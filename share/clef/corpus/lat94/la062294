 CELEBRITY AUCTION: The American Lung Assn. knows the value of notoriety. Its 
Ventura County chapter fetched $1,050 for a football signed by O.J. Simpson at 
its fund-raising auction at the Sherwood Country Club on Monday night. . . . 
The football was caught in a bidding war between movie star Joe Pesci and 
actress Shell Kepler of TV's "General Hospital." "We ended up being the high 
bidder," said Robert DeSantis, Kepler's husband. "We've always been fans and 
hope he is innocent." DeSantis said they immediately received an unsolicited 
offer of $4,000 for the football. 
</P>
<P>
 LOW TURNOUT: Ventura County voters outdid themselves in the June 7 election. 
About two-thirds of registered voters stayed home. . . . Final election figures 
put voter turnout at 33.6%. For those who ask what difference one vote makes -- 
this was an election where it proved decisive. With the final ballots counted 
(B1), John Morrisset beat Scott Weiss by one vote to qualify for the November 
runoff in the auditor-controller race. 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE BALL: With a swift kick, Eric Wynalda hooked the ball over a human 
barrier of Swiss players. It sailed 28 yards, slipping neatly under the 
crossbar and inside the left post. Goal! American soccer fans cheered. Wynalda, 
a former soccer star at Westlake High, scored the goal that tied the U.S. team 
with Switzerland on Saturday. . . . "Eric was Mr. Soccer," recalled Brett 
Potter, a Westlake teammate in the late 1980s. (C10) Wynalda and U.S. teammate 
Cobi Jones, also a Westlake High grad, face the Colombians today in the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S IN A NAME: Ventura city leaders are poised to hire a man named Richard 
Thomas as their interim city manager (B1) . . . . This Richard Thomas is the 
former top administrator of Santa Barbara. He's not to be confused with the 
Richard Thomas who is Ventura's chief of police. Although that could become 
inevitable in future meetings when Richard Thomas calls Richard Thomas in for a 
chat.

PROTESTS AND TOASTS GREET ROYAL VISITORS; DIVERSITY: THE JAPANESE IMPERIAL 
COUPLE MEET A RICH VARIETY OF LOCAL LEADERS. ASIAN AMERICAN MARCHERS DEMAND 
REPARATIONS FOR WAR CRIMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko have been working hard in their United 
States visit to pay tribute to the diversity of America. But in Los Angeles, 
the Japanese royal couple have been encountering even more of it than was 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, hundreds of people of Chinese, Korean, Filipino and Vietnamese 
descent demanded an apology for Japanese war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Tokyo, Latino workers at a Japanese-owned hotel appealed for the 
emperor to support their union, holding up a sign in Japanese and trying to 
present a letter to him. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearby, young men from Japan shouted a tribute of banzai -- in American 
gangsta-style baggy pants and baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the protesters -- or well-wishers, for that matter -- got near the 
imperial couple. Their close encounters with the diversity of the city were 
entirely over the clink of fine crystal. There was, for example, a luncheon 
with the mayor atop the Transamerica building Tuesday. The guest list of 100 
was designed to let the emperor see the rich variety of leaders here. 
</P>
<P>
 At one typical table, Latina businesswoman Ana Barbosa, Bruce Ramer of the 
American Jewish Committee and Joe Hicks of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference sat together. "I'm delighted to meet with leaders from a 
cross-section . . . of Los Angeles," said the emperor in a toast. "I (hear) 
with much interest that Los Angeles' community is made of people with various 
and diverse cultural backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The task of the unfailingly statesmanlike emperor has been to mend fences torn 
apart by the clumsy personnel management of Japanese corporations in the United 
States, by boorish Japanese politicians who blame minorities for American 
social problems, and by Japanese intellectuals churning out bestsellers 
spouting anti-Semitic conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
 And to some degree, it's working. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wounds are still deep (from past insults)," Hicks told a reporter. "(But) 
I'm encouraged by these remarks. The more interaction there can be between 
highly placed Japanese officials and African Americans who are clearly in the 
mainstream and influential people, the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese doing business in Los Angeles could tell the emperor a few things 
about the influence of powerful African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an African American -- former mayor Tom Bradley -- who aggressively 
forged ties with Japan that helped build Los Angeles over the last two decades 
into an international trading giant. He focused so much on Asia, in fact, that 
some of his constituents accused him of ignoring his own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was among the guests at a gala black-tie dinner for 650 at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Monday night, as well as at Riordan's lunch. At the 
dinner, the emperor and empress were welcomed in speeches by Gov. Pete Wilson 
and Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors -- and an African American woman -- who gave the most personal 
welcome, noting the long history of Japanese Americans in her district and the 
sister city ties between her district and Ibaraki, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other Angelenos, however, feel far less friendly toward Japan because of 
its lack of apology for its aggression and atrocities in Asia during World War 
II. About 400 Asian Americans marched from Chinatown to City Hall to the 
Japanese Consulate to demand that Japan pay reparations to victims of crimes 
against humanity during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 At the head of the protest march, which snaked for an entire city block, 
white-clad Korean musicians played ceremonial drums. Their protests were 
addressed to the emperor, but they didn't try to approach him, instead focusing 
on the consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to come down and get on your knees and apologize for what you've 
done," yelled 70-year-old Jom Jo Lee, aiming her bullhorn at the Bunker Hill 
skyscraper where the consulate is ensconced. Lee, who said he was forced into 
slave labor in Japan during World War II, waved a placard that said "Japan Is 
the Asian Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the protesters said they had firsthand experience with Japanese 
atrocities. Yuh Fan Sung, 75, carried a handmade ink drawing that showed the 
scene in his hometown of Shen-yang in northeast China on the day that the 
Japanese invaded. Sun was 19 years old and witnessed Chinese civilians lining 
up to be shot by Japanese soldiers. Heads of decapitated Chinese hung from 
walls. Sung's black-and-gray drawing was carefully inked with red to show blood 
dripping from severed heads. "I can't forgive what the Japanese did to my 
city," Sung said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But other protesters, too young to remember the war directly, said the issue 
still burns in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents told me a lot about the war," said Daniel Wang, 30, who skipped 
out from his Downtown job to join the demonstration. "These are things no one 
can forget, even my children and their children." 
</P>
<P>
 Akihito was a child during World War II, but the protesters are asking him to 
take responsibility for making peace among the next generation by apologizing 
and making reparations. It was during the reign of Akihito's father, Hirohito, 
that the atrocities occurred, but ironically, when Hirohito visited in 1975, 
demands for apologies and reparation were not reported by the press. There were 
protests, to be sure. But they were by Japanese Americans upset at Japanese 
investment in Little Tokyo displacing local people, and by Koreans focusing on 
Japanese and U.S. support for the military government in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian American population in 1975 was far smaller and less diverse than 
today -- and less politically sophisticated. Today, a new generation of Asian 
Americans -- who speak English, are media-savvy and well-organized -- are 
overcoming their differences to press demands. Japanese American groups, with a 
long history in the United States, have helped lead the politicization of Asian 
Americans through their fight for U.S. government reparations for the 
internment camps of World War II. David Monkawa, an organizer of that effort, 
said it's only natural that Japanese Americans support Asians seeking redress 
from another government. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Americans are also active in pressing Japanese corporations to act 
responsibly in the United States -- in part because anger against Japanese 
companies often is taken out on Americans of Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Omatsu, a staff member of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center, was 
marching with Latino workers trying to unionize the Japanese-owned New Otani 
hotel. "The owners of the New Otani are certainly not promoting the image of 
Japan, and they're certainly not promoting inter-ethnic harmony," Omatsu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the emperor can intercede on our behalf," said Argelia Ortiz, a cashier 
and union backer. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the activity on the street, the emperor and empress sailed 
serenely through the day, she in a beige kimono, he in a dark gray suit. At the 
Japanese American Culture and Community Center, they met with Japanese 
Americans bringing not labor demands but expressions of friendship and shared 
cultural ties. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps the most relaxing part of the day came at the beginning, when they 
visited an exhibition on Abraham Lincoln and the lush gardens of the Huntington 
Library in San Marino. Even here, the painful roots of America's diversity were 
on display, in historic posters advertising slaves for sale. But the imperial 
couple seemed fascinated by the material, lingering over an original manuscript 
of the Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation.

CALIFORNIA WATCH; THANK YOU, HIGH COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whew! California has dodged a $2-billion bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the state lost this week in a case taken to the U.S. Supreme Court and 
been made to pay monetary compensation to multinational corporations as a 
result, the ruling might have been a knockout blow to its already precarious 
financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday the nation's top court upheld the right of states to collect tax 
revenues from multinational corporations by the "unitary tax" method. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices found that this method of state taxation, including California's 
controversial unitary tax system for foreign corporations doing business here, 
was not unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-2 decision means that California can continue to deviate from standard 
taxation practices by collecting taxes from multinational firms on the basis of 
their worldwide revenues -- the unitary method. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that unitary taxes are ill-conceived. They discourage foreign 
business investment and interfere with the federal government's all-important 
ability to negotiate international tax agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, California itself seems to have recognized that fact. Last year it 
moved to allow foreign companies the option of filing either under the unitary 
rules or the "water's edge" method, which taxes a company subsidiary as if it 
were a separate state-based firm. That's good. 
</P>
<P>
 What the case really proves is the need for Congress to deal with this issue 
by legislating a uniform tax policy for all states in which foreign companies 
do business. That really isn't too much to ask.

CLINTON IS RIGHT ON THE HEALTH ISSUE; EVENTUAL UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IS WORTH 
FIGHTING FOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, astute politician that he is, has been signaling for 
months, and more recently said outright, that he is willing to compromise to a 
certain degree in order to persuade Congress to pass health care reform. Any 
significant change that would directly affect the insurance, medical, hospital 
and legal industries -- that is, some of the most powerful in the nation -- is 
a tough sell on campaign-contribution-dependent Capitol Hill. Thus Clinton has 
gone from saying he would veto any legislation that did not guarantee insurance 
coverage for all Americans to saying that Congress must simply give its 
"commitment to cover everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a good sign of reasonable flexibility, but there are limits. The 
President cannot be so malleable on this difficult issue as to make health care 
reform meaningless. Nothing could be worse than for Washington to hand 
Americans health care reform in name only. Toothless legislation consisting 
only of goals and hopes and dreams would do nothing to help the 37 million 
without health care coverage but would do a lot to fuel cynicism about the 
government's ability to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton should stick to his guns in insisting on real incentives for 
reform. His health care proposal, which even he concedes will not survive as 
originally proposed, was based on the key premise that all Americans are 
entitled to affordable health care. It's how to get there that few Democrats or 
Republicans can agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a two-pronged concept that has gained currency recently: that a 
reform bill containing non-controversial elements such as paring down paperwork 
and fraud would be passed and industry would be given a reasonable period to 
make health care accessible and affordable; if, after a designated period, 
certain gains had not been made, then the government would step in with 
mandates of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
 This so-called "hard-trigger" approach is preferable to outright government 
mandates as first called for by Clinton. The President is said to now be 
willing to support the hard-trigger approach because it still would push the 
nation toward health care coverage for all, and because it is probably the most 
he can politically hope for by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of how all this would work are the subject of furious work and 
horse-trading on Capitol Hill. But already the health care industry has proven 
that there's nothing like the threat of government intervention to inspire 
private industry reform. The President shouldn't turn down the heat now. He is 
right about the issue.

NOT THIS TIME, SHE SAID; BATTERED WOMAN FINDS RELIEF, THANKS TO GOOD LAPD WORK, 
CONCERNED JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Domestic violence is a staggering problem in Los Angeles, accounting for 40% 
of all calls for police service. Last year 42,700 of those calls resulted 
either in investigations or arrests. This is commendable and noteworthy: Too 
often, one hears about battered spouses who stay with their tormentors out of 
fear or misplaced optimism, about authorities who take such cases lightly and 
about a lenient and ineffectual judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time . So said a North Hollywood welfare mother, Claudia Clark, who 
claimed that she had endured several beatings by the father of her child. The 
last attack, in December, started when a kitchen knife was plunged into a 
pillow inches from her face. He choked and pummeled her for 45 minutes and then 
led police officers on a half-mile foot chase. Later, as always, he asked her 
for forgiveness. Not this time . "This time," she said, " he was going down. 
Not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's is a story of courage and persistence, of breaking the cycle of 
violence. Much of her monthly $490 welfare checks went to baby-sitters and for 
bus fare to and from court, where often she would hear that her case had been 
delayed again. Her phone was cut off because there wasn't enough left to pay 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was undaunted, and ultimately her testimony was compelling. Last month 
it took a Municipal Court jury just two hours to convict Jose Maria Martinez on 
four misdemeanor counts of spousal abuse, false imprisonment, making threats to 
kill and resisting arrest. Martinez had been convicted of beating Clark in 1991 
and had gotten off with 30 days in jail, some obviously ineffective counseling 
and probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Judge Lloyd Nash wasn't going to let that happen again. He 
vindicated Clark's efforts by leveling what is believed to be the stiffest 
penalty yet in a Los Angeles misdemeanor domestic violence case: four years and 
11 months of imprisonment. "Some cases cry out for the maximum sentence," Judge 
Nash later told a reporter in chambers, "and this case is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Clark, she has some advice for others in her situation: "You can't let 
them keep beating on you and beating on you. Because, one day, they're going to 
end up killing you."

ATM FEE DISCLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "ATM Tuneup" (editorial, June 4), you state that the banks are reluctant to 
disclose ATM fees on the screen at the time of the transaction because bankers 
say it would "be inconvenient, though not technologically impossible" to do so. 
At virtually every ATM machine in Las Vegas, a message flashes informing the 
consumer of the transaction fees and asking him/her if he/she wishes to 
proceed.The ATMs are generally of the same manufacture as those found in 
California, and work on the same systems found in this state, such as STAR and 
EXPLORE. Once again, when dealing with those masters of integrity in 
three-piece suits, it's not a question of "can't," it's a question of "won't."

TASLIMA NASRIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 * The plight of writer Taslima Nasrin (June 11) should raise the conscience of 
all who support the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest warrant and other reported demands to kill her are appalling in 
this day and age.Similar threats and a "death warrant" were issued against 
author Salman Rushdie. These are symptoms of the rise of religious right groups 
and obscure fundamentalism all over South Asia from Afghanistan to Bangladesh. 
India, which proclaims itself to be a "secular" state, has not been able to 
combat the rise of Hindu fundamentalism and its aspiration to bring fascism in 
the name of nationalism.

 * How about one of your writers doing a story on the effects of 
"Christianization" of America through stealth candidates, etc.? Your article, 
"Bangladesh Writer Hides to Avoid Arrest Over Her Quoted Remarks on Koran," 
ought to be an eye-opener for those who lust mightily to turn the U.S. into one 
giant Christian-dominated penal colony. I'm an old-time Orange County 
Republican conservative and this push to Christianize America through politics 
scares me! 
</P>
<P>
 I'd be interested in reading what your writers could come up with regarding 
the potential for our U.S. brand of Christian fundamentalism someday mimicking 
Islam's outrages. As a Christian, I'm fully aware that a lot of my fellows 
would be more than happy to sell their freedoms down the river if they thought, 
by doing so, they could control or eliminate liberals.

DEFEAT OF QUAKE BOND MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I must take issue with your editorial of June 10 ("The Bond Vote Quake: What 
to Do Now"). You state that taxes must be raised for earthquake repairs, etc., 
because "there simply is no possible alternative to paying for the work that 
must be done." I beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask you, what do major companies (including your newspaper) do when they 
have business downturns? One of their first actions is manpower reduction 
programs, usually in the 10%-20% range (sometimes higher). 
</P>
<P>
 A manpower reduction program in this range would result in many millions of 
dollars in savings. Then, when the economy improves, manpower can be increased 
as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 DON EDLING 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * What The Times is proposing is very similar to the recent judicial decision 
in Pennsylvania, which stated that unless a woman fights back with force when a 
man is raping her, then it isn't really rape, no matter how many times she says 
"no." 
</P>
<P>
 The citizens of California said a resounding "no!" to the bond issues on 
Election Day because we're all just a little tired of politicians and 
bureaucrats crying poverty when it comes to services for us taxpayers, such as 
adequate police and firefighting protection, but then squealing in righteously 
indignant rage when it's even suggested that they, the politicians and 
bureaucrats, cut back on their pay raises, benefits and perks. 
</P>
<P>
 So, even though we California citizens said "no!", The Times, and probably 
more than a few politicians, have decided that what we really meant was "yes," 
so there will be an attempt to legislate into law a "temporary" tax for 
earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody out there really believe that the tax will be temporary? Or that 
every cent collected will actually end up being spent for earthquake relief? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get a citizen state budget committee made up of randomly selected 
California residents, to whom the politicians and legislators must present each 
yearly budget. It's time for these guys to answer for all the wasteful 
spending, and try to explain to overburdened taxpayers why legislators are 
still living the good life at our expense, while demanding more and more taxes 
to pay for it.

 * Responding to Sherry Jeffe's article (Opinion, June 12) on the recently 
defeated proposed bond measures, I feel she has missed one important fact. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the voters described by Jeffe ("classic, high-propensity voter"), 
further described as "older, white and more affluent," I want to point out an 
important motivation element of this group. 
</P>
<P>
 This "high-propensity" group was telling their representatives in Sacramento 
that our state is in enough financial trouble and we should not compound the 
problem by adding any more debt at this time. These voters were telling their 
esteemed representatives to clean up the current financial mess, reduce 
wasteful spending and then come back to the voters for bond approvals to pay 
for these admittedly necessary public needs.

 * Hurrah for Tom Campbell ("Reality Bites California's Budget Deficit," 
Commentary, June 9). I thought that there wasn't anyone left in Sacramento with 
any sense at all. A reasonable budget and financial plan with clearly stated 
contingencies should (with a bit of publicity) play well with both the voters 
and the bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state really needs new funds to pay for earthquake repairs and road 
improvements, let's do it "the California way" with tax revenues that are 
clearly dedicated to the specific tasks. How about Gov. Pete Wilson providing 
some "fireside chats" on where we really stand instead of allowing information 
to flow via the political hot air, which no one believes?

20TH CENTURY ENDS POLICIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "20th Century Insurance to End Quake Policies," June 10: 
</P>
<P>
 The revelation that Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi is allowing 20th 
Century Insurance to phase out its homeowner coverage reinforces the 
realization that his performance as commissioner was just as disastrous as that 
of his predecessor. When will we have an official who will protect the insured 
public? 
</P>
<P>
 I have been insured by this company for years and have never filed a claim, 
nor have many insured, I am sure. Therefore, we are investors in 20th Century 
without ever receiving any benefits except the assurance that we are protected 
against catastrophe. Therefore, we who have never received damages are paying 
for those who have. Paying off the earthquake claims did not bankrupt the 
company, it merely took a huge chunk out of their emergency fund, which is 
being replenished every year or so by their insured clients. Of course, we knew 
that the rates would be increased but the knowledge that Garamendi was going to 
allow them to increase them three times over is mind-blowing.

 * It didn't surprise me that 20th Century Insurance is getting out of 
homeowner and earthquake insurance because of excessive loss due to the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While the January earthquake was the biggest financial disaster to hit the 
United States, I feel it allowed for the largest amount of insurance fraud to 
hit as well. I know that many of those insured have taken advantage of the 
"system." People have been given money to replace carpet, floors, furniture, 
appliances, etc. Some of these items were still usable and were not replaced by 
those insured people, yet they still took the money. They're taking expensive 
vacations, adding to their savings, etc. It's simply disgusting and unfair to 
those who were honest enough to not take the money offered. 
</P>
<P>
 If 20th Century had policies that required receipts from their clients to 
prove they replaced those lost and ruined items, perhaps the loss to 20th 
Century would have been millions of dollars less. The rest of us wouldn't have 
to see our rates go up 17% and face the loss of insurance coverage entirely!

<P>
 * Re "Japanese Royal Couple Begins U.S. Visit," June 11: 
</P>
<P>
 I am glad that the Emperor Akihito has chosen to take part in a wreath-laying 
ceremony to honor Dr. Martin Luther King. The gesture is greatly 
appreciated.However, the emperor's participation rings rather hollow when Japan 
remains a bastion of the very prejudice that Dr. King spent his life fighting 
against. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's institutionalized bias against the burakumin ("untouchables"), 
native-born Japanese of Korean ancestry (not legally recognized as Japanese 
citizens), the aboriginal Ainu people and other ethnic minorities is still 
firmly entrenched. If the emperor truly wishes to honor the memory of Dr. King, 
he could work much harder to help reverse his own country's long and hurtful 
legacy of minority discrimination.

 Can you possibly imagine war heroes Sens. Bob Dole or Bob Kerry or any highly

TO BE FAIR, CAST THE NET BROADLY; HEALTH REFORM: SOMEONE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO 
SUBSIDIZE THE VERY SICK AND THE POOR; A FAIR SYSTEM WOULD FORBID 'OPTING OUT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR R. FUCHS, Victor R. Fuchs, an economics professor at Stanford, is the 
author of The Future of Health Policy (Harvard University Press, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Consider the (hypothetical) case of Jim Brown, a 55-year-old man with 
diabetes, high blood pressure and one previous stroke. If Jim had health 
insurance, he would probably be a heavy user of care -- people like him use, on 
average, about $10,000 worth of care a year. There is, of course a good chance 
that Jim has been turned down by insurers. If so, his average expected use 
would be about $6,000 in care per year because many experts estimate that the 
uninsured receive about 60% of what they would receive if they had insurance. 
This $6,000 is then "cost-shifted" to the insured population through higher 
charges to other patients if Jim's care is privately provided, or through taxes 
if it is publicly provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter health-insurance reform, with the current wide agreement that this 
cost-shifting must end and everyone must be covered. Most of the proposed laws 
would require an insurance company to accept Jim as a customer at the 
community-rated premium of, let us say, $4,000. If all are covered, then 
cost-shifting ends, right? Well, no. 
</P>
<P>
 With his insurance in hand, Jim now receives $10,000 worth of care. If Jim 
pays the entire $4,000 annual premium himself, $6,000 will still be 
"cost-shifted" -- in this case to the insurance company's other customers. If 
Jim's income is low, some or all of the $4,000 premium will be subsidized by 
taxpayers; thus the total amount of "cost-shifting" may actually be greater 
after reform than before. Jim will get more care but the cost of the increased 
care is likely to exceed Jim's contribution to the premium. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a fundamental fact of life that the cost of caring for the poor and the 
very sick must always be shifted -- it is impossible for them to pay their own 
way. None of the reform proposals will end cost-shifting but they do differ in 
how they would accommodate the shift. For instance, in a single-payer plan 
financed by a payroll tax the cost would be borne mostly by workers through 
lower wages. Some of the cost might be borne by consumers through higher 
prices. The Clinton plan is different. Its complexity makes it difficult to 
trace completely the path of cost-shifting, but a few generalizations are 
possible. Some of the burden would fall on healthy workers who do not use much 
medical care, some on cigarette smokers and some on taxpayers in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the single-payer and the Clinton plans spread the cost of caring for the 
poor and the sick broadly. But the shifting gets out of kilter in proposals 
that would allow large segments of the population to obtain insurance outside a 
common insurance pool, as, for example, through company self-insurance. Under 
such plans, companies with young, healthy workers could negotiate with 
providers for low rates and thus escape bearing their share of the cost-shift. 
The more this occurs, the greater the burden on those left in the common pool 
and the greater the incentive to leave the pool. Eventually the system would 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Some plans propose making health insurance "available" to everyone but include 
no provision for payment. Such "reform" would be a cruel hoax for those who 
cannot afford the premiums without substantial subsidies. But a subsidy program 
won't work unless the burden is shared broadly and equitably by the rest of the 
population. There are only two ways to achieve broad sharing: 
</P>
<P>
 * The subsidies could be financed by a general tax, such as on payroll, income 
or value-added. 
</P>
<P>
 * The population must be compelled to participate in a common insurance pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy-makers must acknowledge that if they are serious about achieving 
universal coverage through health-insurance reform, some compulsion will be 
necessary.

THE MORALITY OF SELECTIVE INTERVENTION; FOREIGN POLICY: WE SHOULD ACT ONLY 
WHERE WE CAN ASSIST A POSITIVE OUTCOME -- IN BOSNIA, SAY, BUT NOT IN RWANDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY S. BIENEN, Henry S. Bienen, at Princeton University since 1966 and now 
dean of the university's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International 
Affairs, last week was named president of Northwestern University, taking 
office at the end of this year.

 The life of a Rwandan is as precious as the life of a Bosnian. The maiming of 
Angolans and Sudanese is no more tolerable than the maiming of Muslim Bosnians 
in Gorazde. We should value human lives equally but this does not compel the 
United States to intervene with military force in every place where individuals 
and groups are persecuted -- or nowhere at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument is specious that it is immoral to intervene in Bosnia to stop the 
carnage while we do not send military force to save lives in Rwanda. Military 
intervention by the United States to save lives in places of civil strife will 
always stem from a perception of our strategic interests, the feasibility of 
action, political support for the intervention and, yes, humanitarian concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 We need not be and cannot be consistent in our response to ethnic violence. 
Our economic and military resources are not sufficient for us to be the world's 
policeman. Political capabilities at home do not permit the mobilization of 
support where American citizens and leaders alike do not perceive any strategic 
interests at stake. Political capabilities abroad do not allow us always to 
form alliances for military intervention where other countries do not share our 
concerns and do not see their interests at stake, as they did in the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wrong to argue that if we cannot help all people we should help none, 
because to choose is morally repugnant. Indeed, we sent troops to make possible 
the delivery of relief supplies in Somalia in part because it was logistically 
feasible to do so. The United States was unable and unwilling to mount a 
similar effort in the Sudan or in Angola during their civil wars. Intervention 
in Somalia went sour as the United Nations' mission changed. But selective 
intervention should not be given a bad name. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO and U.N. troops are already in and near Bosnia. We have declared our 
commitment to protect safe zones in Bosnia. NATO, the United States, and the 
United Nations have been deeply implicated in the negotiations in Bosnia for 
more than two years. This is an area where we can perhaps alleviate the 
suffering of victims by using military might. We may choose not to do so 
because of military and political consequences. However, it is reasonable to 
think that limited military intervention could make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Our national interests include our cherishing of peace and the diminution of 
torture and aggression around the world. We cannot always bring these interests 
to fruition, especially where overriding strategic interests are not at stake. 
Indeed, it is arguable whether any deep strategic interest is at stake for the 
United States in Bosnia. A greater Serbia is unlikely to threaten Europe beyond 
the areas where Serbs live. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia probably can 
be contained within the boundaries of that destroyed state. Nor will ethnic 
violence in Bosnia inspire such violence elsewhere; people in the Caucasus do 
not seem to require examples to emulate.  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, our interests, if not our national security, are engaged in 
Bosnia. We can have effect there in concert with NATO allies. Whether we want 
to exert ourselves militarily is a matter to be decided. But to argue, as some 
do, that unless we intervene for peace everywhere we cannot act in Bosnia is 
the height of folly and itself is a morally specious argument.  
</P>
<P>
 We do need to anticipate more Rwandas, if not more Bosnias -- to be prepared 
for the large-scale ethnic strife that is, unfortunately, on the horizon 
elsewhere in Africa. It takes too long to mobilize international efforts, 
whether they be relief or military ones. Rwanda has shown this all too starkly. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the United States and other powers will always look at their 
intervention selectively, we should seriously consider helping to build a 
United Nations anticipatory force ready to intervene when genocide occurs. 
Thousands of lives might be saved by timely intervention.

PERSPECTIVE ON CELEBRITY; THE DAY -- AND NIGHT -- OF THE LOCUST; THE CROWDS 
CHEERING O.J. SIMPSON WERE OUT OF THE HOLLYWOOD CLASSIC ABOUT STARS BEING 
DEVOURED TO FILL EMPTY LIVES.

 Watching the nationally televised spectacle from the Los Angeles freeways and 
Brentwood Friday evening was less exciting for me than it seems to have been 
for many others. It was, in fact, something of a disappointment. It's usually 
that way when one has read the book before seeing the movie.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Nathanael West wrote it nearly 60 years ago, "The Day of the Locust" 
plainly is about the events we witnessed on Friday evening. Indeed, the 
similarities are so great that the telecast should have been called "The Night 
of the Locust." For one thing, both the novel and the "real" drama feature 
important characters named Simpson. But West's Homer Simpson is more like his 
cartoon namesake than like O.J. Simpson. The roles played by the two Simpsons 
are different, too; both are sad figures, but the original Homer Simpson was 
never a celebrity. He was, in fact, an anti-celebrity -- one of the prototypes 
for the people who composed the crowds of cheering onlookers in last Friday's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 It was those crowds of spectators that gave anyone familiar with "The Day of 
the Locust" an eerie feeling of deja vu. It almost seemed that the chilling 
climax of the book was about to be re-enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout West's novel, the protagonist, Tod Hackett, is working on a 
painting he calls "The Burning of Los Angeles." It depicts what happens when 
people who can find no meaning in their lives migrate to California, but "once 
there, they discover that sunshine isn't enough." How could West's 
characterization of the crowds in the painting and their coming to life in a 
wild mob outside a movie premiere not be about the crowds last Friday? "No 
longer bored, they sang and danced joyously in the red light of the flames," 
West wrote. The flames last week were the figurative ones consuming the lives 
of O.J. Simpson, his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Their 
immolation mattered not to the revelers. Something was happening. And it was 
being televised. Being on TV -- the ultimate in artificiality -- validates the 
lives of people trying to live without meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent that modern Americans have difficulty distinguishing between 
fiction and reality. Several of West's characters, like most of the people who 
came out for the production last Friday, suffer from this problem. One, Harry 
Greener, finds himself wondering whether he is acting or is actually ill.  
</P>
<P>
 The reality that West's art reflected in the 1930s has grown far worse in the 
decades since. What he perceived -- the emptiness and meaninglessness and 
alienation of modern life for so many people -- was reflected in the multitude 
of bystanders professing love for O.J. as if they were not strangers to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Belonging to a community of personally known people is an essential part of 
human nature. This innate need is not satisfied for large numbers of people in 
our highly mobile society. The pursuit of dreams is individual, and 
separateness is incompatible with our natures as social beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Disconnected modern people are, like West's Homer Simpson and the people Tod 
Hackett wanted to paint, half dead. Their hunger for a sense of being and 
personal connection remaining unfulfilled, they seek excitement in order to 
feel alive. But, as Paul Revere and the Raiders sang in the 1960s, "kicks just 
keep gettin' harder to find." 
</P>
<P>
 Identification with celebrities can provide some of the desired excitement, 
but is ultimately disappointing. As West put it, "At the sight of their heroes 
and heroines, the crowd would turn demoniac." Modern disconnected people, he 
observed, need ever more to feel alive: "cultists of all sorts, economic as 
well as religious . . . all those poor devils who can only be stirred by the 
promise of miracles and then only to violence." Yet, West perceptively noted, 
"nothing can ever be violent enough to make taut their slack minds and bodies. 
They have been cheated and betrayed. They have slaved and saved for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers across the country who were disturbed by what they saw last 
Friday have tried to reassure themselves by asserting that this was one of 
those "only in California" phenomena. They are wrong, as Nathanael West well 
understood. The crowds that Tod Hackett was portraying in "The Burning of Los 
Angeles" were "the cream of America's madmen," West wrote, and Tod "felt almost 
certain that the milk from which it had been skimmed was just as rich in 
violence. The Angelenos would be first, but their comrades all over the country 
would follow." 
</P>
<P>
 What we saw in "The Night of the Locust" that so unnerved us was "The Burning 
of Los Angeles II: The Burning of America." The video screens on which we saw 
this Tod Hackett canvas were mirrors in which we saw ourselves. It was not a 
comforting reflection.

WOLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; KLINSMANN USES HIS HEAD TO TIE SPAIN; GROUP 
D: GERMAN FORWARD SCORES ONE GOAL IN SECOND HALF AND JUST MISSES ON THE WINNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago nearly to the day, Spain embarrassed Germany with a defeat that 
sent German soccer into turmoil. This time, Germany had Juergen Klinsmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinsmann scored with a fine header in the 48th minute to salvage a 1-1 tie 
Tuesday for the defending World Cup champions against a determined Spanish 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spain played an excellent game," Klinsmann said. "They made it very, very 
hard for us in the first half. They just stayed back and waited for our 
counterattacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Those counterattacks ultimately produced the tying goal, which Klinsmann got 
with a header in the 48th minute. He almost won it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad news was that I didn't score the second goal," he said after his 
right-footed boot just missed the right corner of the net. "There are days when 
you just try everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain beat Germany, 1-0, on June 20, 1984, at the European Championships in 
France, preventing the Germans from advancing to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jupp Derwall was fired on the spot and Franz Beckenbauer was brought in 
to rescue German soccer. His mission was completed with the 1990 World Cup 
title in Italy, and Berti Vogts, his assistant, took over. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts almost certainly has Germany into the second round of this tournament. 
The Germans, who beat Bolivia in the opener, have four points in Group C. 
Spain, which tied South Korea, has two. The Koreans play the Bolivians on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we are just happy that we came back against a strong team," Vogts 
said. "We foolishly wasted some scoring chances, but the result was fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still must improve -- and we will." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain, playing without its captain, sweeper Miguel Nadal -- he was suspended 
for two games after a rough tackle against South Korea -- took the lead on a 
14th-minute goal by Juan Antonio Goikoetxea. He floated the ball into the net 
from the wide side on the right wing with what he planned to be a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intended a cross, but it worked the way it did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans were stunned by the goal and suddenly looked very ordinary. Spain 
pressed, but never beat goalkeeper Bodo Illgner again. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was Klinsmann who tied it and nearly won it in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 48th minute, Klinsmann leaped above two defenders to meet Haessler's 
free kick and head the ball powerfully downward. The ball bounced up over 
goalie Andoni Zubizarreta's head and was already over the goal line when Stefan 
Effenberg leaped forward to make sure with a diving header. 
</P>
<P>
 That set the German fans in the crowd of 63,113 at Soldier Field to chanting 
and singing. They almost had even more to celebrate with three minutes to go, 
when Klinsmann stroked a shot just wide of the goalpost. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really upsets me, in spite of our overall success, is that I was unable 
to score the second goal," he said of his right-footed boot that barely missed. 
"I should have been able to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish seemed satisfied with the tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Spanish performance you saw today is the real Spain," Goikoetxea 
said. "The thing that helped today, at least in my case, was the temperature, 
which was not as high as the day we played Korea. That day the tie was made 
possible by heat." 
</P>
<P>
 This day, the tie was made possible by Juergen Klinsmann.

 The big guy in the middle from Nigeria can play. He showed that to America and 
the rest of the world Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't Hakeem Olajuwon this time. No, this dream was turned in by Rashidi 
Yekini, who scored the opening goal and assisted on another as the Super Eagles 
won their World Cup debut 3-0 over Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest World Cup victory by an African nation and marked the 
second consecutive impressive start for a new finalist from Africa. Cameroon 
was the sensation of the 1990 World Cup, reaching the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Olajuwon, a former Nigerian junior goalie who has the Houston Rockets in 
Wednesday night's decisive seventh game of the NBA Finals, Yekini had a strong 
supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Amokachi scored on a brilliant bump-and-run late in the first half, and 
Emmanuel Amunike added a third goal on a diving header in the 55th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rufat also made several sensational saves in Nigeria's goal, soaring to 
grab high balls and staying firm on shots in close. And Nigeria's defense, with 
four men back, never allowed Bulgaria to get into a rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Yekini who was the star. Africa's soccer player of the year and the 
scorer of almost half of Nigeria's goals as it qualified for the World Cup 
finals for the first time, he was in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 striker easily won the battle of headliners with Hristo 
Stoichkov, the fleet forward for Bulgaria, which still is looking for its first 
World Cup victory. It has 11 losses and six ties in 17 final-round appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Yekini went to the middle, lean into defenders and wait for the chance. He 
went to the wing to flick passes to cutting teammates and disrupt the offensive 
flow with quick sprints into passing lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria controlled the midfield and the corners. It dictated the tempo, which 
was too fast for Bulgaria. And it came away with an impressive victory, the 
only one by the three first-time World Cup teams thus far. Saudi Arabia and 
Greece, also in their cup debuts, lost their openers.

RELATIONSHIPS: MANY SEE INFIDELITY AS ULTIMATE BETRAYAL OF TRUST, BUT SOME 
OVERCOME IT 
</P>

 When Fiona had an affair after 10 years of marriage, she never imagined the 
ramifications of her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all seemed harmless at first," says the 40-year-old Corona del Mar writer, 
who asked that her name be changed, as did others in the story. "My husband and 
I had been arguing a lot and weren't as intimate as I wanted to be. The new 
person was really interested in me and didn't hassle me like my husband." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fiona's husband confronted her one night, she told him the truth. The 
couple agreed to work out their problems, but he couldn't contain his anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we needed to go our separate ways, what I regret most is my 
betrayal of his trust. I had been so angry at him for not being what I wanted 
him to be that I didn't even consider what he would go through. He didn't 
deserve to be treated that way," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many married people and singles in committed relationships see infidelity as 
the ultimate betrayal, says marriage, family, child counselor Janet Whitney, 
who is with Coastline Counseling in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 She has seen the aftershocks of a partner having sex outside of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone has an affair, it takes the specialness away from the marriage 
relationship and cheapens everything," she says. "For people who desire an 
honest relationship, it is difficult for them to get over the betrayal, and the 
relationship eventually fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Others stay together, but the betrayed person will close off part of himself 
or herself and continue to function in the relationship on a more limited 
basis. Only those individuals who acknowledge they have a problem and get help 
can overcome what happened, yet a scar always remains," Whitney says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many feel the biggest casualty of infidelity is trust. "The person who was 
cheated on constantly questions the other person's honesty. Questions such as 
'Did she ever love me?' and 'Is he really going where he says he's going?' are 
very common, natural reactions," Whitney says. "Individuals who had the affairs 
also start not trusting themselves. Many people will wonder how they could have 
hurt someone they loved." 
</P>
<P>
 National surveys indicate that between 30% and 60% of married men and women 
have had an affair. "Infidelity has balanced out between men and women," 
Whitney says. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is common for anyone in a marriage or committed relationship to have 
fleeting thoughts about committing adultery, many people don't act on their 
fantasies, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals who start affairs do so for a number of reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * They come from a family where infidelity is common and accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 * They suffer from a lack of chemistry or compatibility with their partners. 
</P>
<P>
 * They have trouble with commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason, the upheaval a discovered affair causes often leads to 
the demise of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Estella. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 40-year-old graphic designer, who lives in Tustin, met her 
husband-to-be, he seemed like a warm father and potentially loving husband. 
</P>
<P>
 After three months together, Estella was madly in love and quickly agreed to 
marriage. One month into the marriage, though, she began finding notes on top 
of his dresser about meeting women for drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found the notes, I confronted him, and he admitted to cheating on me, 
saying that he was bored and didn't feel like we were getting along," she says. 
"I had thought of him like Humphrey Bogart. He had some rough edges, but there 
was a lot of attraction there, so we tried to work things out. But after eight 
months we separated because he continued to cheat on me." 
</P>
<P>
 For Estella the experience took time to get over. "The first thing I did was 
ask myself what I'd done wrong," she says. "Then after awhile, I realized he 
was a jerk. But then I began to ask myself why I picked someone like that. I 
ended up going through therapy over the fact that I couldn't trust my 
instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it happened 11 years ago, Estella feels she is still affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll always be more cautious and less trusting," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 With infidelity, women tend to blame themselves more often than men, says 
Whitney.  
</P>
<P>
 When Raymond's live-in girlfriend and mother of his young son announced it was 
over because she was having an affair with his best friend, the 34-year-old 
Santa Ana teacher never considered it could be his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things weren't running completely smoothly, but nothing I'd done warranted 
that kind of drastic action," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Raymond's girlfriend have an affair, but she thought he would 
stay home and watch their son while she went out. "I have no idea why she 
thought I would stay there while she cheated on me, but after she left, I 
packed up our stuff and left with my son." 
</P>
<P>
 When his girlfriend returned, she called the police and Raymond returned with 
their son. They made arrangements for joint custody. When her new relationship 
didn't work out, she asked Raymond to come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no intentions of working things out," he says. "As far as I was 
concerned, she ended it when she starting sleeping with my friend. I could 
never trust her again. Infidelity is completely unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney says, "It used to be 20 years ago that men played around and women 
didn't say that much, but people aren't ignoring it anymore. There has been a 
shift in attitudes toward a focus on home and honesty in relationships, and 
less people are tolerant of adultery nowadays."  
</P>
<P>
 For some, however, affairs don't carry much significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred, a 45-year-old Costa Mesa graphic designer, has been married twice and 
had affairs during both marriages. He says he feels no guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 His first affair occurred when he was 20. He had been married for a year and 
wasn't spending much time with his wife because they were both busy developing 
their careers. His wife eventually found out about his affair, but Fred says 
she didn't seem to care because, he thinks, she was having one of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years, the marriage ended when she moved out of state. According 
to Fred, they are still friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred married a second time, at 27. They were married 10 years, and he says 
that he cheated on her many times because she had less of a sex drive than he 
did. He says he doesn't think she cared about his flings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the women I was sleeping with would visit my wife and tell her I 
was going to leave her, but that was a lie, because I loved my wife," he says. 
"When I got home later, all she'd say was that someone had visited. I don't 
think she condoned my affairs, but they didn't really bother her because she'd 
been raised with a father who did similar things to her mother and she grew up 
to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage ended when Fred began commuting from Huntington Beach to San Jose 
and his ex-wife met someone else and asked for a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Fred lived with another woman whom he also worked with and says he 
never found it necessary to cheat on her. "We were very compatible. She also 
had a 12-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son at the time, whom I became very 
close to. The family atmosphere really influenced me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred is now living with a woman and having an affair with someone else, whom 
he considers his soul mate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I've finally found the right person," he says. "When we're both 
able to get out of our present relationships and get together, I don't think 
I'll find it necessary to have affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that when infidelity occurs, partners sense something on some 
level and often choose to ignore the signals. Sometimes, however, there are no 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura's story reads like a psychological thriller. The 37-year-old Fullerton 
woman who works in the retail industry was working in the restaurant industry 
when she met a handsome, charming man who seemed like perfect husband material. 
</P>
<P>
 "At work he was really popular and a hard worker," she says. "He was also 
Jewish, like me, which was even more special, since my previous boyfriend 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Her new boyfriend met her family and immediately got along well with her 
parents and brother. After six months of dating, they were engaged and were 
married six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to love my family; we never fought, and my co-workers were all 
jealous. He'd do things like come to pick up my car during the day and get it 
washed," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years after the wedding, Laura's husband told her he couldn't be 
married anymore and left. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura was devastated by his departure, but this feeling was soon replaced with 
shock as she made calls to his co-workers and found that he'd been having an 
affair with a waitress with whom he shared a cocaine habit. He'd also been 
stealing money from work to buy drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known how many problems he had, I would never have married him. But 
he was never himself with me," she says. "He pulled out before he revealed his 
real personality and went to live with his girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she was glad to get out of the marriage, Laura says she is bitter 
over the experience, especially because she lost time. By now she had planned 
to be happily married and to have young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura says she is cynical when friends talk about making wedding plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a lot of trust in marriage, which is sad," she says. "Before my 
ex-husband, I had only the highest regard for marriage. I thought that if you 
did everything right, things would work out all right, but I was wrong."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPAIN ISN'T HALF-BAD TO TIE GERMANY; GROUP 
C: SPANIARDS COME OUT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT BOTH TEAMS SLOW DOWN AFTER KLINSMANN 
TIES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Well, so much for Berti Vogts' theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his German team played Spain at Soldier Field on Tuesday afternoon, 
Vogts had predicted the Spaniards would take a less-than-adventurous approach 
to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spain has more at stake and I expect them to be cautious, to play 
defensively, to wait for our mistakes, and then hope to get three points (by 
defeating) Bolivia," Vogts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish Coach Javier Clemente must have heard about the remark because the 
Spaniards came out playing anything but cautiously. Had they had the courage to 
continue in that fashion, they might even have beaten the defending world 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, Germany and Spain settled for a 1-1 tie in a game that started 
out well but fizzled in the second half. By the time the final whistle sounded, 
many in the crowd of 63,113 were whistling and booing both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the World Cup games in this tournament, the second 45 minutes of this 
one was the most negative and unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
 It need not have been that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain came in having been tied, 2-2, by South Korea in its first Group C 
opener, while the Germans were coming off a 1-0 victory over Bolivia. The 
teams' World Cup history pointed to a German victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries had met twice before in the competition, with the Germans 
emerging victorious on each occasion: 2-1 in England in 1966 and 2-1 in the 
quarterfinals of the 1982 tournament in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time Spain had a chance, especially after an extraordinary goal by 
Juan Antonio Goikoetxea in the 14th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the ball down into the right corner, Goikoetxea crossed it into the 
center from an acute angle. The ball curved over the outstretched fingertips of 
German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner, struck the inside of the far post and rebounded 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Goikoetxea could not believe his luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention was to center the ball, not to score," he said, "but the ball 
entered the goal. It was definitely a big day for me. It will be a great 
memory." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-0 score held up for the rest of the half as Spain continued to attack 
with rare zeal and the Germans found themselves having to pay more attention to 
their defense than their offense. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed three minutes into the second half when Juergen Klinsmann scored 
a somewhat strange goal of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 A free kick by Thomas Haessler on the right curled into the goal area and 
Klinsmann leaped above a crowd of players to send a sharp, downward header 
toward the net in front of goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball took a high bounce over the keeper's head and wound up in the back of 
the net to the astonishment of many, not the least of whom was Zubizarreta. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could, I would have stopped it," he said. "It was a lucky goal in some 
ways. I'd like to see it on television. I felt a player was offside. The 
surface was so hard, it took a high bounce and, surprisingly, went in at the 
other post." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reason for the goal, it was enough to get Germany even and from 
then on it soon became obvious that both teams were settling for a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we played a strong game," he said. "We tried our best against 
Germany, the world champion. We should be satisfied. It was a balanced game. We 
wanted to win. Unfortunately, Germany tied the game. We did not take advantage 
of the first goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain was without its team captain and key defensive player, Miguel Angel 
Nadal, who was banned for two games by FIFA for committing what is called a 
"professional foul" -- that is, an intentional foul to prevent an opposing 
player from scoring -- in the first half of Spain's game against South Korea in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 The severity of the penalty had Clemente fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "When referees become the principal argument in the game, then it's goodby to 
soccer," he said. "A lot of the referees don't have enough knowledge about the 
new regulations (banning tackling from behind, for example). Not all the 
referees apply the rules the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nadal has to depend on Spain getting through to the next round if he hopes to 
play another World Cup game this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday's game, Clemente had sounded optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "One win from two games, that's all we need," he said. "Our luck will have to 
change, but we have no worries at all about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 That win will now have to come against Bolivia on Monday if Spain hopes to 
advance. Clemente has an odd way of looking at results. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Korean tie could be regarded as a loss," he said. "We did not play as 
well (as on Tuesday). We did not feel very confident. A tie against the Germans 
could be regarded as a victory since they are very strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to win against Bolivia now."

PADRES' RALLY BEATS DODGERS IN THE 13TH, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You would have thought that an inside-the-park home run by Mitch Webster and 
five strong innings of relief would be an omen that the Dodgers were on their 
way to their second consecutive comeback victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't turn out that way. After Webster scored the go-ahead run in the 
13th inning, the Padres came back in the bottom of the inning and scored two 
runs off Rudy Seanez to win, 4-3, Tuesday night at Jack Murphy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres scored their winning run on a pinch-hit single to right by Brian 
Johnson, after tying the game on a single by Tony Gwynn that scored Craig 
Shipley, who had tripled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the advantage but the game isn't over until you get the last three 
outs," Tim Wallach said. "There was some very good pitching, as there was last 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 In the top of the 13th, Webster accomplished what no Dodger has done since 
Kirk Gibson on June 5, 1989 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Batting against Donnie Elliott, Webster hit a drive that sailed into 
right-center field, and Derek Bell chased it down, and turned to make the 
throw.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea where the ball was," Webster said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bell's throw sailed over cut-off man Bip Roberts, who was screened on the play 
by Luis Lopez. By then, Webster was rounding third and the ball was just 
sitting in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe (third base coach) Joey (Amalfitano) was waving me in," 
Webster said. "I just kept going." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Padre dugout, Manager Jim Riggleman shook his head. In the Dodger 
dugout, the players had a question: "They asked me if I needed oxygen," Webster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra innings gave the Dodgers a good chance to look at their bullpen, and 
they should have liked what they saw. After Tom Candiotti held the Padres to 
two runs, one earned, in seven innings, the Dodgers sent up five relievers over 
the next five innings, and all did their job. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomer Brian Barnes struck out both left-handers he faced in the eighth 
inning and stranded a runner at first. Ismael Valdes took over and pitched two 
perfect innings, striking out the side in the 10th inning, including Roberts, 
whose 23-consecutive game streak ended. Todd Worrell and Roger McDowell also 
stranded runners on second. Then came Seanez (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 After Shipley scored to tie the game at 3, Phil Plantier was intentionally 
walked after Gwynn stole second. Bell reached safely on a grounder to first 
that took a high hop, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Seanez got Billy Bean to fly out before Johnson stepped up. 
</P>
<P>
 "That high hop of Bell's killed us," Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had a chance in the 11th inning, when Delino DeShields singled and 
stole second, but was stranded when Trevor Hoffman came back to strike out Mike 
Piazza and Wallach grounded out. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields, who scored the Dodgers' first run in the fourth inning, went three 
for six with a double and two stolen bases.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers also had a chance in the 10th inning, but stranded Raul Mondesi at 
second base. Mondesi's single to center was fielded on a hop by Bell, who 
looked a little stunned when he reached in his glove to throw the ball and 
discovered it wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Mondesi was midway to second and beat the eventual throw with a 
head-first dive into the bag. But Hoffman, who replaced Padre starter Andy 
Ashby, struck out Jose Offerman and Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby held the Dodgers to four hits and two runs, one earned, through nine 
innings. With the Dodgers trailing, 2-0, in the fourth inning, DeShields scored 
on a triple by Henry Rodriguez, and Offerman tied the score in the eighth 
inning, coming home on a single by Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti, sore big right toe and all, held the Padres to five hits and two 
runs, one earned, through seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 DeShields led off the fourth with a bunt down the first base line, stole 
second, went to third on a groundout and scored on a triple to right by 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby, who had won his last three decisions, retired the next 10 before 
Offerman reached second on two errors by first baseman Tim Hyers, who fumbled 
Offerman's grounder, then threw it away. Offerman went to third on Dave 
Hansen's groundout and scored when Butler grounded a single into right field, 
extending his hitting streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres went ahead, 1-0, in the first on a sacrifice fly by Gwynn.

 Their historic first-round match finally complete, Steffi Graf and Lori McNeil 
collected their belongings in Tuesday's cloud-shrouded darkness and made their 
way off Wimbledon's rain-slicked Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil, the unseeded American -- the talent supposedly unfulfilled -- left on 
cloud nine. Graf, the five-time Wimbledon champion who almost always leaves 
grass stains on anyone who ventures into her path, departed with a German glare 
that could have melted tungsten. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the power of McNeil's 7-5, 7-6 (7-5) victory over the previously 
grass-invincible Graf. It marked the first time in Wimbledon's 108-year history 
that a defending women's champion, a top-seeded defender at that, had been 
beaten in opening-round play. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after McNeil's match-winning forehand volley had eluded Graf, the 
players met at the net, exchanged handshakes and words. As best as McNeil could 
remember, Graf congratulated her and then muttered something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'Well done,' and 'Good match,' and 'Good luck,' I think," said 
McNeil, ranked 22nd in the world but considered a grass-court threat because of 
her serve-and-volley game. 
</P>
<P>
 This was only the second time in the last decade that Graf had dropped 
consecutive matches -- one at the recent French Open and then Tuesday against 
McNeil. Graf was a 2-5 favorite to win the women's championship here, McNeil a 
100-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the local bookies knew that Graf's first-round draw was no sure 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because in 1992, at the Virginia Slims Championships, Graf was defeated 
in the first round. The winner? The troublesome McNeil. Until Tuesday's match, 
it was the last time the German superstar had exited so early. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Graf seemed slightly unimpressed by the day's events. Upset? What upset? 
</P>
<P>
 "(It's) not that big an upset because of who I lost to, I would say," she 
said. "I mean, it was a very difficult first round and she has always the 
ability to play the top players, so it's not that big of an upset." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps sensing that they might be witnesses to history, the 13,118 who 
crammed Centre Court stadium at the All England Lawn Tennis Club braved two 
long rain delays and the blustery, cold winds of London's mostly typical summer 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the match took about five hours from starting serve to last tiebreaker 
point. Five hours for Graf to realize that her serves were something of a mess 
-- she served only one ace -- and five hours to score only one point off her 
serve-and-volley attack, which produced only two tries in two sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "She played better than me," Graf said. "That's very obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 Never was it more obvious than at the end of the first set, when Graf 
double-faulted and handed McNeil the 7-5 advantage. Later, in the second set, 
Graf was ahead, 5-4, the serve hers. But rather than take control of the game, 
as she usually does in such situations, Graf faltered once more. 
</P>
<P>
 In need of a point to push the game to deuce, Graf barely missed on an ace, 
had to dink over a second serve and then pushed a backhand into the net. Score: 
5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a tiebreaker was needed and again Graf made uncharacteristic 
mistakes. Ahead, 3-2, she promptly sent a smash into the net. Then she 
double-faulted, allowing McNeil to move ahead, 4-3, then, 5-3, then, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as she faced match point, and with no margin for error, that Graf later 
said she felt she had no chance. She was right, as McNeil delivered the 
forehand volley that ended it all. 
</P>
<P>
 As Graf had continually failed to venture toward the net, McNeil began hitting 
shot after shot at the German's backhand, considered the lesser of the star's 
two evils. By doing so, it helped neutralize Graf's power game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big part of my strategy, to make her pass me off the backhand 
side," McNeil said. "Everyone knows Steffi has a great forehand." 
</P>
<P>
 Strategy is one thing, execution another. Before Tuesday, McNeil had never 
advanced past the Wimbledon quarterfinals and has made it to only one Grand 
Slam semifinal -- at the U.S. Open in 1987. And even with the victory over Graf 
two years ago, McNeil's overall record against the German star was 1-8. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday was different. More precisely, McNeil was different. More mature, 
she said. More aware. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely the best win," McNeil said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeil's best, one of Wimbledon's biggest.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lindsay Davenport's strange and wonderful June continued happily 
along as she defeated France's Julie Halard, 6-1, 6-4, in her first-round 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport turned 18 two weeks ago, reached the third round of the French Open, 
went to her high school prom, attended her Murrieta Valley High graduation 
ceremony, watched as the school's No. 1 court was named in her honor, left for 
London last Saturday, discovered that No. 7-seed Mary Pierce had withdrawn, 
took Pierce's place in the draw, got a new hairdo and then beat Halard. 
</P>
<P>
 The first set was easy enough, Davenport taking only 22 minutes to win. But 
Halard recovered somewhat in the second set, forcing Davenport into an 
assortment of errors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She started to get a few more balls back in the second set and I was a little 
nervous," said Davenport, the first American-born woman to reach the top-10 
rankings since Jennifer Capriati did it in October of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimbledon Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf's loss was everyone else's gain in the women's draw, especially 
Lindsay Davenport's. When Mary Pierce withdrew from the tournament last 
Saturday, Davenport was moved into Pierce's spot, away from fourth-seeded 
Martina Navratilova's side of the draw to Graf's side. But with Graf gone, 
Davenport's chances of reaching the final improved significantly. . . . Graf, 
when asked if Lori McNeil is playing well enough to advance to the final: "I 
don't think so, no."

ANGELS GET RESULTS FROM THE TRADE; BASEBALL: EMBATTLED SNOW HOMERS AND SPRINGER 
GETS VICTORY IN 7-2 ROUT OF MARINERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It still is known around these parts simply as The Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans at Anaheim Stadium have forgiven the Angels for giving away Devon 
White. They finally understood the reason for leaving closer Bryan Harvey 
unprotected. And it took time, but most even exonerated the Angels for not 
re-signing Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 But trading away Jim Abbott to the New York Yankees for the likes of J.T. 
Snow, Russ Springer and Jerry Nielsen? Hey, those weren't letters to exchange 
pleasantries that were sent to the Angels' offices. They were death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels didn't dare gloat after their 7-2 victory Tuesday night over the 
Seattle Mariners, but for at least an evening before 20,662 fans, they felt a 
bit vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow hit his first homer of the season, a two-run shot in the second inning 
that ended his 21 at-bat hitless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer won his first game of the season, yielding seven hits and two earned 
runs, for his first major league victory since July 10, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nielsen? Well, who knows? He's still pitching for double-A Midland in the 
Texas League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt so great," Snow said, "because it had really been getting 
frustrating. I mean, it's not easy to look up and see you're hitting .180. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think it made it even more special because of what Russ did too. It's 
been a couple of years, but it's like you hear about that trade like it just 
happened yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory pushed the Angels (31-41) to within 2 1/2 games of the 
division-leading Texas Ranger, and one-half game of Seattle (30-39). 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to tell everyone that someone in our division would finish over .500," 
Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said, "but I'm not so sure about that anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, recalled June 4 from triple-A Vancouver, entered the night batting .188 
with just one extra-base hit and two runs batted in. Yet, it had been exactly a 
week since he produced a hit, the same kind of slump he endured a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you'd like to come up and put up numbers right away," Snow said, 
"but (Manager) Marcel Lachemann took a lot of the pressure off. He just told me 
to relax, that I don't have to carry the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel that urge to get down on myself. It was so different than last 
year. When I first started struggling last year, I started changing everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody started getting a hold of me. Try this. Try that. Do this. Do that. 
It finally all got to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, when things went bad, I started to have my doubts. This year, I 
just kept believing in myself, and look at what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow's two-run homer proved for awhile to be all of the offensive support 
Springer needed. He yielded only four hits the first six innings, and the only 
damage incurred was Reggie Jefferson's solo homer in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer, pitching with a 5-1 lead courtesy of Tim Salmon's 15th homer and a 
two-run single by Gary DiSarcina, began to falter in the seventh. Jefferson led 
off with a homer, and after Tino Martinez and Luis Sojo singled, Springer was 
removed for left-handed reliever Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson retired pinch-hitter Bill Hasselman on a fly ball to left field. 
Lachemann then summoned right-handed reliever Mike Butcher, but he walked 
pinch-hitter Keith Mitchell, loading the bases with one out. That brought Felix 
Fermin to the plate, and Ken Griffey Jr. to the on-deck circle. But Fermin 
grounded into a double play. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey went two for three with a double, but failed to hit his 31st homer. He 
has gone four consecutive games without a homer, his third-longest drought of 
the season. Yet, perhaps the greatest obstacle to preventing him from 
encroaching Roger Maris' record of 61 homers is the looming players' strike. 
Several players said Tuesday that they have been told to anticipate an Aug. 16 
strike date. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't bother me," Griffey said. "My dad struck in '81 for me. He 
struck for the things I have now. We'll be striking for the guys coming up . . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "The only people who worry about (the home run record) are you guys anyway. I 
just come to do the best job I can, and if a homer happens, it happens."

MORNING BRIEFING: WELL-RESTED OLAJUWON NOT RETIRING TYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon, who is 31 and has been in the NBA 10 years, has no intention 
of retiring if the Houston Rockets win the NBA championship by defeating the 
New York Knicks tonight in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retire to what?" Olajuwon asked Michael Arace of the Hartford Courant. "What 
can you do that is better? You come in after the game, stretch, eat and have a 
good night's sleep. What can you do that is better than this?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the record for the most points in the NBA finals? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alerted: Scott Huffman, who recently set an American pole vault record of 19 
feet 7 inches, on challenging world-record holder Sergei Bubka of Ukraine:  
</P>
<P>
 "All I did now is equivalent to a bee stinging a bear. It's just going to make 
him mad and jump higher." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ejection notice: Larry Young, American League umpire, when Kansas City second 
baseman Jose Lind pulled out a harmonica during a break in play: 
</P>
<P>
 "I better not hear 'Three Blind Mice' coming out of that thing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Turnoff: Blackie Sherrod in the Dallas Morning News: "Oh no. Here come those 
NFL commercials again, the ones with Dennis Hopper babbling in some unknown 
tongue, thereby creating indecision whether Hopper is promoting football or 
some funny cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His number isn't up: Chicago White Sox third baseman Robin Ventura, who wears 
No. 23, the same as Michael Jordan did with the Chicago Bulls and Ryne Sandberg 
did with the Cubs: 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not going to retire tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence booster: If Baltimore Oriole Manager John Oates is worried about 
his job, he has a right to be, considering these comments from owner Peter 
Angelos in the Washington Post. Said Angelos of Oates:  
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's a problem. He's obstinate. An insecure man. Not a very good 
manager. I don't think he's a good leader." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who needs it? Marvin Freeman, a pitcher for the Colorado Rockies, has a 6-1 
record but he wants no part of the All-Star game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm old (31), broken down and I'm tired," Freeman said. "I need the three 
days off. I've got incentives for games pitched. I don't . . . for the All-Star 
game." 
</P>
<P>

 News flash: Art Spander in the San Francisco Examiner: "Item: The new 
president of the American League says he's opposed to brawling. Wow! And all 
the time we thought he was supportive of it." 
</P>

 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good riddance: While complimenting NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, Kevin Paul 
Dupont of the Boston Globe took a shot at the previous regime: 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't long ago that determination in the NHL front office meant only that 
both the tie and handkerchief went well with the suit coat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The John Ziegler regime was well dressed and out to lunch -- morning, noon 
and night."

have won 11 of the 14 seventh games in the NBA finals. . . .

them the slight edge over the team with the best coach, Pat Riley. . . .

 Clemens Westerhof is from the Netherlands, but he sounded more like a coach 
from Los Angeles on Tuesday night after Nigeria made its impressive World Cup 
debut with a 3-0 victory over Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Showtime," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 That it was, as the Super Eagles brought an exciting, lightning-quick attack 
to the Cotton Bowl before 44,132, almost 20,000 below capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the talking drums of the musical nation could be heard from Dallas to 
Lagos, where it will be difficult to find anyone working today after a 
nightlong celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 They came out of Africa as the continent's champions, yet some were not sure 
Nigeria could withstand the pressures of the World Cup. But it was Bulgaria, a 
participant in six Cup finals, that still is without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians were left bickering and complaining, but really, they had no 
defense for Nigeria's frontal assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to show people we play football in Africa," Westerhof said. "It has 
been five years of hard work. It's over that (they) can look at us, and think, 
'It's an African team, so no problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria gained respect with its victory, and perhaps sent a message to the 
teams that play a traditional style of soccer. The Super Eagles simply let it 
fly, and there was more than one Bulgarian defender left in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love to attack, we love to go," said Emmanuel Amunike, who scored the 
team's third goal, on a diving header in the 55th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they attack in threes, sometimes in twos, but almost always with 
6-foot-3 Rashidi Yekini, who is poised to become a soccer superstar if he 
maintains the level he played Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yekini, Africa's player of the year, scored almost half of Nigeria's goals in 
qualifying, so it was appropriate that he scored the team's first goal, in the 
21st minute after a nice cross from the accelerating George Finidi. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was a good start, Westerhof expects more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not yet seen the real Rashidi Yekini," Westerhof said. "It's coming." 
</P>
<P>
 And no one has seen the real Super Eagles -- another scary thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin Okocha, the team's star midfielder, did not play against Bulgaria after 
suffering a slight leg injury during the weekend. Captain Stephen Keshi, the 
starting goalkeeper, also was held out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to take any risks," Westerhof said. "Okocha will come later -- 
against Maradona." 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's next match in Group D will be against favored Argentina and its 
aging superstar, Diego Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria did not need the regular starters against Bulgaria, which entered the 
tournament as an offensive-oriented team. The Bulgarians had two early scoring 
opportunities and when they failed the team went into a trance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if we would have scored first, it would have been different," said 
Dimitar Penev, Bulgaria's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ruffai made several nice saves, and the defense pressured Bulgarian 
strikers Hristo Stoichkov and Emil Kostadinov to the point of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria almost scored in the 37th minute. Austin Eguavoen fouled Stoichkov, 
considered one of Europe's most dangerous forwards, in midfield. Because of 
miscommunication, Stoichkov thought he had a direct kick, and knocked the ball 
in with his potent left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the goal did not count because he actually was awarded an indirect kick, 
and one other person needed to touch the ball. Stoichkov, predictably, blamed 
the referee, Rodrigo Badilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed international inexperience," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yekini thought the Bulgarians were worn down by the heat, which was not as 
intense as it was during Friday's South Korea-Spain match. Perhaps it had more 
to do with Yekini and his teammates' fast-paced game than anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Yekini could tell the Bulgarians were dragging. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were goose-eyed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And even Stoichkov said his team was finished after Nigeria's second goal, a 
brilliant score by Daniel Amokachi in the 43rd minute. Amokachi took a lead 
pass from Yekini, then kicked the ball sideways and beat his defender. When he 
turned, goalkeeper Borislav Mikhailov was out of position on the far right, and 
Amokachi kicked it in from a few yards out.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; MARADONA ANSWERS CRITICS WITH A GOAL; 
GROUP D: CONTROVERSIAL SUPERSTAR HAS OLD TOUCH, BATISTUTA HAS A HAT TRICK TO 
PROPEL ARGENTINA TO 4-0 VICTORY OVER NEWCOMER GREECE.

 They're back. Argentina and Diego Maradona, a.k.a. Captain Lazarus, came 
storming back to the World Cup on Tuesday in better form and spirits than when 
they left it four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I answered my critics on the field," said the incomparable, incorrigible 
Maradona, diamond earring sparkling, drug and physical travails apparently just 
bad memories in a sweet moment of victory. "It was a very emotional goal for 
me. I had been waiting a long while for it." 
</P>
<P>
 With game but outclassed Greece as their foil, the 1990 Cup runners-up scored 
early and often, cruising to a 4-0 victory in one opening-round game at which 
-- at last -- nobody talked about the weather. What heat? Under glowering, 
leaky skies, it was a why-didn't-I-bring-a-jacket afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 For a partisan but good-natured 53,486 in Boston's suburban Foxboro Stadium 
halfway to Rhode Island, it came down to a struggle of the blue and white 
stripes. The difference was the blue; the Greek sea-dark, the Argentine 
sky-light -- and all bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a marvelous game," Argentine Coach Alfio Basile said. 
</P>
<P>
 The usually affable Greek coach, Alkis Panagoulias said, not bothering to 
disguise his distress -- or his anger, "I am very disappointed. I never 
expected my players to be afraid of the Argentines." 
</P>
<P>
 It started badly quickly for the Greeks in their World Cup debut. And it got 
steadily worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second minute, the crowd still squirming on wet seats, a lightning 
Argentine counterattack produced a goal. Midfielder Diego Simeone shot a 
sideline pass to long-haired forward Gabriel Batistuta, known around the soccer 
world as "Archangel Gabriel" and "Batigol." 
</P>
<P>
 "I beat two defenders and then there was only the goalie," said Batistuta, who 
plays professionally for Fiorentina in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The early goal, which seemed to sap the Greeks as surely as it silenced their 
thousands of supporters, set the tone for a game that was played throughout at 
Argentina's pace -- tight control, no speeding. Greece managed eight shots to 
Argentina's 21 and never seriously challenged. In a last-minute switch, 
Argentina replaced veteran Sergio Goycochea in goal with 28-year-old Luis 
Islas, who passed a quiet afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 For Batistuta, the opening goal was only the beginning. He scored a hat trick 
on a gray afternoon, becoming the tournament's leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Batistuta scored his second goal, on a pass by defender Jose Chamot, at the 
end of the first half. After that, Greek goalkeeper Antonis Minou had no 
chance. He was cleanly beaten by Batistuta's third goal, on a penalty shot at 
game's end, after a hand ball. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Maradona's goal, though, that will be on the replays. 
</P>
<P>
 At 33, he was the greatest question mark on a problematical team from a soccer 
powerhouse that has won the Cup two times. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, when he carried Argentina to the final, Maradona has been 
suspended for cocaine use and bounced ingloriously from teams in Italy, Spain 
and Argentina. Many fans and soccer experts had written him off. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday he returned, slimmer, uncertain at first but with that same awesome 
touch that has made him one of the most famous soccer players for more than a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, Greek defender Panagiotis Tsalouhidis did everything to 
slow Maradona except tie his shoelaces together, and he earned a yellow card in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gained confidence in the first half," Maradona said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the start of the second half, the Greek defense gave him a bit more 
room to maneuver. Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 60th minute, midfielders Fernando Redondo and Simeone gave Maradona the 
ball just outside the penalty area. In the next instant it had somehow split 
through two defenders into a corner of the net after a left-footed blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "To answer the questions, Diego is in very good physical condition," Basile 
said. "His touch is still magic and every day now he will be better." 
</P>
<P>
 With five minutes to play, Basile calculatingly substituted for Argentina's 
captain, and as Maradona trotted off the field the dejected Greek blues joined 
the ecstatic Argentine blues in saluting him.

 Colombia vs. United States 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: The onus is on the U.S. team to match up against Colombia.Can 
the midfield hold the ball and, thus, start the offense? Will the team use four 
backs on defense or 10? How will the defenders stop some of the quickest, most 
dangerous forwards in the world? Comparing players is useless, but the United 
States should be very nervous to learn that forward Adolfo Valencia will be 
replaced in the lineup by Anthony de Avila to "add mobility," the Colombians 
say. How much faster can Colombia get? What's the speed limit in the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Do you use a zone or man-to-man defense against self-imposed 
pressure? That will be the question for both teams. Colombia must get a point 
and would prefer three. The United States needs three but would be delighted 
with one. Colombia's pressure will be unrelenting and their forwards' superior 
speed will expose the American defense's feet of lead. Look for a few 
somersaults from Faustino Asprilla. The best chance the U.S. team has to score 
will be on set plays and restarts. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Colombia isn't one of the tournament's favorites for no reason. 
This is a team with enormous pride and it was embarrassed by its loss to 
Romania, a team with some international stature. The Colombian player does not 
exist who would contemplate a loss to the United States. Colombia by three.

 Romania vs. Switzerland 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: It might be a ploy, but Swiss Coach Roy Hodgson insists he 
will not tinker with the game plan that resulted in a lackluster 1-1 tie 
against the United States. This, despite protestations at home, where Hodgson 
was ripped in the press for deploying only one striker, the talented Stephane 
Chapuisat, in the opener. Hodgson went to the formation because of an ankle 
injury to forward Adrian Knup, who did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-forward theory, the experts vented, put too much pressure on Thomas 
Bickel at midfield. Sonntagsblick, the mass-circulation newspaper, called 
Hodgson's decision a "fatal mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Chapuisat says he does not like to play alone in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania, which smothers the midfield, stunned Colombia, 3-1, and is out to 
show that was no fluke. The Swiss defense will have to contain Romania's 1-2 
punch of Gheorghe Hagi and Florin Raducioiu. Hagi, the brilliant playmaker, 
scored against Colombia and set up the other goals, both scored by Raducioiu. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: A pivotal game for teams that have not tasted much World Cup 
success. Knup has practiced for two days and appears ready to play, which might 
convince Hodgson to change tactics. With a victory, Romania can assure itself a 
return trip to the second round. A victory would put Switzerland back on track, 
but the team can ill afford a loss or a tie, knowing it still must face 
Colombia in group play. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: The Swiss are more desperate for a victory, but it appears that 
coach and players are not on the same page, which is never a good sign. 
Emotionally, Romania could be flat in the wake of its upset of Colombia but it 
should have enough firepower to squeeze out a hard-fought, 2-1 victory. CHRIS 
DUFRESNE

 Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner and his teammates couldn't stop talking about the 
reception they got in the New York-New Jersey area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to go back (for playoff games)," he said. "There were 50,000 Irish 
there (for the victory over Italy). If we can stay there, it would be great for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Giants Stadium, he said, was fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The design was magnificent and it supported that kind of atmosphere. It was 
mostly Italians and Irish. It wasn't American people. I must say it was 
well-organized, So far, everything here has been a dream." HELENE ELLIOTT

 Who has the worst job at the Rose Bowl?

<P>
 An early candidate was the poor soul sweltering in the pink bunny suit, 
beating a drum while walking the grounds in the afternoon heat Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energizer bunny and soccer -- who would have thought it? 
</P>

 "Twenty minutes outside and 20 minutes inside the entertainment center," said 
the bunny's minder. "There's been no problems. Oh, yeah, except for little kids

 While spectators at the Germany-Spain game in Chicago on Tuesday performed the 
wave, ESPN commentator Ian Darke informed his American audience that that 
particular form of fan participation was introduced during the 1986 World Cup 
tournament in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner in the booth, former U.S. national player Peter Vermes, set him 
straight, telling him the wave originated with American football, well before 
1986.

 Belgium Coach Paul Van Himst will revamp his lineup to produce a more 
conservative, defensive style than he used in Sunday's opening 1-0 victory over 
Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Himst will ditch his 3-4-3 alignment in favor of a formation that employs 
two forwards.The extra player might be in the midfield or on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 His reasons? He saw his defense wilt in the Florida heat Sunday, and he 
realized Group F is shaping up tougher than anticipated. If he initially 
regarded Saudi Arabia lightly, he changed his mind after seeing the Saudis' 
strong performance against the Netherlands on Monday. That means Belgium can't 
lose to Holland and expect to automatically make up those three points later, 
against Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised at how well the Saudis defended themselves. They 
defended themselves very well," Van Himst said Tuesday. "I was surprised how 
well prepared they were." HELENE ELLIOTT

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; POLITICS, SOCCER ON THE SAME

 Every four years, Mexicans are said to renew their faith that the national 
soccer team will win the World Cup and, every six years, that the new 
ruling-party presidential candidate will pull the country back from the brink 
of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, they are dubious about both team and party. Mexicans tuned out seven 
months of peasant uprising, political assassinations and kidnapings to turn 
their attention to the national soccer team Sunday -- and watched it lose to 
Norway, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts seriously suggest that unless the team's performance improves, 
failure on the field could bode ill at the polls for the Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), which is facing the tightest presidential race in 
its 65 years of rule. Sports fans might take out their frustrations on the 
governing party when they vote Aug. 21, according to that logic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly one-third of the 600 people polled in the capital a few weeks before 
the World Cup told the newspaper Reforma that they believe the national team's 
performance will influence the outcome of the election. One-third said the PRI 
would be hurt by the team's failure and 42% said a good showing would help the 
ruling party.  
</P>
<P>
 Pressure for change in the relationship between soccer and politics was 
building even before the team left Mexico. An opposition candidate challenged 
the government's exclusive rights to the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 National Action Party standard-bearer Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, running 
neck and neck with the ruling party's Ernesto Zedillo for first place in the 
polls, took advantage of the national soccer mania to dispel a cumbersome 
aristocratic image. Wearing faded jeans and a work shirt, he attended the 
national team's final exhibition game in Mexico City and won big points by 
buying a round of beer for everyone in his section. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI leaders such as Ignacio Pichardo, chairman of the ruling party's campaign, 
downplay the importance the elimination of the team might have. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want our team to play well, realizing that our chances of making it 
to the finals are remote," he said. "But there are lots of Latin teams that are 
going to please us by beating the Anglo-Saxon teams."

 The London Telegraph reported that a magazine called Sports in Russia recently 
published an article in which the great former Soviet goalkeeper, Lev Yashin, 
rated the 24 goalkeepers starting for their teams in the 1994 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a scoop much envied by other Russian sports journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 " Yashin? " said Vladimir Titorenko of Moscow's Sport Express when informed of 
the article. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Edelman, a Russian history professor at UC San Diego who wrote 
"Serious Fun," a book about sports in the former Soviet Union, explained 
Titorenko's surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe somebody appraised the goalkeepers for the magazine, or maybe it was a 
joke, but it's highly unlikely that they spoke to Lev Yashin," Edelman said, 
pointing out that the goalkeeper has been dead since 1990. RANDY HARVEY

 Bar staff called off a three-day strike Tuesday, clearing the way for full 
service at Dublin's pubs when Ireland makes its second appearance in the World 
Cup on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike by 3,000 union workers that closed many of the city's pubs put a 
damper on celebrations Saturday when Ireland defeated Italy, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff, represented by the Mandate union, voted Tuesday to accept a deal that 
included a 1% pay increase, time and a half for cleanup periods and improved 
pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The union estimated the package was worth $57 for members, who earn an average 
of $400 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland, tied with Norway for the lead in Group E, will play Mexico on Friday 
in Orlando, Fla.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: WHEN SQUID DELAY, ANGLERS WILL PLAY

<P>
 What a way to spend the first day of summer, sweltering under the sun aboard a 
boat at Santa Catalina Island -- reeling in one big fish after another. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best fishing of the year was happening Tuesday at the island, 
where yellowtail, barracuda and school-size white seabass were attacking with 
such abandon that fishermen aboard boats from Long Beach Sportfishing and L.A. 
Harbor Sportfishing reached three-fish limits of white seabass from 15 to 30 
pounds and 10-fish limits of barracuda by noon. Yellowtail were less 
cooperative, but some of the fish landed pushed 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are fish all along the backside of the island," Top Gun skipper Bobby 
Taft said upon his return to L.A. Harbor. "We were throwing back barracuda from 
9 o'clock on. We must have caught a bazillion barracuda." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronado skipper Ray Lagmay radioed Long Beach Sportfishing at noon Tuesday 
and said his customers had taken their limit of seabass after fighting seabass 
and barracuda for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the unseasonably good seabass bite is the unseasonable presence 
of squid off the back of Catalina. Squid, irresistible to white seabass, 
usually disappear by April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, when the water warms up the squid are gone," said Don Ashley, owner 
of Long Beach Sportfishing. "So any time we have squid after March, it's an 
aberration." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Exploratory trips out of San Diego have yet to turn up any albacore at the 
outer banks. But anglers on some medium-range boats have been battling large 
bluefin tuna 200 miles southwest of the landings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen aboard the Qualifier 105 caught 22 bluefin between 70 and 100 pounds 
Monday and skipper Jack Webster radioed to port Tuesday morning that there was 
a school under the boat and six fish hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Angler returned Sunday with six bluefin of more than 100 pounds 
and six more between 60-90 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hot off the wire: A Russian poacher was electrocuted last week when he tried 
to catch fish by putting a live electric cable into a pond, Itar-Tass news 
agency said. The 25-year-old from Tula, south of Moscow, forgot to disconnect 
the wire before getting into the water to collect his catch.

 Problem bears seem to be turning up everywhere. The latest, in Arizona, was 
shot and killed by wildlife officials June 13, but only after becoming a 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 11, the 100-pound bear climbed into a large ice chest on a picnic 
table. The bear didn't flinch when a man tried to scare it away with a yell. 
When he poked it with a broom handle, the bear grabbed the handle with its 
teeth and took the broom.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, the bear showed up in someone's yard and ran off after a 
shot was fired in the air. The next morning, the Arizona Game and Fish 
Department received a call from a man complaining that the bear was only four 
feet away when he emerged from an outdoor shower. The man was chased into his 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear then followed an adult and child as they walked down the street. Then 
some residents began following the bear as it rummaged through town. Wildlife 
officials finally encountered the bear as it was trying to get into a house. 
When attempts to tree the animal -- so it could be shot with a tranquilizing 
dart -- proved unsuccessful, it was shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 That ending might have been averted had not well-meaning residents been so 
careless. Interviews revealed that they had been feeding the bear. One family 
told an officer they had put meat and fish outside to feed wildlife. AF&G field 
supervisor Ray Parent said that only causes the animals to expect such 
treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're not doing bears or other wildlife a favor by feeding them," Parent 
said. "In fact, sometimes you are condemning them to death."

FISHING REPORT: THE ONE THAT GOT AWAY DOESN'T QUITE GET AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You wouldn't want to see the one that got away. It's rotting in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 An angler at Green Valley Lake in the San Bernardino Mountains apparently had 
quite a struggle with an unusually large trout last Friday, but the fish 
managed to break the line. 
</P>
<P>
 It later surfaced -- belly up. Lake employee Jerry Eaker scooped it up, 
brought it in, weighed it in at 11 pounds, then disposed of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We double-wrapped it and threw it in the dumpster," concession owner Jim 
Allison said. "It must have put up enough of a fight that it croaked."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; GANT SIGNS TWO-YEAR DEAL WITH REDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free-agent outfielder Ron Gant, still disabled because of a broken right leg, 
signed a two-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract minimizes the Reds' risk if he can't play again. Gant will get 
the major league minimum of $109,000 this season until he is activated and 
$10,000 a day thereafter for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds also agreed to a $500,000 base salary for next season that will 
automatically increase to $3.5 million if Gant is fully recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jim Bowden said doctors agree Gant, 29, probably will be fully 
recovered between August and November. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant suffered the injury in a dirt-bike accident last February, one week after 
he signed a non-guaranteed, one-year contract with the Atlanta Braves for $5.5 
million. The Braves released him after the injury, paying a $901,639 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gant averaged 29 homers, 97 runs batted in, 30 doubles and 31 stolen bases the 
last four seasons for Atlanta. He bated .274 last season with career highs in 
homers (36) and RBIs (117). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants confirmed that pitcher Salomon Torres has left the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, 22, was coming off a start Sunday in which he gave up 10 hits and four 
earned runs in 3 2/3 innings of a 10-6 loss to the Chicago Cubs. The Contra 
Costa Times, citing an unidentified player, reported Torres left a note for 
Manager Dusty Baker after Sunday's game that said: "I can't take this. I've had 
enough. I can't pitch at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is 2-6 with a 4.86 earned-run average. He is 0-4 with a 5.73 ERA in his 
past four starts, including Sunday's 87-pitch outing, his shortest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Marlins plan to activate closer Bryan Harvey for tonight's game 
against the Chicago Cubs, and he probably will pitch one inning, Manager Rene 
Lachemann said. Harvey had a brief rehabilitation assignment with Class-A 
Brevard County of the Florida State League.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; LARKIN, REDS ADD TO GIANTS' WOES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Roper made one mistake, but overcame it. John Burkett made one, and it 
cost him. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper gave up only a solo homer over seven innings Tuesday night to anchor the 
Cincinnati Reds' combined two-hitter, and Barry Larkin homered against Burkett 
in the eighth inning at Cincinnati to give the Reds a 2-1 victory over the San 
Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper didn't give up a hit until Dave Martinez lined a two-out, game-tying 
homer in the sixth. Martinez pulled a belt-high, first-pitch fastball over the 
wall in right for his first homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper knew he had a no-hitter going, but it wasn't on his mind at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had glanced up at the scoreboard in the fourth inning and saw it said no 
hits. But the home run didn't come from that," he said. "It was just a bad 
pitch I made. After that, I was able to bear down and get them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so Burkett (4-6), who has lost his last three starts. Manager Dusty Baker 
let him bat in the top of the eighth with two out and the score tied because he 
was pitching so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I left him in. At the time, he was throwing as good as anybody I 
could bring in," Baker said. "I took a chance and lost." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting the first out, Burkett hung a first-pitch breaking ball to the 
hot-hitting Larkin, who had two hits to extend his hitting streak to 14 games. 
He pulled it over the wall in left for his fifth homer, sending the Giants to 
their 10th loss in 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 7, Philadelphia 1 -- Dave Clark and Don Slaught homered for the 
Pirates at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark hit a three-run shot in a four-run first inning aided by three 
Philadelphia errors. Slaught added a two-run drive -- only his third extra-base 
hit of the season -- in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, New York 3 -- Fred McGriff's two-out run-scoring single in the 
ninth lifted the Braves at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 John Franco (1-3), trying to become the career saves leader among 
left-handers, squandered a 3-2 lead for his fourth blown save in 20 
opportunities this season. Franco and Dave Righetti are tied with 252 career 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 8, Houston 0 -- David Nied pitched a four-hitter at Denver for his 
first career shutout, and the Rockies' first shutout at home in their 1 
1/2-season history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nied (6-4) did not give up a hit after the third inning until the ninth, when 
Andy Stankiewicz led off with a single. The right-hander struck out four and 
walked one to win at home for the first time in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Florida 2 -- Sammy Sosa hit his 16th homer and drove in four runs 
to lead a 15-hit attack by the Cubs at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 5, Montreal 4 -- Bernard Gilkey's run-scoring single broke a 
ninth-inning tie at St. Louis, enabling the Cardinals to climb back to .500.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WHITAKER'S GRAND SLAM ENDS INDIANS' STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lou Whitaker, who just missed extending the Detroit Tigers' home-run streak to 
a major league-record 26 games on Monday night, started a new streak for the 
Tigers on Tuesday night with one of the most dramatic home runs of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker hit a grand slam that capped a six-run rally in the ninth inning at 
Detroit, giving the Tigers a 7-5 victory over the Cleveland Indians that ended 
the Indians' 10-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are riding high right now, and they thought they had us beat, but they 
just couldn't put us away," Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jason Grimsley limited the Tigers to one unearned run on four hits in 
eight innings, Manager Mike Hargrove replaced him with rookie closer Paul 
Shuey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a four-run lead, and our closer needed some work," Hargrove said. 
"Jason had pitched really well, but he had been up in the strike zone and a 
little erratic in the eighth. If I had to do it over, I'd do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Gibson drew a leadoff walk in the ninth from Shuey, Mickey Tettleton 
walked with one out and Alan Trammell hit a run-scoring single. Pinch-hitter 
Juan Samuel greeted Derek Lilliquist (1-3) with a single that loaded the bases 
and Tony Phillips walked, forcing home a run that cut the Tigers' deficit to 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker followed with a drive into the upper deck in right field for his 10th 
home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 13, Toronto 1 -- Mo Vaughn doubled twice and drove in three runs during 
a 10-run first inning at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox combined seven walks and six hits, including two-run doubles by 
Scott Cooper and John Valentin and a run-scoring double by Mike Greenwell, in 
the 41-minute first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston sent 16 batters to the plate against Brad Cornett (0-2) and Scott Brow. 
Cornett gave up six runs on three hits and three walks while getting only one 
out in his second major league start. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Jay shortstop Dick Schofield was taken off the field on a stretcher, his 
neck and head immobilized, after being hit just above the left ear with a 
fastball by Aaron Sele in the fifth inning. Schofield appeared to be knocked 
unconscious by the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 2, Oakland 0 -- Four Royal pitchers combined on a one-hitter and 
Felix Jose hit a two-run homer against Ron Darling in the ninth inning at 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three batters reached base for the A's, who had a six-game winning streak 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Texas 4 -- Frank Thomas hit two solo home runs for the White Sox 
and Ozzie Guillen singled home the winning run in the 10th inning at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 6, Minnesota 4 -- Jimmy Key won his 10th consecutive decision, 
becoming the majors' first 11-game winner at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Milwaukee 1 -- Mike Mussina improved to 10-4 and Harold Baines 
homered and had a season-high four runs batted in at Baltimore.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; THE GLOVE HAS BEEN PASSED -- TO EASLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds stopped by teammate Damion Easley's 
locker Tuesday afternoon, and had one simple request: 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I have my glove back?" Reynolds said, raising his eyebrows in feigned 
exasperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Easley borrowed Reynolds' glove in Chicago on the last trip, and until Tuesday 
had no reason to give it back.Easley was not only coming off the disabled list, 
but he was taking Reynolds' job. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who plan on keeping Easley at second, have since informed teams 
that Reynolds is available. And one interested team is the Seattle Mariners, 
for whom Reynolds played the first 12 seasons of his professional career. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds was in the starting lineup Tuesday, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann 
said, because of his .538 batting average against Mariner starter Chris Bosio. 
But the Angels privately said they also wanted to showcase Reynolds' skills 
against the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners' interest in Angel catcher Greg Myers is beginning to slightly 
wane because of the $800,000 he is guaranteed for the 1995 season. Although the 
Mariners desperately want a left-handed catcher, Myers' contract is a 
deterrent, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers returned Tuesday to the Angels' lineup for the first first time since 
May 24 because of torn cartilage in his left knee. He suffered the injury in a 
home-plate collision with Boston Red Sox outfielder Mike Greenwell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Phil Leftwich, who had won three of his last four decisions when he 
went on the disabled list June 8 because of an inflamed lower right leg, will 
begin a rehabilitation assignment Thursday for Class A Lake Elsinore against 
San Bernardino. Leftwich will make at least two starts before the Angels recall 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping I wouldn't have to go through that," Leftwich said, "but I guess 
they want to make sure I'm fit." BOB NIGHTENGALE

'90S FAMILY; FAMILY FILE; BE HONEST IF YOU CAN'T ATTEND CHILD'S SPECIAL EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times staff and news services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are moments in a child's life when a parent can't attend a special 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 On these occasions, parents should be honest and find alternative ways to show 
they care, says Gregory Smith, associate professor of psychology and child 
development specialist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "A straightforward, honest explanation is required," Smith says. But if it's 
business that prevents a parent from being in attendance, "don't act like the 
job is more important by saying things like 'This is very important to Mommy.' 
That's the worst thing a child could hear at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 To help alleviate the disappointment of a parent missing a recital or play, 
Smith suggests arranging a "command performance" of the event at home, or 
calling before or after the performance. Such actions help communicate the 
parent's pride and interest in the child's accomplishments, satisfying the 
child's need for parental approval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith cautions parents not to go overboard. Hasty promises to attend the 
child's next event or gifts to soothe a child's hurt feelings often do more 
harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't promise to be at the 'next one' if you can't," he says. "The child 
won't care about the next one right now and reneging on the promise will make 
the situation even worse." Dangerous Fireworks Can Put Damper on Fourth of July 
</P>
<P>
 Fireworks blind, maim or kill about 11,000 people each year, according to 
Prevent Blindness America. More than half the injuries are to children, and 
nearly 40% of the injuries involve bystanders, the organization said. The three 
types of fireworks that keep hospital emergency rooms busy during the Fourth of 
July holiday are bottle rockets, firecrackers and sparklers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bottle rockets and firecrackers are miniature explosives," said Tod Turriff, 
safety director of Prevent Blindness America. "Sparklers burn at temperatures 
hot enough to melt gold." 2 Companies Offer Workers Help With Living Wills 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T and Glaxo are providing free consultations to employees on creating 
living wills. Diane Piktialis of Work/Family Directions in Boston which 
developed the service -- said a national study reported showed that living 
wills could significantly lower hospital bills for individuals near death. Most 
Working Moms Feel Happy, Competent, in Control 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of working moms say they like or love their jobs and believe 
their families are better off because they are working, a new survey from 
Working Mother magazine shows. These 1,000 working mothers also said they felt 
happy, competent and in control. Further, eight out of 10 of the respondents 
viewed themselves not as secondary or optional providers, but as breadwinners.

RSVP; JUST A NICE, NORMAL DINNER WITH ROYALTY

 The only scene that even remotely suggested excess at Monday's black-tie 
dinner for Japan's emperor and empress was the arrival of the Imperial 
entourage's luggage. Just as the cocktail hour began, two white trucks pulled 
into the Beverly Wilshire's driveway and unceremoniously disgorged scores of 
bags, boxes, trunks, valises and garment bags. It looked like the start of a 
Liz Taylor world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the contrast to the sedate and restrained evening that followed that 
made the baggage arrival stand out. Former Gov. George Deukmejian said Emperor 
Akihito and Empress Michiko were "reserved but pleasant . . . very dignified," 
and this could also describe the dinner in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 680 guests, the evening began with a stroll through ultra-sensitive 
metal detectors (anything more than earrings and cuff links seemed to set them 
off) into the reception area near the ballroom. About 75 VIP guests -- 
including Lew and Edie Wasserman, Marvin and Barbara Davis, Toyota's Yukiyasu 
Togo and Mitsubishi Electric's Takashi Kiuchi -- proceeded upstairs to a 
pre-dinner reception with the royal couple. 
</P>
<P>
 When cocktails were over, guests were asked to be seated before the emperor 
and empress, who were announced by dinner chair Lod Cook and preceded into the 
room by Mayor Richard Riordan, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke and Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the royal couple were seated, there were remarks from the hosts in 
the extreme form of bland politeness this kind of evening seems to demand. 
Wilson described the dinner as, "this pleasant, historic evening." 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor, no slouch himself when it comes to polite-ese, spoke in Japanese 
and focused on his "great pleasure on being here," and that he was "glad to 
note Japanese Americans have worked closely with other Americans of various 
areas to forge and construct California society." 
</P>
<P>
 Seated with the royals at the head table were 20 guests. Burke was to the 
emperor's right, the empress on his left and Wilson was seated to her left. One 
other head-table guest of note was former Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi 
Miyazawa. He's probably best known to Americans for the unpleasant surprise he 
received in his lap when President George Bush became ill during a Tokyo state 
dinner. On this occasion, Miyazawa went pleasantly unsurprised. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal began with ravioli Gorgonzola, followed by a salad with seared ahi 
tuna and a main course of tenderloin of beef. "The host committee wanted 
something indicative of this area," Beverly Wilshire catering director James 
Cutfield said. "They wanted normal local foods." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those dining were AT&T's Glen Fukushima, Richard and Betty Koshalek, 
Japanese Consul General Seiichiro Noboru, Jane and Michael Eisner, Union Bank's 
Tamotsu Yamaguchi, Etsuko and Joe Price, the Japan Business Assn.'s Kazunori 
Amano, Shel and Sandy Ausman, Peter and Annette O'Malley, Gene Autry, George 
Aratani and Sadao Kita. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening ended with a shining performance by the four dozen members of the 
Los Angeles Children's Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 There were a number of guests who thought that the Imperial visit was an 
indirect way for the Japanese to help Los Angeles -- that the royals coming 
here sends a sign that L.A. should be a tourist destination. The message to the 
Japanese people, said Doug Erber of the Japan America Society, is that, "if 
it's safe for the emperor, then it's safe for them."

 The big fade-out: "Have L.A. Cellular technicians found that your car phone is 
the one thing that you can take with you after you get that final call from on 
high?" asks Bruce Carroll of L.A. 
</P>

 He points out that the company's latest newsletter lists several sites where 
new antennas have been installed, including: 
</P>
<P>
 All Souls Cemetery.

 Which reminds us: An L.A. urban tale of years past -- mentioned in Ken

 One political candidate who has a six-PAC: Assembly hopeful George Reis says 
his Libertarian campaign wasn't getting much media attention so he made a batch 
of 48 bottles of George Reis for Assembly Beer (see photo). 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, he caught Only in L.A.'s attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Reis, running to replace Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), concocted 
the liquid campaign favors at a cost of about $300 at Hamilton Gregg Brewworks 
in Hermosa Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 He has discovered that the bottles, most of which he has handed out, are more 
popular than potholders. It's difficult to gauge how much they helped, though. 
Running unopposed in the primary, he amassed 61 votes (compared to about 14,000 
cast for candidates in both the Republican and Democratic contests). 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 62 Libertarians in the district, so someone didn't vote," Reis 
said. "I'm a little afraid to ask my wife if it was she."

 List of the Day: L.A.'s Downtown News has listed several categories in its 
sixth annual Reader's Poll for the Best of Downtown, including:

 Now that you asked: Here are our votes on the above three ballot questions. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Heading south on the Hollywood Freeway (101), you must cross over four 
lanes of traffic to reach the Harbor Freeway (110). In the novel, "Play It as 
It Lays," author Joan Didion immortalized the maneuver this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "On the afternoon she finally did it without once braking or once losing the 
beat on the radio she was exhilarated, and that night slept dreamlessly." 
</P>
<P>
 2. We're still looking at our mug shots of the City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The guy who greets Downtown business people around City Hall with a 
semi-mocking, "Hello, professionals! How about a quarter today?" Our former 
colleague, Bob Trounson, was once waiting in line at a DMV office in the San 
Gabriel Valley when he felt a tap on his shoulder. It was the panhandler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, professional," he said to Trounson. Then the panhandler laughed and 
said, "That's OK. I'm not working right now." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Bonus selection: Barbara Ryan of L.A. suggests a new category -- best Downtown 
News typo -- and nominates the opening paragraph of a June 6 cover piece on 
archeology. 
</P>
<P>
 It began: "Downtown has its fair share of buried treasurers. . . ."

<P>
 Apparently L.A.'s always had problems with its finances. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 In Peter Lefcourt's new novel, "Di and I," Princess Diana runs off with a 
middle-aged Hollywood writer. The lovers become the operators of a McDonald's 
franchise -- in Rancho Cucamonga. Perhaps, if that venture fails, they could 
get a distributorship for George Reis for Assembly Beer in the sequel.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; THOSE PESKY TRAVEL BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County agency that controls fleas, rodents and other 
disease-causing pests again has created ill will among taxpayers and 
contributed to the cynicism that many people feel about government. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, the Orange County Vector Control District, spent $6,000 in April 
to send 19 board members and staffers to San Diego for the annual meeting of 
the American Mosquito Control Assn. That is far too many. True, the mosquito is 
one of the main targets of the district and staffers should be up to date on 
eradication measures. So a case can be made for sending a few staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members had no need to go. The board consists of representatives 
from each of the 31 cities in the county, plus one from the county, and its 
membership is nearly as big as the total full-time staff of the district. After 
riding out the recession, government agencies should know how to tighten their 
belts. Board members easily can be briefed on conferences by staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the agency increased the fee it charged property owners from $1.10 
annually to $3.19, provoking howls of protest from taxpayers. The district 
argued that the additional charge was needed to fight pests, and the increase 
appeared justified at the time. But the news that the district spent $100,000 
on travel-related expenses for staff and trustees in the last three years 
undercut its argument. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials last week restricted travel to a maximum of eight board 
members for each annual state meeting on mosquito and pest control. That is 
eight too many. Send a few staffers; leave the directors at home. They can use 
telephones and fax machines if they need to consult with their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth considering is Supervisor William G. Steiner's suggestion that the 
Vector Control District be merged into the county Health Care Agency. The 
Orange County Grand Jury has contended that the county has too many special 
districts and that some should be consolidated. Maybe the pest-chasing agency 
can justify an independent existence, but if it cannot it should be folded into 
an agency whose activities, including travel budgets, are supervised by the 
county supervisors.

MATCH PLAY NEXT FOR WI IN STATE AMATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five years, Charlie Wi should know his way around the Monterey 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 With a driver, certainly. 
</P>
<P>
 As a driver, not so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing the first round of the 83rd State Amateur Championship this 
week, Wi hopped in a car with a friend and tried to find his way back to the 
Pacific Coast Highway via scenic, looping 17-Mile Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi kept taking laps like he was cruising at nearby Laguna Seca Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the storied courses on the peninsula, Wi knows each twist and turn. The 
22-year-old from North Hills finished with a 36-hole total of 147 to tie for 
seventh and advance to the 32-man match-play portion of the event, which begins 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Five others from the region were pushed aside, but Chad Wright of Ventura and 
Jamey Forsyth of Chatsworth remained alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi shot a one-over-par 73 at Pebble Beach Golf Links on Tuesday and will face 
Mark Miller, 42, of Antioch at 6:42 a.m. at Pebble Beach. Miller shot 79 at 
Pebble Beach on Tuesday and made match play by one shot after finishing in a 
nine-way tie at 153. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, an 18-year-old who graduated last year from Buena High and now plays 
at USC, shot an even-par 72 at Spyglass Hill Golf Course to finish in a 
three-way tie for ninth at 148. Wright, playing in his second State Amateur, 
will face Ed Cuff of Temecula today at 7:12 a.m. Cuff shot 152. 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth, a first-time entrant, shot 78 at Pebble Beach to finish at 153. At 
6:30 a.m., he plays Steve Woods of Upland, who won medalist honors by shooting 
73 at Pebble Beach to finish at 142, one shot ahead of Tiger Woods of Anaheim. 
Steve Woods has been a quarterfinalist three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 All remaining play in the tournament, which concludes Saturday, is at Pebble 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi made the cut with relative ease -- which isn't exactly news. Wi, a senior 
at Cal, has qualified for match play five times in as many attempts dating to 
1990, when he won the tournament title two weeks after graduating from Westlake 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 He was two-under par through six holes Tuesday, a fast start that ensured a 
berth in match play. This despite a putting stroke that kept leaving him 
off-line to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit it pretty good, but I didn't putt at all," Wi said. "I didn't have the 
yips, I had the push." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsyth, at 6-foot-5, is the tallest player in the match-play field and might 
be the least experienced. Forsyth, 25, a 1986 graduate of Hart High who is an 
employee of Valencia Country Club in Santa Clarita, did not play high school 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
 He played soccer. Was an all-league goalie, in fact. "Golf was for weekends 
with my dad," said Forsyth, who eventually earned a scholarship to Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly a weekend in the sun for the five others with ties to the 
region. Failing to make the cut were Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys (80-74 -- 
154), Birmingham High graduate Yasu Amaya (78-81 -- 159), Paul Tanner of Sun 
Valley (81-78 -- 159), David Saylor of West Hills (82-79 -- 161) and Brandon 
DiTullio of Westlake Village (80-82 -- 162). 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, 36, who missed the cut by one shot, failed to make two putts from 
inside four feet over the final three holes at Spyglass. Over the past 15 
years, Steinberg had reached the quarterfinals three times and the semifinals 
twice.

 O.J.'S FINER MOMENT: The last time O.J. Simpson made a public appearance in 
Orange County, he made a lot of friends and did a lot of good for his alma 
mater, USC. . . . La Galleria D'Arte in Newport Beach had asked Simpson to 
autograph copies of a LeRoy Neiman serigraph of his famous run against UCLA 
that sent the Trojans to the 1968 Rose Bowl. Simpson appeared gratis at the art 
gallery on March 20, on condition that it donate $100,000 to USC. . . . "It was 
a long evening and he was just charming," says co-owner Eileen Inderbieten. 
"Our customers have been calling us all week; we're all in shock about what has 
happened." The autographed serigraphs were $3,500 then; $5,000 now, with only a 
few left. 
</P>
<P>
 NO FAINT PRAISE: Sheriff Brad Gates on more than one occasion has found 
himself at odds with members of the Board of Supervisors. But Tuesday, the 
board was all praise for the job his deputies did in the dramatic pursuit of 
O.J. Simpson (B4). . . . "Clearly, this was an extremely delicate and 
potentially dangerous situation that required effective communication and 
coordination," said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. "And they did it with the 
whole nation watching." 
</P>
<P>
 LITTLE RIPPLES: The Splash is unbeaten in Continental Indoor Soccer League 
play. But the downside: They trail 10 teams in home attendance. The Splash 
averaged just 3,816 fans in their first three home games at the Pond of 
Anaheim. . . . Tonight may be different: Fans will get a poster of the 
Mermaids, the team dancers, as the Splash face Detroit at 7:35. Says dancer 
Jeni Waters: "We've all been Rams or Clippers cheerleaders; we're more 
accessible to the Splash crowd and that makes it more satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 SIDELINE CREW: Being a team cheerleader may not fit some women's lifestyle, 
but such positions are in great demand. The Los Angeles Rams just completed 
tryouts for their 42-member team, with 250 hopefuls. . . . Alisa Denmon, 28, of 
Hollywood made the team for the seventh year, making her the runaway veteran. 
The cheerleading squad is women only, with 25 from Orange County. Average age: 
22.

DOLLAR PLUNGES; MARKETS FOLLOW; ECONOMY: WORLDWIDE INFLATION WORRIES AND A 
SURPRISE SURGE IN THE U.S. TRADE DEFICIT ARE BLAMED FOR THE CURRENCY'S FALL. 
ANOTHER INTEREST RATE INCREASE MAY RESULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Worldwide inflation jitters Tuesday sent the dollar plummeting against the yen 
and other foreign currencies, pounding the stock and bond markets and raising 
new fears of an interest rate hike that could threaten the nation's economic 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell briefly below the once-unthinkable barrier of 100 yen, its 
decline hastened by new figures showing that the U.S. trade deficit surged an 
unexpected 22.1% in April to $8.4 billion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average 
lost 33.93 points, bringing the indicator's six-day losses to 2.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a pervasive nervousness about developments all over the world, with 
inflation fears underlying it all," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of 
Goldman, Sachs International. "It's worrisome because so much of the U.S. 
recovery has depended on low interest rates. And, if this raises rates for a 
sustained period, that will slow the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 The continued market turbulence generally mirrored declines in Europe and Asia 
and raised some expectation that central banks would begin buying up billions 
in dollars to reverse the slide. But for the moment, Clinton Administration 
officials only repeated their insistence that the economy's condition does not 
justify the dollar's fall and withheld action. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising fears of inflation, the fall also caused bond buyers to worry about 
erosion in the value of their investments. And the prospect of higher bond 
yields in turn led some stock investors to sell off their shares in 
expectations of higher yields in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The markets are seeing weakness everywhere," said Ian Spence, a senior 
currency trader with Chemical Bank in New York. "It's just feeding on itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors fear that inflation will trigger another round of interest rate 
hikes in the United States, slowing the economy and hurting investments in 
stocks and bonds. Many investors respond by moving their investments into 
foreign currencies, which drives down the value of the dollar against those 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A secondary factor, some traders said, was investors' lack of confidence that 
the Administration is up to the task of handling the political and economic 
problems it faces, from North Korea to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation concerns recently have been fanned by signs that commodities -- 
notably oil -- are seeing worrisome price rises. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Federal Reserve does not make it a practice to raise interest 
rates as a means of stabilizing the dollar, some economists said they believe 
that the Fed's governors might want to offset an inflationary spiral caused by 
the falling dollar. A cheaper dollar raises the cost of imports for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne D. Angell, chief economist at Bear Stearns & Co. and a former Fed 
governor, predicted that the Federal Reserve would raise rates July 5 at the 
next meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there have been signs that German interest rates might be 
rising. Lothar Klausing, an economist with the Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, 
attributed the dollar's continued weakness to expectations that German rates 
might soon increase, as well as to concerns over the U.S.-Japanese trade 
conflict and fears of inflation's effects on U.S. bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are inflation fears," he said. "And people have no confidence as to 
U.S. interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Klausing and several U.S. analysts said the dollar's fall might yet be 
an overreaction to an American economy that continues to display many signs of 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investors fear that a falling dollar will lead to higher interest 
rates because the Fed often uses interest rate increases to reverse such 
declines. The Fed does so because higher interest rates attract more foreign 
investors to U.S. currency, increasing the value of the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence, of Chemical Bank, said traders have expected to see central banks 
begin buying up currency in the past several days. "When they didn't, that just 
added fuel to the fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 4, central banks intervened massively to try to stabilize the dollar in 
a move orchestrated by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. Now, however, the 
Treasury Department apparently hopes that the dollar's slide is nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Hormats, of Goldman Sachs, said the dollar's turbulence reflects in part the 
enormous growth of dollar holdings abroad. During the 1980s, about $170 billion 
flowed to foreign investors annually because of large trade deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 In this decade, those levels have been swollen by foreign direct investment 
and other factors, so the annual outflow now is closer to about $250 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if foreigners start seeing that they can't hold those dollars at a stable 
currency rate, they can get nervous -- and start to sell," Hormats said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to dipping below the 100-yen barrier, the dollar also dropped 
below the critical 1.60 level against the deutsche mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended Tuesday at 100.35 yen, down from 101.90 on Monday. It was a 
postwar record closing low. The dollar also ended at 1.594 German marks, down 
from 1.60 and the lowest since May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year bond yield rose to 7.49% from 7.46% on Monday. The last 
time the yield hit that level was May 13. The price of the bonds dropped 3/8, 
or $3.75 per $1,000 of face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow's fall marked its lowest close since May 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Marjorie Miller in Bonn contributed to this story. Key 
Questions 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is depressing the dollar? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Economists can't find solid explanations. They are attributing the slide 
mainly to negative sentiment toward the U.S. currency in the global 
foreign-exchange market. Some say this reflects a lack of confidence in the 
Clinton Administration's foreign policy, particularly negotiations with Japan 
over its trade surplus. Many money traders believe that Washington wants to 
keep the yen high, which in the long run should depress Japan's exports by 
making them more expensive. Trade figures released Tuesday showed that the 
Japanese surplus with the United States remains huge, putting more downward 
pressure on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does this mean for consumers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not very much, at least in the near term. Although the dollar's purchasing 
power has weakened abroad, importers have so far been absorbing higher costs 
for cars, appliances and other items. But if the dollar continues to weaken 
over the next several months, prices for imports could rise and domestic 
manufacturers might opt to boost prices as well. That could fuel inflation. 
People traveling to Europe and Japan will find that they can't buy as much with 
their dollars.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; U.S. PUTS UP STORM WARNING; GROUP A: 
AMERICANS PREPARING FOR A WRATHFUL COLOMBIA IN WAKE OF ITS 3-1 UPSET BY 
ROMANIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two schools of thought on Colombia's mood going into today's World 
Cup game against the United States at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 One says the intense pressure on Colombia, which was upset by Romania in its 
opener, will cause the team to wilt in its rush to gain a point with only two 
games left in the first round. This reasoning has it that the Colombians will 
press to score and lapse into undisciplined individual play. 
</P>
<P>
 The other says Colombia had an off day against Romania and won't have another. 
According to that line of thinking, the Colombians will take out their 
frustrations on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter theory is more popular and the U.S. team is preparing for the 
worst. Assistant coach Steve Sampson said Tuesday of the resilient Colombians: 
"They are the type of team that won't panic. They won't change their system. 
All they have to do is finish their chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are likely to occur at an alarming rate, with Faustino Asprilla, Carlos 
Valderrama and Freddy Rincon playing. The surprising news from the Colombian 
camp Tuesday was that Anthony de Avila would start in place of Adolfo Valencia 
at forward. 
</P>
<P>
 De Avila adds quickness to an already fast team, which might well cause 
serious problems for the U.S. defense. "We are confronted with a team that is 
considered to be one of the best in the world, with the best talent in the 
world," Sampson said. "But you have to look at what's happening in this World 
Cup. Anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the one change on Colombia's side, look for the U.S. team to make 
some adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible new looks: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The World Cup debut of Hugo Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the obvious problems for the U.S. team in its 1-1 tie against 
Switzerland was controlling the ball in the midfield. Barring a miraculous 
overnight recovery from his hamstring injury, Claudio Reyna will not play 
today. His creativity and ability to hold the ball was sorely missed last week 
and continues to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is older and not as active as Reyna, but he's experienced and highly 
skilled and -- rare on the U.S. team -- is left-footed. Perez would seem to be 
a good choice to insert in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the changes Bora's looking at," Sampson said of his boss, U.S. 
Coach Bora Milutinovic. "He recognizes that we need someone in the middle of 
the field who can hold the ball for us and allow us to stay more compact 
between our back line and our front line." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eric Wynalda moved back to the midfield, Roy Wegerle as the withdrawn 
forward and Ernie Stewart as striker. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda played in the midfield in the second half of the final tuneup game, 
against Mexico, with great success. This alignment has the benefit of adding 
Wynalda's speed and ball-control skills to the midfield, which should help link 
the midfield to the forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though that is a very good option for us, I think most likely you'll see 
that combination in the second half," Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because of Wegerle's questionable fitness. Wegerle has had three recent 
knee operations and although he says he's ready to play 90 minutes, Milutinovic 
will want to have the freshest legs and fastest players available to him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Sorber playing more of a playmaker role and Thomas Dooley dropping 
back to help on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Dooley is the one American no one would have expected to have a sub-par game, 
but his contribution against Switzerland was diffused because he spent too much 
time helping other players on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorber has been a quiet player and something of an unknown. His starting in 
midfield surprised some, but Sorber is the kind of steady player Milutinovic 
likes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a part of Mike Sorber that is happy to be on the field," Sampson 
said. "But I think there is a part of him that would like to be a playmaker, 
but he has too much respect for Thomas Dooley." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson says the U.S. staff wants to see Dooley play with his back to his own 
goal so that his first touch of the ball is more confident. The staff wants 
Sorber, not Dooley, to push the ball up and would prefer that Dooley drop back 
and play defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense figures to have trouble maintaining position against Colombia's 
constant attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Switzerland played a lot of long ball," U.S. defender Cle Kooiman said. 
"Colombia will come through more on the middle of the field. They will play the 
ball on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if they fell apart. But I don't think that's going to 
happen."

MIKE DOWNEY: GOAL TOOK BOUNCE OUT OF HIS STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ball went boinngggg.  
</P>
<P>
 Soccer balls are not supposed to bounce like rubber. They aren't supposed to 
go bounding like a bloop single in Minneapolis. Once a soccer ball touches 
ground, it is likely to bounce up ankle-high, knee-high, waist-high, maybe even 
eye-high. But not over your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Zubizarreta. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad enough spending your childhood being called last alphabetically. Bad 
enough being fired from your home club of Barcelona shortly before World Cup 
'94. Bad enough missing a World Cup opening game against South Korea for being 
ejected from a qualifying game against Denmark, then watching helplessly as 
your replacement, Santiago Canizares, yields two goals in the final few 
minutes, sending an imminent victory for Spain down the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 But this . . .  
</P>
<P>
 To stand there and watch a ball go boinngggg, two feet over your outstretched 
arm. 
</P>
<P>
 To have it cost your country a triumph over Germany, of all clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the German coach called it "a really lucky goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Not for Zubizarreta, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Mala suerte.  
</P>
<P>
 Bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 There he stood, Andoni Zubizarreta, the Spanish goalkeeper, dancing on his 
toes. Team on top, 1-0. Second half. Taking it to the Germans, who hadn't been 
defeated in the World Cup finals since the championship game of 1986. Spain's 
loyalists behind him, cheering their lungs out Tuesday at Soldier Field, 
cheering from here to Madrid, still tingling over Juan Antonio Goikoetxea's 
ricochet-bing-bang first-half goal, still anxious about getting a victory in 
this tournament and not being sent back home in shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball goes to Juergen Klinsmann, who has set up camp directly in front of the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakly, he redirects it with his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball bounces once. 
</P>
<P>
 Boinngggg.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the left shoulder of Zubizarreta it bounds. He barely moves. He barely 
looks up. 
</P>
<P>
 On TV, an analyst, former American player Peter Vermes, says, "Oooh, I think 
he could have reacted a little bit better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 About all Zubizarreta did do was bend over, retrieve the ball and lob it back 
toward the field, disgustedly, like a Bleacher Bum after a visiting-team home 
run at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain 1, Germany 1, no one won. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Zubizarreta said, stating the obvious, "If I could have stopped the 
goal, obviously, I would have. It was a lucky goal. I would like to see it on 
video, because I felt a German player was offside." 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be the only one viewing the tape. According to the president of 
Spain's Superior Council of Sports, Rafael Cortes Elvira, about 70% of everyone 
in Spain put a halt to all activity Tuesday evening to watch this game. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretty unhappy 70%, right about now. 
</P>
<P>
 Many back home apparently believe the Spanish coach, Javier Clemente, made a 
mistake in restoring Zubizarreta to his position in goal. Until the wild ending 
with South Korea, the younger-by-eight-years Canizares had played skillfully, 
even spectacularly. 
</P>
<P>
 So now what? 
</P>
<P>
 Spain is winless. Its captain, Miguel Angel Nadal, is in exile, having been 
banished for two games because of a red card he drew in the South Korea game. 
Its brightest prospect, 21-year-old midfielder Julen Guerrero, hurt his leg 
against the Koreans. Now, a goalkeeper controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mala, mala suerte.  
</P>
<P>
 The coach, Clemente, is putting his own spin on things, saying, "We played 
against the world champions, so I think we should be satisfied with the result 
we got." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but tell that to the 7,000-plus fans from Spain who made the trip, most 
of whom have been hanging out at the hastily arranged House of Spain 
hospitality lounge in downtown Chicago, what with the team playing twice here. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemente had insisted beforehand, "One win from two games, that's all we need. 
Our luck will have to change, but we have no worries at all about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Perdone, por favor.  
</P>
<P>
 Pardon me, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Nosotros no estamos de acuerdo.  
</P>
<P>
 We disagree.

NBA FINALS; THE WAITING FINALLY WILL END TONIGHT; GAME 7: AFTER THE DISTRACTION 
OF A TWO-DAY BREAK, THE KNICKS AND ROCKETS WILL DETERMINE A CHAMPION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a fitting place for Game 7 of the NBA finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks and Houston Rockets both want to get to the summit, so 
they will play there. One game. Winner take all. Tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what you play for," Rocket guard Kenny Smith said. "To get to this 
position where the world's a stage." 
</P>
<P>
 The curtain goes up on Act VII because the Rockets got the most traditional of 
Father's Day gifts on Sunday, a tie. Their 86-84 victory made it a 3-3 series 
and provided only the 14th Game 7 in the 47 years of the championship series 
and the first since the Lakers beat the Detroit Pistons at the Forum in 1988. 
Then came the tough part. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The usual one-day break, in place every time except between Games 3 and 4, 
became two, because that's what NBC wanted. That meant double the practices, 
double the buildup, double the anticipation among players and in a city waiting 
for its first title beyond the World Hockey Assn. or the American Football 
League.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy," Knick Derek Harper said. "The waiting, I think, is the toughest 
part of this. I don't even like to think about it. I woke up (Tuesday) thinking 
that the game was (Tuesday night), and I think it was simply because I was 
hoping. I'm so anxious for it. I was kind of like in a daze because it seemed 
like I thought about it all night. There were times I got up in the middle of 
the night and all I could think about was the basketball game. Sooner or later, 
it'll come to an end and we'll be champions and all of this will be a lot of 
fun, to think about what you went through." 
</P>
<P>
 Said New York Coach Pat Riley: "This is the ultimate game. The seventh game is 
almost a generic phrase. The seventh game means something in all sports, except 
for football and the NCAA tournament. It's final. It's the end. It's over with. 
. . . All of us have, in our own line of work, reached down as deep as we can. 
The seventh game is the final chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying this does not have the great theater or drama of the other 
finals. They're not feeling what the players and coaches are feeling. There's 
enough theater and drama out there to last a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 The home team is 11-3 in Games 7 of the finals -- the Washington Bullets of 
1978 were the last to beat the odds -- and has won 19 Games 7 in any playoff 
series since Philadelphia won at Boston for the 1982 Eastern Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 A series thought to be devoid of any of the usual interest -- so say the TV 
ratings -- suddenly has something over so many of the others that have come 
before it. This is Game 7, something no junior skyhook by Magic Johnson at 
Boston Garden in 1987, no hail of three-pointers by Michael Jordan at Chicago 
Stadium in 1992, no series-winning basket by John Paxson at America West Arena 
in '93 can match. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fun pressure," Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "The other kind of 
pressure is you've lost eight in a row and the fans are booing you, things like 
that. This is excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Waiting is very hard. I just thank God we don't have to go through the 
national anthem as coaches. We're in the back. Just waiting and waiting and 
waiting. I'd like that we could come out and get the starters out there and 
let's go play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks played a seven-game series to beat the Bulls in the Eastern 
Conference semifinals, played a seven-game series to beat the Pacers the next 
round, and now are heading into their 107th game of the regular season and 
playoffs, a record. 
</P>
<P>
 And the person to coach the only team that won three consecutive seven-game 
series to claim the championship? Riley, with the Lakers in 1988. He has also 
coached the three most recent Games 7 of the finals, in '84 and '88 with the 
Lakers and now the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon heads into the finale easily outscoring, 27.2-19.2, and 
outshooting, 52%-35.7%, Patrick Ewing in the center showdown. But Ewing is 
averaging more rebounds, 12.8-9, and blocked shots, 4.67-4. "I think both of us 
have played well," Olajuwon said. "Both of us have risen to the occasion, 
accepted the challenge. But now what's important is which team wins the 
championship. It's bigger than individuals. It's not the battle. Now is the 
war."

MIKE PENNER: IN DAVIS' VIEW, THINGS ARE LOOKING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So our boys in faded denim stars and adidas stripes are up against it, right? 
Backs pressed to the Rose Bowl's outer barbed-wire security fence. Facing 
mighty, and mighty agitated, Colombia today, with Gheorghe Hagi the Great and 
the Romanian empire on deck Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Easier for the Americans to find a needle in Carlos Valderrama's haircut than 
to win either one of those games and advance to the World Cup's second round, 
no? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, these are times that try men's soles. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Davis, however, remembers worse. Davis remembers when he would have given 
his NASL North American Player of the Year trophy, his United States captain's 
armband and the FIFA All-Star game jersey off his back for the opportunity to 
be pummeled by the Colombians in a World Cup match, any World Cup match. 
</P>
<P>
 With the possible exception of Kyle Rote Jr., Davis ranks as the biggest name 
in the history of U.S. soccer. And Rote achieved his fame primarily for his 
uncanny ability to scale walls during the Superstars competitions of the 1970s. 
Davis was the NASL's first U.S.-born star, a starting midfielder for the 
two-time league champion New York Cosmos, and captain of the U.S. national team 
throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 He was our Franz Beckenbauer, our Johan Cruyff, though very few outside the 
narrow cult of U.S. soccer realized it. 
</P>
<P>
 This is because, in a soccer sense, Davis was also our Ernie Banks. The right 
man at the wrong time. The elite talent stranded on a wretched team. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks never played in a World Series and Davis never made it to a World Cup. 
It wasn't their fault. The Chicago Cubs of the 1950s and '60s were the U.S. 
soccer nationals of the 1980s. And vice versa. Banks and Davis deserved better, 
but where else could they go? Banks was chained to the Cubs because he played 
in the pre-free agent era. Davis was stuck, too, but even more so. He was born 
American. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose Joe Montana had been born in Bulgaria, or Joe Namath in Norway. Hard 
to reach the Super Bowl from there. Davis was born in Denver and raised in 
Claremont -- both a long ways from Manchester, England -- and from there, he 
attempted to qualify for the World Cup in 1978, 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never came close," Davis says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in over our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 For one, he says, "the U.S. team then was nowhere near as good as the team 
today. And, our preparation was horrendous. We had no training center. We were 
a vagabond team. We'd just hop on a plane and play in a qualifying game. Then 
we'd come home, wait a few weeks and do it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 For example: "If we had a qualifying game in Trinidad, typically we would fly 
into Miami, train at the University of South Florida for a few days, then hop 
on a plane, play the game, then go back to our individual homes. In a few 
weeks, we'd have another game in Canada, so we'd fly up to train in Seattle, 
then go up to Canada for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The traveling circus produced clownish results. Canada crushed the Americans 
in the 1978 playoffs, 3-0. In 1982, the U.S. team finished dead last in its 
group. In 1986, the Americans proved they could handle the Netherlands Antilles 
-- you may recall the ticker-tape parade -- but couldn't beat Costa Rica in 
their own back yard, losing the final qualifier, 1-0, in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The red, white and blue might have had a better chance, Davis muses, if they 
had played that one inside the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the NASL died in the mid-80s," Davis says, "virtually all the best 
soccer players in the U.S. were playing indoors. If we had 20 players on the 
roster, 16 of them would be playing indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, Canada and Costa Rica would be playing outdoors 10 months out of 
the year. We were at a huge disadvantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Partly due to Davis' urging, the U.S. Soccer Federation finally got its act 
together under one roof, establishing a national training center before the 
1988 Olympics. By then, knee problems were beginning to drag Davis' playing 
career to a halt, but at the same time, World Cup '90 loomed on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis viewed it as "my last shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Those ailing knees hobbled smack-dab into Bob Gansler, the newly appointed 
U.S. coach, who, according to Davis, "wanted to leave a strong impression 
immediately. He came in with guns a-blazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gansler told his team that all reputations and resumes would be checked at the 
door and the 20 roster spots would be determined solely on what Gansler 
observed from here on out. 
</P>
<P>
 No special allowance would be made for Rick Davis, NASL and MISL hero, who was 
on doctor's orders to rest a minor knee cartilage tear for a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 So Davis participated in opening drills with the other hopefuls and the knee 
began to swell. Every few days, Davis would have it drained, so he could 
continue training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 After two months of this, Davis had aggravated the knee so badly that his 
doctor ordered him off the field for five to six weeks, right in the middle of 
qualifying competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after 40 years, the United States qualified for the World Cup 
tournament, but Davis did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched that World Cup from a TV commentating booth," Davis says with a 
certain wistfulness. "It was just not meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 35 and coach-general manager for the Salsa, Davis is back in the booth for 
Cup '94, providing commentary for ABC and ESPN. He is not an impartial 
observer; Davis is pulling for American advancement to the next round, and sees 
it all hinging on Sunday's match against Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia is not a good matchup for us, and it's now in a must-win situation," 
he says. "What the U.S. needs is for Romania to beat Switzerland (today). If 
that happens and Romania is assured of advancement, they might kick back in 
that third game Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever transpires, Davis will watch, and probably wince just a bit. Davis 
calls his failure to play in a World Cup "probably the first- or second-biggest 
disappointment I had as a professional soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
 "My perspective has always been that the World Cup is it, going back to 1966 
and my first exposure to the World Cup. My father bought a couple tickets to 
the closed-circuit broadcast of the final between England and West Germany at 
the Forum and I was blown away. To me, that was the ultimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that day forward, I planned a course that would take me to the World 
Cup. From making the U.S. junior team to playing in the pros to making the 
Olympic team -- all my dreams and aspirations were geared for me to be there 
one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy it while you can, Davis would tell the young Americans. From a lack of 
experience, he can attest: Three games in the World Cup beat no games in the 
World Cup. By a country kilometer.

BLAKE'S FUTURE AS A KING APPEARS MORE IN DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prospects of defenseman Rob Blake remaining with the Kings are growing 
slimmer as he nears restricted free agency. He will become a free agent with 
compensation July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not confident he'll be back," General Manager Sam McMaster said in a 
conference call on Tuesday. "He's a concern. He's a great player. But if he's 
not back, the L.A. Kings will get something in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want Rob Blake on the hockey team, don't get me wrong. But I want Rob Blake 
where it's good for Rob Blake and the L.A. Kings." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Blake will be a Group 2 free agent, the Kings are ensured of receiving 
some form of compensation if he signs an offer sheet with another team. The 
Kings could match the offer and trade him or they could keep him. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option for the Kings is to trade Blake before he becomes a free agent. 
At issue is money. McMaster said that an offer has been made to Ron Salcer, 
Blake's agent. Blake indicated the offer is four to five years and starts at 
$1.2 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The two highest-paid defensemen in the NHL are Boston's Ray Bourque at $2.5 
million a season and Chicago's Chris Chelios at $2.2 million. The Kings' Marty 
McSorley is fifth at $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Blake is coming off his best season, 20 goals and 68 points, 
and is thought to be approaching his peak years. It would seem unlikely that 
Blake would sign for less than McSorley. 
</P>
<P>
 All will become free agents July 1. MacInnis already has turned down an offer 
of $2.5 million (Canadian). 
</P>
<P>
 Blake isn't the only player with an uncertain future. There have been the 
usual trade rumors about left wing Luc Robitaille. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Robitaille said: "I told them what I hear was that Mr. (Bruce) McNall 
used to protect me from being traded," Robitaille said of the former majority 
owner. "Now things might be different with new owners."

NEWSWIRE: TITANS' HORTON WEIGHS WASHINGTON STATE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The head baseball coaching job at Washington State is George Horton's if he 
wants it, but the Cal State Fullerton associate head coach said Tuesday he 
hasn't decided if he will accept the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said he will decide this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I will discuss it and then make a decision," Horton said. "One of 
the factors to be considered is that my wife has a great job here as an office 
supervisor for a dental group." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton has been at Fullerton four years. The Titans have reached the College 
World Series twice during that time (1992 and '94). He was head coach at 
Cerritos College six years before that, compiling a 226-53 record. LON EUBANKS

 Q: What was the most memorable or significant moment in Orange County high 
school sports this past school year? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Brea-Olinda Ladycats' State championship victory, as well as their being 
honored as national champions in high school girls' basketball, is probably the 
most outstanding event in Orange County sports this season. They won the 
national championship on the same day they won the State championship. The 
tradition continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Fullington, Brea 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "As I was filming the final game for the Southern Section Division II football 
championship game for Los Alamitos High, there was tension in the air. Could 
the title be won three times in a row? My question was answered in Huntington 
Beach's first possession, when Los Alamitos' defense, led by Marc Albert, 
Robert Torres and Steve Trammel, stopped Tony Gonzalez and the Oiler offense. 
This was a sign of things to come . . . another championship for Los Alamitos." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Pazeian, Los Alamitos teacher and coach 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us at Laguna Hills High School are very proud of Brett Nista, who has 
broken the all-time Orange County hit record. He has played varsity baseball 
since he was a freshman, and we think this is a great accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Schuerman, Laguna Hills freshman 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mater Dei vs. Crenshaw basketball game. It was a controversial game, and 
in my opinion, Mater Dei should have won. It was a greatly anticipated game and 
a big event." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Almquist, Foothill junior 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My most memorable moment is the Savanna football team's drive to its 
first-ever (Southern Section) championship. They were supposed to lose because 
Whittier was supposed to be too physical for them. Rebel pride showed through 
and Savanna was able to beat Whittier, 20-13, with a lot of heart, a lot of 
determination and the family teamwork concept they have been developing under 
(Coach) Fred DiPalma for some years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Slagle, Brea 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The most memorable moment in Orange County high school sports this year was 
the Pacifica High boys' basketball team's come-from-behind victory against St. 
Augustine High of San Diego. With 14 minutes left in the (Southern Regional 
semifinal) game, Pacifica was down by 22 points. With a barrage of accurate 
shots, the Mariners came back to win the game, 65-62. I have been to a great 
many professional, college and high school basketball games, and this game was 
the most exciting I have ever attended. Both the team and Coach Bob Becker did 
not receive anywhere near enough credit for their accomplishments this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Spencer, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "My memorable moment is going up to the State high school wrestling meet this 
year. It was really a rude awakening for us as a team because last year when we 
went, people were rooting for us when we won. But when we got up there this 
year, our wrestlers were being booed; people said they hated us. Whenever one 
of our guys was booed, the crowd would just go ecstatic and cheer. We couldn't 
believe how, in one year's time, it changed and how much hatred there was 
toward our school." 
</P>
<P>
 Jed Clark, Calvary Chapel junior 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never forget Friday, Feb. 11, when the Valencia boys' basketball team 
beat Magnolia, 42-40, for a share of the Orange League championship. It's the 
third championship in 60 years. I can't wait to see the banner hanging in the 
gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Miele, Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest sporting moment in Orange County this year was Demitrius Zeigler 
of University winning the boys' basketball scoring title for the second 
straight year." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Blackburn, University sophomore 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Costa Mesa girls' swim team had a great year. The team had only eight 
girls compared to an average high school team of 30 to 50 girls. Mesa's 200 
relay team of Elizabeth Christiansen, Leslie Christiansen, Katie Grogan and 
Colleen Lund broke the school record four times and qualified for the Southern 
Section Division III consolation finals at Belmont Plaza pool with a time of 
1:47.49." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Lund, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa Weaver of the Woodbridge High School girls' basketball team, who, after 
tearing her anterior cruciate ligament in practice, came back within less than 
a week and went up to Oakland to play in the State championships. It took quite 
a bit of guts, courage and control for her to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Howard Marans, Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest Orange County sports moment had to be when the University 
wrestling team (unranked in the county) battled back to tie a heavily favored 
Irvine team (ranked second in Division III at the time), 27-27." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Leung, University senior 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The interception by Joshua Holland of Huntington Beach in the Edison game. 
When Joshua intercepted the pass, it stopped Edison's drive, which possibly 
could have won the game. His interception resulted in Huntington Beach beating 
Edison, 10-7."

PREP VOICES; GAME'S THE SAME, BUT NOT THE LEVEL OF COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before joining The Times Orange County prep sports staff in March, I covered 
high school sports in the San Fernando Valley, the South Bay and Ventura 
County. And while I have written about talented athletes in each of my previous 
stops, the level of play in this county is unlike anything I had previously 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew about the baseball talent developed in the county each year, but I had 
no idea there are also so many gifted athletes throughout the other sports 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 For a basketball nut such as myself, the action in the county is as good as 
watching some college teams -- better in some cases. Brea-Olinda finished first 
in the final USA Today girls' poll, and Mater Dei was ranked highly throughout 
the season in the boys' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll gladly watch Nicole Erickson of Brea-Olinda handle the ball on a fast 
break, or Miles Simon of Mater Dei nail a three-pointer after rolling off a 
screen. Trust me, that beats writing about point guards who dribble balls off 
their legs on six straight possessions and centers who throw rebounds over 
backboards. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen it happen -- a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the support base is also the strongest I've encountered. In 
some of the areas I used to cover, it was odd to see filled stands at the 
so-called "major" sporting events such as baseball, basketball and football, 
let alone the minor sports. In these parts, however, it's odd not to see scores 
of enthusiastic friends, parents and relatives cheering on competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the facilities I have seen are also excellent. Even at the older 
campuses, gymnasiums and stadiums are well maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think prep sports are the same all over. I now know otherwise.

PREP VOICES; SPORTS YEARBOOK FILLED WITH ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As valedictorians across Orange County speak of facing the future in their 
high school graduation addresses, it's time to take a look back at the people, 
events and issues that helped make 1993-94 a memorable year in county high 
school sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Few prep sports fans are likely to forget the accomplishments of the 
Brea-Olinda girls' basketball team, which won a record fifth State title and 
fourth consecutive.Or Los Alamitos' football team, which extended its unbeaten 
streak to 35 games while winning its third consecutive Southern Section 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the athletic feats of Huntington Beach's Tony Gonzalez, who will play 
football and basketball at California next season. Or Foothill's Tara 
Oettinger, who led the county's track and field contingent with top marks in 
four events and was the state's long jump champion. Or Marcy Crouch, who was a 
central figure in Marina's girls' soccer and softball titles. 
</P>
<P>
 County schools won 37 section titles and six State titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But memories from a high school sports season are limited only by the number 
of people taking it all in. So we asked readers to share their most memorable 
or significant moments of 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of The Times Orange County prep sports staff also have their memories 
about the people, events and issues that made the greatest impression on them 
in the last 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a very good year.

PREP VOICES; LADYCATS RIDE TWO WORDS TO EMOTIONAL HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The room exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was set off by such a little comment, barely above a whisper, from Lee 
Moulin's mom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pickerington lost." 
</P>
<P>
 The two words sent Brea-Olinda's girls' basketball team into hysterics -- and 
to the top of the USA Today national girls' basketball poll. Brea, No. 1 in the 
nation, proved that it doesn't always happen to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportswriters aren't supposed to root for winners and losers. Typically, we 
root for stories. Brea's unbeaten State championship run was a good story. It 
was the Ladycats' fourth in a row and fifth in six years. It galvanized Nicole 
Erickson's position as an Orange County legend -- four years as a starter, four 
years as a State champion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy to understand why she jumped out of her chair inside the Oakland 
Coliseum Arena interview room, yelling "I told you all, I told you all," and 
then crumpled to the floor in tears as her teammates bounded up and down, 
knowing that the loss by Pickerington of Ohio was Brea's gain by one position 
in the poll. 
</P>
<P>
 They bounced off the walls in their elation. All except Susan Rhodabarger, who 
sat in her chair, stunned. Coach John Hattrup walked over and whispered 
something in her ear, no doubt about how proud he was of all she had 
accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a celebration in front of grown men and women who were there to record 
what happened on the court, and it was a celebration that made the on-court 
jubilation outside, in front of their fans, timid by comparison.

PREP VOICES; LOS ALAMITOS, PACIFICA SET THE PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love a good fast break, and this season I saw some great ones . . . in two 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 There were the obvious favorites in basketball, such as watching Mater Dei's 
Schea Cotton soar for an alley-oop slam off a perfect assist from Miles Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Santa Margarita's Brad Finneran making a no-look, over-the-shoulder pass to 
his twin brother, Brian, for an easy layup. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Alamitos introduced me to fast-break football. 
</P>
<P>
 Using its no-huddle, run-and-shoot-type offense, the Griffins beat their 
opponents by an average score of 39-7.  
</P>
<P>
 And the Griffins capped the season by blitzing previously undefeated 
Huntington Beach, 39-21, in the Southern Section Division II championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Mike Good passed for 403 yards and four touchdowns as Los Alamitos 
amassed 554 yards in the victory, which gave the Griffins their third 
consecutive section championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos' title was the perfect lead-in to basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica took the up-tempo mentality to the extreme, and rode it all the way 
to a section championship and a spot in the State Division III championship 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Coach Bob Becker, the Mariners' full-court pressure defense harassed, 
harried and hurried opponents. Becker used as many as 12 players in the first 
quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners rallied from double-digit second-half deficits in the Southern 
California regional playoffs twice and trailed at halftime before defeating San 
Dimas to win the section Division III-A title. 
</P>
<P>
 Two championships. One expected, one unexpected. Both frantic.

PREP VOICES; HAVE FUN, MONARCHS, YOU WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's fable, kids, is the tortoise and the hare. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the old story, but with a twist. This time the hare wakes up and wins, 
then pouts about the closeness of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time in a Pond, Mater Dei and Edison were playing for the Southern 
Section Division I boys' basketball championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as everyone knows, Mater Dei has a sleek and fast program. The Monarchs, 
after all, had won eight section titles in 11 years heading into the season. 
They collect some of the best players in Southern California and unleash them 
on lesser teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs were undefeated heading into the playoffs and considered the 
second-best team in the nation by one highly subjective poll. Safe to say no 
one in Orange County could run with them -- figuratively or literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison? Well, the Chargers plodded through the Sunset League, finishing 
fourth. They worked their way through the playoffs, with one upset after 
another. The end of the line was the championship game. No matter how well the 
Chargers played, they were not going to win this game. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, some thought Mater Dei could send out its junior varsity and still win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, as expected, took a big lead in the final quarter, then fell 
asleep. By the time they awoke, the Chargers were on their tail. Twice in the 
final minute, Edison pulled to within four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs held on for a 65-59 victory, thanks to Miles Simon's free-throw 
shooting. But there was no celebrating on the winning side. 
</P>
<P>
 No, instead, Monarch players were in a funk. They sat, heads bowed, as if they 
were ashamed of the victory. Center Shaun Jackson looked as if someone had run 
over his puppy. Later, the team got a good tongue-lashing in the locker room 
from Coach Gary McKnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison players, meanwhile, were jubilant even in defeat. They had run stride 
for stride with one of the best programs in the nation. Their coach, Larry 
Hirst, praised his players. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of this story: Hey, have some fun . . . even when you win.

PREP VOICES; COMING TO TERMS WITH 'ATHLETES OF THE WEEK OF THE YEAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a friend who is always begging to be named Orange County's athlete of 
the week. The award is picked by the prep staff, but this friend knows that as 
the one responsible for writing the feature, I usually make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 His pitch goes something like this: "I went surfing in the morning. Then I 
rode my bike 30 miles. Later I finished off the day by windsurfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you should seriously consider me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Very impressive, Dave," I tell him. "But there's one problem. You're not in 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
 We have our standards, but there's no standard way to determine who should get 
this sort of honor. We can only hope to make it fair. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it was enlightening to look back at who received the award this 
year and what schools they attend. As you might expect, traditionally 
successful schools were represented the most: Edison (five), Corona del Mar 
(five), Fountain Valley (four), Los Alamitos (four) and Marina (four). 
</P>
<P>
 But we try to spread it around a bit and more than half of the high schools in 
the county (45) had a player honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two athletes -- Carrie Garritson of Buena Park (cross-country and track) 
and Marie Philman of Edison (twice in basketball) -- were picked twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable omissions were Mater Dei's Miles Simon and Brea-Olinda's Nicole 
Erickson, the best basketball players in the county two seasons in a row. They 
were unfortunately penalized because their teams were so dominant that giving 
one of them the award seemed like overkill. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, we're suckers for the underdog.  
</P>
<P>
 Pitch a perfect game in baseball, strike out 20 in a softball game, set a 
national swimming record, make free throws in the final seconds to win a 
basketball game -- those are the types of accomplishments that'll get you this 
award. 
</P>
<P>
 But who -- in my opinion -- are the two "athletes of the week of the year"? 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of strong candidates, Philman's clutch fourth-quarter 
performances led her team to victories over two ranked teams in a week and Los 
Alamitos quarterback Mike Good passed for 403 yards and four touchdowns in a 
victory over Huntington Beach in a section title game. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't think anyone can beat Cypress running back Greg Cleave, who rushed 
for 296 yards in only 12 carries and scored four touchdowns, including one with 
a minute left in the game that gave the Centurions a 34-34 tie with Katella. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara Oettinger of Foothill is my pick for girls' athlete of the week of the 
year. She won four events -- the long jump, the 100, 200 and 400 meters -- at 
the Orange County Championships and her mark in each ranks in the top five in 
meet history. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, she and Cleave are high school students.

NO TWILIGHT ON SEASON; NIGHTTIME FISHING OFF TO GREAT START AS SAND BASS CAUGHT 
BY THE HUNDREDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun sets slowly over the Palos Verdes Peninsula, coloring the sky 
crimson-orange. A fading Long Beach skyline is to the east, a shimmering sea 
with boats rolling over gentle swells to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't paint a picture like that," says a large man in jeans and a blue 
jacket, gazing over the bow of the Matt Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the boat have to agree, but on this night their idea of a really 
good view is one of an angry fish being gaffed by the deckhand, plucked from 
the sea and stuffed into a gunny sack. 
</P>
<P>
 They shelled out $20 apiece to create such a scene, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand bass, the primary target of nighttime fishermen, have been plopping over 
the rails of Southland party boats by the hundreds almost every night since the 
twilight fishing season began Memorial Day weekend. Barracuda have even gotten 
into the act, slashing baits, bending rods and -- when they run out of fight -- 
hitting the decks like silver torpedoes in the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only missed (good fishing) one night," says Todd Phillips, 23, a 2 
1/2-year veteran skipper of the 65-foot Matt Walsh, which has carried 51 
anglers from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing to an area off Seal Beach. "We've had 
counts of up to 400 sand bass almost every night. Last year I don't think we 
caught 100 sand bass in the first three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With sand bass congregating off the Southland coast, as they usually do in the 
spring, and with the twilight fishing season off to its best start in years, 
primarily for landings south of Santa Monica Bay, fishermen have been quick to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Business has been as brisk as the westerly wind that blows over the nighttime 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Many boats are carrying as many as 70 anglers -- in the middle of the week. 
And some landings have had to use backup boats to handle the weekend demand. At 
an average cost of $20 for a four- to six-hour trip that generally begins at 
5:30 or 6, and with the less competitive atmosphere associated with twilight 
trips, many find it an ideal way to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relaxing trip," says James Tani, manager of Long Beach Sportfishing. 
"It gives people a chance to get out of the hot weather, especially people who 
live inland. And we are catching a lot of fish now, so that and the comfort 
make for a nice time." 
</P>
<P>
 Wen Li, 27, a Torrance resident who works in El Monte as an engineer, says he 
took the trip aboard the Matt Walsh merely "because it's a good break away from 
the pressure of work." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominic Chemello, 50, a Temecula resident making his fourth such excursion 
this spring, says he prefers the twilight trips because he doesn't have to miss 
any work. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sometimes only gives me about four hours' sleep, but that's OK," says 
Chemello, a Federal Aviation Administration employee. "Plus, the fishing is 
better than it is during the day. We get here (at the landing), see the people 
coming off the (day) boat with their long faces, and we go out and just kill 
them. We've done it three nights in a row now." 
</P>
<P>
 Daytime fishermen will argue that fishing is not always better at night, that 
nighttime fishermen don't usually catch the larger game fish. But there is no 
arguing that when a good sand bass bite gets going, there's no easier way to 
fill a sack with something that not only puts up a decent fight on light 
tackle, but tastes good breaded or basted with butter and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something anybody can catch," says Bob Alvarez, who spent the night 
aboard the Matt Walsh filming for an episode on twilight fishing for a local 
cable television station. "You don't need $100 or even much experience. There's 
a guy over there fishing with a broken rod and he's catching them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darkness has long since fallen and the faraway lights on the coast are 
aglitter. Those on the nearby boats and offshore oil rigs are blinding. One 
angler insists that one of the rigs is a cruise ship, moving closer. Then, 
having downed a red plastic cup full of soda, and whatever else he might have 
added, he forgets about any oncoming ships, baits his hook and drops it to the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 He gets a hit almost immediately, and a minute or so later heaves a large 
barracuda over the rail. The hook pops loose from the fish and sinks into his 
finger. Showing no pain, he cuts off the barb, removes the hook and resumes 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The action has picked up considerably, though few of the sand bass are much 
over the legal size of 12 inches -- well below the three- to five-pound average 
of previous nights and nowhere near the state record of nearly 12 pounds. Even 
fewer of the barracuda are the mandatory 28 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, tired of watching tiny barracuda being bounced over the rail and 
concerned about their ability to survive the ordeal once thrown back into the 
ocean, takes care of that by making a quick move north to an area off Long 
Beach, where there had been an excellent late-night bite on previous trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The move proves successful. The anchovies, sacrificial lambs through all of 
this, what with the hooks in their sides and lead sinkers putting them smack in 
the middle of schools of hungry game fish, don't stand a chance. They are 
inhaled within seconds after hitting bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill McCauley, 16, of Lomita, has put several legal-size sand bass aboard 
within minutes while fishing from the bow. Larry Fukuhara, an avid fisherman 
and a marine biologist with the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro, has done 
the same at the port stern. Dan Stanton, a former skipper and now a part-time 
employee at L.A. Harbor Sportfishing, is showing his expertise in the middle of 
the boat by reeling in a barracuda and a sand bass -- on one hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about that," Stanton says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Li, his rod bent at the starboard bow, the large man in jeans and blue jacket 
looking on, eventually heaves a four-pound bass onto the deck. Li is nearing 
his 10-fish limit of sand bass and is about halfway there with barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even like fish," he says. "But I have a friend at work who will take 
it, no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 A huge barracuda is bounced over the port rail, a sand bass at least as big as 
Li's is landed by a woman at the stern, Fukuhara pulls up a six- or 
seven-pounder that will soon earn him jackpot honors. A few hundred fish have 
been landed, a few hundred more released. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, realizing he is overdoing it a bit in his quest for success, finally 
says it's time to quit and go home. He fires up the Matt Walsh and gives the 
estimated time of arrival as 1:20 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The passengers, many of whom have to work in a few hours, can't believe it's 
so late. But then, they have been busy enjoying the view.

BUYUKUNCU SURFACES AMONG PREP SWIMMING'S FINEST

 As in past years, Orange County demonstrated that some of the best swimmers in 
the state and the nation are going to school behind the Orange Curtain. County 
athletes flexed their aquatic muscles in all three divisions of the Southern 
Section championships at Belmont Plaza, where many placed in final and 
consolation heats. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's boys powered through the South Coast season and section 
competition, winning league and Division I titles. And though they didn't have 
the big-name swimmers Woodbridge had, the Diablos' strength was their depth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Hills boys finished second in Division II and might have won the 
championship a second consecutive year had they placed a swimmer in the 
breaststroke final. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong Irvine girls' team finished runner-up to Walnut at the Division III 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was really the individual accomplishments that made this swim season 
special. 
</P>
<P>
 The big names from the powerful South Coast and Sea View leagues dominated the 
field but didn't overshadow some great individual performances by Los Alamitos' 
Tim Haney, Kennedy's brother-sister tandem of Tim and Wendy Martin and Laguna 
Hills' Mark Kwok. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomores seemed to be the operative word in the girls' competition, with 
Irvine's Wendy O'Brien and El Toro's Katie Lowes leading the way. Other 
noteworthy swimmers were Capistrano Valley's Cathy Carone, Kennedy's Wendy 
Martin, Santa Ana Valley's Amber Wines and El Toro's Katie Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of good swimming to be found among the boys, too, but the 
season belonged to Woodbridge's Derya Buyukuncu. 
</P>
<P>
 At the section finals, the Turkish star came away with three records, 
including one in the 100 backstroke, where he broke his national record set 
last year at the same meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, Buyukuncu will attend Michigan. Those who had the chance to see 
him swim will remember it for a long time, but not as long, perhaps, as his 
records will stand.

COUPLE CENTERPIECES END A SENSATIONAL SEASON

 Center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Center of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that was the case at a couple of season-ending baseball games this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 As prep sports editor, I usually stay behind the scenes, working in our office 
in Costa Mesa, and don't get to see as many athletic events as I'd like. 
</P>
<P>
 But I made a point to watch Katella's Jaret Wright pitch at least once this 
season, and that was enough to see why he was a first-round pick in the recent 
amateur baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
 I also saw Fountain Valley's 3-2 victory over Lakewood in the Southern Section 
Division I championship game before a full house at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
Cal-Hi sports recently called it the "high school baseball game of the year." I 
couldn't imagine a better one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a dream-come-true ending for the top-ranked Barons, who took the lead 
for good when Geoff Wilson stole home in the bottom of the sixth. But they had 
to survive a nightmare in the seventh, when, with two outs and runners on first 
and second, Lakewood's Art Martinez lined a 1-2 pitch into center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Roman fielded the ball on one bounce as Lakewood's Matt Dempsey rounded 
third base. Roman's throw home was strong and arrived at the same time as 
Dempsey. Catcher Dan Hoppie held onto the ball despite the collision and 
Fountain Valley began its celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta's 3-1 victory over West Torrance in the Division III game the next 
night at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Field also was thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Livernois pitched a three-hit gem, but he had his hands full in the top of 
the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance loaded the bases with two outs. Derek Nicholson, who had the 
Warriors' only run batted in, hit a monstrous line drive to center field that 
appeared to be uncatchable. But La Quinta's Anibal Delacruz ended the game with 
a running, stretching, backhanded catch near the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 An ecstatic fan said only Delacruz, among the Aztecs, could have made that 
catch. 
</P>

 Wills has been credited with single-handedly reviving the art of stealing 
bases.The 50 he stole in 1960, his first full season in the majors, were the 
most by anyone in three decades. When he shattered a 47-year-old record by 
stealing 104 in 1962, it was considered such a feat that some baseball experts 
wrongly predicted it would never be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Wills retired after the 1972 season, but his 490 steals as a Dodger remain a 
club record. At 61, he owns Maury Wills Cellular, a Carson company that sells 
car phones and pagers. He also works as a free-lance base-stealing coach for 
the Dodgers and other major league teams.

 One of the original Los Angeles Angels, "Satch" was known more for his 
versatility in the field than for his prowess at the plate.He played every 
infield position for the club before landing the starting job as catcher in 
1968, but was traded to Boston in 1969 and retired after the 1970 season with a 
lifetime .225 average.

 Satriano, 53, owns an accounting firm in Brentwood. His son, Nick, played

California and now pitches for the Colorado Silver Bullets, the all-woman 
professional team.

 Thirty years ago, editors of the nation's sports sections had a simple task: 
Report the results of professional and college games -- maybe throw in a little 
golf or tennis or track and field on the side -- and do so in an entertaining 
fashion. This was done by white males, and targeted for them. 
</P>
<P>
 But when 135 members of the Associated Press Sports Editors gather beginning 
today at the Dana Point Resort for their 21st national convention, the 3 
1/2-day program will include sessions and workshops on an assault conspiracy 
case involving women's figure skaters; a sensational double murder case 
centering on a revered football hero; diversifying both staffs and readership; 
sexual harassment in the newsroom, and communicating more effectively with 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be discussions of writing, reporting and editing, and social 
functions. But the days when those were the dominant activities at an APSE 
convention are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports sections used to just go about presenting your typical menu of 
baseball, basketball and football and a bunch of local names," said Paul Anger, 
sports editor of the Miami Herald, first vice president of APSE and the 
convention's program chairman. "Now there are more sports and issues to cover 
and an increasingly diverse readership. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no such thing as a pat formula for producing a sports section 
anymore. What's going to work in Miami isn't going to work in Kansas City; 
what's going to work in Los Angeles might not work in Washington, D.C." 
</P>
<P>
 The convention, with The Times Orange County Edition as the primary sponsor, 
will be making its second Southern California appearance. It was in Santa 
Monica in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 APSE was formed in the early 1970s by editors who were tired of the perception 
that they ran the newspaper's "toy department" and were seeking ways to make 
their sections better and more ethical. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has since grown to more than 550 members. 
</P>
<P>
 "APSE has increased awareness of ethical standards among sports editors and 
reporters," said Dale Bye, the organization's outgoing president and sports 
editor of the Kansas City Star. "It has raised the issues of diversity, both in 
staff hiring practices and in coverage and readership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it has just raised the standard for sports journalism in general." 
</P>
<P>
 But the strides made have been mirrored by an increasingly complicated set of 
stories to cover; editors have had to keep running just to stay in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Among this week's panels: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Pursuit of Tonya Harding: The session will focus on tactics used by 
reporters and editors in the wake of an attack on Nancy Kerrigan by men close 
to her figure skating rival, Harding. Some steps taken -- such as a small group 
of reporters calling up Harding's personal computer message list at the 1994 
Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway -- have sparked debate within APSE. Mike 
Moran, director of public information and media relations for the U.S. Olympic 
Committee, is certain to take issue with some of the actions taken. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two discussions on diversity, one as it relates to hiring and the other to 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A last-minute session, set for Saturday, to discuss the O.J. Simpson murder 
case and the coverage of it. Panelists will include Leo Wolinsky, Los Angeles 
Times metro editor, and Steve Bisheff, Orange County Register sports columnist. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson, outspoken former coach of the two-time Super Bowl champion 
Dallas Cowboys, will make Thursday's keynote address. Johnson recently left the 
Cowboys and will go to work for the Fox network as an NFL analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the APSE will honor Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Dave Anderson 
with the Red Smith Award, named after Anderson's late colleague at the New York 
Times. The award, given to an individual who has made major contributions to 
sports journalism, was first won by Smith in 1981. Los Angeles Times columnist 
Jim Murray won the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's career has spanned 43 years; he has been a New York Times columnist 
since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Convention sessions will be covered and presented in a daily report by this 
year's members of the Freedom Forum Sports Journalism Institute, an intern 
program designed to attract students -- particularly minorities and women -- to 
print sports journalism.

CSUN'S TORGESON TO QUIT, TAKE SACRAMENTO JOB; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: MATADOR COACH 
PLANNING TO LEAVE AFTER 30-YEAR AFFILIATION WITH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Gary Torgeson, the winningest coach in Cal State Northridge history, said 
Tuesday that he plans to leave the school and accept an offer to become a dean 
at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, who has been Northridge's softball coach the past 13 seasons and led 
the Matadors to the Women's College World Series final last month, will assume 
his post in the health, physical education and recreation department in August, 
pending the endorsement of Sacramento's board of trustees at a July 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval for the hire is considered a formality, but Torgeson said Tuesday 
afternoon that he would not comment on the situation until his hiring becomes 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many things up in the air," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earlier in the day Torgeson confirmed that he has been offered the 
position and that he has conditionally accepted, news that shocked one top 
returning player. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're kidding," said pitcher Kathy Blake, a 1993 All-American who has a year 
of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing to compose herself while fighting back tears, Blake added: "I'm sorry. 
I'm a little upset right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, 51, had 644 coaching victories at Northridge -- eight in three 
seasons as the school's head football coach and 636 in 13 years with the 
Matador softball team. Including his time as a student and assistant coach, he 
has been associated with Northridge the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What separated Gary from the rest is that he's been a great judge of talent, 
a great recruiter and a coach who knows the type of athlete he wants in his 
program, and has been able to go out and find them," said Bob Hiegert, 
Northridge's athletic director. "He's done just a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Torgeson's most successful softball campaigns was his last. In only its 
fourth NCAA Division I season, Northridge posted a record of 52-10, won its 
second consecutive Western Athletic Conference championship and finished second 
in the nation, losing, 4-0, to top-ranked Arizona in the NCAA Division I title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Football was Torgeson's first love. An offensive lineman, he was the Matadors' 
first four-year football letterman and, by age 31, was the school's fourth head 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after being fired from that position, Torgeson chose to remain on the 
football staff as offensive line coach, a position he held until taking over 
the softball program in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 The softball program's immediate success helped ease the bitter disappointment 
Torgeson experienced after failing as football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made an impact," Torgeson said recently, the day after the Matadors 
downed Cal State Fullerton in the West Regional final before a large and 
boisterous crowd at Northridge. "Finally I feel like maybe I've left a notch 
here for the university." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson's softball teams won or shared nine consecutive California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. championships from 1982-90. At the NCAA Division II level, the 
Matadors won four national championships and placed worse than third in the 
nation only once during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's winning ways continued with barely a pause once the school 
stepped up to Division I competition. The Matadors had a 34-32 record in 1991, 
a 45-25 mark in '92, then made their first trip to Oklahoma City for softball's 
World Series during a 48-9-1 campaign the following season. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson's softball players had a reputation for being as tough and brash as 
they were talented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary likes to win, and he was willing to do whatever it took to do it," said 
Marjorie Wright, coach at Fresno State, Northridge's rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will not begin a search for another coach until Sacramento 
officially hires Torgeson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go forward until he gets that rubber stamp," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever takes over for him, the old coach will be missed. "He put a lot of 
trust and belief in me," said Blake, whom Torgeson discovered at tiny Paso 
Robles High. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Sherman, Northridge's top assistant, is expected to be among those 
receiving close consideration for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Tim Kiernan, Sacramento City's softball coach and a longtime friend 
of Torgeson, said a group of coaches is eagerly awaiting the arrival of their 
new boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done so much for Northridge over the years," Kiernan said. "Shoot, 
everything he's done has been tremendous. The staff here is sure excited about 
having him. Gary is so high energy. That's something our department needs."

TALK OF LIFE AND DEATH IN THE WAKE OF FATAL SAUGUS CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of a vintage midget-car driver during a racing exhibition Saturday 
night at Saugus Speedway has left fans, officials and racing veterans at the 
55-year-old race track contemplating some troubling questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Grosso, 67, of Van Nuys, a founding member of the Western Racing Assn., 
was participating in an eight-lap demonstration race during intermission when 
his 1952 Edmunds Midget collided with a stalled vehicle on the main 
straightaway. Grosso, whose car flipped during the accident, was airlifted to 
UCLA Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:45 a.m. Sunday, 
according to a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 An examination is expected to be conducted within the next few days to 
determine the exact cause of death, according to an L.A. County coroner 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Grosso, who apparently did not see the vehicle in front of him 
until it was too late, suffered cuts and lacerations, including a serious 
injury to his right arm, which appeared to be nearly severed. Paramedics raised 
a white sheet on the track retaining wall to shield Grosso from spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of blood," Saugus promoter Ray Wilkings said. "When I was on 
the track, I don't think he was conscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Fatalities, although rare, are an inherent and widely accepted reality in auto 
racing. But visitors to Saugus, a one-third-mile paved oval in which typical 
speeds are far lower than those achieved on larger, more prominent NASCAR 
tracks, are virtual strangers to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an eerie feeling about it," said Pro Stock points leader Scott 
Dinger of Simi Valley, who did not witness the crash but heard "a tremendous 
impact" in the pit area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all aware of how serious he was injured," Dinger said. "But no one 
thought he was going to die. We were going to sign a picture and take it over 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkings, who began working in the track's concession stands in 1966, said 
Grosso's death is the sixth fatality he is aware of at Saugus -- not all 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something we like to keep track of," Wilkings said. "It's always a 
shock. You don't like to see anything like this happen. We all mourn the 
situation. But it's something that does happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent death at Saugus, by Wilkings' recollection, occurred sometime 
during the late 1970s, when a car jumped a wall, tumbled down an embankment and 
struck a track official. A similar accident claimed the life of a racing 
mechanic a few years earlier. Another fatality occurred when a piece of flying 
debris struck a spectator, who died about a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Phipps, 46, of Simi Valley, three-time defending Grand American Modified 
champion and one of the most successful drivers in track history, said he can 
count on one hand the number of deaths that have occurred at Saugus since he 
began watching races from the stands in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps, an enthusiastic historian of Saugus racing, recalled as most shocking 
an accident in 1969 in which a driver was killed during a practice session. 
</P>
<P>
 "His throttle stuck, and he crashed into the wall off the back straightaway," 
Phipps said. "That's the worst I ever heard of." 
</P>
<P>
 Phipps, who also has won three Sportsman titles at Saugus since he began 
racing in 1980, witnessed the accident involving Grosso. Like many observers, 
Phipps labeled the crash "a freak accident." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really tough to see in front of you when you're driving on the outside 
lane, which is something I do a lot," Phipps said. "He came around, and it 
looked like his vision had been blocked. The worst possible circumstances 
happened. The poor guy had nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 13-year-old WRA participate in about 14 demonstration races at 
tracks throughout California, according to Dan Fleisher, president of the 
association. The vintage vehicles, precursors to the modern-day midget race 
cars that typically run on dirt oval tracks throughout the West Coast, are kept 
as true to the era of the 1940s and '50s in which they competed, Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vintage cars' performance Saturday night accented a program that included 
Saugus' annual visit by the United States Auto Club's Midget series. 
</P>
<P>
 The vintage midgets "almost never" are involved in accidents, Fleisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything along these lines happens very infrequently," Fleisher said. "I 
don't mean (just) a flip and a death. I mean any kind of a spin." 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of services, a gathering of Grosso's friends will take place Friday 
night in Burbank in accordance with the driver's wishes, Fleisher said. Dinger 
and Phipps, neither of whom has suffered a serious racing injury, said they 
don't fear dying in a race car. That's what most drivers say.

WESTLAKE ENJOYS TASTE OF WORLD CUP; SOCCER: FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEAMMATES RELISH 
ROLES OF WYNALDA, JONES ON U.S. TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Eric Wynalda hooked the free kick over the Swiss human barrier, sending 
the ball on a 28-yard flight into the net just under the crossbar and barely 
inside the left post for a spectacular goal, American soccer fans everywhere 
celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether at the Pontiac Silverdome, where the shot that gave the United States 
a 1-1 tie with Switzerland in a World Cup match Saturday sent fans into a 
cheering frenzy, or in front of television sets around the world, it was a 
magnificent moment for U.S. soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps no one besides Wynalda's family rejoiced more than the guys who 
played with him and U.S. teammate Cobi Jones at Westlake High in the late 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a goal," Wally Androski said. "It's the goal of the tournament so far, 
as far as I'm concerned. That's probably the most important goal he'll ever 
score. It was an unbelievable shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Androski, a blackjack dealer in Las Vegas, knows Wynalda and Jones well. He 
was an inside right halfback and captain of the powerful Westlake team that 
posted a 22-2-2 record in the 1986-87 season and reached the semifinals of the 
Southern Section 4-A Division playoffs. Wynalda, a senior, was the most feared 
striker in the section. Jones, a junior midfielder, was becoming a fine 
playmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other former Westlake teammates, Androski, who later played at UC 
Santa Barbara, was watching at home when Wynalda scored against Switzerland. 
The goal sparked memories of their time together in high school, when Wynalda 
was honing the skills many thought would take him far in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Wynalda, you knew he was going to do something (in soccer)," Androski 
said. "It was almost expected. With Cobi, he blossomed after high school (at 
UCLA) and became a real good player. He is a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 That Wynalda became a heralded player at San Diego State and more recently 
with Saarbruecken of the prestigious German Bundesliga and the U.S. team wasn't 
a surprise for Brett Potter, a Westlake teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric always had that desire that would take him the full distance. Eric was 
Mr. Soccer," said Potter, who works for a publishing company in Camarillo. 
"Cobi is a big surprise to me. But when he got to UCLA, (Coach) Sigi (Schmid) 
turned him into a serious player." 
</P>
<P>
 Another player from that Westlake team is Chris Volk, a goalie who joined 
Wynalda at San Diego State and now plays for the Las Vegas Dustdevils in the 
Continental Indoor Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric would talk about taking soccer to the highest level and I never doubted 
he would." Volk said. "Perseverance is one of his best qualities. A lot of 
people are a little astonished that Cobi is playing at this level, but I don't 
think I've ever met anyone who works harder than Cobi." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Westlake Coach Mike Williams, who was in his first season with the 
Warriors in 1986-87, has been following the careers of Wynalda and Jones since 
their days in youth leagues. Williams coached at Westlake for five seasons and 
now works for a security company. He will be at the Rose Bowl today when the 
United States meets Colombia, and also was among the more than 91,000 who saw 
the U.S. beat Mexico, 1-0, in a tuneup in Pasadena on June 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brought tears to my eyes in the game against Mexico when I saw Eric 
pumping up the players on the sidelines," Williams said. "That was one of the 
things I tried to motivate him to do, to be more of a leader. He has learned 
that lesson finally." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that the 1986-87 Westlake team was not only immensely talented, 
but also united in purpose. He noted that Wynalda, who gained a reputation for 
cockiness and seemed content to nurture the image, caused no problems at 
Westlake. Jones was the epitome of a team player, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had more fun with that team than any other team I've ever coached," 
Williams said. "There wasn't a game we didn't have pizza afterward at 
somebody's house and watched a video of the game. . . . Eric had a bad rap, 
worse than he ever deserved. Cobi was a delight to coach. The Cobi I remember 
from high school was good-natured and always laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 The current Cobi, the one depicted in a new cartoon strip by former U.S. 
teammate Desmond Armstrong, sports short dreadlocks that make him instantly 
recognizable. He still flashes a contagious smile. And the midfielder, who 
replaced Ernie Stewart for the last 10 minutes of the match against 
Switzerland, still possesses some of the qualities that endeared him to 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called him 'The Weeble,' " Williams said. "That was an old toy that would 
fall down and spring back up again. You could knock Cobi down at full speed and 
he would be up right away and never miss a step." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Wynalda. He has become a respected player whose stature continues 
to grow in Germany and at the international level. 
</P>
<P>
 And he remembers his roots. Many friends will be rooting for him and Jones 
today, and some, like Walt Androski, will attend the match. Androski is Wally's 
father and Wynalda's former club coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had bought tickets to all the first-round games but Eric got us some other 
tickets," Androski said. "Eric did such a nice thing and remembered his old 
coach." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe the old coach will get to see his pupil or Jones provide more 
heroics against the Colombians today. Although, for Potter, matching or 
improving on the goal Wynalda scored Saturday would be nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mouth dropped," he said. "That was the perfect ball. It was a phenomenal 
shot. We need more shots like that to put America on the (soccer) map." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Wynalda and Jones, Westlake already has a place on that map.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; RELUCTANT RELIEVER IS A REAL 
SELF-STARTER 
</P>

<P>
 Jamie Darnell's problem is he has become too good at relief pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually enjoy it, but sometimes I don't because I know I don't get as much 
recognition," said Darnell, a reliever for the Van Nuys West American Legion 
team. "And I know colleges look for starters and not relievers." 
</P>
<P>
 Darnell is also unlike most high school relief pitchers, who play other 
positions, then come in late to hold a lead. Darnell is only a pitcher. All he 
does is sit on the bench and wait for his chance, which usually comes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually get in, unless the starter is throwing a no-hitter or a shutout," 
Darnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darnell, a right-hander who just graduated from Birmingham High, has pitched 
in six of Van Nuys West's eight games so far. He has thrown 26 innings, all in 
relief, and posted a 2.08 earned-run average. On Sunday, he threw seven 
scoreless innings in relief, picking up the decision in Van Nuys West's 7-6, 
14-inning victory against Granada Hills West. 
</P>
<P>
 For Birmingham this spring, Darnell appeared in 22 games -- 21 in relief -- 
and pitched 57 1/3 innings. He was 5-2 with a 2.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still says he'd rather start. Mike Challgren, his Legion coach, 
considered starting him today, but pitching seven innings Sunday might change 
those plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I will start," Darnell said. "He said just to keep my arm 
loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is pretty much standard procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Van Nuys West: Darnell gained the victory Sunday with the help of a 
perfect suicide squeeze by Brian Fernandez in the bottom of the 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like every inning since the ninth we had runners on and we just 
couldn't deliver the blow," said Challgren, Van Nuys West's coach. "So this 
time we got the runners on, and I just figured it was time (to call the 
squeeze). . . . They were getting tired. We were getting tired. It was time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two for the understudies: In the first key matchup of the top teams in 
District 16, Westlake-Royal swept a doubleheader against Newbury Oaks on Sunday 
with some clutch pitching from the emergency replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third inning of the first game, Westlake-Royal starter Phil Derryman 
was shaken up in a collision with Newbury Oaks' Andy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jay Kenney, who was 10-0 for the Westlake High junior varsity team this 
spring, came on to finish the 5-3 victory, striking out four and giving up one 
earned run over 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Westlake-Royal's Maki Kramer, who became ill during the first game, had 
to be scratched from his start in the finale, setting the stage for Todd 
Singleton, a senior-to-be at Westlake who pitched a five-hitter with seven 
strikeouts in Westlake-Royal's 13-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kenney nor Singleton walked a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really very fortunate to have the kind of depth we have," 
Westlake-Royal Coach Mike McClure said. "We have 10 or 11 legitimate high 
school pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep gave Westlake-Royal (10-1) sole possession of first place in 
District 16 ahead of Newbury Oaks (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tournament time: Westlake-Royal is one of three area teams playing this week 
at the Sierra Nevada Classic in Reno. Ventura and the Valley Rangers, a Connie 
Mack team based in Glendale, are also participants in the eight-team 
tournament, which began Tuesday and concludes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legion lines: Phil Onsaga of Verdugo Hills, who combined on a no-hitter 
earlier this season, pitched a three-hitter on Sunday in a 2-1 victory against 
San Fernando. . . . Van Nuys South's Marc Scorza was four for five Sunday, with 
two singles, a double and a triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill's Darrell Hussman struck out 11 batters in seven innings on 
Sunday, but he left the game with the score tied, 4-4, after the seventh. 
Quartz Hill gave up five runs in the ninth inning and lost, 9-4, to Woodland 
Hills East. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 West Hills' Adam Crecion was three for five with a home run and six runs 
batted in during a 16-10 victory against Sunland-Tujunga on Sunday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Encino's Matt Long has walked eight times in his first nine trips to the plate 
this season. He lined out in the other. In Encino's first seven games, the team 
has been issued 63 walks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Bassett hit a three-run, pinch-hit home run in the bottom of the seventh 
last week, lifting Burbank South to a 4-3 victory over North Hollywood.

DEFENSIVE TACKLE BALL WEIGHS IN AS RAIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders made a big addition to their defensive line Tuesday. The question 
is, how big? 
</P>
<P>
 The club signed defensive tackle Jerry Ball, an unrestricted free agent from 
the Cleveland Browns, to a multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, a seven-year veteran and a three-time Pro Bowl player, spent six of 
those seasons with the Detroit Lions before being traded to the Browns a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1 Ball reported to Cleveland at 345 to 350 pounds, according to 
observers. He was cynically referred to as "Butterball," in a season in which 
he allegedly never dropped below 325 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball had two sacks in his first three games, but only one the rest of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball is listed now at 300 pounds, the weight at which he has been most 
effective. A specialist at stopping the run, he will be used to back up Nolan 
Harrison and Chester McGlockton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited to have him with us," said Steve Ortmayer, the Raiders' 
director of football operations. "We plan on working him into the mix. He 
should give us additional strength inside." STEVE SPRINGER

LEARNING TO COPE; STUDENTS AND PARENTS STRUGGLE TO RENEW THEMSELVES IN SPRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY WRIDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

 It is the season of flip-flops and shorts as spring unfolds at La Quinta High 
School, that time of year for big wins in boys' baseball and girls' softball 
and visions of championships, of college acceptance or rejection letters that 
will guide future dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 At La Quinta, the school where I graduated 17 years ago, it is also the season 
of the Sadie Hawkins and prom dances and the fears of moms and dads about 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the school cafeteria one night in March, about 30 Asian parents attend 
a meeting with the principal and two Vietnamese experts. It was a long time in 
coming. More than 600 phone calls by Vietnamese-speaking translators had 
extended the invitation to La Quinta homes. 
</P>
<P>
 That for a turnout of 30. Principal Mitch Thomas is grinning with victory. 
This is a first. As high as they value education, the Vietnamese parents tend 
to have little school involvement, entrusting teachers with their children. In 
the old country, teachers are revered just less than religious leaders. 
Teachers -- not parents -- often decide a Vietnamese child's vocational path. 
</P>
<P>
 But frequently hysterical TV news reports about this gang or that have 
escalated anxiety, and you can see it in the parents' faces, pursed and focused 
under fluorescent light panels. They sit at rows of tables where by day their 
children crowd together with food trays of pho and other popular Asian dishes 
the school now serves. 
</P>
<P>
 First Tony Doan, a Vietnamese specialist for the city of Westminster, passes 
out a bilingual flyer titled "Successful Parenting." His first item: the 
parents' role in bringing up their children in American society. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains how society here encourages children to think for themselves, 
speak their minds and challenge authority. Your children are growing up 
American, he says, and you need to help them fit in to a new culture. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is anathema to immigrants of a society where a parent's 
wisdom is the final word and customs have been passed down for generations. 
Several of the parents remain expressionless; one or two nod. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of his talk is about gangs, how to avoid gangs, how to spot gang 
activities, the dangers caused to the community by gangs, how to defend 
yourself and your family against gangs. It is obviously a huge concern to many 
families, but for these who feel like foreigners still, there is the consuming 
worry of things unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "My boy says the gangs wear certain clothes. Can't you make the students wear 
uniforms so they don't fight over gang clothes?" one mother asks sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Her question is translated for Principal Mitch Thomas by Thanh Tang, vice 
president of the Associated Student Body, who then translates the answer into 
Vietnamese for the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Thomas says, we can't. Uniforms are not the answer to this problem, and 
gang members will just find a different way to identify themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Those items -- recently, bandannas -- are forbidden on campus, and I watched 
this enforced one day. 
</P>
<P>
 A campus supervisor ordered a girl with a bandanna tied scarf-like in her hair 
to remove it. In a taunt at the supervisor, she later put it back on, and the 
principal was immediately flagged. He sized it up and decided the scarf was OK. 
The fuss was defused.  
</P>
<P>
 "My son says he tries to stay away from the gangs, but you can't always tell 
who they are," another mother says, standing with her hands on her hips. "What 
about a list of the names of gangbangers? Could we get that?" Thomas assures 
them that most of the gang members are known on campus, and despite what 
students say, most everyone knows who they are. But more importantly, he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman persists. But why can't we have the list? Can't you just make a list 
and pass it out to us right now? 
</P>
<P>
 The dialogue quickly moves to helping children stay away from "bad friends." 
</P>
<P>
 So many of the questions -- and the answers -- reveal cultural divides between 
an authoritarian and democratic society. The Asian parents want stronger 
control wielded on the campus: Just tell them to do it. Make them do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers of all nationalities hate this like a curfew but the friction 
between Vietnamese parents and their American-raised children is magnified. 
Because nearly 60% of La Quinta's students are Vietnamese, this conflict is 
something teachers and students face all the time. 
</P>

 Loco Nguyen, 18, is a Vietnam-born senior who left his homeland by boat 12 
years ago with his father and four brothers. In the crush and chaos of people 
cramming aboard and pushing off to sea, his mother was inadvertently left 
behind. The same day she gave birth to a boy, Loco's brother, to this day a 
stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I saw her picture, I didn't recognize her," he says simply, 
deceptively unemotional. 
</P>
<P>
 Not knowing the language, his father worked as gardener and church janitor for 
a few years, struggling to support his sons in Seattle, where a relative had 
sponsored them. Loco's mother felt she could not leave aging parents in 
Vietnam, so she has remained there. 
</P>
<P>
 Loco's father later decided the boys needed a mother to cook and clean, so he 
remarried and resettled in Garden Grove, where he works as an auto mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their exodus for freedom has come at a price. Loco says he and his brothers 
are somewhat distant from their father. One brother works at a $7 an hour job 
back East and thinks it's the best he will achieve. One brother is in juvenile 
hall, "a gang member" whose brushes with the police have put him on a downward 
spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Loco dreams of rising above all that, of making a life for himself as a 
graphic artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to go to a good art school, maybe Cal State Long Beach, then 
transfer to (the Art Center of Design) in Pasadena," he says a few hours before 
the Sadie Hawkins girl-ask-boy dance. (He is a candidate for dance king -- L'il 
Abner -- but doesn't offer the information. Somebody else has to tell me.) 
</P>
<P>
 We sit for a long time on the picnic tables in the center of the campus, not 
far from the student government office in which he has painted a dancing couple 
on one big wall. He says he sketches first in pencil, then paints. "I'm not 
into abstract things, but I'm trying to experiment with different media," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm painting something for Coach (Jim) Perry's office. The supplies totaled 
$60. I bought three brushes, a couple of palettes, so it's pretty expensive. I 
have to get it little by little. I draw when I have time, but high school is 
kind of hectic. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the problem is," he adds with a smile, "you don't get famous until you 
die." He hasn't had a girlfriend yet, and he's waiting for the right one, so 
those hassles with a parent have not arisen. 
</P>
<P>
 But he lives under a heavy cloud, knowing he is disappointing his father for 
not going to Catholic school, for not wanting to be a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to straddle two worlds: his happy school world at La Quinta, where he 
is a popular member of the student government and co-president of the 
Vietnamese Club, and his problematic home life, where he barricades himself in 
a room most nights to watch TV rather than fight with his stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 His closest friends are gentle and protective of him and sense the sadness he 
does not hide very well. He is dark-haired , Gap-dressed and part of the 
in-crowd, but when you talk to him you sense he sees himself an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 In that he is like every other teen-ager who feels certain that everyone else 
has a better life, happier disposition, cooler parents and better cars and 
sweethearts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deeper concerns persist, though. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control has investigated the La Quinta tuberculosis 
outbreak, in which 12 students were discovered with active TB and 198 others 
with latent TB. Government officials conclude that the findings show a national 
need to focus more effort on fighting tuberculosis, a disease that only a 
decade ago was thought to be virtually eliminated in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to government shortcomings identified during the La Quinta 
experience, the county's top physician asks the Board of Supervisors to add 
$1.5 million a year to beef up the county's tuberculosis prevention and 
investigation activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "To my knowledge," says Richard Jackson, chief of communicable disease control 
for the State Department of Health Services, "it was the biggest multi-drug 
resistant outbreak of tuberculosis associated with a school in the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-spring, the media coverage has died down and the most visible reminder 
of the TB problem is the daily treatment visits of students at the school 
nurse's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic has been averted by making sure students understand these facts about 
the disease. First, tuberculosis is generally hard to contract and easy to 
cure. The TB bacteria is transmitted in minute droplets exhaled in the breath, 
and a person must have close and lengthy contact with a contagious person, 
possibly six to eight hours a day for six months, before the bacteria settles 
in the lungs. A healthy person's immune system can still suppress the 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bacteria can survive, though, and if or when the immune system 
becomes weak through age or ailment, the bacteria can revive and spread, 
damaging the lungs and other organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexpensive antibiotics taken consistently for six to 12 months can rid the 
body of any lingering TB bacteria. Active cases require four antibiotics taken 
simultaneously for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-April, a report released by the federal government about a study by the 
Centers for Disease Control concludes that the outbreak of TB at La Quinta 
could have been prevented if private doctors who diagnosed a 16-year-old girl 
had more promptly informed county health officials and her treatment had been 
monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amber McCammack, 17, never ruminates openly about such things. She does worry 
occasionally about her boyfriend, though. 
</P>
<P>
 One Tuesday during fifth period I run into her in the hallway outside 
Assistant Principal Derick Evans office. She's wearing pale purple plastic 
glasses, reading a textbook covered in brown shopping bag paper. She's doing 
detention for ditching class Oct. 24, Miss Buckley's U.S. history class. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is glowing, very happy from the events of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been that business about her boyfriend eyeing her friend. But after 
Christmas -- he got her a "reallllly nice present, a watch." It's a Mickey. 
</P>
<P>
 She called him to talk after months of trying to discuss their relationship. 
He didn't have anything else to do, she said, so he didn't put her off this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "His voice perked up," she said. "I said, 'I want you to be my boyfriend 
again.' He said 'OK.' It's different than before; I didn't know if he was gonna 
screw around on me." 
</P>
<P>
 So what's different now? How does she know that officially being her boyfriend 
precludes that? 
</P>
<P>
 "He won't cheat on me or lie to me; he may look like that kind of person," she 
laughs, "but he's not. He makes me laugh. I love him," she gushed. 
</P>
<P>
 And mom? 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom doesn't like him. Never has. Since that day he left the message on my 
answering machine," which her mother thought was rude. 
</P>
<P>
 Does she wish they were just friends sometimes? "Only if it's a real real real 
big argument," she says with a giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 She looks a bit tired in her purple gray sweat jacket, worn inside out. But 
she is happier than I have ever seen her about her boyfriend, who asked that 
his name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good now that we're going out again," she says. She feels more 
secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had my dad, so (my boyfriend) is my little shield. I've known him 
since eighth grade, five years almost now." 
</P>
<P>
 She opens her Life Sciences textbook with a sardonic smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chapter 7 is on animal reproduction," she says with a laugh, a reference to 
her pregnancy last year, a frequent joke of hers that does not mask her 
unresolved feelings about having a baby. "I got 59 out of 59 right on that 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 How did people react after they learned she was pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody thought it would happen to me -- little miss perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Has it changed her? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always really nice to my friends but, if someone pissed me off, be 
-ware. I'm more patient now. Now you have to do a lot to piss me off. Probably 
the pregnancy, because with a pregnancy, you have to -- you know, you're this 
walking ball. When I was nine months pregnant I looked five months pregnant. 
Nobody messed with me because they knew who my boyfriend was, this 6-feet-6 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always the main person being teased. 'Freckles all over her face, and 
red hair.' Always (they teased me) until I went out with (my boyfriend)." 
</P>
<P>
 Painful as this sounds, it is nothing compared to the grief she tries vainly 
to get past, but still has not. 
</P>
<P>
 It is by what she does not say that you start to see how excruciating it was 
to let her baby go. You can tell it was the one person in this world she was 
ever safe to love with her whole heart, and she had to give her away -- in the 
best interests of her daughter. A family friend adopted her. She has not seen 
the girl since infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Every so many months, a dispatch of photographs arrives from the adoptive 
mother -- part of their adoption arrangement. They are snapshots of a 
blue-eyed, red-haired girl that can't help but make you smile. And Amber does. 
It buoys her until the next batch is due, and I've seen her dark mood when the 
pictures are late. I can't help worrying if this Kodak connection to her 
adopted daughter is prolonging her pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of nights a week Amber takes vocational classes to learn clerical 
skills. That's the extent of her immediate plans after high school. As soon as 
she turns 18 and her mom nudges her out the door to take care of herself: She 
wants to stay with the towering boyfriend and work in an office somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 She is looking forward to that future. She thinks of it as freedom.

A SECRET IN OAK RIDGE; HE WAS A STAR EDITOR AND WRITER. SHE'S A DEDICATED 
MOTHER. NOW, MANY IN TENNESSEE AND AROUND THE NATION WONDER WHETHER THEY TRIED 
TO KILL HER HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This town has always been a place of secrets. Half a century ago, the federal 
government swooped down, buy ing up property, bulldozing homes and raising 
great fences around a series of high-security laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, nestled amid the bucolic splendor of Southern Appalachia, the government 
produced uranium for the atomic bomb. And here, in the event of an accident, 
the ridges could theoretically contain the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as the rest of America knew, Oak Ridge, 22 miles west of Knoxville, did 
not exist. It was a "secret city," off-limits to the public from its inception 
in 1942 until 1949, well after the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Ridge still has its secrets, of course. And authorities say one of the 
most shocking was kept by Michael Frazier, a 32-year-old editor at the local 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 A smart and sarcastic young man with a good sense of humor and a flair for 
writing, Frazier had come to the Oak Ridger in May, 1988. He started out as a 
part-time copy editor and obituary writer. 
</P>
<P>
 When he showed skill at writing and editing, he was put in charge of religion 
coverage. Later, he became entertainment editor. And in January, he was 
promoted to editor of Life & Style, the paper's feature section. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier was regarded by some of his colleagues as the best writer at the 
paper. This Friday, in fact, he was to have been presented with a prestigious 
Tennessee writing award for a touching, 1993 Mother's Day story about the 
heartbreaks and triumphs of Lisa Whedbee, the mother of a 4-year-old girl with 
Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a really solid employee," said Oak Ridger Editor Jim Campbell. "He is 
creative, bright, just a good person to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frazier was more than just an exemplary employee. A graduate of Tennessee 
Wesleyan College with a degree in music, Frazier was the organist and choir 
director of Trinity United Methodist Church, where Whedbee was a member of the 
choir. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a productive citizen, with not even a speeding ticket to his name, 
local law-enforcement officials say. Married for two years. About the only 
negative thing anyone would say about him is that he is a heavy smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why, earlier this month, speculation about Michael Frazier's secret 
blew this community away. And not even the ridges could contain the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At dawn on Wednesday, June 8, Michael David Frazier was arrested by sheriff's 
deputies as he walked up his driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, don't tell me my wife has filed another complaint against me," he joked 
lamely, according to Knox County Sheriff Tim Hutchison. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife was out of town. Frazier was arrested on suspicion of attempted 
first-degree murder of Lisa Whedbee's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Outlaw Whedbee, 31, was already in custody, arrested hours earlier on 
suspicion of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit for a warrant to search Frazier's home for a knife and 
surgical gloves, Sheriff's Detective Dan Stewart said that Lisa Whedbee 
admitted that she and Frazier had been having an affair for the past year. But 
Frazier kept whatever secrets he had to himself; he refused to talk to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, the story would captivate the national media. The tale told by 
authorities had all the makings of a sweeps-month miniseries: two families 
shattered in the instant it took to plunge a butcher knife toward the heart of 
a sleeping man, a community stunned into disbelief by the alleged actions of 
two upstanding citizens. Frazier's wife and Whedbee's husband plan to divorce 
their spouses. Lisa Whedbee, by all accounts a dedicated mother, has been 
denied access to her children, Justin, 8, and Brittany, the little girl with 
the great big needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most compelling of all to the media was the notion that Frazier, the 
journalist, allegedly crossed the line that is supposed to separate reporters 
from their sources. Frazier's attorney, Gregory Isaacs, attributed the interest 
to narcissism -- the media sniffed a story of a "reporter gone bad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 911 call came shortly after 1 a.m. that Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller reported an intruder at a home in a subdivision of Northwest Knox 
County known as Camelot, near a highway between Oak Ridge and Knoxville. All 
authorities knew was that the homeowner had been stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 When sheriff's deputies arrived, they discovered John Robert (Rob) Whedbee, 
33, standing outside the house with his neighbor, Bill Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Whedbee was coherent, he was nervous, he was bleeding," Sheriff Hutchison 
said. "He had already come to a conclusion about what had happened long before 
we pieced everything together." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Whedbee was not frightened, Hutchison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was mad." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sheriff's Lt. Larry Johnson, Whedbee said he and Lisa had gone to 
sleep at about 10:40 p.m. on Tuesday, June 7. At about 1 a.m., Whedbee said, he 
was lying on his back asleep. Something -- maybe movement of the covers -- 
roused him. He wasn't quite awake when he smelled the strong odor of cigarette 
smoke. No one in his home smokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had an eerie feeling that someone was standing over him," Johnson said. 
"That is when he opened his eyes in time to see a butcher knife coming toward 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee threw up his arms. The knife glanced off his arms and cut his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that," Johnson said, "is when he got to wrastling with whoever it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee told deputies that he screamed for Lisa, his wife of 12 years, as he 
struggled with his attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to the darkened doorway of their bedroom, Whedbee said, holding a 
baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee yelled at her to call 911, but, he told sheriff's deputies, Lisa just 
stood there, frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee's attacker looked at Lisa and, according to authorities, said: "You've 
got to do it. Just do it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison said Whedbee recognized the voice, but he couldn't place it. "And 
then he said, again, 'Call 911! Turn on the light!' And she would do neither. 
And it was at that point that he became concerned with being safe from his wife 
also." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said it occurred to Whedbee that he'd better make his move. He shoved 
his assailant, grabbed the bat and ran to the garage with the intruder in 
pursuit. "He hit the switch to raise the garage door, which turned on the 
light," Johnson said. "And that is when they came face to face." 
</P>
<P>
 Whedbee, police said, realized in a sickening flash that he knew his attacker 
and that the suspicions he had about his wife were probably true. 
</P>

 Wednesday, June 8, started as a routine workday at the Oak Ridger, an 
afternoon paper with an 11:30 a.m. deadline and a high quotient of 
early-morning energy. About 8 a.m., the police reporter was out making her 
rounds. Other reporters were arriving at their desks. City Hall reporter Will 
Fitzgerald first heard the story in his car radio on his drive in from 
Knoxville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone named Michael Frazier had been arrested in connection with an alleged 
attempted murder," Fitzgerald said. "My first thought was, 'Oh gee, that's 
funny -- someone has the same name as Michael. We can cut out the headline and 
tape it on his desk and he'll think it's hilarious.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter Paul Sloca was sitting at his desk when his wife called to say she 
had heard something about Michael Frazier's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Well, it can't be our Michael.' So I went over to the TV and said 
let's watch the 8:30 news. And it was him. He didn't have his glasses on, but 
you could tell by his body type. He had his 'Phantom of the Opera' shirt on and 
that kind of tipped me off because he is into the arts and opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fitzgerald: "The entire staff (was) just kind of standing there with 
their mouths hanging open, going, 'No way. This can't be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Editor Campbell called his staff together, assigned the story to Fitzgerald, 
and told him to "just play it straight, report what's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell played the story as discreetly as possible, placing it under the fold 
of the front page with no photograph.  
</P>
<P>
 "We decided not to use the mug shot because it's just not Michael," Campbell 
said. "He didn't have his glasses on." 
</P>
<P>
 And he decided against file photographs of Frazier, he said, because they were 
taken after Frazier had won the writing award for his Mother's Day story on 
Lisa Whedbee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just didn't fit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline read: "Paper Employee Charged With Attempted Murder." 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's department spokesman said Lisa Whedbee had let Michael Frazier 
into the home before her husband arrived home at about 8 p.m., and that Frazier 
had hidden in the house until Rob Whedbee was asleep. Justin was away that 
night, and a phone in one of the children's rooms had been taken off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier spent two days in jail before being released on $50,000 bond. Lisa 
Whedbee, whose bond was also set at $50,000, was released after less than 24 
hours in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, whose families had taken weekend trips together, will be tried in 
Knoxville. The prosecutor handling this case declined to comment "for ethical 
reasons" through a secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 But that -- and the fact that none of the principals will talk to reporters -- 
has done nothing to diminish national interest in the case. This week, calls 
were still coming in from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloca, who wrote a story about the extraordinary media interest two days after 
the arrests, had a feeling this story had legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the Associated Press was going to pick it up, and I always think, 'How 
is the national press gonna spin it? . . . It has all the elements. . . . You 
have a news reporter (Frazier) who wrote a story about a person who is 
allegedly involved (in the crime). It also has the sexual aspect, the violence 
aspect. I mean, it's just got everything -- the tabloid television show 
sensationalistic type thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the arrests of Michael Frazier and Lisa Whedbee, Oak 
Ridge and Knoxville experienced a minor invasion by reporters on the trail of a 
crime with an unusual twist: This time, one of the alleged criminals was one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 A CNN crew arrived. Ditto People magazine. The Washington Post's media writer 
called, as did reporters from the New York Post, USA Today and The Times. 
Producers from "Inside Edition," "A Current Affair," "Jerry Springer" and 
"Sally Jessy Raphael" also checked in. One Knoxville TV station called the case 
"a notorious love triangle murder conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastors of Trinity United Methodist Church were swamped with calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the attack, the co-pastor, Brenda Carroll, told the Associated 
Press that Frazier is "an extremely talented musician and writer"; that Lisa 
Whedbee is "a very good mother," and "a very loyal member of the church" and 
that her reaction was "one of sadness and grief." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Sunday after Whedbee was attacked, according to a member of the 
congregation, the service was less a sermon and more an opportunity for church 
members to share their sense of bewilderment and shock. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Oak Ridger passed out photocopies of Michael Frazier's 
prize-winning story about Lisa and Brittany Whedbee. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlined "A Mother's Nightmare, A Mother's Dream," it was a detailed account 
of Brittany's health problems during the first three years of her life, and 
about Lisa Whedbee's attempts to cope. Not only does Brittany have Down's 
syndrome, but she also suffered from a heart defect that required surgery at 6 
months. Just before Brittany's second birthday, doctors diagnosed a rare 
disease that caused strokelike damage in the brain. The toddler underwent two 
brain surgeries within a week of each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The story does not contain any quotes from Brittany's father, nor does he 
appear to have been interviewed for the piece. It did, however, include an 
idyllic family photograph, in which the smiling Rob and Lisa Whedbee are 
flanked by their smiling children. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to imagine them striking such a pose again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier and Lisa Whedbee each have hired private, high-profile criminal 
attorneys. Frazier's lawyer is also defending a man he describes as 
"Knoxville's only serial murderer," an elephant trainer accused of killing four 
prostitutes who has been dubbed "Zoo Man" by the local press. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the lawyers came out swinging harder than Nelwyn Rhodes, the attorney 
for Rob Whedbee, who filed for divorce the day after he was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, just as Frazier was entering the courthouse to be arraigned last 
Wednesday, Rob Whedbee was leaving, after a long interview with the prosecutor 
in charge of the case. Whedbee, who co-owns an insurance agency with his 
parents and brother, was on his way to a hospital to have stitches from cuts 
sustained in the attack removed from his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes planted herself firmly between a reporter and Whedbee, and said her 
client would not be giving a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not letting him talk to anyone," she said later. "Not because we fear 
the truth, but because we are concerned about the defense attorneys taking 
things he says out of context. We do not want to harm or jeopardize this case 
in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes said she did not want Rob Whedbee to discuss a restraining order, filed 
against him by Lisa Whedbee on May 17, in which she accused him of physically 
abusing her after she removed her wedding rings and forcing himself on her 
sexually on two occasions. In the request for the order, Lisa Whedbee also said 
that after she visited a lawyer to discuss "marital difficulties," her husband 
threatened to kill her attorney and her best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did Rhodes want Rob Whedbee to talk about why -- while not admitting 
anything -- he signed the final order of protection on June 2, six days before 
he was attacked -- agreeing not to abuse or threaten his wife on penalty of 
arrest and fine. The order did not require him to leave the home or keep a 
distance from his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes said Whedbee signed the order, even though it was "a work of fiction" 
because he had no attorney at the time, because it was "the path of least 
resistance" and because the couple was working on the marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 Added Hutchison, the sheriff: "If she was that afraid of him . . . she could 
have sought and received an order of protection keeping him away from the 
residence and her. But she didn't do that. To me, that is strange." 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, Rob Whedbee said he sought a divorce because his wife had 
committed adultery and had attempted to take his life "in concert with 
another." Whedbee asked the court for custody of Justin and Brittany. He asked 
for all the real and personal property they own. And he requested that his wife 
be prohibited from any contact with either child. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce is pending, but the court granted Whedbee's request that Lisa have 
no contact with him and their children, and that she not be allowed in their 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after she was released from jail, Lisa Whedbee was hospitalized, said 
her attorney, Tom Dillard. Although he would not elaborate, Dillard said, 
"Stress and grief is part of it. She is undergoing treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, Michael Frazier resigned from the Oak Ridger. He is living 
with his parents in Kingsport, a town in the northeast corner of the state, 
assisting his attorney in the preparation of his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been a good, loyal employee," said Oak Ridger Publisher Peter Esser. 
"Obviously, we didn't want to lose him." The paper, Esser said, has "left the 
door open" to the possibility of Frazier doing some work, on a special 
assignment basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Whedbee was released from the hospital Monday, her attorney said, after a 
stay of 11 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being able to see her children, Dillard said, "is absolutely devastating. 
She hopes she will be allowed to have contact as part of the divorce 
proceedings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A court hearing has been scheduled in the case for July 7, when prosecutors 
will try to show there is enough evidence to bring the pair to trial, which 
could be as far off as a year and a half. If they are convicted, Frazier and 
Whedbee could face sentences of life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison said his office is investigating motives for the attack. Lately, 
speculation in the press has centered on the amount of life insurance carried 
by Rob Whedbee, reported to be as much as $1.5 million -- although it is hardly 
surprising, as Frazier's attorney points out, that a man in the insurance 
business is well insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Reams of questions remain unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Whedbee's statement to investigators apparently provides some clues to 
the crime that shocked Oak Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the story, however, is still Michael Frazier's secret.

AN ABOUT-FACE OR A SIGN OF SUPPORT?; BOOKS: MOMS AND DADS THOUGHT PENELOPE 
LEACH WAS AN ALLY. BUT MANY ARE TAKING HER INDICTMENT OF DAY CARE PERSONALLY -- 
AND THAT TROUBLES THE PARENTING GURU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penelope Leach's "Your Baby and Child" has sold more than 2.5 million copies 
in 28 countries. Her national cable television show of the same name is shown 
four times a week. In her native England, she sits on the Commission for Social 
Justice and is an influential adviser to numerous child-care groups. And 
parents around the world race to her books for information about their 
children's latest bump or hiccup. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as Leach -- one of the trusted troika of child-care gurus that includes 
pediatricians T. Berry Brazelton and Benjamin Spock -- is finding, the 
transition from expert to advocate can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach's newest book, "Children First: What Our Society Must Do -- and Is Not 
Doing -- for Our Children Today," has set off a bomb. The subject of angry 
editorials and much discourse, as well as confirmation by leading institutions 
of some of its key conclusions, "Children First" is more than a shot fired 
against the forces that conspire against good parenting. Rather, it is a 
fusillade of criticism aimed at the way most Western nations raise their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 With it, Leach has abruptly placed herself at the forefront of the child 
advocacy movement, stumping for such causes as children's rights and extended 
paid leaves for working parents, and lambasting the quality of day care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I meant it to be controversial," said Leach, 56, whose credentials include a 
doctorate in psychology from the London School of Economics, decades of 
involvement in child development -- and two grown children. "I was angry on 
behalf of working parents, particularly mothers . . . and the irrationality of 
their double burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Far from feeling bolstered or reassured, however, many parents have reacted 
angrily to "Children First." Although Leach stresses that her criticism is not 
aimed at parents, her message that "everything that parents can do is clearly 
not enough" has opened raw wounds among readers. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York Times review sniped that "Children First" made it seem that "to be 
a working mother is to be somehow derelict." A 5,000-word article in the 
British newspaper the Independent characterized some of Leach's ideas as 
"naively optimistic" and noted that others have found her philosophies of 
child-raising "joyless and oppressive." Brazelton, whose praise adorns the 
jacket of the book, is reluctant to join the debate but admits to reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "She comes on very strong in a very didactic way without being completely 
sensitive to the issues in this country," said Brazelton, adding that some of 
Leach's views, particularly those regarding day care, are unsupported by 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach readily acknowledges that the most nettlesome and controversial portions 
of "Children First" are over what to do about day care. Given the chaotic 
balancing act parents negotiate between work and child-rearing, Leach 
recognizes child care as a necessity, but nonetheless an evil one for many. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the ratios of children to caregivers in center-based care often 
too high -- 6 to 1 in many cases -- but the quality of care offered is 
frequently abysmal, she asserts. In a coincidence of timing, reports released 
by the Carnegie Corp. and the Families & Work Institute soon after the 
publication of "Children First" reached many of the same conclusions. Said 
Ellen Galinsky, Families & Work Institute co-president: "Our country just 
hasn't made provisions for good day care." 
</P>
<P>
 More troubling to some parents, however, is Leach's negative view of all 
infant and toddler day care. Even before "Children First," Leach stridently 
opposed such care, saying that it can be detrimental for children under 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three hours a day in an understaffed nursery where he is special to nobody is 
far from ideal for a newborn, but nine hours a day is far more likely to damage 
his development," writes Leach, who then points to studies showing that 
toddlers left in day care can become overly aggressive and assertive, and end 
up identifying with peers, rather than their parents. "That vital continuous 
one-to-one attention can rarely be achieved in group care, however excellent 
the facility may be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is pronouncements such as these that push the hot buttons of her critics: 
namely, overworked and overwhelmed parents, older feminists wary of a return to 
"traditional values," and child development experts who have their own data 
showing day care to have no harmful and even slightly beneficial effects. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical reaction is that of noted child-care expert Carrollee Howes, a 
professor of education at UCLA. "I don't think it's reasonable to say that 
children shouldn't be in day care," said Howes, who cites a long-term study she 
has done that found no major developmental differences between those in day 
care and those who stayed at home. "All might not be perfectly happy in 
families. And good day care provides children with experiences their parents 
don't think about." 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbled one mother of a 14-month-old toddler: "Where is (Leach's) reality 
base? What is she offering as an alternative?" 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact that there are no alternatives, Leach responded, is the very 
point of her book. "No way am I saying the world would be a better place if 
women stayed home and watched their 1.2 children," she said by phone from 
London. "My moral outrage about day care is reserved for situations in which 
women feel they are blackmailed back into work when they want to spend more 
time with their babies. Anybody's who made a choice and who's happy about it is 
outside the scope of this book." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such apparent equanimity, though, Leach admitted that she is troubled 
by some of the reaction to "Children First." Even if the bulk of it arises from 
what she thinks is outright misinterpretation, or a "shoot the messenger" 
instinct, the criticism still stings. Said Leach: "The response that saddens me 
the most is the gut response from women who say, 'I thought you were a friend 
to me and now I've found you've turned on me and bitten me on the back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And of the guilty feelings on the part of parents? "I can't defend against 
it," she said. "If it makes people feel guilty, to that end, the book fails and 
I regret that." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is not the first time the word guilt has been applied to Leach. 
Much past criticism has focused on her supposedly being overly 
"child-sensitive" and not mindful of the needs of struggling parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, of the "expert threesome" of child-care authorities, it is Leach who 
most consciously attempts to view development from the child's vantage point. 
This affinity frequently is noted by critics, some of whom imply that Leach has 
aided in creating a generation of "little monsters" who keep their terrified 
parents in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think she's sensitive to the demands placed on people," said Theresa 
Maier, a stay-at-home mother in Hennifer, N.H., who adds that although she may 
agree with Leach "on an intellectual level," she still compares unfavorably to 
Brazelton: " He's incredibly focused on the parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed Alison Clarke-Stewart, professor of social ecology at University of 
California, Irvine, and a child development specialist: "I worry about putting 
children first. To me, it seems like a slogan. What we all have to do is work 
out our personal equations the best we can with the limited support we have."  
</P>
<P>
 Leach said she has no argument with that, but then quickly inquired: What are 
the personal and political alternatives to putting children first? And what 
would be the consequences of not putting children first? Would it be higher 
unemployment and crime for the next generations, as some researchers have 
theorized? Such an option, an adamant Leach said, is one that society cannot 
afford to explore.  
</P>
<P>
 "Putting children first wouldn't cost the kind of money that people assume it 
would," said Leach, who earlier this month addressed the United Nations on the 
subject of early child care. "People don't know the costs of not doing it."

FIRST PERSON: CONFESSIONS OF A COOKIE MONSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't just want to be thin. Thin is passe. No, I wish to be fat-free. 
</P>
<P>
 I grit my teeth through fat-free creamy ranch dressing. Fat-free 
jalapeno-cheese bread. And when I feel like living with reckless abandon, 
fat-free cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 They exist??? you ask with disbelief. I toy with you not. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems only the Nabisco people, those whiz-bang bakers of fudge-covered 
Oreos and Nutter Butter peanut creme patties, understand how to hold the fat 
and pack a punch. In an awesome display of molecular manipulation, they came up 
in late '92 with a to-die-for cookie: SnackWell's Fat Free Devil's Food Cookie 
Cakes. Fifty calories each. Cake-like, marshmallow-cream center. And let me add 
two key words: chocolate covered.  
</P>
<P>
 The catch: Stores can't keep the cookies in stock. More than 45,000 callers 
nationwide have jammed Nabisco's toll-free hot line in search of the cookie. 
Grocers have been rationed to one or two of the 12-box cases per week, 
depending on supplies. (Each box has 12 cookies and sells for about $2.20.) 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of loopy desperation has seized the masses since the cookie's debut. 
Last August, the San Francisco Examiner reported that a woman forced a Nabisco 
driver to stop along Interstate 680 near Hayward and begged to buy boxes. 
Nabisco has also reported that customers in Florida, North Carolina and other 
states have formed buying cooperatives to hunt down the cookies and share them. 
And last summer, according to an Associated Press report, two shoppers came to 
blows over the last box in a Wilmington, Vt., store. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's commercials take note of the madness and show three demanding 
women chasing a harried devil's-food cookie deliveryman. 
</P>
<P>
 These are my people, the fanatical fat-gram counters for whom the taste of 
real butter is but a distant memory. They are people like me, who, in a moment 
of weakness, will bum a single peanut M&M off a colleague and then pay 
self-imposed penance in the form of 1 1/2 hours of killer aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the devil's-food cookies crawled off the production line, we, the 
fat-free brethren, thought that taste without guilt was madness, a Spruce Goose 
of a concept. But this cookie turned us into believers. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't to say I'm above duking it out for a box of cookies -- if there 
were only one to fight for. Every week, I plaintively head for the cookie aisle 
in my supermarket. And almost every week, I am faced with a vast expanse of 
emptiness at the SnackWell's shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 I complained to a store manager, throwing in bitter asides about the lost 
concept of capitalism. The manager explained that his hands were tied by the 
Nabisco powers-that-be. He said he has called and begged for more boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like our expensive liquor that we have to keep under lock and 
key," he groused. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, after fear-and-loathing expeditions to grocery stores, I've 
come up with maybe half a dozen boxes. I commiserate with out-of-town friends, 
shamelessly goading them into making cookie searches for me, hinting that years 
of friendship could be on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 I almost fired my cleaning woman in a fat-free-cookie frenzy. I came home one 
day to find a note from her on my refrigerator door: "I ate two of your 
cookies. I hope you don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Mind? I read and wept. Why didn't she take my home computer? My car? 
</P>
<P>
 Nabisco spokesman Mark Gutsche assured me that the cookie makers will "have 
this thing licked" by the end of summer, when output is scheduled to double. 
Still, that means that the North Sioux City, S.D., plant will be cranking out 
only 2 million cookies a day. Two million cookies, for a country of 250 million 
people? Oh, Nabisco, do the math; you break my fat-free heart. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even whispers that the well-publicized cookie shortage is part of a 
secret Nabisco marketing scheme. Another rumor is that grocery-store employees 
hoard boxes for themselves and their friends and never even stock the 
SnackWell's shelves. It's nasty, this whole SnackWell's nether world. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabisco dismisses the rumors and says simply that the cookies' complicated 
four-hour baking process -- including a birthing experience on a mile-long 
track -- slows production. (By contrast, an Oreo is whipped out in 15 minutes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, Gutsche tried to explain the whole engineering feat, throwing out 
such jargon as "marshmallow bake" and "nice chocolate bath." Nabisco even 
points out that the devil's-food cookie is the only one that production-line 
employees are not allowed to sample and the only one not sold in the company 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Give me cookies, Nabisco, not violins. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, I'm down to my last two boxes, which I found in a grocery store 
near my mom's house. I'd tell you where, but then I'd have to kill you.

'90S FAMILY; THE AGE OF EXPRESSIONISM; FIRST PERSON; WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT 
SWEET LITTLE KID? THE TEEN YEARS -- LIKE, 'DUH!'; THE VERBAL MISSILES THAT 
ASSAIL PARENTS USUALLY COME IN THE FORM OF GRUNTS. . . . ONE WELL-PLACED ' DUH! 
' CAN STOP PARENTS IN THEIR TRACKS AND REVEAL THEM FOR THE FOOLS THEY ARE.

 My father's normal speaking voice was a bellow that buckled wood siding. My 
mother spoke just as forcefully, and she made sweeping gestures that knocked 
over lamps in adjoining rooms. Because of my childhood humiliation, I grew up 
to be a soft-spoken, genteel woman. Imagine my surprise, then, when my 
11-year-old son, Eric, leaned over the restaurant table recently and hissed, 
"MOM! You're talking too loud." 
</P>
<P>
 I had a flashback so powerful I passed two time-travelers along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that my parents weren't the Foghorn Leghorns I thought they were 
in my teens? Maybe that would explain how quickly they shaped up while I was 
away at college. I attributed it to maturation -- theirs, not mine. 
</P>
<P>
 My view of the world back then was tainted by common teen-age disgust. And 
now, I realize it's my turn to be on the receiving end. Soon I will face many 
of the charming little weapons teen-agers use to remind adults that they are 
inferior. 
</P>
<P>
 These assaults can be verbal -- as in the liberal use of " duh! " -- or 
facial, as displayed by the gruesome lip curl that translates into: "I am so 
disgusted with you that it's making my upper lip shrivel." 
</P>
<P>
 You know the routine. 
</P>
<P>
 You ask him in front of his friends how his day was and you get the Blank 
Stare. You tell him you think his T-shirt is baggy enough to look cool, and you 
get, "Like you know." You plan an exciting weekend and you're rewarded with, 
"Are you serious?" or the less rhetorical, "No way!" 
</P>
<P>
 And if you foolishly ask him to help out, you receive the sarcastic, " Yesss, 
maaaster ," delivered in a Peter Lorre voice he thinks was created by Ren, the 
bug-eyed cartoon Chihuahua. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't even get me started on Beavis and Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>
 The flip side of the frozen Blank Stare is the deft execution of facial 
contortions. These include eye rolls, head shakes and -- the most extreme 
maneuver -- the dreaded full-face muscle-tightening lock. When you see this, 
you begin to wonder about the possibility of human implosion and what that 
would do to the carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The verbal missiles that assail parents usually come in the form of grunts, 
with " ugh !" or " huh ?" right up there with the famous " duh! " These 
economic, one-syllable responses yield great effects. One " duh! " can stop 
parents in their tracks and reveal them for the fools they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so the teen-ager hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember saying " duh! " to my dad . . . once. When all of us were hanging 
around the family room he said something so inconsequential and obvious that it 
had to be addressed. With every molecule of mocking contempt in my body, I 
said: "Well, duh! " 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 I received a look from my dad that convinced me that I would soon be dead. But 
he didn't do anything. He just watched me as I melted into the Naugahyde 
recliner. 
</P>
<P>
 I had every right to stand up to him -- after all, he had played polka king 
Frankie Yankovic's records during my slumber party. But I didn't. From then on, 
I quietly concealed my distaste for him . . . until he left the room, then the 
facial contortions went into overdrive. That's what we called "respect" in my 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the grunting " duhs! " occasionally real words are emitted by 
teen-agers, delivered in several musical variations. There is the short and 
sharp " right! " The staccato-style "what. . . ever ." And phrases held long 
enough to impress Pavarotti, such as " oh greeeeeeeaaaaaaaatttttttttt! " All of 
these are followed by exhales that could inflate a hot-air balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quite clear to me that Eric has entered the lip-curl era, and that means 
that my son, who used to look adoringly at me, will for the next few years 
criticize me unmercifully. 
</P>
<P>
 I miss the old son, the one brimming with innocence. This reality makes me 
recall a time three years ago when I thought he had lost his innocence. I was 
driving Eric and his classmates on a field trip, and to win the title of "cool 
mom of the school," I cranked open the sunroof on the boring Volvo and blasted 
Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" from the stereo. The song was experiencing a 
revival thanks to "Wayne's World," and we played the tape over and over, 
head-banging as long as we could stand it. 
</P>
<P>
 To further prove that I was cool -- and had been for a long time -- I casually 
tossed out the fact that I listened to the same song when I was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not the exact same song," they baited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the same song," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not the exact same singer," they went on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," I said. "Freddie Mercury." 
</P>
<P>
 I was expecting them to say, "Wow!" but instead, one boy blurted, "He died of 
AIDS." That got them talking about gays, straights, condoms, disease and death 
-- heavy subjects for 8-year-olds. As I was mourning their loss of kid-ness, 
one boy in the back seat asked Eric where he had gotten the Queen tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the Easter Bunny," Eric said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cool!" they chorused. 
</P>
<P>
 They were still believers, and my son still had wonder in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 I was granted a reprieve of a few more years, and that makes it OK that I'm 
losing him now. I'm better equipped (I've been working out with weights) and I 
have a unique vision that allows me to still see my sweet son as he was, even 
when he's expelling sighs instead of sentences and performing eyeball aerobics. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that he still loves me, even when I embarrass him, and that someday he 
will say "Really?" and not mean "I couldn't care less," but rather, "I'm hoping 
that the wonderful thing you just said is true." 
</P>
<P>
 My day will come. 
</P>
<P>
 Really.

'90S FAMILY; THE AGE OF EXPRESSIONISM; REAL LIFE; WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE 
BACK TALK -- PUNISH IT OR JUST IGNORE IT?; EXPERTS SAY THE KIDS' LANGUAGE FOR 
THEIR TIME IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE 'HELLS' AND 'DAMNS' THAT IN THE EISENHOWER 
ERA WOULD GET A KID'S MOUTH WASHED OUT WITH A BAR OF LIFEBUOY.

<P>
 The sweet-faced 11-year-old felt unfairly accused. A classmate had stolen her 
ruler and the teacher said it was her fault for leaving it unprotected. In the 
sixth-grade world of personal justice, something had to be done. So the girl 
said she stole the classmate's ruler, then marched past the teacher and loudly 
proclaimed: "In your face, Miss Plumley!" 
</P>
<P>
 A mild enough retort perhaps, but enough for Miss Plumley to ground the girl 
for recess. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of bold back talk used by kids today that shocks many adults. 
Most of this girl's friends have told their mothers to shut up, that they're 
stupid or that they hate them. "I have a friend whose 2-year-old called her a 
bitch," said Julie, the mother of a 5-year-old boy. High school students in 
affluent Washington, D.C., suburbs are said to regularly curse teachers who try 
to discipline them. One braggart told the Washington Post: "I called (the 
teacher) a lot of stuff for a minute straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Julie, 35, was aghast last fall when her son started to use a "nasty tone" to 
defy her. "The way he stands there and says 'No,' I can't believe it. My first 
reaction is to hit him. I feel like I'm a lousy parent. Out of control. Like 
he's going to try to run me and I won't know how to turn him around and it's 
going to get worse and worse. Like when he's 8 and doesn't want to do his 
homework, or when he's a teen-ager and we don't care for his friends." Then, 
too, she said, "I'm concerned about what all the other mothers are going to 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm torn," she said. "I want him to be strong. Just not to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But when parents look for advice, they are apt to find two schools of thought 
among experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The first advocates zero tolerance ("We will not allow that kind of language 
in this house. Ever. And there will be consequences."). The other advocates 
unflappable obliviousness -- if at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, experts said parents should try to first understand that shocking 
back talk is a normal part of child development, intended to gain power for 
young children and identities for teen-agers. At the same time, they admit it 
is magnified by the specific characteristics of our era: TV, rap music, working 
and single parents, and the continually rising limits of what is acceptable. In 
order to shock anybody, children are forced to raise the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Timothy Jay, author of "Cursing in America," also suggests that 
as society has grown disapproving of physical punishment, some families have 
increased their use of verbal insults as conflict tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 But in most cases, the experts say the kids' language for their time is no 
different than the "hells" and "damns" that in the Eisenhower era would get a 
kid's mouth washed out with a bar of Lifebuoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every parent is going to encounter this kind of language from 
teen-agers unless they're Amish," Jay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing other parents' war stories and understanding that back talk is common 
helps, "but I still don't like it and I don't handle it terribly well," said 
Richard, 55. After fruitless attempts to get his 15-year-old daughter to pick 
up, clean up and exercise without any back talk, he said he finally realized, 
"Hey, what's the point? I'm not accomplishing anything by making too much of 
these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he said he tries to "strike some sort of balance, so I'm not a total 
pushover, and yet to try to keep my own respect. It's much more a matter of 
changing me than changing her." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Whitham, licensed clinical social worker and author of "Win the 
Whining War and Other Skirmishes," always suggests ignoring back talk because 
"they would not push your buttons if you had no buttons to push." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get bent out of shape by yelling, correcting or punishing just for 
words, it just feeds it and it will become more of a habit. We need to save our 
more serious punishments for tougher stuff -- hitting a brother or sister, 
breaking a safety rule, taking something without asking." 
</P>
<P>
 Other suggested techniques: 
</P>
<P>
 * Repeating the offending phrase 100 times, singing it high and low, fast and 
slow, so it becomes less shocking, or saying, "That's an interesting term. 
Where did you learn that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Fining the offender 50 cents per word. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoiding such language yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 What does not work: 
</P>
<P>
 * Taking it personally or too much talk of hurt feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insisting on control, even through super niceness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insisting on having the last word, rather than letting the child save face 
with a mumbled misdemeanor such as "OK, I'll empty the damn trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jay: "What we are interested in is healthy expression of anger and 
differences. Parents don't want to be so punitive that they can't establish 
themselves as a source of information later, especially with sex and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason you don't want to spank them or wash their mouths out with soap is 
so later at 8, 10 or 12, they will come to you for this information. If parents 
are always punitive, they'll go someplace else."

DANA PARSONS: IN SHAPING CARING SOCIETY, WE CAN PAY NOW OR PAY LATER

 Surveys suggest the American public can't get enough of the O.J. Simpson 
murder investigation. Count me in, too. I've read everything so far and have 
room for more. 
</P>
<P>
 But, just as a quiz, how interested were you in the front-page story Tuesday 
about the report that said abused kids are staying at the Orangewood Children's 
Home much longer than those of 15 years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Did you even read the story? Did you read that the home is overcrowded and the 
children there are suffering much worse problems than those of a decade ago? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm asking, not chastising. 
</P>
<P>
 My guess is that, like most people, your interest in that story was a fraction 
of your interest in the Simpson saga. And therein lies one of society's great 
and lingering problems -- we're only interested in how things turn out, not how 
they start. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in social services know an ugly little truth -- that many of 
tomorrow's front-page crime and violence stories have already taken root. 
</P>
<P>
 As we all know, Simpson has been charged with killing his ex-wife, Nicole. The 
investigation already has raised the issue of whether stronger intervention in 
their earlier domestic problems may have prevented her death. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orangewood report deals with child abuse, but experts in the field say 
that, just as with domestic violence, early intervention can make a difference 
on child abusers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are staggering, because Orange County reported 36,721 incidents of 
child abuse in 1993. As recently as 1990, the figure was 28,364. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy McCarrell, executive director of the Child Abuse Prevention Center in 
Costa Mesa, said numerous studies indicate that prisons are overwhelmingly 
populated by adults abused as children. 
</P>
<P>
 She maintains that programs for early intervention and prevention have never 
been tried on a massive scale. "A certain percentage, and it would be difficult 
to say what percentage, would take that early intervention and make it 
something positive," she said. "Some won't, and that may have more to do with 
how bad the scarring was, mixed with their ability to overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her center matches volunteers with troubled families. The volunteers spend at 
least two hours a week with the family, for up to a year, in an effort to 
reverse the abusive behavior. Seventy families are involved now, and another 70 
could easily be found if enough volunteers were available, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as with child abuse, earlier and more meaningful intervention could slow 
the onslaught of domestic-violence cases, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If authorities are correct about Simpson's involvement, McCarrell said, his 
violent behavior may have been curbed had he been forced to attend group 
therapy or receive treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Emphasizing that she wasn't referring to Simpson specifically or commenting on 
his guilt or innocence, McCarrell said, "Kids who grow up seeing domestic 
violence are more likely to become perpetrators or victims (as adults). We've 
seen that generational cycle, so intervention in the spousal abuse cycle would 
certainly affect the next generation of spousal abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 To social service professionals, the link between violent childhood 
experiences and adult behavior is so obvious as to sound tiresome to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Briggs, a supervisor with the Orange County Child Abuse Registry, has 
repeated the mantra a thousand times, which makes the shortage of early 
intervention especially maddening to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at what it costs society to intervene afterward," she says, 
referring to both child abuse and domestic violence, "it would have cost a lot 
less if there had been intervention earlier with families and with adults. 
We're willing to spend a whole lot of money to build Orangewood and a whole lot 
of money to build prisons, but we could spend a whole lot less money and make 
real dramatic changes in families if we did prevention." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, she knows that isn't jazzy enough to move society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public doesn't get it," Briggs said. "Maybe they'll start getting it now. 
I hope I live long enough to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows whether prevention and early intervention will ever be glamorous 
enough to grab our attention. Maybe the terms or the concepts are just too 
starchy for mass consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, maybe we're content to wait for the screaming headlines from future 
front pages to remind us of our failings.

VOTERS TO HAVE SAY ON EL TORO BASE AS AIRPORT; CONVERSION: COUNTY SUPERVISORS 
SAY THEY HAD LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO APPROVE THE INITIATIVE, SINCE SUPPORTERS HAD 
GATHERED MORE THAN ENOUGH SIGNATURES TO FORCE AN ELECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 Setting up a potentially divisive political campaign, the Orange County Board 
of Supervisors grudgingly agreed Tuesday that voters be allowed to determine 
whether El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is converted to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors said they had little choice but to place the controversial 
issue on the Nov. 8 ballot because supporters had gathered more than enough 
petition signatures -- 114,879 -- to force an election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, the airport initiative is the same type of ballot box planning that 
once worried so many of the people who are the initiative's strongest 
supporters," Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said, referring to 
local business leaders who feared the slow-growth referendums of the 1980s. "It 
was wrong then and it is wrong now." 
</P>
<P>
 All five supervisors approved the ballot order, but only Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder said the vote was necessary because of a public "perception" that 
voters have little faith in the current government leadership to decide El 
Toro's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is that this issue has already been politicized," Wieder said. 
"The current process needs to be replaced by the public. This is just not a 
land-use issue. This development is going to affect generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, called the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative, 
has the support of a local business and political coalition that contends that 
a new airport would create more than 20,000 new jobs in Orange County and 
generate $170 million each year in revenue for local cities and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the initiative would require the county to build a commercial 
airport on 2,000 acres of the 4,700-acre base, which is scheduled for closure 
by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, the air station has been at the center of heated political 
debate that has divided the county at an imaginary north/south border. 
</P>
<P>
 North County officials have joined business leaders to support the airport 
plan, while South County officials say such a project would require massive tax 
increases for construction and bring unwanted noise and traffic to their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, South County leaders gathered at the Hall of Administration to launch 
their first salvos of the campaign even before supervisors voted to place the 
issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will require the biggest tax measure in the history of Orange County," 
said Leisure World resident Bert Hack, representing a group called Taxpayers 
for Responsible Planning. "There are no adequate sewer, water or power systems 
to support such a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At minimum, Hack said, his group estimated that construction of a terminal, 
new runways and other public works improvements would cost $3 billion. Hack 
said the average resident's contribution to such a project would amount to more 
than $8,000 in additional taxes and fees each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Houssels, president of the Harbor Hills Homeowners Assn. in Newport 
Beach, told the board that if existing military runways are used for commercial 
aviation at El Toro, flight patterns would cross residential neighborhoods in 
Irvine, Corona del Mar and Newport Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the initiative was very deceptive," Houssels said, holding aloft a map 
of possible flight paths. "People signed this petition without knowledge of the 
full consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative has considerable backing among business leaders, including 
developers George Argyros and Buck Johns. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men, among the most generous contributors to local political campaigns, 
played key roles in organizing the petition drive and have expressed little 
confidence in leaving development of the base to the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority, the county agency formed to consider uses of the base. Agency 
members have pledged to give equal consideration to placing a commercial 
airport on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government had ultimate authority over how the base is used but 
will consider local plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) said passage of the measure 
would be his "No. 1 priority between now and November." 
</P>
<P>
 "People should know what horrible consequences will result from allowing a 
small minority of people to make the decisions on this issue," Rohrabacher 
said. "This is too important to leave the people out." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Councilman Irv Pickler, who has expressed support for the 
measure, said the board's decision "places the issue right where it should be: 
before the voters." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this is going to be labeled a north/south war, but I hope it doesn't 
turn out that way," Pickler said. "This is not a small-potatoes issue here. 
It's proper that the electorate decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Laying the foundation for the campaign ahead, Riley said the real "battle for 
public opinion will not be fought today but over the next five months." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the record, while I'm voting yes today to place this measure on the 
ballot, when Nov. 8 arrives, my vote will be to protect the (El Toro planning 
board) process,"" Riley said. "And I'll vote no." 
</P>
<P>
 The other board members, with the exception of Wieder, reluctantly gave their 
approval, saying the development should be left with the existing planning 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not going to be beating the drum for or against this 
initiative," Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said. "It's going to sink or swim 
based on the facts or lack of facts available. It's a political campaign."

SEVEN ARRESTED IN $100,000 TAGGING SPREE; GRAFFITI: SEVERAL FROM O.C. ARE AMONG 
THOSE ACCUSED OF VANDALIZING LONG BEACH FREEWAY IN WHAT POLICE CALL A WAR 
BETWEEN RIVAL GANGS.

<P>
 Police on Tuesday arrested seven men and boys, including several from Orange 
County, for allegedly spray-painting 14 miles of the Long Beach Freeway, a 
massive tagging spree that resulted in more than $100,000 damage and is 
regarded as one of the worst concentrated graffiti attacks in Southern 
California's history. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25,000 graffiti attacks were made May 13 through 18 in a tagging war 
between rival area gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti, which ran on the southbound freeway between the Broadway exit 
and the interchange with the Artesia Freeway, covered the freeways themselves, 
on-ramps, off-ramps and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could not believe it," Long Beach police spokeswoman Margarita DeWitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early-morning sweep of La Habra, Fullerton and several other cities, 
police officers from a multi-agency task force arrested Marco Ross of Whittier 
and John Ehredt of La Mirada, both 18. They also took into custody five 
juveniles whose names were not released because of their ages, DeWitt said. The 
juveniles, all aged 16 and 17, were from Fullerton, La Habra and Norwalk, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were booked on felony charges of vandalism and conspiring to 
commit vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of more than 40 officers from the California Highway Patrol, the 
Long Beach Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
handled the investigation, described as the first phase of a campaign against 
graffiti vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said police are considering asking judges to impose sentences that 
include suspending the suspects' driver's licenses until they turn 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults face a maximum of a year in prison and $50,000 in fines, Long Beach 
city prosecutor John A. Vander Lands said.  
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said Long Beach police are trying to hit taggers hard because "they're 
damaging our city. We don't have a very high tolerance for that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, people who work in some of the buildings that border the Long Beach 
Freeway despaired of taggers ever being brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ongoing battle," said Pat McGurk, director of operations for 
International Containment Service, which has a warehouse near the freeway's Del 
Amo exit and was hit in the tagging spree.  
</P>
<P>
 Making a few arrests "is like throwing a bucket of water on a forest fire . . 
. but the police are doing what they can," said McGurk, who added that his 
company has spent thousands of dollars to graffiti-proof and repaint its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 McGurk says the graffiti gives potential customers a bad impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they come in and you've got a building that looks like it's been in a war 
zone, they don't want to do their business here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Humphreys, a worker at Everyday Products on Susanna Street, said that 
when freight trains come in to drop off raw materials at his warehouse they 
wind up covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the tagging, Humphreys said, "is pretty artistic." He said he wishes 
taggers "would go take some art school classes or something," rather than 
spray-painting. 
</P>
<P>
 One Los Angeles anti-graffiti activist, Joe Connolly, argued Tuesday that 
arresting taggers perpetuates the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attention is what they want," Connolly said. After the names of the taggers 
arrested Tuesday appear in the media, "20 of (their) buddies are going to go 
out and do everything in sight. . . . You can only beat (taggers) with paint." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the businesses along the Long Beach Freeway paint over graffiti, 
saying they are discouraging taggers by erasing their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach police spokeswoman DeWitt said the department usually does not 
publicize tagger arrests, but wanted to make a point of Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Falenchik, a worker for Specialty Tabletops, a tableware manufacturer 
with offices along the freeway, paints over graffiti on the property. He said 
he found 27 empty spray cans behind the building after last month's tagging 
spree. "I couldn't believe how much was on there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Falenchik said he wishes he could bring taggers into the offices and watch 
people at work, and perhaps be inspired to get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't see their names on a paycheck or on a report card," he said. "I 
think they just want to see their names."

ENDANGERED FRIENDS; RESCUERS AT MARINE MAMMAL CENTER ARE RUNNING OUT OF MONEY 
-- AND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A foursome of young elephant seals and sea lions that were released back to 
the ocean Tuesday may be among the last patients of Friends of the Sea Lion, a 
nonprofit rescue group that is nearly broke, its leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing patient loads and mounting costs for medicine and food -- including 
$2,000 for 3,000 pounds of fish a week -- have drained the group's emergency 
reserve, said Judi Jones, 49, director of operations at the Marine Mammal 
Center on Laguna Canyon Road, where the animals are rehabilitated.  
</P>
<P>
 The center has enough money to sustain the small staff and the more than 50 
current patients for only two more months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Mammal Center became four patients lighter Tuesday as Gumby and 
Pokey, 6-month-old elephant seals, and BMW and C.W., 1-year-old sea lions, were 
released into the waves at Crescent Bay as hundreds of beach-goers cheered. The 
four had been nursed back to health by about 60 volunteers and two staff 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW suffered from a severe case of pneumonia when he was discovered by the 
Coast Guard last month at Newport Beach. C.W. showed signs of an eye infection 
and a spinal injury when he was found in April, also at Newport. Respiratory 
infections and injuries to the eyes and spine (the latter caused by run-ins 
with boats) are the most common ailments, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumby and Pokey suffered similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has rescued and released thousands of sea lions, elephant 
seals and harbor seals since it was founded in 1971 by a veterinarian, a 
lifeguard and a science teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past four years, expenses for medicine and food have drained its 
reserve, which is regularly financed through donations from about 100 of its 
3,500 members and a small gift shop. The organization receives no federal 
assistance and gets no corporate money like places such as Sea World do, Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People aren't aware that we need money and that we run only on donations," 
said Jones, a registered nurse and the center's only year-round, full-time 
staff member. 
</P>
<P>
 After emergency reserves run out, the regular staff will be eliminated and the 
healthier animals will be released sooner than they would be otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that it would never come to that," Jones said. "We're being 
optimistic. We can't perceive that actually happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Hunter, 37, a volunteer since 1989, said that if Friends of the Sea 
Lion folds, "there would be a lot of sick animals on the beaches. It can be 
dangerous if people try to pick them up. They would be public health hazards." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter recalled one patient she was especially fond of. Little Kahuna, a 
7-month-old, 25-pound sea lion, suffered mild seizures when he was rescued five 
months ago in San Juan Capistrano. When he was released last month, he weighed 
73 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have your favorites," Hunter said. "Like Little Kahuna, who looked 
like he wasn't going to make it and then miraculously did." Creature Comforts

BREAKING THE PATTERN OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; COURTS: ABUSE VICTIM CLAUDIA CLARK'S 
PURSUIT OF THE LEGAL PROCESS PAYS OFF AS THE COMPANION WHO BEAT HER RECEIVES 
THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In jail, after he'd had some time to reflect on the mess he was in, Jose Maria 
Martinez wrote the mother of his son a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 She had told police that Martinez had severely beaten her -- dragged her off 
the bed, pinned her to the floor, choked her until she nearly lost 
consciousness and then whacked her on both sides of the head to revive her. In 
all, she said, he slapped and punched her about 30 times in 45 minutes. The 
police had hauled him off to jail -- after chasing him on foot for half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, which later became part of the court record, he pleaded with 
her not to press charges. He told her to lie for him. "All this is going to be 
(dropped) if you do what I say," he wrote of the charges he was facing. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, Claudia Clark was not moved. Finally, she said, the painful truth 
had hit her: "You can't let them keep beating on you and beating on you. 
Because one day, they're going to end up killing you." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark decided to press charges against the father of her 4-year-old son. "This 
time," she said in an interview, "he was going down. Not me." 
</P>
<P>
 That anger and determination launched a process that underscores the obstacles 
-- some practical, others emotional -- that a battered woman can encounter in 
going to court. The process took weeks. But it produced a result that 
illustrates how the much-maligned court system can still exact justice -- if a 
woman is willing to believe in it and in herself. 
</P>
<P>
 After a four-day trial, at which Martinez maintained his innocence, a Van Nuys 
Municipal Court jury convicted him on four counts, including spousal abuse. A 
few days ago, Judge Lloyd Nash sentenced Martinez to 4 years and 11 months 
behind bars, believed by the city attorney's office to be the longest sentence 
ever handed down in Los Angeles in a misdemeanor domestic violence case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all cases require this type of sentence," said Nash, who has been on the 
bench about five years. "But some cases cry out for the maximum sentence. And 
this case is one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Jeffrey M. Harkavy, who prosecuted the case, said the 
average sentence for such a crime is considerably shorter. A first offense 
typically might result in a sentence as light as community service or as tough 
as six months in jail, Harkavy said. A second offense might bring up to a year 
in jail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez could not be reached for comment. His defense attorney, Christopher 
P. Nance of Van Nuys, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing charges, Clark said, took persistence. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the beating, Dec. 23, Clark had to submit to police photographs 
that documented the angry red welts on her neck. That night, she suffered the 
indignities of being examined at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few weeks, she had to confide in a prosecutor. Her phone service 
had been turned off, so she had to attend every court hearing -- if only so she 
would know when the next hearing was. That meant baby-sitters for the boy and 
bus rides from her North Hollywood apartment. That cost money, which she didn't 
have much of, living on welfare and food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 She had to be patient; the Jan. 17 earthquake scrambled schedules at the Van 
Nuys courthouse. Finally, when the case did go to trial, she had to testify 
against Martinez, to publicly confront being a victim and the fear of 
retribution.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, now 25, had been convicted of beating Clark once before, in 1991. 
For that, he got 30 days in jail, six months of counseling and two years 
probation. He also had done two stretches in state prison for drug-related 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been on parole for only a few weeks when he beat Clark, now 26, most 
recently. When she first met Martinez, Clark said, he seemed so different. He 
was a talented artist. He was charming. In the summer of 1989, they moved in 
together but never got married. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon she was pregnant. Then things got ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was three months pregnant, she said, he asked if another woman could 
move in with them. She declined. He got mad. He kicked her in the stomach with 
steel-pointed shoes, she said, and punched her, cutting her lip. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 When the baby was 3 months old, the car wouldn't start. Martinez clenched the 
wheel. "What's wrong?" Clark said. He erupted, she said, punching her in the 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, she said, she was holding the baby over her shoulder when he hit 
her. The force smacked the baby's head into the wall.  
</P>
<P>
 He apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, she said, she would take him back -- hoping that things would 
change between them and, more than that, that he would provide for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "he never worked, nothing." She survived on food stamps and 
welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1993, Martinez was released from prison. Clark allowed him to see 
their son and, sometimes, to sleep on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the morning of Dec. 23, a knocking sound echoed through the 
apartment. Clark thought it was the neighbors getting ready for work. Martinez 
said it was her boyfriend at the door, a man named Juan. She said that was 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one in her life, she told him. He didn't believe it. Enraged, he 
went to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and plunged it into the pillow 
inches from her head, according to her trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 He dragged her out of bed, she testified, got on top of her with his knees 
pinning her elbows and put his hands to her throat. She felt she was passing 
out. She said he hit her head to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Martinez left the house, and then called Clark and told her, "I'm going 
to come back and finish you off," Harkavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived and, after a chase on foot, arrested Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that morning, the thought dawned on her: "If the father is going to be 
like this, better the son doesn't have a father. My son deserves better than 
this." So, she realized, did she.  
</P>
<P>
 That notion fueled her determination to pursue the court case.  
</P>
<P>
 When the trial came, Clark said, she realized she "didn't have no feelings for 
the guy anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez followed her to the stand. He denied assaulting her. He did, however, 
concede that he tried to run away from the officers.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury came back in two hours with guilty verdicts on all four misdemeanor 
counts: spousal abuse, false imprisonment, making threats to kill and resisting 
arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 Misdemeanors carry a maximum of one year in jail. On May 26, Nash sentenced 
Martinez to a year on each of the four counts, then tacked on 11 months for a 
probation violation linked to the 1991 assault on Clark.

PROTESTS AND PRAISE GREET ROYAL VISITORS; DIVERSITY: THE JAPANESE IMPERIAL 
COUPLE MEET A RICH VARIETY OF LOCAL LEADERS. ASIAN AMERICAN MARCHERS DEMAND 
REPARATIONS FOR WAR CRIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko have been working hard in their United 
States visit to pay tribute to the diversity of America. But in Los Angeles, 
the Japanese royal couple have been encountering even more of it than was 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, hundreds of people of Chinese, Korean, Filipino and Vietnamese 
descent demanded an apology for Japanese war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Little Tokyo, Latino workers at a Japanese-owned hotel appealed to the 
emperor to support their union, holding up a sign in Japanese and trying to 
present a letter to him. 
</P>
<P>
 And nearby, even friendly gestures reflected the city's multicultural stew: 
Young men from Japan shouted a tribute of banzai -- in American gangsta-style 
baggy pants and baseball caps. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the protesters -- or hoi polloi well-wishers, for that matter -- got 
near the imperial couple. The close encounters with the diversity of the city 
were entirely over the clink of fine crystal. There was, for example, a 
luncheon with the mayor atop the Transamerica building Tuesday. The guest list 
of 100 was designed to let the emperor see the rich variety of leaders here. 
</P>
<P>
 At one typical table, Latina businesswoman Ana Barbosa, Bruce Ramer of the 
American Jewish Committee and Joe Hicks of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference sat together. "I'm delighted to meet with leaders from a 
cross-section . . . of Los Angeles," said the emperor in a toast. "I (hear) 
with much interest that Los Angeles' community is made of people with various 
and diverse cultural backgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The task of the unfailingly statesmanlike emperor has been to mend fences torn 
apart by the sometimes clumsy personnel management of Japanese corporations, by 
boorish Japanese politicians who insult minorities and by Japanese 
intellectuals who pen bestsellers spouting theories about alleged Jewish 
conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
 And to some degree, it's working. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wounds are still deep (from past insults)," Hicks told a reporter. "(But) 
I'm encouraged by these remarks. The more interaction there can be between 
highly placed Japanese officials and African Americans who are clearly in the 
mainstream and influential people, the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese doing business in Los Angeles could tell the emperor a few things 
about the influence of powerful African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an African American -- former Mayor Tom Bradley -- who aggressively 
forged ties with Japan that helped build Los Angeles over the last two decades 
into an international trading giant. He focused so much on Asia, in fact, that 
some of his constituents accused him of ignoring his own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was among the guests at a gala black-tie dinner for 650 at the Regent 
Beverly Wilshire Hotel on Monday night, as well as at Riordan's lunch. At the 
dinner, the emperor and empress were welcomed in speeches by Gov. Pete Wilson, 
Arco Chairman Lodwrick M. Cook and Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat of honor next to the emperor went to Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, 
chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors -- and an African 
American. She noted the long history of Japanese Americans in her district and 
the sister-city ties between her district and Ibaraki, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Angelenos, however, feel far less friendly toward Japan than these civic 
leaders. For many of the nearly 1 million people of Asian descent in the 
county, the emperor brings back memories of aggression and atrocities during 
World War II, even though he was just a child at the time. About 400 Asian 
Americans, led by Korean drummers, marched from Chinatown to City Hall to the 
Japanese Consulate to demand that Japan pay war reparations and teach Japanese 
schoolchildren the truth about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emperor has expressed "deep sorrow" over the "severe suffering" 
that Japan inflicted on China, many Chinese consider the gesture inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to come down and get on your knees and apologize for what you've 
done," yelled 70-year-old Lee Jom Jo, aiming a bullhorn at the Bunker Hill 
skyscraper where the consulate is ensconced. Lee, who talked about being forced 
into slave labor in Japan during World War II, waved a placard that said "Japan 
Is the Asian Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
 Some protesters said they had firsthand experience with Japanese atrocities. 
Yuh Fan Sung, 75, carried a handmade ink drawing showing a scene from his 
hometown that he remembered vividly -- heads of decapitated Chinese hung from 
walls by Japanese soldiers.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But other protesters, too young to remember the war directly, said the issue 
still burns in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents told me a lot about the war," said Daniel Wang, 30, who skipped 
out from his Downtown job to join the demonstration. "These are things no one 
can forget, even my children and their children." 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the reign of Akihito's father, Hirohito, that the atrocities 
occurred, but protesters said it is the responsibility of Akihito to ensure 
that the truth about the past is told. Ironically, when Hirohito visited here 
in 1975, there was no similar protest against Japan's war history reported by 
the press. 
</P>
<P>
 There were protests in 1975, to be sure. But they were by a group of Japanese 
Americans upset at Japanese investment in Little Tokyo displacing local people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian American community of Los Angeles today is very different from that 
of two decades ago. It has shifted from a small population dominated by 
U.S.-born Japanese Americans to a large, mostly foreign-born population from 
many different countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers of Tuesday's protest said it was an important watershed in 
unifying various Asian immigrant communities behind a single cause. The protest 
was supported by some Japanese Americans, who said that their own fight for 
redress from the U.S. government for their internment during World War II makes 
it natural for them to support other victims of injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese Americans are also active in pressing Japanese corporations to 
act responsibly in the United States -- in part because anger against Japanese 
companies often is taken out on Asian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Omatsu, a staff member of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center, was 
marching with Latino workers trying to unionize the Japanese-owned New Otani 
hotel. "The owners of the New Otani are certainly not promoting the image of 
Japan, and they're certainly not promoting inter-ethnic harmony," Omatsu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the activity on the street, the emperor and empress sailed 
serenely through the day, she in a beige kimono, he in a dark gray suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Waving from a balcony of the Japanese American Community and Cultural Center, 
they were met by a rustling sea of Japanese and American flags flourished by 
enthusiastic Japanese nationals and Japanese Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the center, they met with Japanese American leaders bringing not 
demands or complaints but expressions of friendship and shared cultural ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, they met with Ronald and Nancy Reagan at their home in Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, the royal couple visited an exhibition on Abraham Lincoln at 
the Huntington Library in San Marino. Even there, the painful roots of 
America's diversity were on display, in historic posters advertising slaves for 
sale. But the imperial couple seemed fascinated, lingering over an original 
manuscript of the Gettysburg Address and the Emancipation Proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress appeared to be delighted with the lush gardens, which 
include roses named Princess Michiko, and with the Huntington's extensive 
collection of British portrait paintings, including "Blue Boy" and "Pinkie." 
</P>
<P>
 But the visit to the hushed, wood-paneled Huntington, a world-famous center of 
Anglo-American civilization, was still another symbol of the changing face of 
Los Angeles. For the elegant Beaux-Arts museum, formerly the mansion of 
Anglophile railroad tycoon Henry Huntington, is at the heart of the San Gabriel 
Valley -- center of the largest Chinese community in the United States.

7 ARRESTED IN $100,000 FREEWAY TAGGING SPREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Tuesday arrested seven men and boys for allegedly spray-painting 14 
miles of the Long Beach Freeway, a massive tagging spree that resulted in more 
than $100,000 in damage and is regarded as one of the worst concentrated 
graffiti attacks in Southern California's history. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25,000 graffiti attacks were made between May 13 and May 18 in a 
tagging war between rival area gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 The graffiti, which ran on the southbound freeway between the Broadway exit 
and the interchange with the Artesia Freeway, covered the freeways themselves, 
on-ramps, off-ramps and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could not believe it," Long Beach police spokeswoman Margarita DeWitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early-morning sweep of several cities, police officers from a 
multi-agency task force arrested Marco Ross of Whittier and John Ehredt of La 
Mirada, both 18. They also took into custody five juveniles whose names were 
not released because of their ages, DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were booked on felony charges of vandalism and conspiring to 
commit vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of more than 40 officers from the California Highway Patrol, the 
Long Beach Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
handled the investigation, described as the first phase of a campaign against 
graffiti vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said police are considering asking judges to impose sentences that 
include suspending the suspects' driver's licenses until they turn 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults face a maximum of a year in prison and $50,000 in fines, Long Beach 
city prosecutor John A. Vander Lands said.  
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt said Long Beach police are trying to hit taggers hard because "they're 
damaging our city. We don't have a very high tolerance for that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, people who work in some of the buildings that border the Long Beach 
Freeway despaired of taggers ever being brought under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ongoing battle," said Pat McGurk, director of operations for 
International Containment Service, which has a warehouse near the freeway's Del 
Amo exit and was hit in the tagging spree.  
</P>
<P>
 Making a few arrests "is like throwing a bucket of water on a forest fire . . 
. but the police are doing what they can," said McGurk, who added that his 
company has spent thousands of dollars to graffiti-proof and repaint its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 McGurk says the graffiti gives potential customers a bad impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they come in and you've got a building that looks like it's been in a war 
zone, they don't want to do their business here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Humphreys, a worker at Everyday Products on Susanna Street, said that 
when new freight trains come in to drop off raw materials at his warehouse they 
wind up covered with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the tagging, Humphreys said, "is pretty artistic." He said he wishes 
taggers "would go take some art school classes or something" rather than 
spray-painting. 
</P>
<P>
 One Los Angeles anti-graffiti activist, Joe Connolly, argued Tuesday that 
arresting taggers perpetuates the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attention is what they want," Connolly said. After the names of the taggers 
arrested Tuesday appear in the media, "20 of (their) buddies are going to go 
out and do everything in sight. . . . You can only beat them (taggers) with 
paint." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the businesses along the Long Beach Freeway paint over graffiti, 
saying they are discouraging taggers by erasing their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach police spokeswoman DeWitt said the department usually does not 
publicize tagger arrests, but wanted to make a point out of Tuesday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Falenchik, a worker for Specialty Tabletops, a tableware manufacturer 
with offices along the freeway, paints over graffiti on the property. He said 
he found 27 empty spray cans behind the building after last month's tagging 
spree. "I couldn't believe how much was on there," he said.

LAPD PANEL URGES BRISENO FIRING; LAW ENFORCEMENT: BOARD OF RIGHTS FINDS THE 
SUSPENDED OFFICER GUILTY OF UNNECESSARILY KICKING KING. ATTORNEY THREATENS SUIT 
IF WILLIAMS APPROVES DISMISSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police Board of Rights on Tuesday recommended that Officer Theodore J. 
Briseno be fired from the Los Angeles Police Department, finding the suspended 
officer guilty of unnecessarily kicking Rodney G. King during the notorious 
1991 police beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, rendered by a three-member board, must be approved within five 
days by Police Chief Willie L. Williams. If Williams follows the board's 
recommendation, Briseno will take the department to court, Briseno's lawyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little disappointed," said Gregory G. Petersen, lawyer for the 
40-year-old Briseno. "But we're confident that . . . we'll be able to reverse 
their decision in the trial courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno was one of four LAPD officers originally charged in the March 3, 1991, 
King beating, and many who saw the videotape of the incident thought he 
appeared to be kicking or stomping King. 
</P>
<P>
 In the criminal and civil trials that ensued, Briseno broke the so-called code 
of silence by testifying that other officers involved in the beating -- 
especially Officer Laurence M. Powell -- were out of control and that Sgt. 
Stacey C. Koon, the supervisor at the scene, did not properly execute control. 
</P>
<P>
 But Briseno denied that he acted with unnecessary force, saying that he was 
just trying to force King to the ground so King could be handcuffed and taken 
into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Powell and Koon were eventually convicted of violating King's civil 
rights, Briseno was acquitted in the criminal and civil rights trials and found 
not liable for punitive damages in King's civil suit. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney had argued that the Board of Rights should give him his job back 
because he has not been convicted of any crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a statement released Tuesday, LAPD Capt. Val Paniccia of the LAPD's 
West Valley Division said: "This board's decision is that Officer Briseno's use 
of force was unreasonable and unnecessary and he is guilty as charged." 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending the firing, the board cited a prior suspension for excessive 
force on Briseno's record, telling the officer that he "failed to learn" from 
the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 A department advocate also noted that Briseno had failed to file a report on 
the night of the King beating expressing his concerns that excessive force had 
been used. If he had actually been concerned, Sgt. Corrie Malinka argued, he 
should have told his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen said, however, that the board "acted in excess of its jurisdiction" 
by firing Briseno on the basis of an accusation that was found to be baseless 
in three courts of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess LAPD gets to have a different standard of justice," said the attorney 
for Briseno, who has been unemployed for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess three captains know more than three juries of 12 and one jury of 
nine," Petersen added. "I'm surprised, but I guess I shouldn't be."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY REFUSES TO PAY STATE'S PENSION BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has refused to pay a $743,632 bill from the state for city 
employee pensions that the employees and the city inflated through spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 0 Monday not to pay the bill the city received from the 
state Public Employees' Retirement System. Not voting were Councilman Jim 
Silva, who arrived late, and Councilman Earle Robitaille, who was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking occurs when an employee gets the city to inflate the worker's last 
year's wages -- on which a pension is based -- by allowing the employee to 
forgo vacation days, car allowances and other benefits and take them as wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The state retaliated against the practice by billing the city for a portion of 
the increased cost, which was due to spiking. 
</P>
<P>
 The city estimates that pension spiking by city employees could cost $13 
million in additional pension benefits and, because those pensions are 
unfunded, it could become a liability for the city or PERS. City officials 
believe the city will be billed for some of that by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were angered by the state's bill, and said that when the city 
participated in spiking it was a common practice and approved by PERS. 
Councilman David Sullivan said that because PERS permitted the practice "it's 
their responsibility to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 In refusing the bill, the council also set the stage for suing PERS over the 
cost of the increased pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, members of the Citizens' Bureau of Investigation, a group 
made up of residents investigating waste and abuses of city government, also 
urged the council to eliminate the spiked portions of the pensions to save 
taxpayers millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "CBI has been telling them for two months that spiking is illegal and they're 
finally realizing it," CBI director Bill Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $13 million in unfunded pension liability, Sullivan said that some $3 
million covers 39 employees who have already retired. The state bill for 
$743,632 was to cover a portion of that liability. PERS ordered the city to pay 
that bill by June 30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $10 million covers unfunded pensions of 153 city employees planning to 
retire with spiked pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible mess that has put a potential liability of $13 million on the 
citizens of Huntington Beach," Sullivan said. "In my opinion, it's an outrage 
that it happened and the council should do everything it can to stop it and 
make sure nothing like this ever happens again." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted 5 to 0 to stop the processing of retirements with 
spiked pensions during the next two weeks. A final vote is expected at its 
meeting July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 A new state law, which will prohibit most pension spiking by public employees, 
takes effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sullivan said the financial implications for the city won't stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly not over for us, if it's going to cost us $10 million after 
July 1," he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COUNTY OKS BUDGET THAT ADDS 364 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer in Orange County government has nearly always been synonymous with 
budget fever, but this year officials have yet to break a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors passed a proposed $3.6- billion budget Tuesday without a 
peep from a single local resident or government official. In years past, people 
have packed the meeting chamber to decry the possibilities of layoffs and cuts 
to public safety departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible," said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley, banging the 
gavel Tuesday on perhaps the shortest budget hearing in recent county history. 
"In my 19 years, I don't think this has ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the apparent lack of interest could be attributed to a county 
financial plan that for the first time in three years does not threaten 
government jobs, nor does it pose significant service cuts in any department. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, county government is actually planning to add 364 employees to the 
rolls this year, a 2.7% increase over last year. Many of the new employees will 
be paid for through city, state and federal program money flowing to the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the additional workers will be deployed in either county health, 
social services or public safety departments. The largest single personnel 
increase -- 123 workers -- is being proposed for the county Social Services 
Agency to deal with the burgeoning caseloads of welfare, Medi-Cal and food 
stamp recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, all of our programs are involved in a growth industry," Social 
Services Director Larry L. Leaman said, adding that the number of local 
Medi-Cal recipients is expected to increase by 10,000 people next year, 
bringing the total to 80,000 cases. "It seems like we've been in this growth 
mode for five years now and that means more clerks, more counselors and more 
professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget also contains 84 new positions for the county Fire 
Department, 53 of which are part of the county's takeover of firefighting 
operations from the City of Buena Park. Under the new arrangement, the city 
will pay the county for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said the budget plan approved Tuesday provided a 
comfortable scenario for the county, which in the past three years has been 
forced to trim more than 2,000 positions from its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a very good position this year," Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget plan still is very much dependent on how the state will attempt to 
balance its massive shortfall, recently projected at close to $5 billion. But 
Steiner and other county officials said they believed that cities and counties 
might be spared the loss of key revenue suffered last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, state officials helped balance a similar shortfall by shifting 
$2.6 billion in property taxes from cities and counties to fill holes in the 
California public education system. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; TOLL ROAD PROTESTERS CONTINUE THEIR VIGIL 
</P>

<P>
 Anticipating a court ruling allowing bulldozers back into Laguna Canyon, 
opponents of the San Joaquin Hills toll road continued their protest Tuesday, 
waving signs and slowing traffic, but the court order never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday afternoon, protesters vowed to maintain their vigil at the planned 
toll road construction site, about three-fourths of a mile north of El Toro 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to stay here forever," Earth First member Patrick Mitchell said, 
"until this thing goes one way or another, until the canyon is no longer under 
threat." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration is part of a protest that began June 14 when U.S. District 
Judge Linda H. McLaughlin rejected a lawsuit filed by environmental groups 
against the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is charged with building 
the road, and the Federal Highway Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, bulldozers began plowing through the hillsides, causing some 
demonstrators to start sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, lawyers for tollway opponents won a temporary injunction 
from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals halting the grading.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Laguna Beach Councilwoman Lida Lenney, wearing a "Keep It Wild" 
T-shirt, said more than 100 people met in the canyon the night before to be 
trained in civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Carpenter, who helped in the training, said people are willing to be 
arrested if the grading begins again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to save the canyon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway agency spokesman Mike Stockstill had no comment about the 
demonstration Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Hills tollway would stretch 17 miles, cutting through Laguna 
Canyon as it links Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation workers dampened the protest Tuesday 
afternoon by posting "no parking" signs along both sides of the roadway. Lenney 
said she would ask her colleagues at a regularly scheduled City Council meeting 
Tuesday night to approve a permit allowing protesters to use a city-owned 
parking lot next to the demonstration site. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JUVENILE HALL PROBES COUNSELORS' ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities at the county's Juvenile Hall in Orange are investigating 
allegations that counselors allowed youths to engage in gang behavior and 
ignored beatings that were part of gang rites. 
</P>
<P>
 Two deputy probation counselors have been placed on paid administrative leave 
as a result of the investigation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern has to do with an alleged gang subculture which may have existed," 
said Tom Wright, Juvenile Hall co-director. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wright declined to identify the counselors who were placed on leave 
or discuss incidents that prompted the inquiry. He said Juvenile Hall 
authorities expect to release their findings later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter has also been referred to the Orange County Grand Jury, which is 
investigating, said Frank Kroeger, the grand jury foreman. Kroeger declined to 
comment further Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile authorities said the investigation focuses on one living unit which 
houses 22 youths. Both of the suspended counselors are assigned to the unit in 
question, authorities said. Juvenile Hall contains 17 living units and has an 
overall population of 430. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said authorities launched an investigation May 13 after complaints from 
senior staff members about several incidents in living unit E. 
</P>
<P>
 "The senior staff members said they thought something was amiss," said Bruce 
Malloy, administrator for the Orange County Juvenile Justice Commission, who 
also declined to provide specifics. The commission is charged with monitoring 
Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said there are seven deputy probation counselors assigned to each 
living unit. In addition to counseling the minors, the supervisors are charged 
with enforcing regulations that strictly prohibit any type of gang behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said the Juvenile Hall supervisors are required to enforce a list of 
rules concerning banned conduct. Among other things, minors are prohibited from 
using gang slang, exhibiting hand signs, writing gang graffiti or wearing 
clothing that might identify them as belonging to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Malloy said enforcement is a difficult task because the Juvenile Hall 
population is "more toxic than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of 13,000 referrals, 70% are real serious felonies," he said. "I think part 
of what you're looking at is the probation system adjusting to the population 
in there." TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CROWDS IN THE SWIM AS SUMMER ARRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer officially arrived Tuesday with temperatures in the low 70s, clear 
skies and light breezes, luring crowds to county beaches and to inland swimming 
pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's phenomenal, it's summer," said Lt. Eric Bauer of the Newport Beach 
lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "As always, our crowds are predicated on weather," he said. And the 
combination of warm temperature and summer vacation for many students resulted 
in "very, very crowded conditions" at Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been pent up in a classroom all year, and they're ready to come to 
the beach," said Bauer, who noted that the city brought in extra lifeguards to 
handle the unexpectedly large crowds. Full staffing of the lifeguard towers is 
scheduled to begin Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 As for water conditions on the first day of summer, Bauer reported "some 
pretty good-sized surf" of three to five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had quite a few rip currents pulling and quite a few rescues," said 
Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 At Huntington Beach, Alanna Quignon and Erin Spaseff were sunning themselves 
on a grassy knoll just north of the pier. The 15-year-olds attend Valley 
Christian High School in Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finals are over, we are so happy," said Spaseff, a Lakewood resident. "We're 
just trying to work on our tans." 
</P>
<P>
 Quignon added that "this is our third time (at the beach) this week." 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance from the high school students, Huntington Beach lifeguard 
Jeff Flanagan was watching the water from his perch at Tower 6. He 
characterized the crowd as large for a Tuesday, with a mixture of visitors and 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people seemed content to stretch out on the sand and enjoy the afternoon 
sun. But some of those who ventured into the water had the misfortune of 
stepping into holes created by strong wave action. 
</P>
<P>
 "People kind of float on by and get caught in holes," said Flanagan, a 
20-year-old student at Golden West College in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 People also took to the water in inland cities. In Brea, for example, the city 
plunge was crowded "with all kinds of people," said cashier Manuel Viola, who 
estimated that 50 adults and 200 children took a dip Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The historic structure, built in the late 1920s, opened for the season Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, UC Irvine's Dr. Virginia Trimble, a physics professor, offered a 
scientific explanation of the summer solstice, the longest day of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Solstice' means 'sun stands still,' which is silly, of course, because the 
sun doesn't stand still," Trimble said. Actually, the sun "climbs" to its 
highest point in the sky on June 21, which marks the first day of summer in the 
Northern Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But for people living in the Southern Hemisphere, June 21 is the shortest day 
of the year and the official start of winter. ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; 2% PAY INCREASE FOR TEACHERS OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Teachers of the Los Alamitos Unified School District will receive a 2% 
increase in pay beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 School district trustees unanimously approved the increase Monday after just 
two weeks of negotiation between district officials and the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a judgment call," trustee Keith Polakoff said. "All things considered, 
we thought it would be good for the district to have a quick settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The district had also begun negotiating with non-teaching employees, and there 
was some fear that the quick settlement with the teachers could influence those 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase would boost salaries of the district's 307 teachers by about $700 
to $1,300 a year, according to Assistant Supt. David Hatton. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 2% across-the-board increase, teachers' salaries will be 
adjusted based on teaching experience and for continued studies beyond a 
bachelor's degree. The most senior teachers now could make about $59,300 a 
year, Hatton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said beginning teachers would receive about $27,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers are in the second year of a three-year contract that was signed 
in 1993. The agreement called from negotiating salaries this year, with no 
salary increase last year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatton said the pay increase would cost the district about $600,000 for the 
1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fair for both sides," said school board President Virginia Wilson. She 
added that a quick settlement is not unusual, particularly if it does not 
involve negotiating a new contract. BERT ELJERA

 Two Valley Vista High School students were attacked and beaten by five 
assailants shortly after leaving a Denny's restaurant on Adams Avenue early 
Tuesday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested five juveniles seen fleeing the restaurant area on suspicion 
of assault in the beating of Damon Ohr and the stabbing of Michael Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, who was stabbed twice with a small knife, is in fair condition at 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with a punctured lung, police said. Ohr was 
treated for bruises to the head after being hit with a large fishing pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they recovered both weapons from the juveniles, whose names were 
not released because of their ages. JAIME ABDO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SURROGATE MOTHER, COUPLE DROP SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tustin couple and a surrogate mother who engaged in a landmark custody 
battle over a surrogate child have agreed to a legal truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative settlement agreement, Mark and Crispina Calvert have agreed 
to drop their lawsuit against Anna Johnson if she withdraws a cross-complaint. 
The Calverts signed a $10,000 contract with the Garden Grove woman in 1990 to 
carry a child for them. During her pregnancy, however, Johnson told the 
Calverts she wanted to keep the child. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Calverts sought a court order to enforce the surrogacy 
contract, which was arranged by the Center for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly 
Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 The precedent-setting case was the nation's first legal test of whether a 
surrogate mother with no genetic connection to the child has parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge awarded custody to the Calverts, and the 
state Supreme Court later upheld that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1992, the Calverts sued Johnson and the Beverly Hills surrogacy 
firm in Superior Court in Santa Ana, alleging fraud, breach of contract and 
infliction of emotional distress. They received an undisclosed sum from the 
surrogacy firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Lais, an Anaheim attorney who represented the couple, said Tuesday the 
Calverts dropped their lawsuit because Johnson, a former Marine, had few assets 
and would not have been able to pay a judgment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why go through the time and effort to get a judgment?" Lais asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gilbert, an Orange attorney who represented Johnson, said she no 
longer wanted to pursue the matter because "taking money from the Calverts 
would be like taking money from her own child."  
</P>
<P>
 Lais said the Calverts hoped that the agreement in the civil cases before 
Superior Court Judge Nancy Wieben Stock will settle the matter once and for 
all, adding that the couple want to "find peace and enjoy normal family 
relationship" with the child, Christopher, now 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbert said Tuesday the legal battle is far from over.  
</P>
<P>
 "She will never stop fighting for the child she gave birth to," the lawyer 
said. DAVAN MAHARAJ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; $137-MILLION BUDGET CALLS FOR 22 NEW COPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a lively debate, the City Council on Tuesday approved a lean 
$137-million general fund budget that calls for hiring 22 new police officers 
but eliminates 16 other positions in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget dips into the city's reserves and imposes a utility right-of-way 
fee against the city-owned Public Utility Department to cover a nearly 
$9-million deficit. The department is fiscally independent of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's recession as well as a drop in sales tax and the tourism industry 
have hurt the city in the past four years. During that period, nearly 10% of 
the city's 2,000 work force has been cut, while the budget has been slashed by 
$34 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 1994-95 budget is about $578 million, but the discretionary 
general fund is $136,914,962, about 1% more than the last general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To balance the budget, the city drew about $3.5 million from its $13-million 
cash reserve. The city is relying on a right-of-way fee against its own Utility 
Department to raise about $3.9 million. About $2 million of that amount will be 
earmarked for the addition of 22 new officers to city's current department of 
353 sworn officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee would not raise electricity rates for at least three years because the 
Utility Department, which supplies Anaheim with electricity and water, has been 
running a multimillion-dollar surplus. Water rates, however, might increase 
slightly, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the vote to approve the budget was unanimous, Councilmen Bob D. 
Simpson and Fred Hunter voted against the right-of-way fee as a way of helping 
to pay for the new officers and suggested that the council search for other 
funding sources, including a controversial utility user tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a time when politics need to be put aside," Simpson said, meaning 
that the council should grapple with the utility tax issue.  
</P>
<P>
 The budget also calls for other small fee increases in convention center 
parking rates and for services such as using the city-owned gymnasiums and 
fields. A 5% increase in solid waste collection, which is about 60 cents per 
resident, was also approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the approved budget, the city will eliminate 16 positions from various 
departments. Most of the cuts will likely come through attrition and 
retirements. MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; READING AS EASY AS PIE AT VICTORIA SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raising his syrupy, blueberry-caked hands into the air, 11-year-old Martin 
Moran of Costa Mesa smiled victoriously and tried to catch the drops of sweet 
purple juice dripping down his beaming face. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the scene Tuesday morning at Victoria School, where students pigged 
out in the campus' first-ever pie-eating contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The event marked the conclusion of a program that encouraged students to read 
books in their spare time. The students were promised a special event when they 
read 20,000 books. Upon reaching the goal, they voted in favor of the pie 
feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin won the contest that pitted him against a handful of other, mostly 
younger, students, as well as Principal Judy Laakso. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and his friends insisted it was training and not age that propelled him 
to the top. "He ran around a lot and starved up for a while," said pal Shane 
Ontiveros, 10, of Costa Mesa. "That's what made him win." 
</P>
<P>
 His classmates said they knew Martin should enter the contest after they timed 
his eating a cupcake in 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The more than 100 children who observed the contest had the zeal of World Cup 
soccer fans. They loudly chanted the names of the participants and sprung up 
from the lawn to surround the contestants as soon as the event began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Just Read program began in January with the goal of having the school's 
325 students read 20,000 books by June. Each time the students read 5,000 
books, the school played host to a special event, such as an ice cream sundae 
party and barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran said he read about a dozen books this term, including one horror novel 
called "Monster Blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Laakso said stuffing her face in a pie was worth the trouble, if it encouraged 
students to read. 
</P>
<P>
 But she did prepare for the event, ensuring that while the student 
participants all dug into messy blueberry pies, she got to munch on a 
sugar-free apple pie. SHELBY GRAD

SQUATTERS RESCUED AFTER QUAKE-DAMAGED HOUSE COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A three-story Victorian house that had been condemned after the Northridge 
earthquake collapsed Tuesday, forcing firefighters to rescue two homeless 
squatters inside and leaving an elderly neighbor hospitalized with chest pains, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house in the 1100 block of South Magnolia Avenue had been "red-tagged" 
after the January quake and was presumed empty, said Los Angeles City Assistant 
Fire Chief Bob Neamy.However, unknown to city officials, it had become a haven 
for homeless people, some of whom had been sleeping there for more than two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack McKay, 48, said he had spent Monday night with several other homeless 
people on the second floor of the house and was preparing to bunk down for a 
second night when, about 4:45 p.m., "everything just started shaking and 
falling down." 
</P>
<P>
 McKay managed to escape unaided as the collapse crushed part of the first 
floor. Two other transients inside had to be rescued by firefighters, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The house finally came to rest against a neighboring home, whose frightened 
79-year-old occupant was hospitalized for chest pains, Neamy said. The woman 
was in stable condition Tuesday night, he said.

COLISEUM OKS LUXURY BOX OFFER FOR RAIDERS; STADIUM: THE FOOTBALL TEAM'S RENT 
WOULD BE PUT ASIDE TO BUILD THE AMENITIES. ITS OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN TALKING TO 
OTHER CITIES ABOUT RELOCATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Coliseum Commission approved a contract proposal Tuesday that would put 
all rent the Raiders pay this fall into a fund to build special luxury boxes, 
with the money being returned to the team if the boxes are not built. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting in a closed session, the commission authorized the project director of 
its ongoing $42-million earthquake repair, Don C. Webb, to make the offer to 
the team, which has yet to commit itself to play in Los Angeles this year and 
has not even sent out season-ticket applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider officials could not be reached for comment. The team has been paying 
about $800,000 rent per year, not nearly enough to build the boxes. The 
remainder of the money presumably would come from a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' managing general partner, Al Davis, has made it clear that he 
hopes to get a commitment to build luxury boxes at the Coliseum, bringing it up 
to the standards of other National Football League stadiums, before deciding 
whether to remain in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis has met with officials from Oakland, Baltimore, Orlando, Fla. and New 
Haven, Conn., for talks about moving the team, but it is not clear whether he 
is serious about such a plan or is trying to put pressure on the Coliseum 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials say they lack the resources to match the other cities' 
offers, but they suggest that the long-range profit potential of remaining in 
Los Angeles exceeds that of the other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the latest commission offer will prove enough for the Raiders was 
uncertain Tuesday. The commission's president, Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, emphasized that the offer is not for a new multiyear 
contract tying the team to the Coliseum, but instead is a promise to negotiate 
in good faith for a long-term deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer calls for the same 50-50 split of concession revenues that has been 
in effect, said the commission's vice president, Los Angeles City Council 
President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In another decision, the commission voted to remove immediately the video 
scoreboards atop the peristyle to facilitate earthquake repairs. Webb said 
substitute boards will be provided by the opening of the fall football season. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb and prime contractor Ronald Tutor said the Coliseum repair project has 
been tougher than expected. Nonetheless, they said, the stadium will be ready 
by September.

MTA PREPARES STRIKE CONTINGENCY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials, who are negotiating a 
contract with unions representing train and bus drivers and mechanics and 
clerks, released a strike contingency plan Tuesday to prepare for any possible 
work stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation agency says it has trained supervisors and non-union 
employees to be able to operate and maintain buses and trains as early as July 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has contract agreements through June 30 with the United Transportation 
Union, which represents 4,400 bus and train operators; the Amalgamated Transit 
Union, which represents more than 1,900 mechanics and service attendants, and 
the Transportation Communications Union, which represents more than 600 clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Chief Executive Officer Frank White said the agency has trained and 
certified 100 substitute bus and train operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials initially requested a 3% raise as well as retaining a 
cost-of-living increase. MTA officials -- who are considering a fare increase 
to help ease a $126-million operating deficit -- oppose both demands. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of a strike, the MTA plans to serve the 18 busiest lines. 
Officials will operate up to 50 buses during the first week, and gradually 
increase the number of buses to 250. The service will operate from 6 a.m. to 6 
p.m. on weekdays. Service on the Blue Line trolley, running between Long Beach 
and Downtown, and the Red Line subway will also continue during those hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Clark, general chairman of the United Transportation Union, said: "We 
believe the interest of the public would be far better served if the MTA would 
concentrate its energies at the bargaining table."

OFFICERS BEGIN VOTING, EXPECTED TO OK CONTRACT; LABOR: SOME CITY OFFICIALS FEAR 
MAYOR RIORDAN'S COMPROMISE OFFER IS TOO COSTLY. AIDES SCRAMBLE TO FIRM UP 
REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT ARE THE BASIS OF HIS BUDGET. 
</P>

<P>
 Although questions lingered about the city's ability to fund the deal, Los 
Angeles police officers began voting Tuesday on the city's latest contract 
offer, and leaders of the police union said the package appeared to be headed 
for ratification. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials argue that the compromise worked out by Mayor Richard 
Riordan is too costly and will drastically scale back the mayor's effort to 
beef up police patrols. Union leaders, meanwhile, contend that the offer is 
acceptable but not anything to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contract will probably be approved, but the men and women of the Los 
Angeles Police Department when they are voting on this contract are very 
solemn," said union Director David Zeigler. "They aren't tap-dancing about this 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
 The voting will continue today and Thursday at various police facilities. The 
$50-million package -- which calls for a 7% raise over the next 18 months, 
along with a patrol incentive and $1,500 cash bonus -- will be considered by 
the City Council next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officers began to vote, Riordan's aides were working to shore up 
revenue estimates that are the basis of his budget. Two council committees had 
recommended this week that the city not approve the deal without first knowing 
how it will be funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Department of Water and Power Commission, who are appointed by 
Riordan, sought to guarantee a $10-million transfer from the DWP to the city 
treasury. But with the support of only two of five DWP commissioners, the 
proposal died. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan aides denied that the request of the DWP was linked to the police 
raise, but officials at the city utility said they believed that was the reason 
for the proposed transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 DWP officials argued vehemently against the transfer, saying that the $197 
million they have already agreed to transfer to the city is as much as they can 
spare. 
</P>
<P>
 Any additional transfer of funds could lead to layoffs of DWP employees and a 
reduction in projects such as the replacement of outdated water lines, said Jim 
Wickser, the DWP's assistant general manager. "They were talking about a 
surplus that just isn't there," he said.

BILL BOYARSKY: RESERVOIR PROJECT HOLDS HOPE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The invitation was hard to resist -- a helicopter flight to eastern Riverside 
County, where a huge, new reservoir will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of a helicopter ride prompted me to phone a quick RSVP. A 
close-to-the ground flight over the Eastside and the San Gabriel Valley into 
the farthest reaches of the Inland Empire would be a break from slogging around 
Southland freeways. My most interesting work-related travel recently had been 
driving to a Neighborhood Watch meeting on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more to this invitation than a flight. Domenigoni Reservoir is 
an important part of one of Southern California's most fascinating political 
stories, the effort of this semidesert to secure enough water to support a 
population that nature never intended to live there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 7 a.m. last Wednesday, I joined officials of Metropolitan Water District of 
Southern California at the agency's Downtown Los Angeles headquarters, and we 
headed to the helicopter waiting for us at a Civic Center parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Our destination was the Domenigoni Valley near Hemet. By 1999, this valley 
will be covered by 250 feet of water, creating a reservoir 4 1/2 miles long and 
2 miles wide. Three dams will hold the water in the valley, which for more than 
a century has been the farming domain of the Domenigoni family. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-billion-plus reservoir is being built to correct a basic flaw in the 
Southern California water supply system, a planning misjudgment that has caused 
years of conflict between Northern and Southern California and between 
agriculture and the cities. The problem is that there is not enough reservoir 
capacity to get us through periodic droughts. Domenigoni will also be big 
enough to supply us for six months should the long-awaited Big One cut off the 
aqueducts bringing water from the Colorado River and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 As our helicopter headed east into Riverside County, I could see why there was 
a growing need for the water. Around Corona, we flew over huge mansions -- 
pseudo-colonials and fake French chateaus -- occupying comparatively small 
hillside lots. On the flatlands, houses stood row on row, looking from the air 
like the subdivisions that inspired Malvina Reynolds to write her folk song 
about little boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 These houses, big and small, and their inhabitants are slurping up the water. 
And more are on the way. The recession stopped the Riverside County boom for a 
while. Now, heavy equipment and carpenters are back at work, putting up 
shopping centers and subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter landed in Domenigoni Valley. This is pre-industrial, 
pre-suburban California, not much changed from the days when Gov. Pio Pico 
granted this land, as part of the 47,800-acre Rancho Santa Rosa, to Juan Moreno 
on Jan. 30, 1846. But don't mourn for the land. If the MWD hadn't bought it for 
a reservoir, I'm sure it would have been subdivisions and reservoirs in a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 As we looked around the area, I talked to MWD General Manager John Wodraska 
and Elizabeth Ann Rieki, an assistant U.S. secretary of the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 The water officials, who have been criticized for being environmentally 
insensitive, spun their story about how they were at one with nature in 
developing this particular reservoir. At the headquarters building, they showed 
me how the engineers had saved the habitat of the rufous-crowned sparrow, the 
Stephens kangaroo rat, the San Diego horned lizard, the orange-throated 
whiptail and the California gnatcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving these species, in fact, is why Domenigoni Valley reservoir is taking 
shape with relatively little controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these creatures has protectors who'd go to court if a single one were 
threatened. Working with other agencies, the MWD helped buy more than 11,000 
acres of wildlife habitat, thus preventing a legal assault on the reservoir 
project.

 What was more interesting to me, however, was the Domenigoni Valley 
Reservoir's place in California's long-running water wars, fought over dividing 
a limited supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The water that will fill this reservoir will come from the Colorado River and 
the Feather River in Northern California. The Feather runs into the Sacramento 
River, and then to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where huge pumps 
constantly pull the water into the big aqueduct that carries it to Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The pumping has depleted the delta water supply, diminished its flow to nearby 
San Francisco Bay and all but wiped out the striped bass, once a favorite delta 
sport fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Northerners hate the south for this assault. By storing water in our new 
reservoir, pressure can be eased on the delta. The pumps can be turned off when 
the delta needs water the most. Instead of just exploiting the delta, we can 
help save it, and find a way to provide enough water for all California.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; NEW BUDGET TO RAISE WATER RATES, FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has a new $25.5-million budget for fiscal 1994-95 that raises water 
rates, eliminates vacant positions and increases fees for a variety of city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no new taxes, but city officials said the combination of cuts and 
fee hikes was necessary to balance the budget as city income continues to 
decline and the cost of providing services keep rising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as low and tight as it can go to maintain the level of services that 
you've got," Finance Director Brian Mayhew told the City Council, which 
approved the spending plan last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Water rates will go up 7 cents to $1.24 for every 748 gallons of water used. 
The 5.9% increase was the second this year and the sixth since 1991. City 
officials said the rate hike was necessary because of the higher cost of buying 
water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which 
supplies about 20% of the city's water. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city pays for a state required water treatment program and 
makes payments for funds borrowed to improve the water system, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Manager Robert Huntley said that the increase will take effect in 
July but that residents will start to see the change in their water bills by 
September and October. 
</P>
<P>
 For the average Westminster household, the increase would boost its water bill 
to about $24 a month, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, water rates increased from $1.14 to $1.17 for a unit of water, or 
about 748 gallons. Last year, water rates went up twice, first from 98 cents to 
99 cents, and then to $1.14 for every 748 gallons of water used. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, rates doubled from 63 cents to $1.26. But a public outcry 
over the increase forced the council to roll back the fees to 73 cents. The 
rates have steadily risen since. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that an $8.5-million bond sale this year used to finance 
improvements to the water system will help stabilize the rates in the years 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The water rate adjustment, however, will not affect those 62 or older whose 
household incomes are $18,000 or lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The council tentatively approved an ordinance last week that will exempt 
seniors under the income limit from paying a 5% utility tax imposed in 1985. 
For the past nine years, only those with incomes of $12,000 or less were 
exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayhew also said that the city would save about $400,000 from 11 positions 
eliminated this year that include six from the Police Department and three from 
the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, however, that the positions have been vacant for some time and no one 
was laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, the city has cut 20 positions, a 6% reduction of the 
city's work force that could hurt its ability to provide services in the 
future, Mayhew said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 348 employees serving a population of 81,000 people, one of the 
lowest ratios in Orange County, officials said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; STABBING VICTIM, 18, REMAINS HOSPITALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old man remained hospitalized with multiple stab wounds Tuesday, 
after he and a companion were attacked the previous night by gang members in 
Sigler Park, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 The attackers mistakenly believed the two young men were members of another 
gang, said Westminster Police Officer Greg Jackson.He said the case is under 
investigation as an attempted murder. No one has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said witnesses reported that the stabbing victim, Quintin Roman of 
Huntington Beach, was standing with Ricardo Cruz, 24, also of Huntington Beach, 
near a basketball court when several gang members accused them of being members 
of another gang. 
</P>
<P>
 After the two men denied belonging to a gang, Jackson said, witnesses saw 
their accusers leave the area. But about 15 minutes later when Roman and Cruz 
walked to their car, they were attacked by 10 to 12 gang members, he said, who 
stabbed Roman and beat Cruz repeatedly with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman and Cruz were driven by a family member to Huntington Beach Medical 
Center, where personnel at about 10 p.m. reported the beating and stabbing to 
police. Cruz was treated and released, Jackson said, while Roman was 
transferred to the trauma unit at UCI Medical Center in Orange.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; 2ND-PLACE FINISHER WILL GET RECOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The second-place finisher in the Republican primary for the 70th Assembly 
District will get a recount of the 44,778 votes cast in the June 7 election, 
the registrar of voters office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Thomas G. Reinecke, who lost to Marilyn C. Brewer by 172 votes, will 
pay the $358-per-day fee for the recount to ensure no votes were mistakenly 
counted.The recount is scheduled to begin Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke could not be reached for comment, but he said soon after the primary 
that he wanted to explore his options -- including a recount -- before 
conceding the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer said Tuesday that a recount would be futile because it would not change 
the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess any candidate has that prerogative," Brewer said. "I am unclear as to 
why he continues to belabor the point. I am the Republican nominee for the 70th 
District and a recount will not change that." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-way race in the district that runs along Orange County's central 
coast proved to be one of the state's most divisive Republican battled in the 
primary, with Brewer, Reinecke and Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond splitting 
the vote almost evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinecke has refused to publicly comment on whether he will endorse Brewer in 
the Nov. 8 general election, should the results remain unchanged. The 
Republican nominee will face Democrat Jim Toledano in November. GEBE MARTINEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; AUTO CLUB OFFICE EXPANSION APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Automobile Club of Southern California was given the go-ahead early 
Tuesday morning to double the size of its 467,000-square-foot complex at 
Fairview Road and Sunflower Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the project in a number of divided votes during a 
marathon public meeting attended by scores of supporters and opponents of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval caps a monthlong debate about whether the economic benefits of 
the Auto Club expansion are worth the increased traffic. Some critics also fear 
that the project will open the door for other large commercial centers on the 
bean fields north of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But Auto Club representatives and most of the speakers at Monday night's 
meeting argued that the expansion will boost the local economy by bringing in 
new jobs and additional tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a positive thing for the city of Costa Mesa and its residents," said 
Peter McDonald, Auto Club vice president.  
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Club plans to build about half-a-million square feet of office space 
in a "campus-like setting" on the company's 30-acre compound. The buildings 
will be used for administrative offices and an expanded data processing 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials predicted that the expansion will more than double the size of 
the Auto Club work force in Costa Mesa, from 1,135 to 2,509, making it the 
city's largest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent study concluded that the expansion would generate $150,000 in 
new fees for the city annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa business leaders were among the loudest supporters of the 
expansion. And even some residents who criticized the scope of the development 
acknowledged that the Auto Club is the kind of good neighbor the city should 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion is so large that it required the City Council to amend Costa 
Mesa's general plan. Councilman Jay Humphrey said he feared such an amendment 
would set a precedent for other developers seeking approval for projects that 
exceed zoning guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis also questioned a city consultant's estimates of the 
traffic that would be generated. Genis said she joined Humphrey in voting 
against the general plan amendment, in part because she felt the Auto Club did 
not give adequate assurances that it would keep the number of automobile trips 
below the consultant's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the club did agree to pay $228 for each trip that exceeds the estimate, 
said Donald Lamm, the deputy city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis also voted against the development agreement for the project, which 
authorizes the Auto Club to build all the phases of the project without further 
City Council approval. Council members Peter F. Buffa, Joe Erickson and Mary 
Hornbuckle as well as Humphrey voted in favor of the development agreement.

 The body was discovered by an officer who was investigating the car parked in 
the area of Westmont Drive and Euclid Street, Lt. Steve Brace said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>

LIMELIGHT FOLLOWED SIMPSON, DEPUTIES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: LOW-KEY OFFICERS WERE 
CAST IN HISTORY'S MOST GRIPPING FREEWAY DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For most of their careers the routine patrol stops of Orange County Sheriff's 
Deputy Larry Pool and Sgt. Jim Sewell would hardly make them players in the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, for one day, the deputies were in The Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The low-key pair were the front line chasing former football star-turned 
fugitive O.J. Simpson and his friend, Al Cowlings, through a freeway thicket of 
cheering spectators and television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 The game kicked off when Pool, 33, headed out after his shift Friday, 
wisecracking that he wasn't going home until he nabbed Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading north on the Santa Ana Freeway, Pool's joke wasn't so funny. The 
eight-year veteran caught a glimpse of a white Bronco on the swooping on-ramp 
from eastbound Jamboree Road. He sped alongside, easing into the Bronco's blind 
spot to check out the occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cowlings turned around and looked at me and smiled nervously," Pool said. 
"Then he turned right back around and continued driving. At that point, through 
the window tinting, it looked like Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Pool radioed to check the plate. It was a match. "I said, '10-4 I'm behind 
it,' " Pool said. "There was this really pregnant pause and all air traffic on 
the radio stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 As they headed north, Sewell, 40, joined the chase at 4th Street in Santa Ana. 
The pursuit turned tense when traffic stopped the Bronco at Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies got out of their cars, drew their guns and ordered Cowlings to 
turn off his engine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cowlings started screaming and swearing no and pounding both his fists on the 
driver's side door so violently he's actually shaking the whole car," Pool 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings shouted at the deputies to put their guns down, that Simpson was in 
the back of the car with a gun to his head, Pool said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with traffic clear in front, Cowlings took off down the freeway, 
launching a chase that would last 80 minutes, cross three freeways and reach 
speeds of 70 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 Behind him, a wedge of Orange County's finest fanned out, first Pool and 
Sewell and two other Orange County sheriff's cars, then three Santa Ana police 
cars, then an assortment of local agencies, which peeled off when their 
jurisdictions ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they hit the Los Angeles County line, the pursuit turned into an obstacle 
course with pedestrians crowding onto the freeway and cars filled with gawkers 
joining the chase, Pool said. The police cars had to merge into single file at 
some points to avoid pedestrians.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were portions of the highway where it looked like a concert had let out 
on the highway," Pool said. "They were really agitating Cowlings. Motorists 
would come up alongside him and would come really close and give him the thumbs 
up and he would violently swerve his vehicle at them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we were, following a truck with an armed murder suspect," Sewell said, 
"and they were waving and honking and holding up signs." 
</P>
<P>
 When they hit Sunset Boulevard, both deputies knew they were headed for 
Simpson's home. The chase ended in his Brentwood driveway when the Los Angeles 
police SWAT team let them know it was their ballgame now. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, both deputies said, they tried to keep their minds off the 
fact that they were chasing one of the most famous football heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mind was on everything that I had to take care of," Sewell said. "But in 
the back of my mind I'm thinking, 'This is O.J. Simpson and I am not going to 
lose him.' "

MORGAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN SLAYING NEAR ORANGE NIGHTCLUB 
</P>

 A parolee with three previous sexual assault convictions pleaded not guilty 
Tuesday to murdering a young Huntington Beach woman whose battered body was 
found outside an Orange nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, appeared briefly in Superior Court for 
arraignment on capital charges in connection with the May 20 slaying of Leanora 
Annette Wong, 23.The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Morgan last week on 
kidnaping, sexual assault and murder charges in the death of Wong, who 
witnesses said he met inside the nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges, which include the special allegations that the slaying took place 
during a kidnaping and sexual assault, make Morgan eligible for the death 
penalty if convicted. Prosecutors have not yet decided if they will pursue a 
death sentence. Morgan is scheduled to return to court July 8 to receive a 
trial date. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the case declined to comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a jail interview with The Times on Saturday, Morgan said he is innocent and 
disputed depictions of him as being a smooth-talking stalker who would romance 
women, then rape them. He said a security videotape that filmed the attack and 
the attacker is "not as explicit or graphic as they say." 
</P>
<P>
 Police allege Morgan lured Wong from the Australian Beach Club and killed her 
in a nearby parking lot, ripping apart her insides with an object detectives 
have yet to identify. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan previously was convicted in three sexual assault cases, and was 
arrested, but not prosecuted, after a fourth woman accused him of rape in 1993. 
The parole board revoked his parole after the last complaint, and he was freed 
from state prison earlier this year.

SON HELD IN FATHER'S DAY KILLING OF EMMY-WINNING TV ENGINEER

 The 15-year-old runaway son of an Emmy-award winning television sound engineer 
has been arrested on suspicion of shooting his adopted father to death on 
Father's Day, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered the body of Gayle Hansen, 51, on his family room floor in 
Cypress Monday afternoon, four hours after both his sister and his girlfriend 
reported him missing.Hansen, an ABC television employee, had been shot twice 
and had been dead since early Sunday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a struggle or forced entry, police said, but Hansen's car 
was missing from the home in the 5500 block of Citrus Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 1, Hansen had reported his son as a runaway, police said. The 
teen-ager also had run away from home in Paramount, where the two had lived 
until about two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our impression that there were some bad feelings toward the father by 
the son," said Cypress Police Lt. Jim Weuve. 
</P>
<P>
 Using leads from the runaway investigation, police tracked the teen-ager and 
the car to a Cerritos home. When the boy and an 11-year-old friend drove off, 
undercover police gave chase, Weuve said. Both boys were apprehended uninjured 
about 5:30 p.m. after the car smashed into a light pole. The 11-year-old was 
released to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was booked in Orange County Juvenile Hall, Weuve said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen won an Emmy for "individual achievement" for his work on the 1984 
Summer Olympic Games, Weuve said. The boy was the youngest of three children 
adopted by Hansen and his former wife, a resident of Eugene, Ore., he said. The 
15-year-old and his father lived at the home alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Weuve asked that anyone with information about the shooting call Cypress 
Police Department at (714) 229-6600.

ANAHEIM DELAYS DECISION ON PRIVATIZING GOLF COURSES; GOVERNMENT: PROPOSAL IS 
HOTLY DEBATED, WITH BACKERS CITING INCREASED REVENUE AND FOES A LOSS OF 
CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing a lack of "reliable" information, the City Council on Tuesday postponed 
a decision on a controversial proposal to privatize the operations of its two 
municipal golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed the city manager to re-evaluate the proposal following 
conflicting testimony over how much additional revenue a private contractor 
could bring to city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there are legitimate arguments on either side," said Mayor Tom 
Daly. But "until we have reliable numbers on the 20-year contract, I don't 
think the citizens of Anaheim can know what will happen."' 
</P>
<P>
 City analysts had recommended against privatization, saying financial benefits 
from having a private company operate the courses were minimal and did not 
justify the risk of losing control of the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of privatizing H.G. Dad Miller and Anaheim Hills golf courses was 
hotly debated among members of the audience Tuesday. Supporters said it would 
create additional revenue for the city, while opponents said the city would be 
losing control of a valuable asset. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Guerra, executive vice president of American Golf, which came in with the 
best privatization bid, told the council that the company would make about $2 
million worth of improvements to the courses' irrigation systems immediately if 
it is awarded a 20-year contract. The company would also pay rent of at least 
$1.6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city study, the private contractor would also bring in about 
$100,000 more in business annually than the city.  
</P>
<P>
 City park and recreation officials, however, said they could make up the 
difference with additional cuts, belt tightening and aggressive marketing of 
the courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't enough money in the deal to justify the risk, " said Chris Jarvi, 
director of parks and recreation. "The city does not see a good return." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Carole Geronsin agreed. She said American Golf stands "to make a 
mint" over the life of the contract. "Allow us to keep those funds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Davis, 33, of Anaheim said that if "the city can make money in any 
way, then it should privatize. I can't see this hurting the city of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Bob D. Simpson and Fred Hunter said they opposed the privatization 
because they felt that the return wasn't high enough to justify losing control 
of the courses and that the city should be loyal to its workers.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; USE TOOL KIT TO CUSTOMIZE SOFTWARE

<P>
 Remember the old Burger King jingle "Have It Your Way?" They were talking 
about hamburgers, but I feel the same way about software. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to have control over how my software operates. One option, I suppose, 
would be to write all my own programs. I could also build my own car, design my 
own home and grow all my own food. 
</P>
<P>
 Get real. I use commercial software. But that doesn't mean I give up control. 
There are ways to modify how you use commercial programs so they behave to your 
specifications rather than those of the company that designed the program. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, most of the high-end word-processing programs come with tools 
that let you customize the way the programs behave. Microsoft Word (DOS and 
Windows), WordPerfect (DOS, Mac and Windows) and Ami Pro (Windows) all have 
tools that give you control over the appearances of both the programs 
themselves and the documents they create. Tools include customized menus and 
button bars, templates, styles, abbreviations and macros. 
</P>
<P>
 A macro is a sequence of keystrokes, mouse movements or other commands you 
record so they can be "played back" by pressing a key, selecting a menu item or 
clicking on an icon. You can use a macro to reduce a long sequence of commands 
to a single action or to create an alternative way of issuing a single command. 
 
</P>
<P>
 I like to use Alt P to print a document, so with just about all the programs I 
use, I've assigned the printing function to that keystroke. I've even modified 
my Word for Windows and WordPerfect programs to use some of the same control 
keys I learned about 12 years ago when I used WordStar. This way, I haven't had 
to break old habits or learn new commands. In effect, I've created my own 
personal interface, which makes me more productive. I have another macro that 
formats my documents so they can be transmitted to my newspaper editor.  
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to use a keystroke to run a macro. The major full-featured 
word-processing programs allow you to customize menus and icons (buttons), and 
they all allow you to assign any macro or command to a menu item or button. I 
created a macro to send a fax from my word-processing program and assigned it 
to a button that, naturally, looks like a fax machine. A template is a file 
that contains text, formatting codes, macros or other material you can use to 
create a customized document. You might have a special format you use for an 
interoffice memo that differs from what you would use with a fax or a letter to 
a client. Another template could produce a customized invoice. The major 
programs come with templates for newsletters, brochures, letters and all sorts 
of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 A template can be stored as a file, which you can use when you're ready to 
create a document that's based on that template. The template could include 
your company logo, heading information (such as the standard top of a memo) or 
perhaps your company letterhead. A template can even prompt you for the name 
and address of the recipient, a title or any other information. 
</P>
<P>
 Templates can also contain a custom interface with different menu items, icons 
and other commands. I've created a special Word for Windows template for my 
children so that when they use Word, they get simpler menus, fewer icons, a 
larger typeface and an icon for inserting graphics. It's almost like having a 
special word-processing program just for kids.  
</P>
<P>
 A style gives you control over the look of a section of text. A single 
document can have multiple styles. You might have a style for indented text, 
another for long quotations, one for listings, one for tables and another for 
multiple-column formats.  
</P>
<P>
 Word was the first program to offer styles, but they're now in WordPerfect and 
Ami Pro. After you've assigned a style to a section of text, you can make a 
change in the style itself and watch as the text is changed automatically. 
Styles can determine the font, type size, indenting and just about any other 
formatting options.  
</P>
<P>
 All of the high-end programs also let you use abbreviations or "auto-text." 
You could, for example, have the program automatically translate "CIA" into 
"Central Intelligence Agency." This same feature in Word can automatically 
correct spelling. Type "comptuer" and Word changes it to "computer." You can 
even assign a graphic to an abbreviation, or you can create a macro that 
inserts a graphic. I have a macro that automatically inserts a scanned image of 
my signature for outgoing faxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, each program differs in how it implements each of these features. 
Less expensive programs, such as Microsoft Works and Q&A Write, offer some 
customization features, but they are generally not as extensive as what you'll 
get with a full-featured word processor.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Microsoft Windows comes with a built-in macro program called Recorder 
that gives you the ability to create keyboard shortcuts that work with most 
Windows programs. However, Recorder is not as sophisticated or easy to use as 
the macro features included in the major word-processing programs.

FAMILY; BAROQUE ORCHESTRA RESURRECTS PAPA BACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children and their parents can get the lowdown on the 18th-Century doings of 
Johann Sebastian Bach and sons in "Meet Papa Bach," an open-air children's 
program by the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra at the John Anson Ford 
Amphitheatre in Hollywood on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 With family as the show's demystifying theme, L.A. Baroque will introduce the 
melodies, rhythms and harmonies that raised the eyebrows of the Bach clan's 
contemporaries. Acclaimed keyboard player Edward Murray appears at the 
harpsichord in the title role. He and the other soloists will not only play 
period instruments but wear historical garb for a theatrical touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is really to humanize baroque music for a general audience," Murray 
said, "and present it in an appealing way in costume. We're (using) Papa Bach 
and his family, because family is a concept everyone will relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 The family-friendly concert should appeal to "any school-age children up 
through, say, junior high," Murray said. If you discover you want more, the 
company will be performing a full-length adult concert that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Meet Papa Bach," John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East, 
Hollywood, Saturday, 10 a.m., $7; (213) 466-1767. * 
</P>
<P>
 Not Just Clowning Around: Did you, or will you, greet a new arrival this year? 
Think your little bundle will want to go to the circus, in, say 1999 . . . for 
free? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, check out a rather clever marketing strategy from the folks at Ringling 
Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus: They will give any baby born in 1994 a free 
ticket for his or her first trip to the Big Top, whenever that may be. 
</P>
<P>
 For junior's Special Gift Certificate, good for one admission ticket in any 
city, in this year or any year, parents just have to send their name and 
address, plus the name and date of birth of their newborn to: Ringling Bros. 
and Barnum & Bailey Circus, P.O. Box 39485, Edina, Minn. 55439. 
</P>
<P>
 Well over 600,000 certificates were sent out in 1993, the first year of the 
offer. Talk about a ready-made audience for all those folks in big shoes and 
funny noses. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: For precocious infants, or for fans in general, the circus will be in 
town this year July 20-25 at the Long Beach Arena, July 27-Aug. 2 at the L.A. 
Sports Arena and Aug. 4-14 at the Anaheim Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tickets are on sale now at those box offices, or call Ticketmaster at (714) 
740-2000 or (213) 480-3232.

TV RATINGS; ARRESTING COVERAGE DEFLATES NBC'S NBA NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DANIEL CERONE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ABC used a strong slate of sitcom repeats led by "Home Improvement," with Tim 
Allen, and "Grace Under Fire" -- and newsmagazines to wrest last week's ratings 
championship from NBC, whose NBA Finals on Friday were dramatically affected by 
news coverage of O.J. Simpson's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But NBC did beat CBS, last season's top-rated network, for the week with a 9.3 
rating, followed by 8.3 for CBS and 5.1 for Fox. ABC led with a 9.7, according 
to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, NBC won the week for the first time in a year because of the 
first three games of pro basketball's championship between the Houston Rockets 
and the New York Knicks. But NBC was hurt last Friday by lower ratings for Game 
5 in New York, which finished No. 46 for the week, compared to No. 9 for Game 
4. 
</P>
<P>
 The network blames extensive live news coverage of the Simpson chase in 
Southern California -- which NBC affiliates covering at least 10% of the 
country, including KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, chose to broadcast instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first six games, the NBA Finals are averaging an 11.3 rating, down 
37% from the first six games of last season's matchup between the Chicago Bulls 
and the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Disney's new animated feature "The Lion King" promises to be a 
blockbuster based on the interest in an ABC special last Wednesday, which 
finished at No. 13. Southland Ratings

SHAKEN TRUST; BUSINESS OWNER SAYS QUAKE AID RULES LET MANY FALL THROUGH CRACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 " I feel like I've been rolled and pleated I can't prove it, but I think I was 
cheated I woke up without a single dime And I swear on my horse, I have seen 
the light If I had a horse, I would be alright But now it's time to move on 
down the line. " -- "Only Game in Town" by Ronn Crowder 
</P>
<P>
 Ronn Crowder, an aspiring country musician and songwriter, need look no 
further than his own life for the stuff of mournful blues and blue collar 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from Tennessee to the San Fernando Valley in 1981, Crowder bought a 
home and established his own typesetting business, only to see his life wrecked 
by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 He has filed for personal bankruptcy -- in which he will probably lose his 
house -- and now plans to move back to Tennessee next month. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Linda, and their two sons, Clayton, 12, and Ronnie, 7, are 
selling most of their personal belongings at weekend yard sales, both to raise 
money for groceries and because they cannot afford to take much with them on 
the drive back to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder, 47, seeks no pity, but he is angry and frustrated that after years of 
being a good citizen and taxpayer, he seems to have fallen through the cracks 
of a system that is supposed to help people get back on their feet after a 
disaster like the 6.8 quake that damaged his home and business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't lose everything in the quake like many others did, but $18,000 in 
damage to his modest two-bedroom home and another $3,000 to his typesetting 
equipment in a home office is a bigger loss than he can handle without help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He received a $1,400 grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but 
he has been turned down by every other government agency to which he has turned 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never asked for any of this stuff before," Crowder said Saturday during 
a break from trying to sell clothing and other odds and ends from his front 
yard. "I'm baffled. I don't understand any of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I've fallen through the cracks of the system. We were part of the 
middle-class tax base. When we really needed it, the system failed us. All 
those years we were good citizens, paying our taxes and not breaking the law . 
. . that don't mean anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA officials respond that government disaster assistance was never meant as 
a replacement for private insurance. Other than FEMA grants that averaged about 
$2,500 to take care of immediate short-term housing needs and repairs right 
after the quake, most government assistance comes in the form of loans from the 
Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But loans are expected to be paid back, said SBA spokeswoman Diane Brady, so 
the agency withholds loans from those who appear unable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the most common reason someone is declined," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, almost half the applications for aid are rejected, according to 
government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June 18, only about 67,000 of 124,000 applications processed for 
personal and family SBA loans were approved. Only about 9,500 of 17,000 
business applications were approved, and only 1,600 of 6,500 applications were 
approved in a separate program that provides working capital for companies that 
lost business as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the SBA has provided quake victims with a combined total of nearly $2.3 
billion in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder, however, calls his a classic Catch-22 situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the cash flow (to repay a loan) because I don't have my 
equipment, and I don't have my equipment because I can't get a loan to fix it 
or replace it," Crowder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder and his family moved to Los Angeles 13 years ago to fulfill his dream 
of becoming a musician and songwriter. But recognizing that would take time, he 
enrolled at Los Angeles Valley College in Van Nuys and studied journalism. 
After graduating, he was offered a job as a reporter at a local newspaper for 
$250 a week, but realized that would not house and feed his wife and two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his journalism studies, Crowder had learned about typesetting. He 
worked for a few years for a typesetting company, then in 1986 he started his 
own business and bought a small house in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 After many of his clients went out of business following the 1992 riots, 
Crowder received a $21,000 SBA loan designed to help riot-impacted businesses, 
and slowly started to rebuild his client base. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Northridge earthquake hit, damaging most of his business equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like tens of thousands of others, he applied for disaster assistance. After 
receiving a FEMA grant for $1,400 to make immediate repairs to his home, he 
expected to qualify for another SBA loan. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this month, he was notified that his loan was denied because SBA 
officials didn't believe he could repay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Crowder's wife, Linda, 35, had been fired from her job with the 
Federal Reserve Bank in April after 13 years because she began making mistakes, 
which she blames on fatigue from working overtime to make up for their lost 
income and nerves rattled by the continuing aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 After the SBA turndown, Crowder's application was forwarded to the state 
Individual and Family Grant Program, a last resort, bare-minimum disaster 
assistance program, which could not help him because he was self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the IFGP confirmed that business losses for self-employed 
people are not covered under the program, which is designed to cover only 
immediate survival needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute, this is America," Crowder commented. "You're going to penalize 
me because I'm self-employed? What happened to rewarding initiative?" 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder could not turn to the state's CALDAP program, a last resort loan 
program for homeowners, because voters this month turned down a bond measure 
that would have provided money for it. 
</P>
<P>
 He did receive a voucher from the Red Cross to buy a new stove. But he had to 
turn down an offer from Habitat for Humanity, a nonprofit group that helps 
low-income families build homes, to provide the labor to fix his damaged roof 
because he can't afford the materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind in house and car payments, the credit cards charged to the limit and 
running out of money, the Crowders filed for bankruptcy in May to stave off 
creditors and give them time to rethink their future. They applied for help 
from the county Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, but when they 
admitted they had a $10,000 retirement account, they were denied help until 
that money was exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Kiehl, AFDC program administrator for Los Angeles County, said program 
recipients are limited to $2,000 in property, including bank and retirement 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we couldn't touch that money because if we withdrew it, then under the 
bankruptcy filing they would take it to pay the creditors," explained Crowder, 
adding that he is in debt nearly $200,000, including a $150,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 But while his finances are falling apart, Crowder's music career may finally 
be coming together. 
</P>
<P>
 He has signed with personal manager Rob E. Brondell and record producer Danny 
Sheridan, contacts he made while performing at a fund-raiser the day before the 
Northridge quake and again while helping clean up Sheridan's quake-damaged 
recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowder plans to continue both his typesetting business and his pursuit of a 
music career in Tennessee, and is trying to make the move a positive 
experience, both for himself and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "This experience has brought us all closer together," he said. "The boys were 
back in their room sorting out their toys to see which ones they were willing 
to sell. It's kind of neat. They were showing their family spirit. Of course, I 
wouldn't make them sell anything they didn't really want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having to start over, Crowder remains upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things we are losing are just material things," he said. "You lose a 
little face, but there was nothing else we could do. We did our best. So what's 
to feel bad about? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be depicted as poor, poor pitiful people. We'll be OK. But I 
hope that FEMA and the SBA will fill those cracks that we and a lot of other 
people have fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people like us are totally denied by everybody, then geez, there 
something wrong."

POLICE SWEEPS APPROVED FOR EARTHQUAKE 'GHOST TOWNS'; STRATEGY: DAMAGED AND 
VACANT BUILDINGS WILL BE EMPTIED OF SQUATTERS, BOARDED UP AND THEN PATROLLED BY 
SECURITY GUARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to eliminate dangerous quake ghost towns, a Los Angeles City Council 
committee Tuesday authorized police sweeps of the vacant quake-damaged 
buildings, to be followed by boarding up and patrolling by private security 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The get-tough strategy will begin with a blitz by city building inspectors on 
Monday to identify which buildings are public safety hazards. The approach was 
developed by a task force of city department heads, who have now identified 13 
neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and Mid City areas where 
clusters of vacant buildings have become havens for squatters, vandals, 
scavengers and drug users. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the so-called ghost towns, each with about 10 vacant 
apartment buildings or condominium projects, has left neighboring homeowners 
and merchants fearful that the blight and crime will spread -- and in some 
cases they already are spreading -- to adjacent communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vandals are coming into our units even though they are boarded up," Pam 
Nelson, one of 20 townhouse owners at the El Dorado Townhomes in Sylmar, told 
the committee. She said only eight owners are willing to rebuild their units 
there. "We're stuck and we need security and we can't afford security." 
</P>
<P>
 With about $240 million in local and federal emergency funds, the task force 
outlined a 120-day schedule for clearing out, securing and demolishing 
buildings in the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the costs of sealing up the buildings might be passed on to property 
owners, particularly if federal money is not secured. But to encourage 
reconstruction where possible, funds also will be set aside for rebuilding 
loans to those who cannot secure loans elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The task force is hoping that within 120 days we will have a lot of 
rebuilding happening," said Pat Bonino, a chief analyst for the city 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery approved the strategy on 
Tuesday, members said they remained frustrated that the city could not move 
faster to demolish problem buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a danger to people, tear the damn things down," said Councilman 
Hal Bernson, who heads the committee and has five ghost towns in his district. 
"Let's get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy would include the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning Monday, city inspectors will inspect buildings in ghost towns to 
identify structures that are a public safety hazard and are occupied by 
trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Owners of buildings deemed hazardous will be sent notices giving them 10 
days to clear out trespassers and board up and fence their property. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the owner of a hazardous building does not respond in that time period, 
police will clear it of trespassers, and crews will board and fence the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private security guards will be hired by the city for up to 120 days to 
protect those buildings where city officials believe there may be a continuing 
problem with trespassers. 
</P>
<P>
 While buildings are being boarded up, building and safety officials also will 
speed up the demolition process for structures determined to be public hazards. 
City officials say they can begin demolition within two weeks after a building 
has been identified as a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has already demolished 35 severely damaged buildings and is in the 
process of tearing down another 75, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 To pay for the security measures, Bonino said, the city can use $20 million 
provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and $99 million 
from a federal community development block grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who requested the task force be formed, asked that 
the city also press the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reimburse the 
city for the costs, even though FEMA officials have previously indicated that 
the problem does not qualify for emergency funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The communities are being torn apart," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If FEMA does not reimburse the city, Bonino said the city will put liens on 
the problem properties to force the building owners to pay for the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 For structures that can be rebuilt, housing officials will urge the Small 
Business Administration to give top priority to loan applications submitted by 
owners of ghost town buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort, Bonino said the city has about $116 million in local and 
federal quake recovery and housing money that could be extended as loans to the 
property owners.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; YMCA GETS LOAN TO FIX HOUSING COMPLEX 
</P>

<P>
 The city of Glendale will provide $250,000 to the YMCA to refurbish a 
71-year-old apartment building used to shelter single and elderly low-income 
and homeless residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Housing Authority voted unanimously Tuesday to lend the nonprofit 
organization money to remodel a 22-unit building at 119 N. Kenwood St. and 
repair damage to the structure caused by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year loan will be forgiven if the YMCA meets the terms of an agreement 
drawn up between the YMCA and the city to provide affordable housing to people 
with incomes below $27,050 for a one-person household. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, rents at the complex are required not to exceed $380 for 
a studio apartment and $504 for a one-bedroom unit. Funds for the project will 
be taken from $1.4 million provided to the city by the federal government as 
part of the HOME Investment Partnerships Act Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Money provided by the Housing Authority, whose members include the City 
Council, will be used to paint the structure, refurbish the kitchens and 
bathrooms, and update electrical and plumbing systems, said Madalyn Blake, 
director of community development and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to refurbish the apartments fits with the city's goal to provide 
transitional housing for low-income residents and families who are on the verge 
of homelessness, City Manager David Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials decided to pursue transitional housing options after a task 
force on homelessness recommended that the City Council pursue a "continuum of 
care" for Glendale's homeless, including a transitional shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The report claimed that up to 360 young families, elderly, singles and 
mentally ill spend the night under the stars in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are scheduled to present a rehabilitation agreement between the 
city and the YMCA for the apartment complex to the Housing Authority for its 
approval within three months. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 The Glendale Housing Authority voted Tuesday to negotiate with the city of 
Pasadena and a nonprofit group, the Pasadena Housing Alliance, to build housing 
for low-income families from both cities who are trying to escape homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 During negotiations, officials will discuss a request that Glendale donate 
$600,000 toward a $2.2-million regional housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's portion of the project money would be taken from $2.3 million 
provided to the city by the federal government as part of the HOME Investment 
Partnerships Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials, working with the Pasadena Housing Alliance, plan to 
purchase land and three structures at 154-160 S. Euclid Ave. in Pasadena for a 
regional housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to refurbish buildings at the site to provide 20 one- and 
two-bedroom units, a manager's unit, a social services office and an 
infant-care facility within the project -- known as Euclid Villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena officials are working to get financing for the project, and plan to 
apply for several grants and hold a fund-raising campaign to complement 
$507,000 in funding from Pasadena, and Glendale's possible $600,000 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project falls through, an agreement will allow Glendale, Pasadena and 
the alliance to pursue land for other regional housing opportunities, said 
Madalyn Blake, Glendale director of community development and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan drawn up for Euclid Villa by the alliance, low-income families, 
primarily single parents with children, will be referred to the housing project 
by nonprofit agencies serving the homeless in Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project reaches fruition, Pasadena agencies would be allowed to place 
families in half the units, while Glendale nonprofit organizations would have 
access to the other half. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; SUSPECT SOUGHT IN 3 ABDUCTION ATTEMPTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are warning residents to be on the lookout for a man who has tried 
three times to abduct girls in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bill Greene of the San Fernando Police Department said Tuesday that his 
department has released a composite sketch of the man officials believe is 
responsible for accosting three girls since April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making the assumption that they are related because of the similarities 
of the vehicle and the suspect's description," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a white male, between 35 and 50 years old, green 
or brown eyes, gray-white or brownish-gray hair, with a mustache and goatee. He 
also has a large cross tattooed on his upper right arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene described the suspect's vehicle as a white, late model Mercury Tempo or 
Ford Taurus. There is no link between the suspect and the Valley molester, 
Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident occurred June 1 about 5:15 p.m. when a man encountered a 
young girl in the 1000 block of Holister Street. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the man told the girl to get in the car, saying he would 
take her home to her mother. When the girl refused and turned around, the man 
drove the car into a driveway and cut her off. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the girl glanced inside the car and discovered that the man had 
exposed himself and was performing a lewd act. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was able to run around the car and make an escape," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other incidents in April, which took place on the 500 block of Harding 
Street, were similar, Greene said. All have involved elementary-school age 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene is asking parents in the area to warn their children not to talk to or 
take rides from strangers. Anyone spotting the suspect should call the San 
Fernando Police Department immediately at (818) 898-1267. If he is in the 
vehicle, police say, try to get the license plate number, but do not approach 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still fielding clues on the case," Greene said. "We appreciate any help 
the community may be able to give us." JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN STUDENTS SHOW RETURNS IN STOCK CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Generation X-ers aren't widely known for their financial responsibility, 
the Cal State Northridge Foundation last year gave a few twenty-somethings a 
chance -- and $500,000 -- to change that image. 
</P>
<P>
 It's paid off for both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation is $8,651 richer, and the students have proven they can play 
with the financial big boys -- and whip a few of them at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did better than (Standard & Poor's 500, a financial index), so I guess we 
did pretty well," student Carlos Camargo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camargo, 28, was one of 13 members of the most recent student investment 
management class, which he said learned much about real-world financial markets 
and at the same time made a little money for the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8,651 return on $500,000 was indeed "a little, not a lot," said William 
Jennings, class teacher and chairman of the finance department. But, he added, 
"This was a very tough year (for investors). They did about the same as the 
market as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more, in fact, with the average return coming in at 1.5%, according 
to Standard & Poor's 500, while the class had a 1.6% return. 
</P>
<P>
 The program at CSUN is the latest of about 23 around the country, said 
foundation Executive Director Don Queen. About half of the other school 
foundations, however, offer the money only to graduate classes; the students at 
CSUN are all undergraduates. And the $500,000 portfolio those undergrads handle 
is probably the third or fourth largest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for giving students -- some of whom still take laundry home to mom 
-- real money is it helps them take their studies seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 Students last term made elaborate studies of companies, charting their 
financial success, investigating their methods of management, Camargo said. 
They drew up charts and made presentations to classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our textbook was Barron's, the Wall Street Journal, Business Week, stuff like 
that," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem so far with the class has been the spurt of furious 
competition it caused. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has four financial planners handling its $7-million endowment, 
said Queen, but during the first semester of the class, students began showing 
better numbers than the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were busting their buttons on that one," Queen said. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; COMMUNITY MURAL TO BE UNVEILED SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A community mural painted by local teen-agers under the direction of 
nationally known artists will be unveiled Saturday in Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will be at 11 a.m. at the Al Jal Inc. building, 11308 Penrose 
St., near San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Depicting scenes from the history of Sun Valley, work on the four-panel mural 
was begun in April. The mural's completion was thrown off-track temporarily 
when vandals splattered black paint across two panels in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally known artist Joe Gonzalez was hired by the sponsoring Sun Valley 
Community Venture Council for $10,000 to head the project. Gonzalez initiated a 
series of murals in East Los Angeles in the 1970s and painted the commemorative 
mural for the 1984 Summer Olympics near the Los Angeles Coliseum. He also did a 
portrait of Edward James Olmos for the cover of Time magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez commissioned local resident Frank Martinez to design the Sun Valley 
mural, which depicts scenes from prehistoric times and Native American life to 
the times of Spanish missionaries and stagecoaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez and Martinez have worked on projects for the Smithsonian Institution 
and Hands Across America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Valley Community Venture Council looks at the project -- which is in 
view of passing Metrolink trains and the nearby Golden State Freeway -- as a 
way to attract attention to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of United Way, community groups and teen-age artists and their 
families will participate in Saturday's unveiling. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; ELECTRICAL SHORT FORCES EVACUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An electrical short forced the temporary evacuation of about a dozen workers 
from the old San Fernando police station Tuesday, causing no injuries but a few 
bad cases of deja vu.  
</P>
<P>
 The station is now being used by the Los Angeles city attorney's office, whose 
offices at the San Fernando Courthouse were deemed unsafe after the Northidge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "First the earthquake, now this," said Paula Zamacona, a deputy city attorney. 
"We've had so many things happen that we just keep a camera handy." 
</P>
<P>
 But evacuation of the makeshift office at the police station, 120 MacNeil St., 
was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters responding to a complaint of smoke coming from a vent about 10:30 
a.m. discovered that it was only an electrical problem with the 
air-conditioning system. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrical workers from the city of San Fernando were called to fix the 
problem. Workers from the city attorney's office were back in the building by 2 
p.m. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; BOARD ADJUSTS PERMIT FOR HORSE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Zoning Appeals on Tuesday granted a horse boarding 
and training business in Granada Hills the right to keep up to 70 horses and 
modified several other conditions on a 10-year operating permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding and training facility, called Whispering Winds Ranch, is on 7.2 
acres near Zelzah Avenue and Ridgeway Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator of the ranch, Ronald Lowe, appealed more than a dozen conditions 
imposed under a new operating permit by the city's zoning administrator. The 
ranch's previous 10-year operating permit expired last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board agreed with Lowe on several conditions, including increasing the 
maximum number of horses from 50 to 70, and modifying the manure removal 
schedule, operating hours and street dedication requirements, said Ed Barr, a 
city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe's appeal was supported by several neighbors who said the ranch is 
well-run and would not be financially successful under the conditions proposed 
by the zoning administrator. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; AIR QUALITY TOP CONCERN IN SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The top environmental priority for Calabasas residents is the quality of the 
air they breathe, according to a survey conducted by a city advisory group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise because in all of the L.A. basin, this region is among the 
best spots you can live in for air quality," said City Councilwoman Lesley 
Devine."We have been approaching air quality as a traffic-related problem, but 
it may be time to coordinate our efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Although air pollution is usually viewed as a regional problem, some local 
solutions -- including tree planting in parking lots and along the Ventura 
Freeway, the purchase of electric or natural gas vehicles for the city and 
public awareness campaigns -- may be within reach, Devine said. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey mailed by the Environmental Standards Committee to about 7,000 
Calabasas households in May and tallied last week ranked air quality, water 
quality, wildlife protection and recycling, respectively, as the top 
environmental concerns for residents of the semi-rural town. Only about 1% of 
the surveys were returned, which Devine blamed, in part, on their placement in 
a mailer about city recreation services. 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving oak trees and other native life, water conservation and trash 
reduction were ranked last as priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Devine said the survey was meant to help steer the committee as it moves 
beyond recommending city policies regarding oak trees, curbside recycling, 
scenic corridors and native plant use. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of specific work when the city first formed," Devine said. 
"Right now, we're at a crossroads, wondering where we should go next. Having 
input from the public would help us prioritize that." KURT PITZER

19 INJURED IN BRAWL BETWEEN LATINO AND BLACK PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen inmates were injured Tuesday when black and Latino prisoners fought 
in a 90-men dormitory at the Pitchess jail, the latest in a long series of such 
brawls, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight broke out at 3:55 p.m. when a Latino inmate accused a black inmate 
of stealing from him, said Deputy Rich Erickson, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known how many of the inmates housed in the medium-security 
dormitory at the sprawling Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho participated in the 
brawl, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates used broomstick handles, homemade jail knives and telephone receivers 
as weapons in the 10-minute fight before sheriff's deputies fired three rubber 
bullets to restore order, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most seriously injured men were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital 
where one was treated for a puncture wound in the chest and another was treated 
for severe facial cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine others were taken to County-USC Medical Center, where they were treated 
for a variety of cuts and bruises, Erickson said. The other inmates involved in 
the fight were treated at the jail, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said jail officials will try to determine who was responsible for 
initiating the fight and transfer them to other jail facilities.

<P>
 "I believe she has shown herself to be somewhat flighty," Luros observed as he 
set Sellers' bail at $100,000 -- the amount requested by Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Carol Fisch. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Barry Hammond said the bail was 10 times the amount usually 
set for the offense Sellers is charged with -- receiving stolen property. He 
said Sellers, who rents a $450-a-month apartment in West Hollywood, could not 
afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luros, who ordered Sellers jailed last week when she failed to keep an 
agreement to surrender for booking, said her conduct justified the high bail. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Sellers, the 29-year-old daughter of the late British comic 
actor Peter Sellers and actress Britt Eckland, had changed lawyers and 
addresses, and that she had given authorities her theatrical agent's address as 
her home address. When deputies went to the Hollywood home last week to arrest 
Sellers, the agent said she hadn't seen Sellers in two months, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers testified that she didn't realize she would be arrested if she didn't 
surrender. She said she thought her lawyer would handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to go by myself and I wanted a lawyer to come with me to go 
through the procedure," Sellers said. But she had trouble reaching Hammond, and 
Hammond had trouble reaching her because she had no phone and her pager broke, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any excuse for that. I thought in my head that if I didn't hear 
from you, you would page me and I would call you back," she told Hammond during 
her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through my own fault, I did not call. I'm truly sorry I did not call," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond said Sellers has no access to her family money and no one has offered 
to help, except "friends who don't have any money." 
</P>
<P>
 Luros ordered Sellers jailed last week after she failed to meet a deadline to 
surrender to detectives at the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley 
station for booking and fingerprinting. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Joel Price testified that he told Sellers to call him, and she never 
did, even though the arrangements were meant to spare her an arrest that would 
be highly publicized. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Sellers became a minor celebrity as a sidekick to alleged 
Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss, a longtime close friend, and accompanied Fleiss 
to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers' own day in court attracted several journalists with British accents 
-- but no Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers was charged last month with receiving jewelry police say was taken in 
a series of armed robberies allegedly committed by her boyfriend and bodyguard. 
Detectives say they found stolen gold and gemstone jewelry in Sellers' dresser 
drawers and under her bed during a search of the Northridge house she shared 
with the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers appeared drawn following five days in jail. Luros refused to allow her 
to change into street clothes, even though Hammond had brought her a new dress. 
The lawyer toted the black print dress in a shopping bag, and its price tag was 
visible: $39.99. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the dress had not been dry-cleaned and sealed in a plastic bag, 
as required by court security rules. 
</P>
<P>
 At another hearing today in Superior Court, Hammond will ask Judge Stanley M. 
Weisberg to grant Sellers a lower bail so she can get out of jail. Hammond 
contended in court papers that Sellers has been held on illegally high bail.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA WILL CONSIDER RESTRICTING 
PEDDLERS; BUSINESS: SOME MERCHANTS ARE AGGRAVATED BY ROADSIDE VENDORS. COUNCIL 
WILL HOLD TWO PUBLIC MEETINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, opportunists seeking a fast 
buck descended on Santa Clarita, selling "I survived" T-shirts and other quake 
souvenirs from vans and car trunks. 
</P>
<P>
 That rekindled the longstanding complaints by Santa Clarita merchants that the 
peddlers undercut prices because they don't have to pay rent or property taxes 
and often ignore licensing fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the time has come to stop being wishy-washy," said Councilwoman Jan 
Heidt at a recent meeting. "Because we want to see one hot dog stand, one fruit 
stand, we've allowed all these other things to proliferate." 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake souvenirs have gone now but the argument hasn't, so the city 
has scheduled meetings at 7 p.m. today at City Hall and 7 p.m. Thursday at 
Sierra Vista Junior High School to gather public comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials are considering amending the city business license 
ordinance, which now treats peddlers the same as other merchants, to limit 
where peddlers can do business and the length of time they may stay in one 
location. The new regulations might even ban peddling. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no official count of how many peddlers sell items from empty lots and 
roadsides on an average day, but an informal survey turned up more than a 
dozen. Fruits and vegetables, sunglasses, ceramic pots and throw rugs can all 
be bought from the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce is waiting to review 
proposed changes before taking a stand, vice president Viki Rudolph 
acknowledged the chamber is concerned about peddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see people that string up a line between two cars and put up some 
rugs, that's not the image we're trying to project," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one roadside vendor believes Santa Clarita should determine which 
peddlers are operating illegally before condemning them all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they enforce the regulations they have, they wouldn't have a peddler 
problem," said Terry Ramsey, owner of the Fresh Berries fruit stand on Soledad 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey said she pays rent for her location, and can quickly produce receipts 
for annual fees she pays to operate legally -- $200 for a plot plan to Los 
Angeles County, $150 to the Department of Agriculture, $128 to the Health 
Department and $45 for a business license. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the possibility of added restrictions, Ramsey plans to continue with 
her roadside stand because it allows her to sell what she wants, when she wants 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's freedom. You can offer the best product for people at the best prices," 
she said. "We've had stores. It's like being in prison."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; INJURED GIRL'S CONDITION UPGRADED

<P>
 A teen-age girl who was given only a 10% chance to live after an auto accident 
three weeks ago has been upgraded from critical to stable condition, Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbara Du Bois, 14, one of five girls in a car that collided with two 
other vehicles June 1, is still in a coma, hospital spokeswoman Deborah Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still praying," said Mary McWilliams, Du Bois' grandmother and 
guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois sustained brain damage and her left arm may be partially paralyzed, 
doctors have told McWilliams. An encouraging sign is that Du Bois has been 
taken off an oxygen machine and is breathing on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of brain damage suffered won't be known until Du Bois comes out of 
her coma, McWilliams said. Du Bois, who is left-handed, will also likely have 
to learn to write and perform other tasks with her right hand as part of her 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have told us it will be a very, very long rehabilitation period," 
McWilliams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred when Du Bois' sister, JoKema, 15, was driving home from 
a church youth group meeting in her grandmother's car. JoKema was reportedly 
weaving the car back and forth to amuse a 3-year-old girl in the car when she 
swerved across the center line into oncoming traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 JoKema Du Bois, Gena Watkinson, 15, and the toddler, Jesika Noell, were killed 
in the collision. The fifth girl in the car, Alicia Acevedo, 14, is in stable 
condition at the Northridge hospital.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REPUTED GANG MEMBER SENTENCED FOR ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 19-year-old reputed gang member wept as he was sentenced Tuesday to six 
years in prison for sexually assaulting a 12-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher O'Dell was convicted on one felony count of performing a lewd act 
upon a child in the July 9, 1993, incident.The girl was attacked in the 
bathroom of a friend's house in Saugus, unaware that the residence had become a 
popular gang hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the sentencing, O'Dell's mother asked for leniency for her son, as did 
a friend who said the teen-ager often takes care of his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, both of them talked about how he's severed his gang affiliations," 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Noyes. 
</P>
<P>
 But a letter presented to Superior Court Judge Charles Peven from the victim's 
mother said that the girl, now 13, is "depressed, no longer seems to care about 
the things she is interested in and seems to be in fear," Noyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother did not request a specific sentence in her letter. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl testified during the trial that she had decided to take a shower 
after a shaving cream fight at the house and was sexually assaulted by O'Dell 
as she was drying off. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said the house had turned into a gang hangout earlier during 
the summer when a father left his 20-year-old daughter in charge of the house. 
The woman was dating a gang member, and others in his group soon frequented the 
house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Dell will be eligible for parole in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Peven could have sentenced him to a maximum of eight years in prison, or 
a minimum sentence of probation after a year or less in County Jail, Noyes 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; IDENTIFYING BODY FOUND IN CANYON COULD TAKE 
MONTHS 
</P>

 Investigators said Tuesday it could take months to determine if skeletal 
remains found near a wrecked truck in a canyon north of Castaic are those of a 
suspect from a January, 1993, murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck, discovered Saturday, belongs to Mark Douglas Snyder, 29, of 
Winnetka.Snyder's family and friends said they are certain he committed suicide 
by driving the truck off the 400-foot cliff the night of the slaying. But 
officials want to make sure Snyder didn't place the body of an innocent person 
in the truck and send the vehicle over the cliff to aid his escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder is suspected of shooting his friend, Christ James Wetzel, 27, in the 
head at the garage of a Northridge home on Jan. 14, 1993. Those close to Snyder 
said they didn't know why the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, an anthropologist will examine the skull and other bone fragments 
found in the truck, but identifying the body will probably be a long process, 
said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may try to return to that scene at some point, scour the area, and see 
what they can look for," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's family is trying to obtain dental and other medical records that 
might aid the investigation, said Tom Broad, chief homicide investigator for 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing remarkable about the teeth, so we're going to have to take 
some time," Broad said. "We don't even know the dentist who treated him." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials recovered hair samples when they removed the truck from the 
canyon Monday, with one officer stating the hair was long, similar to Snyder's. 
But Broad said detectives do not have hair samples from Snyder to compare to 
those found at the crash scene.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HIGHLAND HIGH SCHOOL LOSES 2ND BID FOR CHARTER 
STATUS 
</P>

 Teachers' hopes of reinventing the educational system at Highland High School 
have been dashed for a second time, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of a charter school there waited too long to file an appeal after 
the proposal was rejected in January by the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District board of trustees, according to the Los Angeles County Office of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is clear that the notice (of appeal) shall be filed within 30 
days," said Jim Parker of the county education office. The Highland High 
charter committee filed the appeal last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said the committee working toward charter status will be notified that 
its appeal will not be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said attorneys reviewed the county's policies on charter appeals after 
receiving the submission last week but "couldn't find any reason to waive (the) 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a black-and-white policy," Parker said. "We made our policies known. 
We sent a letter out to all the superintendents back around November. All the 
districts should have been notified." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Highland High began working more than a year ago toward gaining 
charter school status. Such a school would be better able to create lifelong 
learners out of students and better prepare them for the 21st Century than a 
traditional campus, boosters said. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the high school district board rejected the proposal, saying it 
was too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the committee will not abandon its efforts to create a charter 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty optimistic anyway," said Glen Horst, head of the charter 
committee and an English teacher at Highland High. Horst said the commitment to 
educational reform remains. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 law that allows for the creation of 100 charter schools in the state 
was intended as one method of achieving the decade-long effort toward 
educational reform. Charter schools are not bound by the dictates of the 
extensive education code. To date, 53 charters have been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst case, Horst said, would require the committee to again collect 
signatures from the Highland High teaching staff in support of the charter and 
resubmit the proposal to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had such encouragement and support," Horst said. "We could build one 
heck of a facility for education."

 A catheter is a slender tube, usually plastic, slid into a body cavity or a 
vein for delivering medications or draining fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 Common uses: Some drain the kidney or the bladder. Others are threaded through 
arteries to clear blockages. Smilarly, catheters can be snaked into the heart 
so that X-ray dyes can be infused, helping to show how valves are functioning. 
Specialized catheters called tracheal tubes pass fluid and gas out of the 
lungs.

DISNEY SETTLES INS CLAIM OF BAD RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what is believed to be one of the largest settlements of its kind in 
California, Disneyland has quietly paid $260,000 to settle allegations of 
shoddy record-keeping that violated federal immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation last year resulted in the finding of 1,156 violations in the 
employee records of more than 6,000 Disneyland workers, including evidence of 
counterfeit documents such as Social Security cards and green cards. The 
Immigration and Naturalization Service has said that Disneyland was randomly 
selected for review from a list of large area employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS had originally recommended a fine of more than $394,000, which 
Disneyland officials adamantly protested, saying they would formally appeal the 
matter in an administrative hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But a hearing was never held as discussions went on for a year between the 
theme park and the INS before final settlement was reached in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think INS accomplished its point of telling the business community, 'We 
mean it and we will vigorously enforce this law,' " said Los Angeles 
immigration lawyer Josie Gonzalez, adding that the fine reduction is within the 
general range that the INS usually considers to encourage businesses to settle 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Osuna, an editor for Interpreter Releases, a Washington-based legal 
periodical that monitors immigration cases, said the $260,000 payment "is quite 
a bit of money," certainly "enough to get their attention and that was the 
purpose of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials said last year that the Anaheim theme park has never 
knowingly employed any illegal immigrants and that only five suspected illegal 
immigrants using phony work documents were uncovered by the investigation. All 
were immediately fired. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disneyland spokesman declined further comment on the case Tuesday, citing a 
confidentiality clause in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said that $260,000 appears to be one of the 
largest payouts ever in California, although "clearly we don't keep a tally 
board. The amount is not as important as the result." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Disneyland paid the amount without having to make an 
admission of wrongdoing. The agreement also stipulated that neither side would 
disclose the amount paid or the terms of the deal. A copy of the agreement, 
however, was obtained by The Times through a Freedom of Information Act 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Disneyland withdrew its request for an appeal hearing 
and the INS avoided the time and expense of having to pursue the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland is only the latest employer to pay sanctions provided for in the 
controversial 1986 immigration reform law. The federal government collected 
$5.2 million last fiscal year through the program, about $1.1 million of it 
from California and other western states. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions were intended to make employers take responsibility for the 
immigration status of their workers. The idea behind the law was that if 
foreigners know they won't find acceptable work, they won't try to immigrate 
illegally to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics counter that the INS is more concerned about whether employers keep 
proper records than whether they are knowingly hiring illegal immigrants. And 
with fake green cards and forged Social Security cards readily available, 
employers say they are not being given the proper tools needed to ferret out 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very burdensome process for the employers," said Gordon P. Dale, a 
Santa Ana immigration lawyer. "They have to keep records for three years and 
they have to be open at any time for inspections. You are still liable for 
revisits and (more) fines." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, employers that have been fined may try to reduce their losses by 
negotiating a settlement. "They can reduce the fine by a matter of negotiations 
and the agency avoids the process of having to go before an administrative law 
judge or struggle with this thing for a long period of time," Dale said.

LEGISLATORS SEE A CHANCE TO TOUGHEN SPOUSAL ABUSE LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seizing the spotlight that former football great O.J. Simpson's arrest has 
thrown on spousal abuse, lawmakers from throughout the state said Tuesday they 
see momentum for passing stronger laws to curb domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the murder of Polly Klaas in Northern California triggered tougher 
prison sentences and Anita Hill's congressional testimony heightened awareness 
of sexual harassment, public interest in the Simpson case may open doors for 
bills that previously stalled in the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very short window of opportunity," Assemblywoman Dede Alpert 
(D-Coronado) said in gathering several legislators for a news conference to 
advocate passage of stricter laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking care not to declare Simpson guilty of the double murder charges against 
him, Alpert said of the case: "It raised the public's awareness. Hopefully that 
can be the good that comes out of this incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining lawmakers was Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. Alana Bowman, whose unit 
prosecuted Simpson five years ago for beating his wife, Nicole, so severely 
that she had to be hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman noted that of the 20,000 cases her office handles a year, in only one 
-- Simpson's -- was the offender allowed by a judge to undergo counseling by 
phone. "We were frustrated in that case for the sentence it received," she 
said. "Something happened . . . that is not common." 
</P>
<P>
 As chairwoman of the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council, Bowman 
lobbies in Sacramento for a strengthening of statutes and pointed to two 
pending bills as key to stemming abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 One, authored by Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), would mandate 
minimum sentencing requirements, including long-term counseling to help abusers 
overcome a pattern of violence. Among other things, it would force judges to 
sentence offenders to at least three years of probation and mandate their 
attendance at weekly 90-minute counseling sessions for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other bill would set up a statewide computer registry for restraining 
orders, requiring court clerks to enter judges' orders into a Department of 
Justice computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte), who authored the restraining order 
registry bill, cited her frustration in trying to line up support for the bill. 
Only after signing on numerous co-authors did Solis finally usher the measure 
through the Assembly and to a Senate committee where it is scheduled for a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the members here in the Assembly don't really understand what goes on 
in our community," Solis said, noting, for example, that the Legislature has 
failed to mandate bilingual services for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis predicted that the high-profile Simpson case will push some reluctant 
lawmakers off the fence. "I would hope that we not just give lip service 
because of this tragedy," she said. "It's about time that we talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the Legislature, discussion of domestic violence can evoke 
squeamishness, in part because it touches on the sanctity of private family 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the aspect of domestic violence that causes each of us to do a very 
personal inspection," Bowman said. "We look to see if any one of us has been in 
that relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 At times proposals have been treated as punch lines for jokes, according to 
Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he said, a bill requiring that a portion of marriage license 
fees go toward funding domestic violence centers was the subject of snickers 
when it came up for a vote years ago. Eventually it became law but not before 
some lawmakers poked fun at the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the bill was up in the Assembly, some people laughed," said Burton. "It 
was like an insurance policy -- people who have to pay hope they never have to 
use it." Today, $23 of each marriage license fee goes toward funding six such 
centers throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers whose bills have died in committee see the next few days -- 
when the public is still riveted by the Simpson case -- as a golden opportunity 
to attempt their resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) intends to reintroduce 
a bill giving courts the authority to strip an abuser of his or her firearms. 
Under his measure, which is strongly opposed by the National Rifle Assn., a 
judge could demand that an offender surrender any guns he or she owns once a 
restraining order is issued. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) said she is moving forward with 
legislation to require more extensive awareness training for police officers, 
and to require professional standards for counseling of abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling our bill the 'bruisers act,' " said Watson, who questioned as 
"unethical" the type of telephone counseling approved for Simpson.

BROWN TIES DEATH PENALTY STANCE TO UPBRINGING, FAITH; POLITICS: SHE SAYS THAT, 
LIKE HER FATHER, SHE OPPOSES CAPITAL PUNISHMENT LAW BUT WOULD ENFORCE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing in the old Governor's Mansion where she watched her father agonize 
over death penalty cases, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown on 
Tuesday said her heartfelt opposition to capital punishment is rooted in her 
unique upbringing and Catholic faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogged by questions about why she is against the death penalty, Brown returned 
to the house where she lived as a teen-ager to discuss her personal views on 
the issue for the first time in the campaign. The site was chosen to remind 
voters that her father, former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., opposed 
executions but nonetheless allowed 36 people to go to the gas chamber during 
his eight years as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I oppose it because my father taught me it was wrong and the religious 
experiences I had reinforced that," Brown said at the event staged for invited 
reporters at the 117-year-old Victorian house that now is a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 But like her father, Brown maintained that she, too, would conscientiously 
enforce the law. Brown said she agreed with Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's 
decision not to commute the sentence of double murderer Robert Alton Harris, 
who was executed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said her distaste for the death penalty and her willingness to abide by 
the law are not contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
 "So while I hold my own beliefs dear, the people and the courts have spoken," 
said Brown, acknowledging that she is on the wrong side of a hot-button 
political issue. "California's death penalty is the law of the state. And I 
will enforce that law." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wasted no time criticizing his Democratic opponent. The governor found 
the mansion "an interesting choice" for Brown's 45-minute news conference 
because, he said, "it will recall to those who may have forgotten that her 
father in the exercise of his conscientious view excused about 23 people, some 
of whom were subsequently paroled." 
</P>
<P>
 At a breakfast meeting with reporters in Los Angeles, Wilson said he sees his 
challenger's position as inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you have someone who holds what they profess to be a deep personal 
conscientious objection, that you have to expect . . . that they are not going 
to be much of an advocate for the death penalty and will find ways as did Pat 
Brown to avoid imposing it," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too early Tuesday to gauge how Brown's explanation will play in the 
hotly contested campaign or whether her message will assuage voters who have 
identified the fight against crime as the state's top priority, according to 
several polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the June primary, Brown repeatedly refused to discuss her private 
thoughts about capital punishment, saying that the only relevant question was 
whether she would uphold the death penalty law as governor, which she promised 
to do. But Brown's refusal allowed Wilson to portray her as soft on crime and 
threatened to overshadow other elements of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Tuesday that her personal opposition is not based on a single 
factor, but is a distillation of family values, religious teachings and 
personal beliefs. "This is for me a uniquely complex and personal matter," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed for a fuller explanation, Brown said it is "a gut thing. That is it as 
much as anything, and why it is hard to respond in the context of a political 
campaign which is driven by 30-second sound bites." 
</P>
<P>
 At a lectern in the mansion's ornate living room, complete with an elaborate 
chandelier and a 1950s-style console TV, the 48-year-old state treasurer sought 
to focus on the influences that forged her views. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because, you see, for me, the death penalty is not a political textbook 
issue," Brown said in her opening statement, which she said was prepared over 
the past 10 days. "I literally grew up surrounded by it. I never volunteered 
for the assignment, nor did I have the choice to opt out. It was quite simply 
my life as the Catholic daughter of the governor of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown recalled how her father, who served as governor from 1959 to 1967, would 
sit in a mustard-colored chair just a few feet from where she was standing and 
weigh the fate of inmates on San Quentin's Death Row. He allowed 36 executions 
and commuted the death sentences of 23 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 She reminded reporters that "no governor in modern history," including her 
brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., and Republicans Ronald Reagan, George 
Deukmejian and Wilson, "sent more people to the gas chamber, and yes, spared 
more lives with executive clemency than did my father." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that after her father went to bed she would surreptitiously come 
down a spiral staircase and read his thick, black briefing books that laid out 
clemency requests. 
</P>
<P>
 She also described the conflicting voices she heard outside the old mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, she would pass anti-death penalty protesters outside the house and 
once watched an elderly woman beg her father for mercy for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 At another time, she heard "thunderous boos" when she and her mother were 
introduced at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. The outcry, she said, 
was because her father had stayed the execution of the celebrated "red light 
bandit," Caryl Chessman, who ultimately was put to death after his conviction 
for robbery, kidnaping and sexual crimes against two young women. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown noted that times have changed since the days of Chessman, when people 
were condemned to death for crimes other than murder. Today, she said, the 
state has a much tougher and more specific law that identifies "special 
circumstances" in which the death penalty can be applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she has discussed the issue with her brother, who strongly 
opposed capital punishment, she said: "I've had very little conversation with 
Jerry about the issue of the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother appointed Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, whose opposition to 
capital punishment led voters to remove her from office in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Kathleen Brown said she would have "simple" criteria for 
appointing judges. "I will look for experience, intelligence, integrity, 
competence, diversity and a total commitment to enforce the laws of the state 
of California, including the death penalty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also pledged not to use the commutation powers "to tamper with or 
undermine" the state's death penalty statute. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson suggested that, given Brown's deep opposition to capital punishment, 
she would use clemency powers to spare the lives of Death Row inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 He also questioned whether her death penalty views squared with her support 
for abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown scoffed at tying the two issues together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the two issues are entirely separate," she said. "Remember, the death 
penalty is society's judgment about crime and punishment. The issue of abortion 
is the issue of individual choice and rights of privacy." 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; U.N. FORCE HAS A LIFE OF ITS OWN; CRITICS OF BALKANS MISSION SEE AN 
UNWIELDY EMPIRE MORE INTENT ON STAYING IN BUSINESS THAN RESTORING PEACE. 
DESPITE THREATS OF A PULLOUT, TROOPS AND MONEY KEEP POURING IN, AND THE KILLING 
CONTINUES.

<P>
 In between the fierce squalls that usher in the Balkan summer, builders under 
contract to U.N. peacekeepers have been pouring cement and hammering arches for 
twin porticoes of faux Ionic columns outside the two most important doors at 
mission headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The embellished entrances, about 100 feet apart on Building A, lead to the 
offices of the U.N. mission chief, Yasushi Akashi, and to an administrative 
beehive that has swelled since his January arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 While the stab at re-creating antiquity's grandeur may seem pointless against 
a backdrop of squat military barracks, the colonnades add architectural 
substance to local fears that the U.N. Protection Force, or UNPROFOR, has 
metamorphosed from a temporary peacekeeping mission into a city-state with a 
life of its own. There is no name yet emblazoned on the frieze of the vaulted 
arches, but U.N. workers joke that it should read: Republic of UNPROFOR. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 40,000 troops and employees already deployed in the embattled 
former Yugoslav republics and 5,000 more on the way, the U.N. peacekeeping 
force has expanded during its mere two-year life span to become the largest and 
most expensive mission in U.N. history. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 3,164 civilian employees alone eclipse the work force of Vatican City. 
</P>
<P>
 Its proposed $1.5-billion budget for the next fiscal year is nearly 50% more 
than that of the U.N. Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission has its own airline, with two daily flights to Sarajevo and 
regular service to Belgrade and other peacekeeper venues. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 11,527 white vehicles plying the roads from this Croatian capital to 
the tripwire lookouts in northern Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of portable living units -- the postmodern version of the Quonset 
hut -- have created hundreds of remote U.N. mini-bases. 
</P>
<P>
 A fleet of white buses shuttle translators and secretaries from the crammed 
headquarters complex to Zagreb hotels and to the airport, creating a 
transportation system parallel to the city's. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is even developing its own radio-television network, hiring 
reporters and anchors and duplicating the broadcasting services of other 
international agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 While administrators justify the cost and sprawl as investments necessary 
because of the mission's broad scope, there are growing concerns in the mission 
area as well as in the West that the United Nations has built an empire that is 
more absorbed with keeping itself in business than restoring peace so it can 
disband and go home. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission that has neither the mandate nor the military means to stop the 
3-year-old conflict is increasingly raising questions about the efficacy of 
peacekeeping in regions where there is no more peace to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also prodding some Western analysts to wonder whether the ever-expanding 
and elusive quest for a negotiated resolution will end up costing more in 
foreign dollars and local lives than a swift and decisive military intervention 
would have if one had been undertaken at the start. The tab for food aid, 
humanitarian actions and peacekeeping is generally estimated at well over $2 
billion a year. More than 200,000 lives have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a single objective of this mission has been achieved, because it is 
compelled to remain neutral in the face of an obvious aggression," Bosnian 
Information Minister Ivo Knezevic complained during a recent interview in 
Sarajevo. "For UNPROFOR troops, overseeing our people's suffering has become a 
matter of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to sound unfair or ungrateful for their endeavors and the aid 
that we do receive, but the negative aspects of this mission are now 
dominating." 
</P>
<P>
 His chief complaint, that the U.N. mission is trying to strong-arm the 
combatants into agreeing to an unjust peace, is, ironically, shared by all 
warring factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia accuse the U.N. troops of 
trying to reduce their territorial spoils, while Zagreb contends that the world 
body's presence here has firmed up the Serbs' hold on the one-third of Croatia 
that insurgents seized in a conflict three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The imperturbable Akashi smiles tolerantly through the accusations of bias, as 
he does through suggestions his massive mission has become an immovable force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in good shape when we are equally criticized by both parties," the 
30-year veteran of U.N. bureaucracy said during an interview in his penthouse 
office atop the newly aggrandized Building A. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its assignments, the U.N. peacekeeping force oversees negotiations aimed 
at brokering peace both in the suspended war between Serbs and Croats in this 
republic and the Serbian rebellion in Bosnia that has been left to deteriorate 
into civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 But after nearly two years of attempts to cajole the factions into talking out 
a settlement, the latest team of mediators trying to achieve the elusive peace 
treaty has begun brandishing the threat of a U.N. pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 France and Britain, who together contribute nearly one-third of the U.N. force 
(36 other countries make up the rest), have warned they may withdraw their 
soldiers unless the factions agree to a negotiated settlement within a few 
months. But in Croatia and Bosnia, political leaders dismiss that ultimatum as 
diplomatic bluster. 
</P>
<P>
 "UNPROFOR, like any other bureaucratic organization, has the intention to 
perpetuate itself," said Bozo Kovacevic, a leader of the Croatian 
Social-Liberal Party. "It has to. There are too many jobs and careers at 
stake." 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats speculate that France and Britain may actually reduce their 
commitments to the peacekeeping force to calm fears at home that their soldiers 
are being exposed to the hazards of war while the people they were sent to help 
show no willingness to make the compromises necessary to end the conflict. The 
U.N. troops have suffered more than 1,000 casualties -- 84 of them fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 But without any international will to militarily impose a settlement, the 
United Nations must keep the fig leaf of a peacekeeping force in place, one 
Western envoy insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see no chance whatsoever that UNPROFOR will leave before there is some kind 
of settlement here," he said. "They may have to restructure the force with more 
Third World troops if the British and the French do cut back, but that would 
probably be to the U.N.'s liking." 
</P>
<P>
 A protracted stay by the peacekeepers is also a boost for the Croatian 
economy, which was shattered by the six-month war with Serbian rebels in 1991 
and has been shrinking with the loss of tourism income and key industrial sites 
that remain behind rebel lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Drazen Kalodjera, a senior research fellow at the Economics Institute of 
Zagreb, estimates that the mission's housing, food, gas and other expenditures 
-- an estimated $400 million a year -- account for as much as 5% of Croatia's 
gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five percent of GNP is important for any economy," said Kalodjera, dismissing 
threats by the Croatian leadership to ask the U.N. mission to leave unless it 
restores Zagreb's sovereignty over Serb-occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all our dissatisfaction with the United Nations, these troops are 
here for a long time," the economist said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. activities more telling than the symbolic erection of the porticoes also 
suggest that the mission is hunkering down for the duration. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. press center has been built in central Sarajevo to spare public 
information officers the five-mile drive to forward headquarters from their 
offices nearer to town. Dozens of observation posts have been established over 
the last two months to monitor the on-again, off-again truces. Sophisticated 
radar equipment has just been moved in to trace the origin of cease-fire 
violations in northern Bosnia. And the search for more troops to bolster the 
burgeoning force continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi waves away questions about how long he expects his mission to 
persevere, offering vague expressions of hope that it won't be too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not decades. Not like Cyprus," he said. "I completely identify myself with 
the parties to the conflict here. I do not want a reproduction of the stalemate 
we see in Cyprus," where the United Nations has been involved for three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is just such a standoff that the Balkan populations and some 
troop-contributing nations have begun to fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked at the United Nations for five years, so I'm familiar with its 
institutional mentality," said Slaven Letica, a political science professor at 
Zagreb University. "It is lazy, bureaucratic and institutionally stupid. The 
people who take part in these missions learn to accommodate the local 
suffering. They have to develop this indifference as a survival strategy, 
because they are nice young people who cannot really do anything to help. Their 
preoccupation becomes that of any other job -- getting by, getting a paycheck, 
achieving career advancement." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most political and economic analysts in this host nation, Letica 
dismisses the threat of a pullout by the United Nations as "just for foreign 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can probably expect a decrease in the scope of the deployment at some 
point, but withdrawal would be unacceptable for both the international 
community and the Croatian government," said Letica, a former chief adviser to 
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. 
</P>
<P>
 With new responsibilities for patrolling and monitoring heaped on the 
peacekeepers with each U.N. Security Council resolution, the number of troops 
needed is likely to continue rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi concedes that the mission's size is approaching its limit, not because 
the situation is stabilizing but because the international community's 
willingness to send armed forces to the Balkans is nearly exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 A March appeal for 12,000 more troops to enforce cease-fires in Sarajevo and 
central Bosnia drew pledges of only 4,500 soldiers, half of whom have not 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to assess in a very realistic and pragmatic manner what we can 
achieve with our limited resources," Akashi said. "We have to maximize our 
resources. We should not ask for more and more troops all the time, even though 
we are fully aware of the danger of being spread very thinly for our comfort." 
</P>
<P>
 In the unlikely event that the mediation efforts wring out a settlement, the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization has promised to help implement it by sending 
50,000 troops. That would more than double the mission's already unwieldy size. 
</P>
<P>
 As one European officer in Sarajevo quipped, "If the U.N. can keep 40,000 
people busy without having produced a single agreement, imagine what the force 
will grow to if we ever get a real cease-fire."

GRAND JURY REPORTEDLY PROBING SIMPSON ALIBI; CRIME: FAMILY FRIEND MAY HAVE 
INFORMATION ON HIS ACTIONS ON DAY OF MURDERS. NO WEAPON HAS BEEN FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors on Tuesday continued working behind closed doors with police 
investigators and the Los Angeles County Grand Jury in the O.J. Simpson double 
murder case as authorities suspended a hunt in a Chicago field for a crucial 
piece of evidence -- the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid tight controls on information, there were indications that prosecutors 
directing the secret proceedings on the 13th floor of the Downtown Criminal 
Courts Building have sought testimony focusing on Simpson's alibi. The former 
football great has told his attorneys he was waiting for a limousine at his 
Brentwood estate at the time his ex-wife, Nicole, and her friend, Ronald Lyle 
Goldman, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first witnesses to testify Monday was a family friend who was 
living in the guest house at Simpson's estate, and who spent much of the 
afternoon and evening of the murders with Simpson, according to a source who 
insisted on anonymity and is close to the witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kato Kaelin -- an actor and writer is friendly with the defendant, his ex-wife 
and their children -- told the grand jury he greeted the limousine at the gate 
on the night of the murders, the source said. Simpson came out of the house a 
short time later, according to the source, who would not specify how much time 
had elapsed. Kaelin's encounter with Simpson did not "suggest anything unusual 
was taking place," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin, who has appeared in little-known Hollywood offerings such as "Beach 
Fever," met Nicole Brown Simpson while skiing in Colorado a few years ago, and 
initially rented a guest house at her previous residence on Gretna Green Way in 
Brentwood, the source said. After she moved to the condo where she was slain, 
Kaelin moved to O.J. Simpson's estate. Kaelin was particularly popular with the 
Simpsons' children, whom he cared for frequently at both locations, according 
to the source. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Kaelin's attorney, William J. Genego, gave the 
following account of his client's observations on the night of the murder, 
before Simpson took a limousine to the airport to catch a red-eye flight to 
Chicago: "My guy saw O.J. coming out of the house to the limo. He does not know 
where O.J. was when the limo arrived. He could have been in the house, as far 
as he knows. . . . But at no time did he say that O.J. was not at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Genego said his client's knowledge of the events that night "neither 
implicates nor exonerates Mr. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaelin was subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury as its first witness 
last week, sources said. But his lawyer balked because he was not given 
adequate time to consult with Kaelin, and requested a postponement. When it was 
not immediately granted, Genego urged Kaelin to take the 5th Amendment, and 
successfully petitioned a judge to grant a delay until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the district attorney's office maneuvered Tuesday for advantage in the 
legal battle ahead -- apparently seeking a grand jury indictment that would 
avoid a public preliminary hearing where much of prosecutors' evidence would be 
laid out -- Simpson's lawyers dodged reporters and had their first full day to 
review newly obtained autopsy reports and other police evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense team, led by attorney Robert L. Shapiro, offered no comment on the 
grand jury developments or the scientific evidence accumulated against their 
celebrated client -- who has denied any involvement in a crimes. Both sides 
prepared for a court appearance today in which a range of preliminary issues 
will be addressed, including the evidence that has been shared by prosecutors 
and Los Angeles police, and Simpson's request that he be permitted to have 
sleep medication and a so-called cervical pillow, a device that fits around the 
back of the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said the device is needed because the Men's Central Jail, where 
Simpson has been housed since Friday in a one-man cell, provides no regular 
pillows for inmates. The hard jail bed, according to Shapiro, exacerbates 
Simpson's discomfort from an old football injury. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Tuesday, the evidence against Simpson still did not include a 
murder weapon, officials said. Los Angeles police called off a third search of 
a field in Chicago, near the hotel where Simpson stayed briefly the morning 
after the murders, without locating the knife they suspect was used in the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suspended their hunt in a trash-strewn lot near O'Hare International 
Airport for a knife linked to the June 12 murders, but a Los Angeles detective 
insisted that the weapon was probably somewhere in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite finding only a duffel bag, a pair of socks and sunglasses after three 
days of combing through the lot, Los Angeles Homicide Detective Bert Luper said 
the area remained the "most logical place to dispose of the weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done the majority of the searching we expected to do here," Luper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luper said Los Angeles homicide detectives and a Chicago canine unit were 
breaking off their search near the O'Hare Plaza Hotel -- where Simpson spent 
several hours after the murders -- until they receive more reliable information 
about Simpson's whereabouts that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Luper said police have been unable to verify an anonymous tipster's report 
that Simpson, clad in a touring cap and golf shirt, was seen emerging from the 
wooded area about 7 a.m. on June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But Luper insisted Tuesday that both the "timing and corroborating evidence" 
suggest that the murder weapon is "still in there somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the opportunity (to leave the hotel room that morning)," Luper said. 
"It's one of only a few places where he would have had time to dispose of 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 While Chicago police and six evidence-sniffing dogs combed the lot and the 
rear of the O'Hare Plaza property Tuesday morning under Luper's supervision, 
another group of detectives searched an unspecified area inside O'Hare 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives also were questioning at least 15 witnesses in the airport and 
hotel areas, among them airport security workers who might have used an X-ray 
device to peer inside the bag Simpson reportedly carried with him from his 
flight from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Court records shed new light on financial battles between O.J. and Nicole 
Simpson during their 1992 divorce. O.J. Simpson was portrayed in papers filed 
by his attorneys as a man in failing health and beset by financial setbacks 
which caused his income to dip 40% from 1991 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers were filed to support Simpson's contention that he should not have 
to pay an inordinate amount of child support and alimony. Under a temporary 
support arrangement, Simpson was ordered to pay nearly $15,000 monthly to 
support his two children and $9,000 per month in alimony. The final divorce 
judgment provided for Simpson to pay $10,000 monthly in child support and no 
monthly alimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Respondent's health is also a consideration. . . . Because of his athletic 
career, (he) sustained numerous injuries. He now suffers from severe arthritis, 
which eventually will become extremely crippling. He currently takes three 
medications a day," the documents state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not serve the goals of accomplishing substantial justice by 
(requiring) the party in failing health to support the party who is young and 
in excellent health for a lengthy period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The documents also portray Simpson as reeling financially. They state that the 
NBC contract he negotiated for the 1992 football season was $100,000 less than 
the prior year, mainly due to financial constraints at the network. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also an economic victim of the 1992 spring riots. One of two Pioneer 
Chicken franchises he owned in South-Central Los Angeles burned down. 
</P>
<P>
 * LAPD Sgt. Dennis L. Sebenik said he has been questioned by LAPD Internal 
Affairs investigators concerning his role in spiriting a decoy into Simpson's 
Brentwood mansion Thursday while Simpson went to a home in the San Fernando 
Valley. But he insists he did nothing wrong. "I was off-duty, OK?" said 
Sebenik, a 25-year veteran assigned to the LAPD's Harbor Division. "It was a 
straight deal. I'm a loyal, faithful police officer. . . . I was clean as a 
whistle in what I did last week." 
</P>
<P>
 * NBC Sports President Dick Ebersol said Monday that he had been aware of 
Simpson's plea of no contest to a spousal battery charge when the network hired 
him as a football analyst in 1989, but was assured by Simpson and his wife that 
the matter was behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discussed with both of them how they were doing (in the relationship) 
during our negotiations" in June and July, 1989, Ebersol told The Times. "They 
both said that they very much wanted to be together." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz reported in Los Angeles, Braun in Chicago. Also contributing to this 
story were staff writers Rich Connell, Gordon Dillow, J. Michael Kennedy, 
Leslie Berger, Carla Rivera, Frederick M. Muir, Andrea Ford and Jane Hall. 
Legal Procedures 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the next legal steps in the O.J. Simpson case: 
</P>
<P>
 * Compliance Hearing: Scheduled for today before Municipal Judge Patti Jo 
McKay to determine if the coroner complied with a request by Simpson's attorney 
to gain access to the autopsy reports on the two victims and any evidence 
gathered during the autopsies. McKay also will determine whether officials gave 
Simpson's lawyers all police reports on the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preliminary Hearing: Scheduled for June 30. Prosecutors must present 
evidence and testimony showing that the case should go to trial. If McKay 
determines there is enough evidence, the case will be bound over to Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grand Jury: At any time, a grand jury could issue an indictment, and a grand 
jury has begun hearing testimony on the Simpson case. If an indictment is 
issued, the case would go to Superior Court without a preliminary hearing.

FIRM DEVELOPED HIGH-NICOTINE PLANT, FDA SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler, explicitly 
rejecting a tobacco industry claim that it does not manipulate nicotine levels 
in cigarettes, Tuesday described a secret project by one company to genetically 
engineer a tobacco plant with twice the usual nicotine content. 
</P>
<P>
 In congressional testimony, Kessler released the results of an agency 
investigation into a decade-long project by the Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp. The company developed and grew in Central and South America a 
high-nicotine plant known as Y-1, brought several million pounds of it from 
Brazil and used it in at least five of its American brands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment, Kessler also said several tobacco companies chemically regulate 
nicotine by adding ammonia, a substance that "liberates" nicotine from the 
tobacco blend, in effect delivering more nicotine to the smoker. Last April, 
cigarette manufacturers released a list of 599 ingredients added to tobacco, 
including ammonia, but did not describe the reasons for using the additives. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings lay to rest any notion that there is no manipulation and 
control of nicotine undertaken in the tobacco industry," Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials have repeatedly denied they deliberately spike their 
products with nicotine. However, they have acknowledged that nicotine levels 
can be changed through the blending of different tobaccos and that all of their 
companies engage in this practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Brown & Williamson project, a company spokesman said Kessler 
had misrepresented its motives. The objective of the Y-1 operation, he said, 
was to enhance flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler's examples and other evidence the agency is gathering likely will 
serve as the legal and scientific underpinnings of the case the agency is 
building to support its regulatory authority over cigarettes. The FDA has been 
exploring the possibility of regulating cigarettes as drugs -- or, more 
precisely, as drug delivery systems -- because of the addictive nature of 
nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA officials believe they would have statutory authority over nicotine if it 
can be proved conclusively that nicotine is addictive and that its levels in 
cigarettes can be controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Witt, FDA's special assistant to the deputy commissioner for operations, 
told the subcommittee that during a May 3 meeting with Brown & Williamson 
executives she asked whether the company had bred a high-nicotine plant. 
Company officials denied it, saying "it wasn't feasible," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, when confronted with the results of the FDA inquiry, the 
company admitted that it had done so, Witt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the company, which had been seeking a patent for the plant, 
withdrew its application in March, Kessler said. He refused to speculate about 
the company's reasons for doing so. But Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), 
the subcommittee chairman and a leading congressional foe of tobacco, noted 
that the action occurred less than two weeks before Kessler disclosed that the 
FDA would study the possibility of cigarette regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said Brown & Williamson cigarettes -- Viceroy King Size, Viceroy 
Lights King Size, Richland King Size, Richland Lights King Size and Raleigh 
Lights King Size -- all contain approximately 10% of the genetically bred 
high-nicotine tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas E. Sandefur Jr., chairman of Brown & Williamson, is scheduled to appear 
before the subcommittee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the company, declined to respond to the 
specifics of the FDA testimony, saying: "We'll be setting the record straight 
Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "Contrary to what Dr. Kessler said, there was nothing secretive 
about the development of Y-1 tobacco. He has totally blown the issue out of 
proportion. What Dr. Kessler called manipulation was an effort on our part to 
lower tar levels in our brands and provide the taste that consumers were 
expecting. We've used a variety of domestic and foreign grown tobaccos to 
provide the unique recipes that go into each cigarette blend. Y-1 was a 
blending tool for flavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said: "What we have here is an agency with an agenda -- and their 
agenda is to acquire jurisdiction over tobacco so it can regulate it out of 
existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler said interest in developing a high-nicotine plant dated back to the 
mid-1970s when Dr. James F. Chaplin, then of the Department of Agriculture and 
North Carolina State University, conducted genetic research in search of a 
high-nicotine tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, an employee of Brown & Williamson asked Chaplin for some 
of his seeds, which were used as a basis for the company's work, Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company grew a number of different plant lines on its experimental farm in 
Wilson, N.C., Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contracted with another firm, DNA Plant Technology, of Berkeley, 
to work on tobacco breeding and much of the later work took place in DNA's 
laboratories and greenhouses in New Jersey, Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ensuing years, the high-nicotine tobacco variety Y-1 was developed 
by a combination of conventional and advanced genetic breeding techniques that 
Kessler said ultimately resulted in a male sterile plant, which he said was an 
indication of its value to the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This procedure ensures that when a plant is grown, it will not produce seeds 
that can be appropriated by others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "What was accomplished was the development of a tobacco plant with a 
high nicotine content -- about 6% -- that grew well and could be used 
commercially," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants were grown in Brazil in farms under contract to Souza Cruz 
Overseas, a sister company of Brown & Williamson, Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not yet have all the details of how Y-1 came to be growing in Brazil," 
Kessler said, pointing out that until 1991, it was illegal to export tobacco 
seeds or live tobacco plants out of the United States, except for special 
experimental purposes and in very small amounts -- less than half a gram. 
</P>
<P>
 How the Y-1 seeds were shipped outside the United States is not known. Kessler 
said officials from each company -- Brown & Williamson and DNA Technology -- 
have told the FDA that the other company may have been responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 10, officials from DNA Technology told the FDA that "it had been 
authorized by Brown & Williamson to tell the FDA that Y-1 had never been 
commercialized," meaning that it had never been used in its cigarettes, Kessler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kessler described a paper trail of invoices, obtained by the FDA, which 
showed that more than half a million pounds of Y-1 were shipped to the company 
in September, 1992, from Souza Cruz Overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four days ago, after our questioning . . . Brown & Williamson told FDA that, 
in fact, 3 1/2 to 4 million pounds of Y-1 tobacco are currently being stored in 
company warehouses in the United States," Kessler said, and "more 
significantly, that Y-1 had, in fact, been commercialized" and used in five of 
the company's brands.

VALLEY VACCINATION CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED; HEALTH: MORE THAN 250 FREE CLINICS WILL 
OPEN. BUSINESS COALITION HOPES TO IMPROVE L.A. COUNTY'S LOW IMMUNIZATION RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying children in Los Angeles County have one of the lowest vaccination rates 
in the nation, a business coalition on Tuesday launched what it described as 
the largest private sector immunization drive ever undertaken in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said it hopes to boost the county's 40% vaccination rate -- the 
worst of California's most populous counties -- by sponsoring more than 250 
free clinics in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was applauded by county health officials still haunted by a measles 
epidemic that killed 40 children and left another 2,700 hospitalized between 
1987 and 1991. Some child-health experts predict another outbreak will strike 
in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's vaccination rate is significantly below both the 
statewide and national rates -- 48.5% and 55.3% respectively -- for 2-year-olds 
who are fully immunized against measles, polio, mumps, rubella, diphtheria and 
other childhood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Health authorities blame the county's poor ranking on several factors, 
including its large population of toddlers, many immigrant parents who do not 
understand English, a limited number of public health clinics and soaring 
vaccine prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, experts say, many 30- to 40-year-old parents -- who only had to wince 
their way through about four shots when they were young -- are unaware of how 
many shots must be administered these days for complete immunization. Some of 
the vaccines used today didn't exist before the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents have this image of kids lining up at school for polio shots. They 
don't realize it takes 16 to 18 doses of vaccine," said Joseph Liu, director of 
policy for Children Now, an advocacy group. "It's a lot more complicated than 
people remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Immunization rates are particularly low among the county's poor, who often 
cannot afford to take time off from work for repeated visits to the doctor or 
cannot reach public clinics scattered over such a vast region for free shots. 
And many illegal immigrants, fearing exposure, are wary of taking their 
children to government clinics at all, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the cost of full vaccination has skyrocketed in recent years. 
Shots that cost less than $11 in the mid-1970s now are priced at more than 
$235, not including any charges to administer them, according to the Children's 
Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the private inoculation effort said they are not trying to take 
over from the County Health Department but merely supplement its efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county has done a fantastic job trying to reach these people, but they 
just don't have the resources," said Greg Waskul, a spokesman for Burbank-based 
UniHealth America, which operates hospitals in the Valley and is spearheading 
the drive, called Operation Immunization. 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off the effort, nurses gave free shots at a Northridge elementary 
school Tuesday, trying to stick needles as gently as possible into small 
children who promptly began screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took Tylenol even before I came over," said Judee Stelly, a nurse who 
normally works in the emergency room at nearby Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jess Ross of La Crescenta said he came to the school to take advantage of the 
free injections for his 20-month-old daughter, Mychelle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They run about $160 when you go to a private clinic," he said, adding that he 
has no health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Waskul said Operation Immunization will hold more than 250 clinics in the 
Valley over the next six months at elementary schools, McDonald's restaurants 
and the Volunteer Center in Van Nuys. Vaccines will be provided by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the organization plans a massive education campaign to inform 
parents of the potentially fatal consequences of not vaccinating their 
children. It hopes to enlist hundreds of local businesses, churches, synagogues 
and community groups to help disseminate brochures and sponsor lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 An ongoing education campaign is crucial because it doesn't matter how many 
parents make sure their children get shots today if the next crop of parents 
don't do the same for their children, Waskul said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to inoculate the minds of parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waskul said Operation Immunization has signed a contract with the Los Angeles 
Unified School District to run weekly clinics at seven schools and to 
eventually expand throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many immigrants seemingly are less wary of schools than of government 
health clinics, and most can easily walk their children to a neighborhood 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shirley Fannin, the county's chief of communicable disease control, said 
the government was happy to get help from private business. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the county's low vaccination rate is partly attributable to its 
thorough reporting, but conceded that it ranks poorly compared to other large 
urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 On a statewide level, although only 48.5% of 2-year-olds are fully inoculated, 
the rate varies considerably among ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglos have the highest rate -- 58% -- followed closely by Asians at 56%, 
according to the California Department of Health Services. Forty-four percent 
of African Americans and 37% of Hispanics are fully immunized, but only 22% of 
Southeast Asians are. 
</P>
<P>
 Waskul said poor vaccination should not be viewed as a problem only of 
low-income people and minorities, however. It cuts across all races and 
economic classes, he said, and some countries enjoy a far higher rate than 
California's. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, for instance, vaccinates a whopping 96% of its 2-year-olds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, amid a nationwide measles epidemic, the federal Centers for Disease 
Control recorded more than 27,000 confirmed cases of measles, almost half of 
them in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu of Children Now said that due to Los Angeles County's low immunization 
rate, measles remains "essentially endemic -- it's always there." 
</P>
<P>
 He said because so few toddlers are properly vaccinated, and because the 
disease often runs on a three- or four-year cycle, many health experts expect 
"a new resurgence in the next year or two." Vaccination Schedule 
</P>
<P>
 The following table shows the immunization schedule recommended for children 
by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It shows all the 
vaccinations that a child should receive from birth to 16th birthday.

DOLLAR PLUNGES; MARKETS FOLLOW; ECONOMY: CURRENCY'S POST-WORLD WAR II LOW 
AGAINST YEN REVIVES INFLATION CONCERNS AND MAY PUSH FED TO RAISE INTEREST RATES 
AGAIN. TRADE DEFICIT TAKES UNEXPECTED JUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In another blow to world financial markets, the dollar's value sank on Tuesday 
below the psychologically key level of 100 Japanese yen, triggering a global 
selloff in stocks and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's decline to a post-World War II low against the mighty yen took 
Wall Street by surprise and revived worries about higher inflation and interest 
rates, the global economy's recovery and Americans' living standard -- all of 
which can be affected by swings in the huge but often-arcane world currency 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a pervasive nervousness about developments all over the world, with 
inflation fears underlying it all," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of 
brokerage Goldman, Sachs International. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp drop in the dollar's value is likely to pressure the Federal Reserve 
Board to raise interest rates for a fifth time this year, perhaps as early as 
next month, in an attempt to support the currency. However, another increase in 
rates may further threaten the fragile economic recovery in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York on Tuesday, the dollar's value fell as low as 99.5 yen from 
Monday's close of 101.9 yen, though it rebounded slightly to finish at 100.35 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Early today in Tokyo the dollar rose further, to 101.2 yen, as the Bank of 
Japan bought dollars and sold yen. Japan's economic ministers, including Prime 
Minister Tsutomu Hata, were to hold an emergency meeting at midday that was 
expected to focus on the currency turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei stock index was down 175 points to 20,637 at midday 
today, after falling 338 points on Tuesday. A rising yen could batter Japan's 
depressed economy by further raising the cost of its exports to the United 
States and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the dollar has weakened in recent weeks -- from 105 yen in early June 
-- as the U.S. economy has shown signs of slowing and as tensions with North 
Korea have flared, few experts had expected a break below 100 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, the government's report that the nation's trade deficit jumped 
22% to $8.4 billion in April, far exceeding analysts' estimates, fueled new 
concerns about the U.S. economy's long-term trend of consuming more than it 
produces. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a nation's currency essentially is a gauge of investors' underlying 
confidence in the economy, the selloff in the dollar reflected fears that the 
U.S. economy's expansion is not sustainable, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, because a falling dollar can automatically boost prices of goods 
imported into the United States, the dive below 100 yen magnified inflation 
jitters that have rattled U.S. markets all year. 
</P>
<P>
 The negative sentiment spilled into the stock market Tuesday, where the Dow 
Jones industrial average dropped 33.93 points to 3,707.97, bringing its loss 
over the past three sessions to more than 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, U.S. interest rates rose broadly Tuesday on concerns that the 
Federal Reserve will be forced to raise short-term rates again soon, in an 
attempt to defend the dollar. Higher rates tend to attract investment to a 
country's fixed-income securities, thereby strengthening its currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, which has tightened credit four times this year to moderate the 
economy's growth and thus keep inflation at bay, had signaled in recent weeks 
that it was content to leave rates alone this summer, confident that the 
economy was slowing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dollar's sudden collapse could force the Fed to act as early as its 
July 5 policy meeting, analysts said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Any additional Fed-induced increase in interest rates would have widespread 
effects, economists say. Mortgage rates could jump again, hurting the housing 
market. And any general increase in rates would be especially harmful to 
California, which still is struggling to emerge from recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, higher U.S. interest rates -- and a subsequent further slowdown 
in the U.S. economy -- would compound Europe's economic problems, threatening 
the Continent's nascent recovery from a very deep recession in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts, however, said they doubted that the Fed will feel compelled to 
defend the dollar with higher interest rates because the dollar's problems are 
viewed as long-term in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very unusual for the Fed to raise rates to help the dollar, 
because that is a structural problem" in the economy, said Marshall Acuff, 
investment strategist at brokerage Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of a Fed rate hike "would last two days, and then the speculators 
selling the dollar would be back at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed could, however, buy dollars on the open market to help stave off a 
downward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Fed intervened in currency markets last month to push the dollar 
higher -- at the U.S. Treasury's request -- the central bank apparently was 
absent from the market Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration in recent months has sought to talk up the dollar, 
a reversal of what many experts viewed as the White House's previous policy of 
allowing the dollar to gradually decline as a way of making U.S. exports more 
competitive, especially in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, Administration officials only repeated their insistence that 
the economy's condition did not justify the dollar's fall, and they withheld 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street experts have sought to pin the dollar's latest slide on what 
they perceive as the White House's naivete on economic issues. By talking the 
dollar lower earlier in the year -- effectively making the currency a trade 
weapon against Japan -- the Administration may have set the stage for the 
current plunge, some investment pros say. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some currency traders said the weakness in the dollar reflects 
investors' lack of confidence that the Administration is up to the task of 
handling the political problems it faces, from North Korea to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Lothar Klausing, an economist with the Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt, said 
the dollar's slide might prove to be an overreaction by currency speculators. 
</P>
<P>
 Hormats, of Goldman Sachs, said the dollar's turbulence reflects in part the 
enormous growth of dollar holdings abroad. During the 1980s, about $170 billion 
flowed to foreign investors annually because of large trade deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 In this decade, those levels have been swollen by foreign direct investment 
and other factors, so that now the annual outflow is closer to $250 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if foreigners start seeing that they can't hold those dollars at a stable 
currency rate, they can get nervous -- and start to sell," Hormats said. Each 
decline in the dollar devalues foreigners' holdings in the United States.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON DRAWS HIS LINE IN SAND ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, a man who loves compromise, says that he has found his 
stopping point. 
</P>
<P>
 After 17 months in office, during which many have questioned just what it is 
that Clinton really stands for, the President has taken his stand on the 
principle that health reform must mean providing coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite predictions by leading Republicans and Democrats that his position 
cannot prevail, Clinton told aides over the weekend, and repeated in a speech 
Tuesday, that "I refuse to declare defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has made it clear that he is willing to compromise on almost every 
other major part of his massive health reform proposal. But his decision to 
fight over universal coverage amounts to a roll of the dice -- with the success 
of his presidency at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 If he prevails -- and aides said they believe that despite current gloomy 
portents he still has a chance to prevail in the House and win narrowly in the 
Senate -- he will have won a huge and highly visible victory on an issue -- 
covering everyone -- that polls consistently show the public supports. But 
should he fail, political strategists warned, the loss could be devastating -- 
reinforcing in the minds of voters the notion that Clinton has been unable to 
break the Washington gridlock that he campaigned against. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking Tuesday to the Business Roundtable, an organization of big 
businesses, Clinton drew on his recent trip to Normandy for the anniversary of 
D-day, saying that just as the World War II generation met its challenges 
overseas, today's generation of leaders must meet the challenges of domestic 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring out a way to provide health insurance to all Americans "goes to the 
heart of whether we can get our own economic house in order. It goes to the 
heart of whether we can make government work for ordinary people. It goes to 
the heart of whether we can empower people to view change as a friend instead 
of an enemy," Clinton told the business leaders. "Unless we can provide 
coverage for every American in a reformed system which focuses on both quality 
and control of costs, the deficit will grow, your costs will continue to grow 
and undermine productivity, and more and more Americans will lose their 
coverage or be at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to fight on a point of principle rather than seek a broader 
compromise won the support of Clinton's most loyal allies on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's have it out and frankly come to some conclusions. And the sooner the 
better," said Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), a member of the Finance Committee and 
a protege of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who passed up a 
possible seat on the Supreme Court to lead the fight for health reform. "What 
you have to compromise away, what a watered-down version of health reform you 
get to (win) 60 votes (in the Senate), in my view is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic strategists said they believe that they have a shot at rounding up 
a 51-vote majority in the Senate for a universal coverage bill -- one that they 
would then, in effect, dare the Republicans to filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people are not going to permit crass politics to be played with 
this issue that makes such a difference to them," said Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), whose committee has 
produced a bill that Mitchell could use as a vehicle to get the issue to the 
Senate floor if the Finance Committee, which is also working on a health bill, 
remains deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any political leader or any political party that stands between the Senate of 
the United States having a full and fair debate and discussion is going to be 
perceived, I think, as not only an obstructionist but is going to be a 
politician at risk," Kennedy added. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, warned that by insisting on universal coverage and going for 
51 votes rather than watering down his plan and seeking a broader majority, 
Clinton is jeopardizing the best chance Congress has had to make meaningful, if 
limited, reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Those critics echoed statements made by Finance Chairman Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) over the weekend that proposals to reform the insurance 
system but not cover everyone are still "important advances." 
</P>
<P>
 "Government is about the increments by which you move toward goals you 
desire," Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that a 51-vote strategy cannot work, in my opinion," said Sen. 
John B. Breaux (D-La.), who authored a more conservative health plan that would 
not guarantee universal coverage. "It's easier to get to 63 votes" by crafting 
a bill that wins significant GOP support "than it is to get 51" by appealing to 
Democrats on party lines, Breaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House strategists point to last fall's experience, when Republicans 
tried to use a filibuster to kill the so-called Brady bill, which authorized a 
waiting period for the purchase of handguns. The Republicans gave up after the 
effort proved wildly unpopular with constituents. "The American people don't 
like filibusters. They think they're sneaky," said one White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans, and some Democrats, pointed to the opposite example: early in 
his Administration when heavy-handed partisan tactics produced a filibuster and 
Clinton suffered the humiliating defeat of his economic stimulus package. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stimulus-bill fight, the White House wrote off moderate Republicans and 
now may be doing the same on health care, warned Sen. Dave Durenberger 
(R-Minn.). "I don't think that's the way to get health care reform. That's 
something that sets off people like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, action -- or more properly the lack of it -- in Congress 
illustrated the difficulties ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan, who had predicted that his committee would complete work on health 
care by the end of this month, announced that the schedule had slipped until 
mid-July. And a leading Democratic member of the Finance Committee, Sen. Bill 
Bradley (D-N.J.), said that he could not support Clinton's preferred method of 
achieving universal coverage and proposed yet another entry in what has become 
a bewildering array of potential compromises. Bradley's plan rejects the 
requirement that employers pay for workers' insurance. It instead mandates that 
individuals buy insurance if reforms in the health care market fail to produce 
near-universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 On the House side, the Ways and Means Committee bogged down amid partisan 
sniping with Republicans attempting to increase benefits while Democrats 
charged that GOP lawmakers wanted to grandstand in favor of additional services 
without supporting revenue-raising measures in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we are willing to pay for these add-ons, it makes no sense to add them 
on," said Chairman Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.), who threatened to keep the panel in 
session over the weekend in his effort to complete work on a bill next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has one major political trump on his side in the coming fight. Unlike 
many parts of his health plan, which have proved controversial, universal 
coverage enjoys broad popular support. Polls consistently have shown that most 
Americans favor the idea of universal coverage. Clinton's proposal that 
employers be required to cover all their workers also draws strong public 
support. A highly publicized fight on that issue would be a way of focusing 
public attention on one of his plan's stronger points instead of on its 
weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A second major argument in favor of universal coverage is, simply, that most 
of the alternatives that have been proposed so far do not work, Administration 
officials said.

CLINTON SEEKS $24.8 BILLION FOR IMMIGRATION; GOVERNMENT: WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
REQUEST IS ONE-THIRD GREATER THAN BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. BUT WILSON AIDE 
CRITICIZES IT AS CREATIVE ACCOUNTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Showcasing its attentiveness to the immigration issue, the Clinton 
Administration released figures Tuesday indicating that its spending requests 
for the next fiscal year were one-third greater than the amount sought for 
immigration-related programs in the last Bush budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The briefing, held by Budget Director Leon Panetta and INS Commissioner Doris 
Meissner, came on the eve of Gov. Pete Wilson's visit to Washington today in 
search of federal funding to offset the costs of illegal immigrants -- and 
presumably to take the Administration to task for not acting forcefully or 
quickly enough on his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures show California in line to receive the lion's share of the 
proposed federal spending on immigration-related programs that range from 
agriculture to education to law enforcement. But in compiling the figures, the 
Administration combined federal spending for legal and illegal immigration, 
thus yielding more robust spending numbers than had been previously used in the 
Washington-Sacramento dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 An Office of Management and Budget spokesman said the federal spending could 
not be accurately broken down between legal and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $24.8 billion sought by the White House for immigration-related 
programs in the next fiscal year, the Administration projected that California 
would receive $8.4 billion -- nearly $6 billion more than second-place New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta calculated that in fiscal 1993 President George Bush requested $18.8 
billion in federal spending on immigration and other programs affecting 
immigrants. The Clinton fiscal 1995 budget seeks about $6 billion more, 
representing the one-third increase nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of federal spending for legal and illegal immigration spurred 
swift reaction from a top Wilson aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Goodman, the governor's deputy chief of staff for communications, 
dismissed the Clinton numbers as creative accounting and an attempt to "get the 
cash register to ring to a higher number." 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw this as an opportunity to get their story out before the states give 
out the facts. To confuse (spending on legal and illegal immigration) is to 
start down a very slippery slope," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson in January estimated that the federal government owed the state $2.3 
billion in illegal-immigration costs and factored the entire amount into his 
state budget calculations. He has since lowered his budget expectations to $760 
million in federal reimbursements, but argues that the federal government still 
owes California the higher amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the governors of each impacted state have legitimate problems . . . 
but I think that there's a tendency in some instances to overplay this issue," 
Panetta said. "I don't think the President questions the need to deal with the 
issue, but it has to be done with sensitivity and responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner, meanwhile, offered an update on the Administration's plan to slow 
illegal immigration with greater vigilance along the country's southwest 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego and El Paso, which account for 65% of the country's yearly immigrant 
apprehensions, are targets of the most assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner cites 350 new Border Patrol agents, 250 new vehicles, 350 new 
encrypted voice radios, 14 additional miles of border fence and a new automated 
processing system as examples of the Administration's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the Administration's proposed immigration reform package are 
speedier deportation procedures, streamlined asylum adjudications, stiffer 
employer sanctions and greater emphasis on naturalization of legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea for increased cooperation, Panetta called for a state-federal 
partnership to combat Capitol Hill opposition to the immigration initiatives, 
which benefit only a few states. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular importance to California is an Administration plan to seek $350 
million to help states saddled with the costs of incarcerating large numbers of 
illegal immigrant prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, a veteran California legislator who formerly chaired the House Budget 
Committee, announced the spending allocation with considerable fanfare in 
April. But he warned that it faced a difficult legislative sojourn because it 
would benefit only the six or seven states most severely affected by the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, the money was yanked out by an appropriations subcommittee 
earlier this month in favor of diverting it into an anti-drug program that 
would distribute the funds throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you get resources to these (affected) states?" Panetta said. "My God, 
we're having one hell of a time trying to commit resources to the investments 
that all of us care about. . . . If six or seven impacted states are asking for 
additional resources, then is there any question in anybody's mind that this is 
one hell of a battle?"

WELFARE MOTHER PLAN FAILS TO HALT PREGNANCY TREND; SOCIAL SERVICES: THE NEW 
CHANCE PROGRAM HAS RAISED THE EDUCATION LEVEL AND MOTHERING SKILLS OF 
TEEN-AGERS. BUT RESULTS OF ITS ATTEMPT TO DISCOURAGE REPEAT CHILDBEARING ARE 
DISAPPOINTING. 
</P>

<P>
 An experimental program being tested in California as part of a national 
effort to move teen-age welfare mothers toward self-sufficiency has shown 
disappointing results in discouraging repeat pregnancies and reducing reliance 
on government assistance, according to findings being released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, called New Chance, demonstrated substantial success in raising 
the education level of young mothers and modest success in improving their 
parenting skills. But the study found that, like other programs in the past, it 
had little impact on one of the most serious problems facing teen-agers on 
welfare -- repeat pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the program received extensive education, training, counseling and 
parenting instruction, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But 18 months after entering the program, more than half of the young women 
participating in it reported that they were pregnant again. And while many of 
them had found jobs, pregnancies and other family problems prevented them from 
staying employed for any length of time, leaving them on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "The results of the demonstration are mixed and they are less than what we 
have hoped for. . . . The program did not work in the area of repeat 
childbearing," said Janet C. Quint, senior research associate for the New 
York-based Manpower Demonstration Research Corp. and the author of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Over an 18-month period, the study followed 2,300 teen-age mothers who applied 
for the program at 16 locations in 10 states. With centers in Chula Vista, 
Inglewood and San Jose, California had one of the highest levels of 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 New Chance, which started in most states in 1989, was designed for teen-age 
welfare mothers because they are the segment of the welfare population 
considered most likely to spend their life on public assistance. Its goal was 
to move them away from welfare dependency and toward self sufficiency through 
an intensive program which included instruction in contraception and family 
planning as well as academic courses aimed at earning high school equivalency 
certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, officials hoped the services provided by New Chance would improve 
the lives of the young mothers and their children as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was directed at a segment of the welfare population considered 
among the most disadvantaged. To participate, mothers had to be 16 to 22 years 
old, had to be receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children and had to 
have given birth as teen-agers. The average participant in the program was 19 
and had given birth to her first child before the age of 17. The vast majority 
were unmarried high school dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers emphasized that the report released today provided only short-term 
results and said they hope that a follow-up study to be completed in 1996 will 
show that the long-range impact of the program was more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 But they acknowledged that the short-term results clearly demonstrated that 
there are no quick fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Granger, senior vice president for the Manpower Demonstration 
Research Corp. and project director of the New Chance research, said the data 
gathered so far provides valuable guidance for state and federal officials who 
are proposing welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it shows that the Clinton Administration and many states have 
correctly targeted teen-age pregnancy as a problem that must be attacked in any 
welfare reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that it makes a lot of sense to focus on adolescent pregnancy and to 
come up with some ways of not having young unwed mothers have babies when they 
are ambivalent about having those babies or don't want those pregnancies," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quint said the high number of repeat pregnancies has perplexed both the 
researchers and the operators of the program and neither has found a clear 
explanation for it. 
</P>
<P>
 She said many of the programs have since beefed up their family planning and 
added more case managers to their staff who could provide follow-up counseling 
for mothers after they left New Chance.

ON CALIFORNIA: DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET

<P>
 It was a mistake to think them harmless curiosity seekers. They were savage 
and bitter, especially the middle-aged and the old, and had been made so by 
boredom and disappointment.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Nathanael West, "Day of the Locust." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second most talked about story in Los Angeles over the last week or so 
involves an angel. It's been passed along, not by the media, but mouth to 
mouth, friend to friend. While details vary, certain elements seem to make 
every telling: 
</P>
<P>
 A motorist is stopped on the Pacific Coast Highway by a CHP officer for 
weaving. You won't believe this, the driver says, but an angel just appeared in 
the back seat and warned of a major earthquake. The officer responds: "I 
wouldn't believe you -- except that you are the sixth person on this road today 
who has told me the exact same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In most versions, a specific date was attached to the forecast, a date which 
has since come and gone. Still, there are people who swore by the story. I 
heard for instance that, on the appointed day, at least one television producer 
arrived at work in a crash helmet, and that several other believers called in 
sick, taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
 And who could blame them? After what has transpired in L.A. over the last week 
or so, who would not have trouble distinguishing between fact and rumor, 
fantasy and reality? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most talked about story in the city, and probably across the land, of 
course, has been the investigation of O.J. Simpson -- the accusations of double 
murder, the absurd Friday night ramble across the basin. It is a story that, 
only a few days ago, might have seemed as implausible as Gabriel sightings on 
the PCH. 
</P>
<P>
 A collective disbelief surrounds the Simpson case, giving rise to rumors. The 
rumors grow wilder and more rampant by the day. No one seems ready to believe 
-- as the prosecutors have alleged -- that O.J. Simpson was capable of double 
murder or of committing the crime alone or, at a minimum, of committing it in 
such a clumsy fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 And so everywhere there are people who insist he must have been framed. By 
whom? There are scenarios to satisfy every "conspiracist." There is the Chicago 
mob land hit theory. There is the gambling debt theory, the cocaine connection 
theory and multiple variations on the love triangle theory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The spousal abuse angle in the case has received fast and heavy attention. 
This seems to fit a common media tendency to attach societal themes to 
seemingly senseless crimes, to squeeze them into a neat topical box. Still, it 
would seem that, no matter what facts emerge, the Simpson case can exemplify 
only an exception and not the rule. For the rule of domestic violence is that 
it is committed by everyday people, not by the superstars of pop culture. The 
rule of domestic violence is not that the cops come and leave, but that they 
don't come at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I saw a man interviewed on television Monday. He was an older fellow. The 
camera caught him standing in the morning sun outside O.J. Simpson's house. The 
man was asked what had drawn him to the Brentwood mansion that two days earlier 
provided the final scene for an unbelievably strange day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted," the man explained, "to see if it looked the same as it did on 
television." 
</P>
<P>
 It made perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds that lined the freeways Friday night and rooted for Simpson have 
got everyone rereading their Nathanael West. This was "Day of the Locust" 
material, a convergence of the disappointed and the bored. And, of course, 
these roadside renegades were characterized elsewhere, quickly, as yet one more 
piece of evidence that Los Angeles has gone to crazy hell. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder, though, whether the people who stopped along the freeway were 
different in any significant way from those 95 million Americans who watched 
the proceedings at home. And I wonder, too, about the geographical analysis: 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of mine was at Madison Square Garden on Friday night for the NBA 
playoffs. In the second quarter, he reports, the Knicks fans began to notice 
that the television sets in the Garden luxury boxes no longer were carrying the 
game. Instead, they were showing the chase, live. 
</P>
<P>
 "And so," he tells me, "everybody in the stands quit watching the game. 
Instead, we turned around the binoculars and watched the luxury box TV sets. 
Since no one could hear, all these rumors started flying around. It was like an 
informational wave. O.J. has just shot himself. O.J. has been shot. It was a 
river of information, and, as it turned out, all the information was bad." 
</P>
<P>
 See, Los Angeles, it's everywhere.

ANTI-GAY INITIATIVE FAILS TO MAKE NEVADA BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Backers of a controversial Nevada anti-gay initiative, designed to make it 
legal to discriminate against gay men and lesbians, failed to gather enough 
signatures by the Tuesday deadline to gain a place on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative groups said Tuesday that they had gathered an estimated 31,000 
signatures statewide in the past five months in their effort to get on the 
ballot the so-called minority status and child protection act -- far short of 
the more than 51,000 signatures needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Clark County, where about 75% of Nevada's citizens reside, a small group of 
organizers showed up at the county clerk's office, petitions in hand, and said 
during a brief news conference that they will resurrect their battle in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very quiet and lasted no more than 10 minutes," said Peggy Karmazin, 
Clark County voter registration coordinator. "That was their message: that they 
will do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucille Lusk, chairwoman of the conservative group Nevada Concerned Citizens, 
applauded the losing effort, saying that it sent a strong message to public 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tens of thousands of signatures gathered in this short-term effort speak 
strongly to urging the public schools to teach our children the academic and 
work skills they need to succeed, and not to become a propaganda channel for 
some unhealthy trends in our society," Lusk said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Anderson, a Reno activist who has worked against the petition drive 
since it was launched in January, said he was not surprised by the outcome -- 
but that he was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was rather hopeful they would garner enough signatures so we could have a 
blowout in November," he said. "According to the state Constitution, had they 
lost, they never could have resurrected that idea again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevada initiative was written by Lon Mabon, the architect of similar 
legislation throughout the Pacific Northwest. Mabon is chairman of the Oregon 
Citizens Alliance, the parent group of Nevada Citizens Alliance, which launched 
the Nevada petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed amendment to the state Constitution said in part that "objection 
to homosexuality based upon one's convictions is a Liberty and right of 
conscience and shall not be considered discrimination relating to civil 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure had won, gay men and lesbians would not have been allowed to 
act as foster parents, nor could they have won custody of their children if the 
other parent in the dispute was heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, homosexuality could be acknowledged in public school 
health or social studies classes but not in a way that would "elevate 
homosexuality to a neutral or normal position in a child's eyes," Mabon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar petition drives face deadlines this summer in Oregon, Washington, 
Michigan, Missouri, Arizona and Idaho.

DMV, INS TO CHECK NEW LICENSE APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An agreement to help determine if first-time applicants for driver's licenses 
and identification cards are legal U.S. residents has been reached by the 
Department of Motor Vehicles and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Legislature passed and Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law a bill to 
link up the state and federal agencies in an effort to crack down on rising 
costs associated with illegal immigrants coming to California. 
</P>
<P>
 A DMV spokesman said the intent is to prevent illegal immigrants from 
obtaining a state driver's license or identification card, which can sometimes 
help them obtain employment and state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 About 743,000 people will apply for their first California driver's license 
this year and 581,000 others will seek a DMV identification card. The estimated 
additional cost to check immigration status is $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The statute applies only to first-time applicants. It has no provision for 
checking illegal immigrants who are already licensed and wish to renew their 
licenses or cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the DMV will be able to query the INS computer database 
to determine if a first-time applicant is qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 For each inquiry, the INS will provide the department with the person's 
immigration status, alien registration number, first and last name, date and 
country of birth, date of initial entry into the United States, and in the case 
of non-immigrants, the expiration date of the person's authorized stay in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DMV came to us for assistance and we are gratified that we were able to 
accommodate the state's needs and pull this agreement together in a relatively 
short time," said C.M. McCullough, acting western regional administrator for 
the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 McCullough emphasized that the DMV, not the INS, will make the final decision 
on whether an individual receives a state driver's license or identification 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 The department still has to sign a contract with Martin Marietta Corp., the 
company that maintains and processes the INS database, to gain direct access to 
the system.

PALESTINIAN POLICE ARREST KEY PLO FIGURE, 9 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian police arrested 10 PLO activists Monday and Tuesday, including a 
former head of the Fatah office in the Gaza Strip, for blocking a road to a 
Jewish settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest of Sami abu Samhadaneh was the first detention of a key figure in 
the Palestine Liberation Organization structure since the May deployment of 
Palestinian police from outside the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released several hours after his arrest, along with the other 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Samhadaneh, 32, who served many years in Israeli prisons, is popular among 
the Palestinian gunmen who have watched their power ebb with the arrival of the 
police. The gunmen have been relegated to lower-level police jobs -- or nothing 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Samhadaneh claimed that an Israeli sniper fired at his car Saturday night 
while he was passing the Jewish settlement of Netzarim south of Gaza City. 
Others say five bullets were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Samhadaneh returned to the settlement Sunday with nine other men, many of 
them armed, and blocked the entrance. Using a bullhorn, he demanded that the 
settlers hand over the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police persuaded the men to leave, and they began rounding them up 
in Gaza City and their homes in Rafah on Monday. Abu Samhadaneh turned himself 
in Tuesday. The settlers denied that any shots were fired.

JORDAN'S KING HOPES FOR OPEN TALKS WITH ISRAEL; MIDEAST: HUSSEIN SAYS HE WILL 
PRESS AHEAD WITH PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT RELYING ON SYRIA'S LEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After decades of alleged secret meetings with Israeli leaders, Jordan's King 
Hussein said Tuesday that he hopes the revival of peace talks next month will 
lead to an open meeting between the former enemies, perhaps even before the 
signing of a full treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very possible; I'm quite flexible," he told a news conference here. 
"When there is a reason, then we'll meet. (There) is nothing to prevent that." 
</P>
<P>
 The king is in Washington for meetings as Jordan and Israel prepare for their 
first peace talks in the region next month. The talks will alternate between 
their respective ports of Aqaba and Eilat, which face each other on the 
northern Red Sea coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanian leader's comments reflect the depth of change in the region as 
the peace process accelerates after the signing of the Israel-Palestine 
Liberation Organization accord in May. "We are on the verge of beginning the 
serious negotiations that we need to establish peace between us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jordanian monarch also said he is prepared to plunge ahead with Israel no 
matter what Syria does. While noting that all parties are hoping for a 
"comprehensive peace," he said that Jordan's position "is not linked to 
anything that may or may not happen on any other track." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he and Syrian President Hafez Assad have been in touch and 
"understand each other very well." But he made it clear that Damascus would not 
call the shots. "In this situation, we feel that nobody has the right to ask us 
what we do, and we have the responsibility towards ourselves, our land, towards 
our rights, to do whatever we can to safeguard our interests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the PLO pact, mediation between Israel and Syria was given priority, 
with the help of shuttle diplomacy by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
Both Jordan and Lebanon were expected to defer to Syria. But after the initial 
exchange of positions in May and a follow-up shuttle last month, the Syria 
track stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, looking for another partner to sustain the momentum, turned to a 
willing partner in Amman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein, who has ruled Jordan for more than four decades, said pointedly that 
the major Arab players have never fully coordinated their strategies in dealing 
with Israel. But overall, he added, the peace process has now reached a point 
where it is "irreversible." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout dozens of earlier peace efforts, Hussein had distanced himself 
publicly from open meetings with Israeli leaders, though he is reported to have 
spent hundreds of hours with assorted Israeli government officials, including 
prime ministers, from both the Labor and Likud parties. He allegedly even has 
piloted his own helicopter to secret rendezvous. 
</P>
<P>
 The king first indicated his willingness for talks shortly before he met with 
Christopher on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he would "be happy to 
meet with King Hussein and with Jordanian officials at any time, anywhere, for 
the good of peace between the two peoples." Rabin also called Tuesday for 
direct talks with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 During his U.S. visit, Hussein also underwent a medical checkup. Two years 
after cancer surgery, he said he was given a clean bill of health.

SOCIAL PROGRAMS; GI BILL MARKS 50 YEARS OF GIVING VETS A SHOT AT THEIR DREAMS; 
IT TRANSFORMED THE MIDDLE CLASS AND IDEAS ABOUT EDUCATION. TODAY IT IS CITED AS 
A PROTOTYPE FOR GOVERNMENT INITIATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The GI Bill, one of the century's most powerful legislative forces of social 
change, turns 50 today -- still on the books and altering American lives even 
as a new generation of political leaders tries to capitalize on its success. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed into law on June 22, 1944, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the GI 
Bill of Rights transformed the United States during the tenuous post-World War 
II era, paying for the education of 7.8 million soldiers returning to civilian 
life. It opened up opportunities, providing professional careers to a 
generation born to working parents. And it reshaped American life, swelling the 
ranks of the middle class, expanding university campuses and making college 
education a goal for the masses as well as the elite. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation invested $7 billion in the GI Bill's education programs from 1945 
until 1952, but the return in productivity among those who used the bill's 
education benefits pumped at least $35 billion -- and perhaps as much as $84 
billion -- into the economy, according to an analysis by the Joint Economic 
Committee of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the great transforming events of the last 50 years," said 
Columbia University social historian Kenneth T. Jackson. "It opened up the 
doors of opportunity for an entire generation." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has described the GI Bill as his favorite government 
program, the defining example of the mode of broad-based social initiatives he 
favors. Clinton invokes the GI Bill repeatedly as he lobbies for his social 
agenda. He used it as a prototype for his national service program, passed last 
year by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The GI Bill's popularity has a lot to do with the gratitude of the American 
people for the service of the men and women who went to war, and this President 
has done an enormous amount to put the issue of service back on the front 
burner," said William Galston, Clinton's deputy assistant for domestic policy 
and one of the idea men behind the President's national service program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the GI Bill's lingering popularity, there is little consensus over 
whether it can -- or should -- serve as a model for peacetime legislation. 
Historians describe the GI Bill as a creature of its time, succeeding in an era 
when the nation's middle class and its businesses were already poised for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that the GI Bill was an engine of expansion -- of the mind, of 
business, of society," said Lehman College historian Davis Ross, an expert in 
the political origins of the bill. "Almost every segment of society benefited. 
All of the big social bills passed in the last 20 years go in the other 
direction. Everybody's trying to save what they have." 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton's political critics insist that the sort of unanimity he seeks for 
his own broad-based programs could never be achieved outside of a wartime 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you use GI Bill rhetoric to sell your own flawed political program, you 
cheapen what the GI Bill did for this country," said Doug Bandow, a senior 
fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 GI Bills were passed during the Korean and Vietnam wars but used by 
successively smaller waves of students. Former GIs now can receive up to $5,000 
a year in tuition -- a far cry from the 1944 bill, which paid all tuition and a 
$75 monthly stipend at any school in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the early 1950s, many of the nation's college campuses swelled with a 
generation of GI students who took advantage of the bill's benefits. Quonset 
huts sprouted around Memphis State University as homes for the families of 
young GIs. Veterans studied in warehouses at the University of Illinois's 
temporary pier on Lake Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill changed the nation's attitudes about education. No more than 40% of 
the returning vets would have gone to college without the GI Bill, the Joint 
Economic Committee study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of thousands of working-class kids had access to college for the 
first time," said Northwestern University military sociologist Charles Moskos. 
"They in turn have passed on those attitudes to their kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill grew out of a bitter two-decade battle over pensions that veterans of 
World War I's American Expeditionary Force insisted they were promised by the 
country's political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 World War I veterans marched on Washington in 1932 seeking their economic due. 
Dispersed by Army regulars during a bloody clash on the banks of the Potomac, 
many remained embittered by their treatment. Vowing they would not allow a 
repeat of those events, veterans' groups began lobbying after 1942 for a 
benefits package for those returning from service in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, F.D.R. Administration officials began post-war planning, 
fearing that if the American economy was forced to absorb millions of returning 
soldiers all at once, the nation would plunge back into a financial depression 
-- as almost occurred after World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 Only as the war ground on and veterans' groups made a reward for returning GIs 
a priority did it become obvious that the GI Bill "was a no-lose proposition," 
Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even the framers of the bill had no idea of its ultimate impact. No more 
than 600,000 returning soldiers were expected to use the education benefits. 
And few GIs were even aware at first of the broadening influence of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert A. Eubanks, a warrant officer who served in an all-black port unit in 
the Pacific theater, only heard about the benefits from a superior as he 
mustered out in 1946 -- two years after the bill's passage. "It was news to 
most of us," said Eubanks, now emeritus professor of civil engineering at 
Illinois State University. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really wasn't until I was accepted at (the Illinois Institute of 
Technology) that I realized what was going on," said Eubanks, a Chicago orphan 
who used his degree to carve out a career in engineering. "The place was 
crawling with soldiers, all impatient to get a degree and get on with their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of Clinton's efforts to fashion a broad-based social agenda say 
that the GI Bill's overwhelming success -- despite its more modest goals -- 
serves as a warning that activist government programs do not always turn out as 
they are intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandow and other critics are especially wary of Clinton's national service 
program, which aims to reward 100,000 students who work in community service 
jobs with two-year college tuition awards of up to $4,725 and health-care and 
child-care benefits. The program, hailed by some as a modern version of the GI 
Bill, does not approach the older bill either in scope or purpose, critics 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The GI Bill rewarded millions of servicemen, no matter who they were or where 
they came from, for their risks during the war," said Allison Tucker, who 
analyzed Clinton's plan for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Clinton's 
plan, on the other hand, is a make-work program for privileged kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is not so stark. 
</P>
<P>
 Many college campuses in the late 1940s and 1950s "were still segregated or 
limited their populations with quotas," Jackson said. That was evident to 
Eubanks, who saw few other blacks on his own campus during the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite complaints that it helps those who already have access to college, 
Clinton's service program was designed explicitly to be broad-based and not 
aimed at helping only poor Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The GI Bill can be duplicated in a peacetime setting as long as you don't 
limit it to only certain groups," said James H. Scheuer, a former congressman 
who now serves as Clinton's ambassador to the European Bank for Reconstruction 
and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheuer, who used the GI Bill to finance his pursuit of a law degree at 
Columbia University, could have afforded his degree anyway. But the GI Bill's 
success, he said, came from its availability to every service member. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time we moved away from programs that help only narrow segments of 
society," Scheuer said. "The idea of giving something back to Americans who are 
willing to serve society is one we need to boost -- no matter who they are or 
where they come from." Was It a Good Investment? 
</P>
<P>
 The GI Bill of Rights increased incomes and spurred economic output, according 
to a study of World War II veterans. The study, by the Joint Economic Committee 
of Congress, spanned 1952 to 1987, the estimated working times of most WWII 
veterans. 
</P>

SINGAPORE FREES FLOGGED U.S. TEEN-AGER; ASIA: MICHAEL FAY IS 'HAPPY TO BE OUT' 
AFTER EARLY RELEASE. HE LEAVES THE COUNTRY, HEADS FOR HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Smiling and waving to the cameras like a celebrity, Michael Fay was released 
from prison Tuesday after gaining worldwide notoriety as the first American 
ever flogged in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to be out," Fay, 19, said after his release. "My health is good. 
I'm looking forward to the future very much. I'm looking forward to going back 
to my country." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay served two months and 21 days of a four-month jail sentence handed down in 
March after entering a guilty plea to spray-painting cars and other acts of 
vandalism. He was released early for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 He was initially sentenced to receive six strokes of a rattan cane as part of 
his punishment, but the government reduced the penalty to four strokes as a 
gesture to President Clinton. The caning, carried out May 5, became the focus 
of a worldwide debate about crime and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with "Lone Wolf," Fay visited the U.S. Embassy 
after his release to discuss his case with U.S. officials. He spoke briefly 
with journalists but would not answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Randy Chan, said he would not speak openly until he arrives in his 
hometown of Dayton, Ohio, with his father. George Fay flew in from the United 
States for the release. They left Singapore this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, who has lived in Singapore for two years with her second husband, told 
The Times on Monday that her son is "very excited and a little scared about 
what's waiting for him." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Michael "hasn't been able to look at himself" since the caning, 
meaning he could not bring himself to look at wounds from the caning, which has 
left some prisoners with scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay gave no indication Tuesday whether he had suffered permanent injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said the family has been approached by media outlets to sell its story 
but had not made any deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay was a senior at the Singapore American School, a $10,000-a-year private 
school attended mainly by the children of Americans working here, when he was 
arrested in October. He was forced to drop out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 George Fay has been a vocal critic of the government's handling of his son's 
case, suggesting that the youth was coerced into confessing to a crime he did 
not commit and that he had been given hints that he would be let off without a 
flogging if he pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singapore government has vociferously denied the allegations -- which 
resurfaced Tuesday, along with new discussions of Fay's Jewish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 His father told the Associated Press he is Jewish and the son of Holocaust 
survivors, and this "struck a chord in Israel," where human rights campaigners 
were among young Fay's most fervent supporters. The teen-ager repaid the favor 
by giving his only interview to Israeli radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was smacked in the face," Fay said in the telephone interview. "My hair was 
pulled. I was actually pulled out of my chair by the hair. I was hit on the 
head with one of the officer's knuckles." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay confirmed a government report that he shook the hand of the jailer who 
flogged him, saying the man was only doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth's father said that his son, while jailed, had pondered his Jewish 
background, which, he said, the family had barely discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Fay read "Schindler's List," giving his father a copy and saying he 
had underlined parts he wanted to discuss further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the book is underlined," the Associated Press quoted the father as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 While caning is common here, the U.S. Embassy said Fay was the first person 
ever caned for vandalizing private property. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government, including Clinton, has maintained that Fay was unfairly 
singled out. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Fay said outside Queenstown Remand Prison that "this is no time for 
a celebration. We are going to pick up our lives and get back to semi-normal, 
whatever that means." 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy about the case continues to mar relations between Singapore and 
the United States, formerly close allies. Singapore has been striving to host 
the first meeting of the World Trade Organization that was established this 
year, but U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has expressed opposition to 
the choice and hinted that the caning was the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's punishment was hotly debated in the United States, with many crime-weary 
Americans coming out in support of caning and others denouncing the punishment 
as a form of torture.

 Barely 48 hours after his election as president of Colombia, Ernesto Samper on 
Tuesday confronted a new round of accusations that his campaign was financed by 
money from the world's largest drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper has steadfastly denied the allegations. But new suggestions emerged 
Tuesday in the form of a tape recording that purports to reveal a discussion of 
plans to funnel millions of drug dollars into Samper's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The authenticity of the tape could not be determined. On it, the two reputed 
leaders of the Cali cocaine cartel, brothers Gilberto and Miguel Angel 
Rodriguez Orejuela, are purportedly talking on the telephone with a Colombian 
journalist who has been repeatedly linked to the cartel. The three discuss the 
need for an extra $3.75 million to help finance Samper's race in the runoff 
election held Sunday, and they appear to set the journalist up as the 
go-between who would relay cash to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The recording does not prove that the money ever actually reached Samper's 
campaign coffers, and the tape's origin is unclear. Late Tuesday, Samper said 
he had asked the state prosecutor general to investigate all money used in his 
campaign, and he denied again that he received drug profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The taped conversation also contains discussion of money for Samper's 
opponent, Andres Pastrana, a local television station reported. Neither 
Pastrana nor officials of his campaign could be reached Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper, a member of the ruling Liberal Party, narrowly defeated Conservative 
Party candidate Pastrana in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations that drug money had seeped into the presidential campaign 
circulated frequently in recent months but were denied by both camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the last couple of days have those allegations suddenly gained 
momentum. In his concession speech Sunday night, Pastrana said, "A president 
who has received drug-trafficking money does not have the moral authority to 
lead his people." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional grist for the mill came in the waning days of the campaign. 
Pastrana sent a letter to Samper asking him to join in a pledge that if the 
eventual winner discovered later that drug money was used in his race, he would 
resign immediately. Pastrana said he never received a response.

AIR FORCE OUSTED GUNMAN OVER EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS; TRAGEDY: OFFICIALS AND 
ACQUAINTANCES RECONSTRUCT EVENTS THAT CULMINATED IN FATAL ATTACK ON STAFF AND 
PATIENTS AT A BASE HOSPITAL IN WASHINGTON STATE.

 Memories of the clean-cut young man who checked out of Room 102 on Monday will 
always remind Arnold's Motel manager Marlene Anderson that it is what you do 
not see in people that can pose the greatest threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean A. Mellberg, 20, was calm, even pleasant, Anderson said, when she 
upbraided him for being late in paying his bill and checking out that day. 
</P>
<P>
 What she could not know was that Mellberg, an Air Force mechanic discharged 
last month after repeated diagnoses of emotional problems during two years of 
service, was on a homicidal mission that would end an hour later with five dead 
and 23 wounded at nearby Fairchild Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fussed at him because he hadn't paid up and was still hanging around," 
Anderson recalled Tuesday. "But he was very polite, soft-spoken, nice, 
apologetic. He said, 'OK, OK, I'm leaving.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Within a few minutes, Mellberg paid his $34 bill and was seated on a curb, 
with a large gym bag at his side. Protruding from the satchel was a white foam 
case wrapped with black tape. When he saw a taxi pull up to the curb, Anderson 
said, Mellberg's face broke into a "beautiful smile." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver took Mellberg 10 miles west of town to the Fairchild base hospital, 
which sits just outside an eight-foot-high security fence ringing the military 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellberg paid the cabbie and went into the hospital's annex, said base and 
local law enforcement officials who pieced together his actions that fateful 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, Mellberg, who was dressed completely in black from his T-shirt to 
his sneakers, ducked into a bathroom. There, officials said, he unwrapped the 
box, baring a Chinese-made MAK-90 semiautomatic assault rifle that he had 
bought from a Spokane gun dealer five days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, just after 3 p.m., he strode into the office of base psychiatrist Maj. 
Thomas Brigham, one of at least two Air Force mental health experts who had 
recommended Mellberg's discharge since his enlistment in June, 1992. Mellberg 
opened fire with the weapon, which was equipped with a 75-round drum. Brigham 
was fatally wounded, along with his office mate, psychologist Alan London. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew where he was going; he went directly to that office," Spokane County 
Undersheriff John Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellberg turned and marched down the building's halls and corridors, randomly 
spraying bullets, cutting down anyone else who got in the way. 
</P>
<P>
 A third person, 8-year-old Christine McCaren, was killed when Mellberg shot up 
the hospital cafeteria. A fourth, Anita Linder, a patient whose age was not 
available, was killed outside the hospital as Mellberg left the building. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the many military patrol officers who raced to the scene shot and 
killed Mellberg as he stood on a grassy divider in the hospital parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the wounded remained in critical condition on Tuesday, including a 
4-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl whose names were withheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was watching that scene unfold on television when police arrived at 
the motel wanting to search Mellberg's room, which had already been cleaned. 
They asked to look at any trash that he might have left. Anderson produced two 
small plastic wrappers and a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
 They were inspecting that litter when Anderson's telephone rang. It was 
Mellberg's parents, Gary and Lois, calling from his home in Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said she had bad news for them. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Lois Mellberg thought that her son was one of the victims of the 
assault. "She went hysterical, screaming, 'Tell me he wasn't one of them!' " 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson did that, adding that Mellberg was the main suspect in the shootings. 
His mother cried even harder. "If you only knew the horrible things that 
(Fairchild) did to that boy. He wouldn't hurt a flea!" 
</P>
<P>
 At Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane late Monday night, Father Luz Flores 
was among 10 military chaplains called in to counsel grieving friends and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the husband of a woman who was shot, and their little kid," 
Flores said. "The little kid wanted me to tell his mom that he loved her. You 
see, he was with her when she was shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives of other victims he talked to were either "kind of stoic, with 
their lips quivering," or "generally angry" at the person who had done this. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was angry with herself for not seeing the flaws beneath the surface 
of the man who spent five quiet days at her motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "With other people we get in here, in their appearance and demeanor you might 
expect it," she said, shaking her head behind the counter of the cramped motel 
office. "But not this fellow. He looked like a happy person." 
</P>
<P>
 Licensed gun dealer Michael Carroll also misjudged the man. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from behind the screen door of his home in central Spokane, Carroll 
said Mellberg was referred by a mutual friend at the base when he came by 
wanting to pay cash for a MAK-90. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said he asked Mellberg what he planned to do with that particular gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wanted it for target plinking and maybe hunting," Carroll 
recalled. "It didn't seem unusual to me. He seemed confident and personable." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did things by the book, did everything right," Carroll said. "The problem 
was with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham's recommendation for discharge was not the first time that Mellberg's 
behavior had come to the attention of Air Force mental health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Within one month of joining the Air Force on June 30, 1992, a staff 
psychiatrist at Texas' Lackland Air Force Base recommended his discharge for 
"having some problems adjusting and getting along in basic training," said 
Robert MacNaughton, spokesman for the San Antonio base. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellberg's mother told the Seattle Times on Tuesday that her son's problems 
were in part the result of ill treatment by other airmen at Fairchild. "They 
put out rumors he was gay . . . they stole chairs from inside his room . . . 
they flattened the tires on his bike," Lois Mellberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mellberg was formally separated from the Air Force on May 23, receiving an 
honorable discharge, which he had fought unsuccessfully. 
</P>

Rovin in Denver contributed to this story.

ALABAMA SCHOOL SETTLES GIRL'S SUIT OVER INTERRACIAL DATING REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mixed-race student who sued school officials over a white principal's 
remarks about interracial dating reached a financial settlement Tuesday to end 
the case, her lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of money going to 17-year-old Revonda Bowen was not disclosed.Under 
the settlement, neither Randolph County High School principal Hulond Humphries 
nor the school board admitted wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen, president of the junior class at the rural high school in Wedowee, 
filed a federal lawsuit in March, charging that Humphries threatened to cancel 
the prom if interracial couples planned to attend. The prom was not canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen, daughter of a white father and black mother, also asserted that 
Humphries said her parents' marriage and her birth were a "mistake." She 
alleged violation of her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, 
said the amount in the settlement will be disclosed when a judge approves the 
agreement. Dees said the money will be given to Bowen when she reaches age 19, 
although it can be used for her college education before then. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the principal and the school board could not be reached 
immediately for comment.

BILL REINSTATING INDEPENDENT COUNSELS OKD, SENT TO CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House on Tuesday passed and sent to President Clinton legislation to 
reinstate the law authorizing independent counsels to investigate alleged 
wrongdoing by top federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 317 to 105 vote on the measure, which Clinton is expected to sign, would 
restore the regular procedure used in 13 investigations since 1978 to avoid 
apparent conflicts of interest.The Senate approved the bill last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel statute lapsed in 1992 because of a Republican 
filibuster in the Senate and was unavailable in January when Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno chose Robert B. Fiske Jr. as special counsel for the Whitewater inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation would continue the procedure under the old law of requiring an 
attorney general to conduct a preliminary investigation of allegations against 
any of 60 top officials, including the President and Cabinet members. If 
"reasonable grounds" for further investigation were found, the attorney general 
would have to ask a special panel of three federal judges to name an 
independent counsel to conduct the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican lawmakers complained Tuesday that a House-Senate conference had 
inserted into the final version of the bill a provision that would allow the 
three-judge panel to name Fiske to continue his investigation as an independent 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. George W. Gekas (R-Pa.) suggested that the exemption was intended to make 
Clinton and "members of the White House" whom Fiske may be investigating 
eligible to have their legal fees reimbursed retroactively.

LESBIAN REGAINS CUSTODY OF SON AFTER LEGAL BATTLE; FAMILY: MOTHER HAD BEEN 
RULED UNFIT BECAUSE OF HER RELATIONSHIP WITH ANOTHER WOMAN. APPEALS COURT 
DECISION IS HAILED BY GAY-RIGHTS ADVOCATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Virginia mother whose young son was taken away last year because she lives 
with another lesbian regained custody Tuesday in a closely watched gay-rights 
legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that a parent is homosexual does not per se render a parent unfit to 
have custody of his or her child," a Virginia appeals court declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, a Henrico County judge shocked gay-rights activists by taking 
2-year old Tyler from Sharon Bottoms, 24, and putting him in the care of her 
mother, Kay Bottoms. Judge Buford M. Parsons Jr. said that, because sodomy is 
"immoral (and) illegal" under state law, the mother's lesbian relationship made 
her unfit to raise her child. 
</P>
<P>
 Had that reasoning been adopted widely, gay parents would have been in danger 
of losing their children in the many states that continue to deem same-sex 
relationships as illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, the appeals court called the judge's order a mistake and said 
that homosexuality does not strip a mother of her "natural and legal right" to 
raise her child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parent's right to the custody and companionship of the child should only 
be disrupted if there are compelling reasons to do so," the state court said. 
There was no evidence that Sharon Bottoms had "abused or neglected her son" or 
that her lesbian relationship had "a deleterious effect" on the child, the 
court said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay-rights lawyers said they were delighted with the reversal. "This sends a 
strong message that, just because a woman is a lesbian, it does not make her an 
unfit mother," said Paula Brantner, interim legal director for the National 
Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But a leader of a group that espouses family values said the ruling may hurt 
the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very unfortunate ruling because it sends a false message that male 
and female roles are insignificant," said Kristi Hamrick of the Family Research 
Council in Washington. "This young boy could be damaged without an effective 
male role model." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, the case put a spotlight on a growing number of custody 
disputes where homosexuality was an issue. The Virginia ruling was unusual in 
that the child was awarded to a third party: his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 State courts are split on whether homosexuality is an important factor or no 
factor at all in deciding whether it is in the "best interest of the child" to 
stay with a parent. The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled directly whether 
discrimination because of sexual orientation violates the Constitution's 
guarantee of equal protection of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cases are all over the map," Brantner said. "In Missouri and Virginia, 
for example, the rule has been if you are gay, you lose your child. In 
California, it is pretty well established that sexual orientation is not a 
basis for taking away custody of a child, except where there is evidence of 
parental unfitness." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers on both sides of the Virginia case have conceded that it is a messy 
dispute involving several "imperfect people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Bottoms married in 1989 and soon got pregnant, but her husband left and 
has refused to pay child support. She has worked part time as a grocery clerk 
and also has been on welfare. During the custody battle, she alleged that her 
mother's live-in boyfriend had sexually abused her for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, she has lived in a lesbian relationship with April Wade, a 
27-year-old food service worker. 
</P>
<P>
 During the court hearing, Kay Bottoms said that she sought care of Tyler 
because the child was not being cared for and was often left at her home. The 
trial judge also noted that Tyler referred to Wade as "Da Da." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the appeals court said that the evidence showed that Sharon 
Bottoms "is and has been a fit and nurturing parent." Absent "specific proof" 
of a problem, homosexuality cannot be assumed to have a bad effect on the 
child, the court said.

COLLISION OF AF JET, CARGO PLANE BLAMED ON CONTROLLER MISTAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A collision between an Air Force F-16D jet fighter and a C-130 cargo plane 
last March in North Carolina, in which 23 servicemen were killed and 100 were 
injured, was caused mainly by the mistakes of an inexperienced Air Force air 
controller, a formal investigation has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Tuesday they had not decided whether to bring disciplinary 
action against the air controller, who apparently already had been undergoing 
retraining because he had been judged to lack the necessary aptitude to 
continue in the high-skill job. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is not scheduled to be made public until next week but officials 
who have seen it said it will show that, while other factors contributed, the 
primary fault rested with the controller for mishandling landing instructions 
to the two planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision, which took place over Pope Air Force Base in North Carolina, 
sent wreckage plunging onto the runway, where it skidded and slammed into a 
parked C-141 cargo aircraft, igniting the fuel tanks of the big transport 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the injuries were suffered by Army paratroopers from nearby Ft. Bragg, 
N.C., who had been preparing to board the C-141 to make a training jump. The 
C-130 was not carrying troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash, which officials described as one of the worst military air 
accidents in recent years, marked the third such embarrassment for the Air 
Force in the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few weeks after that incident, two Air Force F-15Cs mistakenly shot 
down a pair of U.S. Army helicopters over northern Iraq, killing 26 persons. 
And early in March, an Air Force AC-130H "Spectre" gunship crashed in Kenya, on 
a routine mission to Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the crash reports has been made public but officials said that in the 
case in Iraq, the pilots of the two F-15Cs misidentified the U.S. Blackhawk 
helicopters as Iraqi Hinds. The results of that investigation are to be made 
public next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with the report on the collision at Pope said the controller 
erred in at least two major ways: he failed to warn the F-16D early enough and 
he mixed up the call sign of the C-130 with that of another plane that already 
had landed, leaving it without instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, officials said Tuesday, the pilot of the F-16D became confused 
and was unaware that he was too close to the C-130. When the fighter hit the 
larger airplane, it sheared off the horizontal stabilizer on the C-130's 
starboard wing. The impact also destroyed the sensors in the nose of the F-16D 
that feed electronic data to the flight computer, leaving the electrically 
steered fighter virtually uncontrollable.

CLINTON FUND-RAISING EFFORTS UNDER FIRE; POLITICS: HE SEEKS FINANCE REFORM BUT 
CRITICS SAY HE HASN'T PUSHED HARD ENOUGH. STUDY SHOWS HE HAS RAISED $20 MILLION 
IN UNREGULATED 'SOFT MONEY' FOR DEMOCRATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's extensive fund raising for the Democratic Party is coming 
under fire from campaign reform advocates, who maintain it mocks his promises 
to dam the flow of money into politics. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President prepares to host a lucrative Democratic National Committee 
dinner tonight in Washington, the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause 
released a study showing that since Clinton took office he has raised more than 
$20.5 million in unregulated "soft money" from individuals, corporations and 
labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
 As he promised during the campaign, Clinton has introduced legislation that 
would ban most donations not subject to federal limits on campaign 
contributions. But the legislation is stalled in a House-Senate conference 
committee, and reform advocates say the President hasn't pushed hard enough to 
break the logjam. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton "has not conducted the kind of public fight he said he would," said 
Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the DNC and the White House say Clinton is committed to reforming 
the campaign finance system, but will not put the party at a competitive 
disadvantage with the GOP by refusing soft money while it is still legal. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton has proposed, pushed for and will sign campaign finance 
reform," said Michael Waldman, a White House aide monitoring the legislation. 
"But we will not unilaterally disarm while the Republican Party is raising 
millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The critics, however, insist that Clinton's continued aggressive exploitation 
of the soft money loophole sends the wrong signal to the public and legislators 
on Capitol Hill. "If they were sincere about real campaign finance reform, they 
would behave differently," said Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center 
for Responsive Politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Under campaign finance laws, corporations and labor unions are barred from 
making direct contributions to candidates for federal office, and individuals 
are limited to donations of $1,000 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 But the soft money loophole allows unions, companies and individuals to make 
unlimited donations to the national parties for grass-roots "party building." 
Those can include crucial political organizing activities, such as phone banks 
and door-to-door canvassing, and thus allows large donors to effectively 
circumvent the strict limits on donations to individual candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Common Cause study shows, the DNC raised $40.5 million in soft 
money contributions between July, 1992, when Clinton won the Democratic 
presidential nomination, and last March, the latest month for which figures are 
available. Over that same period, the Republicans raised just over half as much 
in soft money: $21.5 million. All figures in the Common Cause study come from 
filings with the Federal Election Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also shows that under Clinton the entertainment industry has emerged 
as one of the largest sources of donations to the Democratic Party, trailing 
only the financial industry and organized labor. Over the 21-month period 
studied by Common Cause, the entertainment industry donated more than $2.6 
million to the DNC. 
</P>
<P>
 Over that period, the largest entertainment industry donor was Time Warner 
Inc. The company directly donated $28,333 to the DNC over the period, the 
review found, while executives with the firm pumped in $480,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other large entertainment industry donors included David Geffen, who 
contributed $220,000; Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chairman of Walt Disney Studios, 
who contributed $170,000; director Steven Spielberg, who contributed $100,000, 
and Sidney J. Sheinberg and Lew R. Wasserman of MCA Inc., who donated $120,000 
and $110,000, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the House and Senate have passed campaign finance reform bills that would 
ban almost all soft money contributions to the national parties. But the bills 
have been held up by disagreements between the two chambers.

POLICE ARREST TEEN IN SHOOTING OF 2 GIRLS IN GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder shortly after 
he allegedly fired more than 20 rounds into a passing car, wounding two 
passengers, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the shooting occurred as the two victims, both teen-age girls, 
were leaving a party near Laramore Lane and Lewis Street just before midnight 
Monday. Authorities said the shooting was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were treated at Garden Grove Hospital and Medical Center. One girl 
was shot in the left leg and the other was wounded in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found two weapons, an assault rifle and a revolver, believed 
to have been used during the shooting. The teen likely will be tried as a 
juvenile, they said.

WHITE HOUSE SEEKING $24.8 BILLION FOR IMMIGRATION-RELATED PROGRAMS; GOVERNMENT: 
THE REQUEST, WHICH COULD EXPAND THE SAN CLEMENTE CHECKPOINT BY TWO LANES, IS 
ONE-THIRD GREATER THAN BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN. BUT WILSON AIDE CRITICIZES 
IT AS CREATIVE ACCOUNTING. 
</P>

 Showcasing its attentiveness to the immigration issue, the Clinton 
Administration released figures Tuesday indicating that its spending requests 
for the next fiscal year were one-third greater than the amount sought for 
immigration-related programs in the last Bush budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The briefing, held by Budget Director Leon Panetta and INS Commissioner Doris 
Meissner, came on the eve of Gov. Pete Wilson's visit to Washington today in 
search of federal funding to offset the costs of illegal immigrants -- and 
presumably to take the Administration to task for not acting forcefully or 
quickly enough on his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures show California in line to receive the lion's share of the 
proposed federal spending on immigration-related programs that range from 
agriculture to education to law enforcement. But in compiling the figures, the 
Administration combined federal spending for legal and illegal immigration, 
thus yielding more robust spending numbers than had been previously used in the 
Washington-Sacramento dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 An Office of Management and Budget spokesman said the federal spending could 
not be accurately broken down between legal and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $24.8 billion sought by the White House for immigration-related 
programs in the next fiscal year, the Administration projected that California 
would receive $8.4 billion -- nearly $6 billion more than second-place New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta calculated that in fiscal 1993 President George Bush requested $18.8 
billion in federal spending on immigration and other programs affecting 
immigrants. The Clinton fiscal 1995 budget seeks about $6 billion more, 
representing the one-third increase nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of federal spending for legal and illegal immigration spurred 
swift reaction from a top Wilson aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Goodman, the governor's deputy chief of staff for communications, 
dismissed the Clinton numbers as creative accounting and an attempt to "get the 
cash register to ring to a higher number." 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw this as an opportunity to get their story out before the states give 
out the facts. To confuse (spending on legal and illegal immigration) is to 
start down a very slippery slope," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson in January estimated that the federal government owed the state $2.3 
billion in illegal-immigration costs and factored the entire amount into his 
state budget calculations. He has since lowered his budget expectations to $760 
million in federal reimbursements, but argues that the federal government still 
owes California the higher amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the governors of each impacted state have legitimate problems . . . 
but I think that there's a tendency in some instances to overplay this issue," 
Panetta said. "I don't think the President questions the need to deal with the 
issue, but it has to be done with sensitivity and responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner, meanwhile, offered an update on the Administration's plan to slow 
illegal immigration with greater vigilance along the country's southwest 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego and El Paso, which account for 65% of the country's yearly immigrant 
apprehensions, are targets of the most assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner cites 350 new Border Patrol agents, 250 new vehicles, 350 new 
encrypted voice radios, 14 additional miles of border fence and a new automated 
processing system as examples of the Administration's efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Border Patrol's San Clemente checkpoint would be spruced up 
and expanded by two lanes, a $7.5-million improvement. But the long-awaited 
$30-million, 16-lane upgrade that was once hoped to be operational by 1995 
remains indefinitely on hold, Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expansion envisioned two or three years ago . . . turned out to be far 
more expensive than what the Congress had appropriated," Meissner said. "There 
was money that had been set aside for San Clemente, which was not enough for 
expansion but gave us funds for rebuilding." 
</P>
<P>
 But even that limited improvement is threatened by a bill expected to pass the 
House today, which would require the INS to conduct a study proving the San 
Clemente checkpoint is effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Due Oct. 1, the study was called for by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), who 
recently challenged the INS to properly expand the checkpoint or shut it down 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless the INS can prove that a checkpoint located more than 50 miles from 
the international border is more effective, I can see no reason to continue 
operating the San Clemente checkpoint," Packard said. "I believe that these 
funds could be better spent to strengthen the U.S.-Mexico border -- our first 
line of defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the Administration's proposed immigration reform package are 
speedier deportation procedures, streamlined asylum adjudications, stiffer 
employer sanctions and greater emphasis on naturalization of legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a plea for increased cooperation, Panetta called for a state-federal 
partnership to combat Capitol Hill opposition to the immigration initiatives, 
which benefit only a few states. 
</P>
<P>
 Of particular importance to California is an Administration plan to seek $350 
million to help states saddled with the costs of incarcerating large numbers of 
illegal immigrant prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, a veteran California legislator who formerly chaired the House Budget 
Committee, announced the spending allocation with considerable fanfare in 
April. But he warned that it faced a difficult legislative sojourn because it 
would benefit only the six or seven states most severely affected by the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, the money was yanked out by an appropriations subcommittee 
earlier this month in favor of diverting it into an anti-drug program that 
would distribute the funds throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you get resources to these (affected) states?" Panetta said. "My God, 
we're having one hell of a time trying to commit resources to the investments 
that all of us care about. . . . If six or seven impacted states are asking for 
additional resources, then is there any question in anybody's mind that this is 
one hell of a battle?"

LOST HIKER SURVIVES 6 DAYS ON PERSEVERANCE AND RAISINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lost, with painful blisters on his feet and a crust of bread and raisins his 
only food, Raimund Hilmar Ottmann kept walking. 
</P>
<P>
 And somehow, after six days lost in rugged Sequoia National Park, he emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 Even rescuers had almost given up hope, scaling back efforts to find the 
45-year-old German aircraft mechanic who works at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like we had searched the area adequately to find a live hiker and we 
didn't," park spokesman Pete Allen said. "And so we began to consider that he 
might be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Ottmann, who has declined to speak to reporters, was in excellent condition 
when he emerged Saturday morning. Though Ottmann could not describe his route 
to safety, park officials believe he stumbled upon a rarely used trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottmann left on a day hike to Paradise Peak on June 12. When he did not show 
up for work the next day, his colleagues became worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Helicopters, dog teams and about 100 rescuers scoured the dense brush and 
steep ravines. But the search was fruitless, and soon rescuers cut back their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's steep brush and dangerous, and we had to consider the safety of our 
people," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ottmann fought on. He knew helicopters were above, so he tried to hail 
them using toilet paper and his camera flash. At one point, he climbed to a 
high point to catch the attention of circling pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ottmann's clothes got wet as he waded in a stream, he made sure to dry 
them. That helped him fend off nightly temperatures that dipped into the 30s, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Ottmann crossed a swinging bridge over the middle fork of the 
Kaweah River near Buckeye Flat campground. A passerby saw Ottmann and drove him 
to a ranger station. 
</P>
<P>
 Search commander Randy Larson said Ottmann's ordeal underscores the danger of 
hiking alone. Last year, 47 hikers at Sequoia National Park got lost, but only 
a few of the rescue operations involved wide searches, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he was fortunate," Allen said. "But we think his good fortune was 
aided by his good judgment."

SEWAGE PLANT BYPRODUCTS MAY HOLD RADIOACTIVE WASTE, REPORT WARNS; ENVIRONMENT: 
EVIDENCE OF CONTAMINATION IS FOUND AT 14 FACILITIES NATIONWIDE, BUT NONE IN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing evidence of contamination in 14 municipal sewer systems nationwide over 
the past decade, the General Accounting Office warned Tuesday of the danger of 
radioactive waste in the sludge and ash formed at sewage treatment facilities 
and often recycled into fertilizer and compost. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released to Congress, the GAO does not cite an imminent threat to 
public health or mention problems in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But it raises concerns for people who work with the material and contends that 
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees the handling of radioactive 
materials, has not been monitoring the amount of radioactivity collecting at 
sewage treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says that nearly 25,000 facilities have licenses to use and dispose 
of radioactive materials, but only 15 have been inspected by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, "the full extent of the radioactive contamination of 
sewage sludge, ash and related byproducts nationwide is unknown. Neither the 
NRC nor the Environmental Protection Agency has conducted or required testing 
to determine the extent of the radioactive contamination occurring at treatment 
plants that receive radioactive discharges." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report is based on contamination studies at sewage treatment plants in 
Portland, Ore.; Washington; Cleveland and Youngstown, Ohio; Ann Arbor, Mich.; 
Vicksburg, Miss.; Springfield, Mass.; Tonawanda and Grand Island, N.Y.; Oak 
Ridge and Erwin, Tenn.; Royersford, Pa., and two unidentified Texas cities, 
said Gene Aloise, the GAO official in charge of the report. 
</P>
<P>
 NRC officials acknowledged to a U.S. Senate committee Tuesday that radioactive 
materials were found in sewage sludge, but that radioactivity amounts "were 
below levels that would cause concern for public health and safety." Still, 
they said, enough contamination existed to require cleanups in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Legally discharged by hospitals, laboratories and a variety of manufacturing 
companies, limited quantities of radioactive waste matter regularly are flushed 
into the nation's sewer systems where dilution is supposed to render the 
material harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the report cites several cases in which, instead of dispersing, the 
radioactive materials re-concentrated in the sludge and ash that is filtered 
out of the waste water passing through treatment plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least five cases, the report says, the amount of radioactivity could 
expose people to 100 millirems -- the maximum dose permitted by the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
 "A threat to public health and safety may not always exist if the NRC's 
criterion is exceeded," the report states, "but according to a former NRC 
commissioner, exceeding the criterion is a public health and safety concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Excessive exposure to radioactivity poses risks of cancer and genetic damage 
to fetuses. How much exposure is excessive remains under discussion and debate. 
From natural sources, including minerals in the soil and the sun's rays, people 
can be exposed to several hundred millirems of radiation each year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Cleveland sewage treatment plant discussed in the report, radiation 
levels were 20 times higher than naturally occurring levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, no program monitors radioactivity in sludge, said Gary Butner, 
a senior health physicist with the state's Department of Health Services 
radiologic health branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not to say we haven't looked," said Butner, adding that his office 
has conducted occasional inspections of municipal sewage treatment plants. 
"We've never turned up a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the congressional testimony Tuesday, NRC Chairman Ivan Selin disputed 
at least one of the GAO's contentions and said no additional regulatory action 
is required -- beyond what the NRC already has done to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the licensee sites have been inspected on a routine basis over the 
years," he said. "Their sewer discharges were found to have been in compliance 
with NRC regulations applicable at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the NRC concluded that the release of insoluble radioactive waste 
into sewers was responsible for the re-concentration of the material in sludge 
and ash. The agency subsequently prohibited disposal of such waste matter into 
sewers, Selin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NRC expects that action to "resolve the identified 
re-concentration problem," Selin said the agency has commissioned a further 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 The report faults the NRC's proposed study because "it would not require any 
testing at treatment plants but would rely on existing data from prior case 
studies of contamination at treatment plants." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report states that the NRC's ban on sewer disposal of insoluble 
radioactive waste "will address much of the problem of concentration but may 
not solve it entirely because even soluble materials that are allowed to be 
discharged could still concentrate as the result of chemical changes that could 
occur during the waste water treatment process." 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends that the NRC notify all treatment plants that receive 
radioactive waste that they may be generating contaminated sludge and ash. It 
also suggests that testing may be necessary and that the NRC establish 
acceptable limits for radioactivity in all sewage treatment byproducts.

SENATE PANEL DEFEATS BILL TO WEAKEN RENT CONTROLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation that would weaken rent-control restrictions in Santa Monica, West 
Hollywood and four other cities by authorizing landlords to increase rates when 
a housing unit became vacant was defeated Tuesday night by the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejection of the landlord-supported bill handed a substantial victory to 
tenant organizations, local rent-control boards and representatives of 
low-income Californians who claimed that the measure would open the door to 
gouging of renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the proposal by Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Hanford) argued that 
"extreme" rent controls in such cities as Santa Monica started out years ago as 
well-intended programs for moderate- and low-income residents, but had evolved 
into havens for high-income professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, supporters of the bill contended, rent controls had imposed such 
severe financial restrictions that landlords were unable to improve maintenance 
and unwilling to invest in construction of more apartments. They claimed that 
this situation has aggravated the housing crisis in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would have allowed landlords in Santa Monica, West Hollywood, Palm 
Springs, Berkeley, East Palo Alto and Cotati to increase rates when a rental 
unit was voluntarily vacated by a tenant. The proposal would not have applied 
to Los Angeles or San Francisco, where landlords currently have such authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The Judiciary Committee, historically a dead end for bills that would weaken 
rent controls, defeated the proposal on a 5-5 vote. Senate President Pro Tem 
Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), a committee member, represented the swing vote but 
abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee agreed to reconsider its action at a future date if Costa can 
fashion amendments suitable to Lockyer. Lockyer said later he was concerned 
about rent-controlled housing being occupied by higher-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said he was interested in discussing with Costa an amendment that 
would subject prospective tenants to an income-screening process aimed at 
limiting rent-controlled housing to low-income people.

NO WEAPON FOUND IN SEARCH OF CHICAGO FIELD; PROBE: A WOODED LOT NEAR O'HARE 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IS COMBED FOR POSSIBLE EVIDENCE IN SIMPSON CASE. A 
TIPSTER REPORTED SEEING HIM THERE THE DAY AFTER KILLINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an anonymous spit of wood in an O'Hare International Airport flight 
path, littered with trash and clotted with weeds and elephant grass, a 
summertime fortress for suburban rat packs and a nocturnal haunt for a homeless 
man who sleeps under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past week, the lot, brimming with cottonwoods and jack pines, has 
become the most scrutinized parcel of real estate in the city, combed by Los 
Angeles and Chicago police detectives searching for a missing murder weapon and 
bloody clothes that might yield crucial clues in the Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing evidence-sniffing Rotweilers and wielding metal detectors, police 
covered the 20,000-square-foot lot for the third day Tuesday. For four hours, 
they rooted in vain through treehouses erected by neighborhood children and 
poked over the transient's campsite. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the police and their dogs were gone, this time for good, they 
said, leaving without their sought-after knife or bloodied clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done the majority of the searching we expected to do here," said Los 
Angeles Police Homicide Detective Bert Luper, whose walrus mustache and 
surfer's shirts have become familiar images on Chicago nightly newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Luper declined to describe exactly what items detectives are seeking -- 
although they are said to be hunting for the murder weapon and a jacket, shirt 
and shoes. He played down reports that the knife used in the murders had a 
15-inch blade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not quite that long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began concentrating on the lot after a local ABC news affiliate 
broadcast reports from an anonymous tipster who insisted that he saw a figure 
who looked like Simpson emerge from a culvert at the edge of the wooded area 
about 7 a.m. June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson arrived at the O'Hare Plaza Hotel across from the lot at 6:30 that 
morning, within hours of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole, and an 
acquaintance, waiter Ronald Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The tipster, who said he was driving out of a service station lot across the 
street from the O'Hare Plaza, has stuck to his story and elaborated on it in 
further calls to television reporter Dick Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy said Simpson was wearing a touring hat and a golf shirt and pants," 
said Johnson. The tipster, he added, has not talked directly to police, but his 
information has been relayed. 
</P>
<P>
 No other witnesses have come forward, Luper said. Those familiar with the 
wooded area say the time of the alleged sighting of Simpson is crucial to its 
veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Venturini, 66, owner of the service station, said that until 7 a.m., the 
streets near the wooded area are usually deserted. "You could walk an elephant 
down there and no one would notice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After 7, the streets crowd quickly with commuters hurrying to a nearby 
elevated railway stop. If Simpson had gone to the woods after 7, Venturini 
said, it is likely he would have been seen by more than one witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between 7 and 8, it's like Grand Central Station," Venturini said. "You 
couldn't come out of those woods without being noticed -- especially someone 
like O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Pete Phillips, the former general manager of the O'Hare Plaza, said 
Simpson arrived at the hotel about 6:30 a.m., driven to the entrance by a Hertz 
rental car employee. Simpson was to play in a Hertz-sponsored golf outing. 
According to Phillips, Simpson went straight to his room on the ninth floor and 
was not seen until 8:30 a.m., when he came down in a panic and demanded a cab 
to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the anonymous report of Simpson's appearance in the woods, 
investigators have no firm proof that the former pro football star and 
television announcer was there on the morning of June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday afternoon, police found a duffel bag and a pair of socks, which will be 
brought back to Los Angeles to be analyzed, but they acknowledged that the 
recovered items could easily have been discarded by someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturini said the woods -- just two blocks from the neighborhood where serial 
killer John Wayne Gacy killed and buried 27 youths -- has been used for illegal 
dumping over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Frey, 12, who lives in the neighborhood, and a friend, Paul Rossi, 13, 
were among the steady stream of gawkers who trotted down the service road near 
O'Hare to watch police scramble under cottonwoods and jack pines. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, who pedaled over on racing bikes, had a personal stake in the 
police activity. Chicago canine unit officers climbed up into all three of 
their tree forts in search of the missing knife. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, their friends were crowding around Luper, begging him for 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you believe this?" Luper said, shaking his head in amazement. "I'm a 
cop." 
</P>

 To James Turney, 14, it was only appropriate. He already had Simpson's 
autograph on an old football card, bought for $35 at a sports memorabilia 
store. Now he wanted one from one of Simpson's pursuers.

 "This is history," Turney said. Hunt for Evidence

<P>
 O.J. Simpson was staying at the O'Hare Plaza Hotel the morning the bodies were 
found. Police searched the field after a man who worked nearby said he had seen 
somebody resembling Simpson there.

MIXED MESSAGES; SIMPSON IS HASTILY EDITED OUT OF FILM ON VALUES, BUT SOME 
PREFER THE ORIGINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The distributor of an educational film on goodness and morality that features 
O.J. Simpson is offering to replace several thousand already sold copies with a 
new version in which Simpson has been edited out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the president of Los Angeles-based Mentor Media says that more people seem 
to want the O.J. version than the non-O.J. version. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange," said Mentor Media's Kris Winter, distributor of the film 
titled "For Goodness Sake." "We've had four people call so far and ask for 
replacement tapes without O.J. But at least a dozen people have called and 
wanted to order the film with him in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles public television station KCET, which 
plans to air the film on Saturday, said the station will use the non-O.J. 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the events of the past two weeks, including the (Simpson) spot would 
detract from the purpose and spirit of the program," KCET spokeswoman Laurel 
Lambert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The film features celebrities in vignettes depicting moral choices, including 
Simpson, Jason Alexander of "Seinfeld," Faith Ford of "Murphy Brown," Bob Saget 
of "America's Funniest Home Videos" and Florence Henderson of "The Brady 
Bunch." A promotional flyer for the film describes it as "a 'values' video for 
the '90s. 'For Goodness Sake' makes a compelling case for responsibility, 
integrity and virtue." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-minute Simpson scene opens in a fancy restaurant with the narrator 
sitting at a table. "Every day, life presents us with a veritable menu of 
temptations," he says, as the camera pans over to Simpson and a female 
companion sitting at a nearby table, looking at menus. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, sweetheart," Simpson says, "what do you feel like having?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, it all looks so good," the woman says. "I'm trying to decide 
between cheating on my taxes and scalping theater tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try this one -- spreading an unsubstantiated rumor," Simpson 
says as a waiter approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, monsieur," the waiter says in a mock French accent, "we have lovely 
specials today, starting with plagiarizing a report and, for madame, having an 
affair with your boss." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have anything a little less spicy?" Simpson asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter said "several thousand" copies of the film have been distributed to 
corporations and educational institutions in the United States and 13 other 
countries, at a purchase price of $695. Winter said Simpson and the other stars 
donated their time for the film, which was produced in 1992 by the Micah Center 
for Ethical Monotheism, a nonprofit Los Angeles organization. It was released 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Micah Center declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter said her company began preparing to take Simpson out of the film soon 
after his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman were found 
murdered, and investigators' attention began concentrating on Simpson. His part 
was edited out over the weekend after Simpson was formally charged with the 
murders, Winter said.

DRUG USE RISING AMONG STUDENTS, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a quarter of California high school students are heavy drinkers by 
their junior year, and teen-agers' use of other drugs is on the rise, according 
to a state study released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 5,655 students in public junior high and high schools found fewer 
youths trying cocaine compared to eight years ago. But after a period of 
declining use among California teen-agers in the late 1980s, drugs such as 
amphetamines, marijuana and LSD are on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the psychedelic drug LSD has more than doubled among juniors since 
1985-86, with 12% having tried it at least once in the previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, commissioned by the state attorney general's office and the 
Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, was conducted from November through 
February at 100 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey asked seventh-, ninth- and 11th-graders about their use of alcohol 
and a dozen other drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attributed the increased drug use, in part, to cutbacks in 
drug-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 40% of freshmen and 36% of juniors surveyed said they had not taken an 
alcohol- or drug-prevention class in the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe the key to progress in the past has been our ability to transmit 
a clear and compelling message to our young people that illicit drugs and 
alcohol abuse will ruin your life and destroy your future," Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren said. "Unfortunately, today that message is being diluted." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also blamed cuts in law enforcement and what he said was a 
glamorization by the entertainment industry of drug use. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has conducted the student drug and alcohol use survey every other 
year since 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age drinking has remained relatively stable over that period, but alcohol 
remains by far the most widely used drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that 53.1% of seventh-graders, 68.6% of high school freshmen 
and 74.3% of juniors had had at least one drink in the previous six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine percent of high school juniors and 21% of freshmen were classified 
as excessive alcohol users. That group included those who had consumed five or 
more drinks in a row at least twice in the previous two weeks, had gotten very 
drunk or sick at least three times in their lives, or drank to get drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 28.1% of juniors and 23% of freshmen were described as "high-risk 
drug users" who used marijuana or other drugs frequently, mixed their drugs or 
tried cocaine.

IMPACT OF THE FALLING DOLLAR; TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS; U.S. TRADE GAP SURGES 
22%, SPARKING NEW RATE HIKE FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's monthly trade deficit soared 22% to $8.4 billion in April, the 
Commerce Department said Tuesday, as Americans' appetite for foreign-made goods 
reached record levels but sluggish economies overseas continued to hurt demand 
for items and services offered by U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 April's trade gap was larger than most analysts had expected and left the 
deficit running at a $133.5-billion annual rate -- putting the United States on 
track to suffer its worst trade imbalance since a record $152.1-billion 
shortfall in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The report put even more pressure on the shaky U.S. dollar and resurrected 
fears that the Federal Reserve Board may raise interest rates again soon in an 
effort to prop up the battered greenback while keeping a lid on inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar has been generally weak against most major foreign currencies for 
months. A falling dollar usually boosts America's export business because it 
makes U.S.-made goods cheaper for foreign customers to purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. manufacturers have yet to benefit much from the dollar's latest slide 
because many of America's chief trading partners -- including Japan and most 
European countries -- have been suffering from prolonged recessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drop in the dollar hasn't helped us much, because people and companies 
overseas just don't have much money to spend on anything," said Gladys Moreau 
of the Export Small Business Development Center, a Los Angeles-based trade 
group that helps small U.S. companies trying to expand their foreign sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, U.S. consumers in April spent $8.4 billion more on foreign goods and 
services than they sold to overseas customers, up 22.1% from a $6.87-billion 
shortfall in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Moreau and most other experts said there is no reason to panic over 
Tuesday's trade gap report. 
</P>
<P>
 Though U.S. exports declined a steep 4.2% in April from March, to $40.29 
billion, analysts noted that nearly half the decline stemmed from an unusually 
large drop in sales of non-monetary gold. Sales of the gold, which is primarily 
used to make jewelry, had soared the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the value of imports in April climbed 0.2% from March to a record 
$53.6 billion, the increase was caused by a sharp jump in oil prices rather 
than an upswing in overall purchasing trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers really aren't as bad as they look," said Stephen Cooney, 
international trade analyst for the National Assn. of Manufacturers in 
Washington. "All things considered, the manufacturing sector looks poised for a 
strong second half of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widening trade gap, Cooney noted that exports in the first four 
months of 1994 were running 6% ahead of the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, he said, Germany's economy is on the mend and Japan is showing 
signs of pulling out of its recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturers here in the U.S. should see business pick up as Japan and the 
European countries get back on their feet and start buying our products again," 
Cooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the nation's home building boom has apparently peaked and that 
consumer spending is on the wane, so its manufacturing sector will have to 
improve if America hopes to prolong its economic expansion that began more than 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A weak dollar should ultimately benefit U.S. manufacturers by making their 
goods cheaper for foreign consumers to purchase, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "But a weak dollar also raises inflationary pressures, because it can cause 
American consumers to pay higher prices for imports and also encourage domestic 
manufacturers to institute price hikes of their own," said Gary Ciminero, chief 
economist of Fleet Financial Bank in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Ciminero and some other analysts said, Tuesday's report could put 
more pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates 
for a fifth time this year in its efforts to cool the economy and keep 
inflation in check.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IMPACT OF THE FALLING DOLLAR; TURMOIL IN THE 
MARKETS; HOW MANY BEARS WILL A WEAKENING DOLLAR BUY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The calendar says it's late June, but on Wall Street it feels disturbingly 
like late March. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's sudden plunge has pulled U.S. stock and bond markets down 
sharply, in an eerie replay of the selloff that dominated the last two weeks of 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average lost 33.93 points to 3,707.97 on Tuesday, its 
lowest close since mid-May. And the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds rose to 
7.49% from 7.46% on Monday, nearing the 1994 peak of 7.65% reached in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, the carnage is a global event. European stock markets, 
which held up reasonably well even as the Dow slumped 300 points in late March, 
have led this decline. And in recent days the selling has spread to Canada, 
Mexico and many Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody wants to blame the markets' latest turmoil on the dollar, of course, 
and that's tempting enough. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, a weak dollar raises the prospect of higher U.S. inflation 
because prices of imported goods can automatically rise as the buck slides. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, if the dollar's decline worsens significantly, the Federal Reserve 
Board may be compelled to raise interest rates to try to defend the currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street had just begun to feel confident that the Fed would wait until 
late summer before considering whether the economy warranted tighter credit. 
Now all bets on a benign Fed are off, and that's bad news for countries whose 
short-term rates are, in effect, tied to ours (like Hong Kong and Mexico). 
</P>
<P>
 But some pros say the weak dollar is just a symptom of the markets' real 
problem: We're in a nearly global bear market in stocks and bonds, which means 
sellers are in control. Despite periodic rallies -- like the one U.S. stocks 
enjoyed in early June -- the overriding trend in financial assets is down, the 
bears argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as a step-by-step, grinding kind of decline," says Richard McCabe, 
technical market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, there are still plenty of people who resist the bear 
scenario. The optimists either see the dollar stabilizing soon, or they make 
the point that the dollar's latest slide is a blip compared to how much it fell 
between 1985 and 1993. (Remember, the dollar bought 250 Japanese yen in the 
mid-1980s. So what's the big deal about a drop from 111 yen to 100 yen this 
year?) 
</P>
<P>
 More important than the buck's status is the frightening surge in long-term 
bond yields worldwide this year, in part a winding-down of wild speculation in 
bonds during 1993, many Wall Streeters say. The optimists among them believe 
that yields already have jumped this year to levels that are ridiculously high 
relative to the global economy's growth rate and to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, for example, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond 
closed at 7.32% on Tuesday, up from 5.89% in early February and its highest 
since December, 1992. Yet inflation in Germany is running at about a 3% annual 
rate, which means the "real" yield on the 10-year bond currently is more than 
four percentage points -- quite a payoff historically. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rates are too high relative to any kind of inflation we see worldwide 
at the moment," argues Thomas Robinson, Merrill Lynch's international 
investment strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bull scenario is that the U.S. economy slows in the second half, thanks to 
the Fed's first-half credit-tightening moves; Europe and Japan recover at a 
modest pace and without higher inflation, allowing bond yields in those 
economies to resume their declines, and corporate profits continue to rise 
worldwide, underpinning stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the bulls' case so far this year is that something always 
seems to come along to botch it up. In winter, the problem was the unwinding of 
the crazed stock and bond speculation fueled by so-called hedge funds last 
year; in the spring, rising commodity prices fanned new worries about 
inflation; and now the dollar is sinking, unnerving investors who naturally 
respond badly to any unforeseen market shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "When currencies move quickly, it scares people," says A.C. Moore, investment 
strategist at money manager SBCM/Argus in Santa Barbara.  
</P>
<P>
 The great danger now is that the markets' latest woes will encourage more 
American investors to do what their European counterparts have already been 
doing in spades: Forget the bullish case and just stay invested in short-term 
securities for safety's sake. Or run to gold and other hard assets that 
traditionally offer refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a recipe for a bear market. And there's a good argument that some 
European stock markets are already deep in a bear phase, on the heels of 
bear-like declines in Asia earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris, for example, stocks are already down 16.6% from year's end, as 
measured by that market's blue chip index. If a bear market is generally 
described as a minimum 15% to 20% decline in prices, much of Europe is there or 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the blue chip Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now is 
off just 3.2% from year's end, though its decline nearly reached 10% from its 
February peak to its spring low. 
</P>
<P>
 James Stack, publisher of the InvesTech market newsletter in Whitefish, Mont., 
and an unabashed bear, concedes that the relatively small decline in U.S. 
stocks thus far makes it tough for most Wall Street pros to join the bear camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto the public, he says. "There's a lot of talk about bearishness, but when 
one looks at the new money still going into stock (mutual) funds, the public is 
not bearish," Stack says. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the current selloff in stocks and bonds hits home, following so closely 
on the March selloff, Stack expects the mind-set to turn increasingly cautious. 
"Historically, big bear markets come after periods of market frothiness, high 
expectations (for stocks) and high valuations" in stock prices, he says. We had 
the latter in 1993, he says; to deny the huge potential for a bear market now 
is absurd, he contends. Gold Returns

UCLA FORECAST SAYS RATE HIKES HURTING RECOVERY; ECONOMY: LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED 
BENEFITS FROM EARTHQUAKE REBUILDING ARE ALSO BLAMED FOR SLUGGISHNESS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a report scheduled to be released today, UCLA forecasters confirm that 
California's recovery has begun but say it is being weakened by rising interest 
rates, a loss of income due to the January earthquake and continuing losses of 
jobs in the aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it is a relief to stop forecasting continuing recession, the 
celebration should be a sober one," UCLA economists Larry J. Kimbell and Tom K. 
Lieser wrote in the most recent report by the widely watched UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project. "The recovery will not erase many of the long-term 
structural problems faced in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the UCLA project concluded that "1994 will be a very good year," 
adding that inflation should remain in check. Real gross domestic product 
should grow 3.9% in 1994 and 2.3% by 1996, the report predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 The California report is the second by UCLA saying that the state's 
long-awaited economic recovery has begun. In March, the business forecasting 
project issued its first positive forecast in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recovery has been sluggish for a couple of reasons, Kimbell said in an 
interview: less benefit from earthquake-related reconstruction than expected 
and depressed residential building in the first quarter of 1994, due mainly to 
rising long-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter appears to bolster arguments that the Federal Reserve Board's 
recent moves to head off national inflation by raising interest rates could 
have the unintended effect of slowing recovery in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's report adds that personal income took a $19-billion hit in the 
first quarter of 1994 due to the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, by 1995, the California recovery should be apparent in employment, 
personal income and retail spending, the report says. By 1996, the state's 
unemployment rate should fall below 7% from 8.3% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The industries that will account for the state's job growth in that period 
will be construction, trade and services, including finances, the report 
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing job losses, mainly in aerospace, will continue but at a slower 
pace: 1%, or 20,000 jobs a year, in 1995 and 1996. On Monday, Hughes Aircraft 
said it may cut 3,400 jobs in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The only bit of good news on the real estate front: Los Angeles-area home 
prices showed a significant month-to-month increase in April, one of the few in 
the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * Total non-farm employment growth since January has been 30,400 jobs, an 
annual rate of only 0.6%. Manufacturing lost more than 9,000 jobs, due mainly 
to the loss of defense jobs. In the service sector, 26,500 new jobs were 
created in non-financial services, while retail trade picked up 7,000 jobs and 
government 5,700. 
</P>
<P>
 * California's unemployment rate, 8.3% in May, remains two percentage points 
above the national rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * The average annual growth of real personal income and taxable sales will 
average only about 2% for the three years ending 1996.

OCCIDENTAL AGREES TO PAY $98 MILLION IN LOVE CANAL CASE; ENVIRONMENT: IN A KEY 
CIVIL LAWSUIT OVER BURIED TOXIC WASTE, THE COMPANY WILL ALSO TAKE OVER THE 
CLEANUP EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking a big step toward closing a case that raised the nation's concern about 
buried toxic waste, Occidental Chemical Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay the state 
of New York $98 million to settle one of the key civil lawsuits over Love 
Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also agreed to take over monitoring and cleanup of the Niagara 
Falls, N.Y., neighborhood -- a chore that the New York attorney general's 
office estimates will cost an additional $25 million over the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 500 families in the Love Canal neighborhood, built atop nearly 22,000 
tons of waste chemicals, evacuated in panic in 1978 after the toxic substances 
were blamed for a variety of birth defects and illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental Chemical, a subsidiary of Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum 
Corp., bought Hooker Chemical and Plastics Corp. in 1968. Hooker had dumped 
most of the waste at the site during the 1940s and 1950s, before regulations 
for handling hazardous wastes were tightened. The canal was dug for an 
abandoned hydropower project before the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the settlement is fair and reasonable," Thomas Truitt, an 
Occidental attorney, said at an announcement of the agreement in Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, estimates of Occidental's liability in the New York case ran as 
high as $700 million. But March 17, U.S. District Judge John T. Curtin in 
Buffalo rejected the state's bid for punitive damages, which could have 
amounted to $270 million. In the end, the company might have been held liable 
at a trial for no more than $130 million, according to Timothy Gilles, 
spokesman for the state attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtin is expected to accept the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the cash award, due over the next three years, $95.5 million will go to the 
state treasury and $2.5 million will go to fund environmental projects in the 
Love Canal area. New York's out-of-pocket costs in the cleanup and evacuation 
totaled $74 million, Gilles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental still faces lawsuits from the federal government, the city of 
Niagara Falls and hundreds of former residents who contend that their health 
problems resulted from toxic materials in the area. The company has countersued 
the federal government, claiming that the Army dumped hazardous waste at the 
Love Canal site and should share the liability. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal civil suit seeks to recover $198 million from Occidental in 
remedial costs that include relocation of residents, cleaning of 
dioxin-contaminated sewers and creeks, conducting studies of contamination 
around the site, attorneys' fees and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their settlement does not directly affect the federal case," Ana Cobian, a 
Justice Department spokesperson, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gilles said he expects the other lawsuits to be settled relatively 
soon. "This is the big enchilada here, the New York state claim," Gilles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts tended to agree. Occidental Petroleum shares added 12.5 
cents to close at $19.125 on the New York Stock Exchange after the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great step forward" for Occidental, said Mary Anne Sudol, a petroleum 
analyst and senior vice president at Fitch Investors Service. "It's not all 
behind them, but it's a big step." 
</P>
<P>
 Sudol noted that Occidental has set aside reserves of at least $742 million 
for environmental liabilities in recent years, much of it in anticipation of 
costs from the Love Canal litigation. An Occidental spokesman confirmed Tuesday 
that the company does not expect to take any further charges because of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lois Gibbs, a Love Canal resident who became a national activist against 
hazardous waste dumps, that was the downside of a settlement she otherwise 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good day that the taxpayers of New York finally got their money back," 
said Gibbs, now executive director of the Falls Church, Va.-based Citizens 
Clearinghouse for Hazardous Waste. "But it's a bad day because I think it's 
pretty sad that Occidental didn't get hurt by this lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go into a house and break all the lamps, you don't get to just pay for 
the lamps," Gibbs said. "You have to go to jail. But all Occidental has to do 
is to pay for the lamps." Love Canal: A Chronology 
</P>

families. 
</P>
<P>

under the Superfund Act. 
</P>
<P>

health officials, is refurbished and a new owner moves in. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 17, 1994: Federal court rules that Occidental does not have to pay New 
York punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>

 Business Groups Irate Over Labor Mediator's Position: Employer groups are 
seething over a letter written by John Calhoun Wells, director of the Federal 
Mediation and Conciliation Service, that appears to endorse legislation that 
would outlaw replacement of striking workers. Wells, appointed in November by 
President Clinton, said in his May 27 letter to Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and 
Howard Metzenbaum that he believes "the use of striker replacements is 
destructive to the collective bargaining process."

Chase, Md., and DeMatteis Construction Corp. of Elmont, N.Y. said they will 
build projects worth $380 million near Da Nang in Non Nuoc, also known as China 
Beach. BBI will build the bigger of the two -- to consist of four hotels, a 
conference center and a golf course -- as part of a joint venture with a 
Vietnamese partner.It will be the biggest investment so far by a foreign firm 
in Vietnam. The DeMatteis development, also to be built as a joint venture, 
will be worth at least $100 million, the company said. It will include a 
five-star hotel, townhouses, offices and a marina. China Beach was an 
in-country R&R center for U.S. servicemen in Vietnam during the war that ended 
in 1975.

BAY AREA FIRMS WIN HMO RATE ROLLBACKS; HEALTH CARE: PREMIUM REDUCTIONS ARE 
EXPECTED TO SET PRECEDENT FOR FUTURE EMPLOYEE HEALTH COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid cutthroat competition in California's health care industry, a consortium 
of major state employers has won rate reductions from 17 health maintenance 
organizations ranging from 5% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The premium rollbacks announced Tuesday for the 11 member companies of the Bay 
Area Business Group on Health is expected to set a precedent for new employee 
health coverage contracts that will be negotiated with thousands of other 
California businesses later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean that many workers who belong to HMOs will see some reduction 
in what they pay for medical coverage receive through their employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that whatever (premium changes) were established for the Bay Area 
group would be the predominant pattern for our marketplace," said Jerry 
Fleming, associate regional manager and vice president of Kaiser Health Plans, 
Northern California Region, in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The consortium, an insurance-purchasing group formed by Bank of America, 
Pacific Telesis, Safeway Inc. and other large statewide employers, negotiated 
the rate reductions with health insurers, such as Kaiser Permanente, Health Net 
and PacifiCare Health Systems. The groups' members provide health care coverage 
for 300,000 workers, their families and retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street, apparently concerned that rate rollbacks would spread throughout 
the industry, pummeled the stocks of HMOs, even those without operations in 
California. Health Systems International, the parent firm of Health Net, 
dropped $3.50 to $28 on the New York Stock Exchange. PacifiCare Health Systems' 
A shares slumped $5.625 to $51.375. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement demonstrates the growing assertiveness of corporations to reduce 
medical costs even as national health reform proposals bog down in Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 "What you are seeing is very, very aggressive pricing in the marketplace," 
said Kurt Davis, a spokesman for Foundation Health Corp., a Rancho Cordova, 
Calif.-based HMO. "Hardly a day goes by when we don't get a call from a group 
of radiologists and anesthesiologists offering to provide services we need at a 
lower cost than whoever is doing it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Roger Greaves, chairman and chief executive of Health Net: "Industry is 
saying to us, 'You should be able to go out there and make better agreements 
(with hospitals and doctors) because it's a buyers' market.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 5% to 10% reduction achieved by the Bay Area group is the second rate 
rollback won by a California organization that pooled the purchasing power of 
many employers. The concept is included in some reform proposals in Congress, 
although President Clinton has said he may drop the mandatory insurance 
purchasing pools opposed by many businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Employees Retirement System, or CalPERS, earlier this 
year negotiated a 1.1% rate reduction in health premiums on behalf of more than 
900,000 state workers and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bay Area group said the agreement establishes a standard benefits packages 
for all HMOs and also places a strong emphasis on improving the quality of 
care. The group also got assurances from the health plans that the agreement 
would not result in higher costs for other groups.

ERNST & YOUNG ORDERED TO PAY $27.8 MILLION FOR MALPRACTICE; COURTS: AWARD MAY 
LEAD OTHER ACCOUNTING FIRMS TO RE-EVALUATE LITIGATION SUPPORT BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles jury Tuesday ordered Ernst & Young to pay $27.8 million in 
punitive damages to a Southland aerospace company that accused the accounting 
firm's legal services practice of fraud and malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment, in addition to a previous $14.2-million jury award against Ernst 
& Young for actual damages, may lead accounting firms to closely examine their 
fast-growing litigation support businesses. The firms help clients prepare for 
court cases by supplying financial analysis and expert testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the firms will have to take a look at . . . who will be allowed to take 
the stand, make these (financial) projections and stand by them," said Arthur 
Bowman, publisher of Bowman's Accounting Report in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst & Young was sued more than five years ago by Mattco Forge, a small 
aircraft parts maker in Paramount. Mattco claimed it lost a previous lawsuit 
against General Electric because it relied on the faulty information and advice 
supplied by the litigation support staff of the accounting firm Arthur Young, 
which merged with another firm to become Ernst & Young in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of trials and appeals, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury 
in March found that the accounting firm had committed fraud and malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outcome is a complete vindication of Mattco Forge and its management, who 
have been subjected to a lot of abuse and a lot of attacks," Mattco Forge 
attorney Joseph Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst & Young executives could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman said accounting firms have faced little risk in providing expert 
testimony because the courts have tended to shield expert witnesses from 
lawsuits. "If they had not been protected, they would not get on the stand," 
was the courts' reasoning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But that protection has eroded over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these experts make mistakes, they should be held accountable," Bowman 
said.

 AT&T to Unveil New Multimedia Delivery System: AT&T Corp.'s equipment unit has 
invented a new way to send interactive multimedia traffic into homes and plans 
to unveil the new technology today at a news conference with Silicon Graphics 
Inc. The technology from AT&T's Network Systems unit may reduce hurdles for 
regional telephone and cable television companies planning multimedia networks. 
AT&T executives declined to describe the invention, but sources and outside 
analysts said development of the technology is likely a key factor in AT&T 
Network Systems' recently winning a string of multibillion-dollar contracts 
from regional Bell companies to build full-service multimedia networks.

$260,000 PAID BY DISNEYLAND IN IMMIGRANT RECORDS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what is believed to be one of the largest settlements of its kind in 
California, Disneyland has quietly paid $260,000 to settle allegations of 
shoddy record-keeping that violated federal immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation last year by the Immigration and Naturalization Service found 
1,156 violations in the employee records of more than 6,000 Disneyland workers, 
including evidence of counterfeit documents such as phony Social Security cards 
and green cards. The agency said Disneyland was randomly selected for review 
from a list of large area employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, Disneyland paid the amount without having to make an 
admission of wrongdoing. The agreement also stipulated that neither side would 
disclose the amount paid or the terms of the deal. A copy of the agreement was 
obtained by The Times through a Freedom of Information Act request. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS had originally recommended a fine of more than $394,000, which was 
reduced in the final settlement reached several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think INS accomplished its point of telling the business community, 'We 
mean it and we will vigorously enforce this law,' " said Los Angeles 
immigration lawyer Josie Gonzalez. Gonzalez added that the fine reduction is 
within the general range that the INS usually considers to encourage businesses 
to settle violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Osuna, an editor for Interpreter Releases, a Washington-based legal 
periodical that monitors immigration cases, said the $260,000 payment "is quite 
a bit of money," certainly "enough to get their attention, and that was the 
purpose of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland officials said last year that the Anaheim theme park has never 
knowingly employed any illegal immigrants and that only five suspected illegal 
immigrants using phony work documents were uncovered by the investigation. All 
were immediately fired. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disneyland spokesman reached Tuesday had no further comment on the case, 
citing the confidentiality clause on disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said $260,000 appears to be one of the largest 
payouts ever in California, although "clearly we don't keep a tally board. The 
amount is not as important as the result."

PEOPLE: TRIP HAWKINS TO FOCUS HIS EFFORTS ON STRUGGLING 3DO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Electronic Arts Chairman W.M. (Trip) Hawkins III announced Tuesday that he is 
leaving that post to work on the second business he founded, 3DO Co., a video 
machine developer that has lost $66.8 million since it went public last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic Arts plans to name a new chairman to succeed Hawkins in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Both San Mateo, Calif.-based Electronic Arts and 3DO of Redwood City, Calif., 
develop and distribute 3DO software, and Hawkins is concerned about the 
potential conflict of interest, the company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have made the difficult decision to step down as chairman of Electronics 
Arts, the company I founded in 1982, to focus my time and energy on 3DO," 
Hawkins said in the statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trip is reacting to reality," said analyst John Taylor of L.H. Alton & Co., 
underscoring the conflict of interest potential as well as the slow start 3DO 
has had getting its technology off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Electronic Arts closed at $15.125, down 25 cents on Nasdaq. Last 
October, Electronic Arts traded at its all-time high of 42.

 Fidelity Fund Prices Found to Be Erroneous: Fidelity Investments submitted 
incorrect prices Friday for most of its mutual funds to the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, providing day-old figures that appeared in newspapers 
nationwide, officials said.Fidelity, the nation's largest mutual fund manager, 
was unable to calculate the value of about 150 of its 208 funds due to a 
computer error, Senior Vice President Jane Jamieson said. The error was 
discovered Monday after calls flooded the NASD, said James Spellman, a 
spokesman for the NASD, an industry group that polices securities brokers and 
is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Fidelity fixed the 
problem and a correction was transmitted in the fund tables released Tuesday, 
Spellman said.

 Limits Placed on Former Platinum Software Executives: U.S. District Judge 
Alicemarie H. Stotler in Santa Ana ordered Platinum founder Gerald R. Blackie 
and other former executives to notify the court if they plan to transfer more 
than $100,000 in cash or $10,000 in assets out of the country, attorneys in the 
case said.Stotler placed the limit on the former executives to ensure that 
there will be money available to pay plaintiffs in a pending shareholder suit. 
Shareholders sued the Irvine-based company in January, alleging financial 
improprieties. The company acknowledged that it misreported revenue in April, 
whereupon Blackie and others resigned.

 Chrysler Reportedly Settles Minivan Suits: The auto maker has reached 
out-of-court settlements in at least a dozen lawsuits alleging that its minivan 
models have rear door latches that can open in a crash, the Detroit News 
reported. At least eight other suits are pending, according to documents filed 
with the federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Chrysler Corp. 
maintains that its minivans are safe and that most of the 10 deaths allegedly 
linked to the problem were the result of severe crashes.

 Honda, Utilities to Test Alternative-Fuel Cars: American Honda Motor Co. of 
Torrance has entered into separate partnership agreements with Pacific Gas & 
Electric Co. and SCEcorp's Southern California Edison Co. to evaluate electric 
and natural gas vehicles.The companies said the program will give Honda 
feedback on its alternative-fuel vehicles and enable the utilities to study 
infrastructure requirements and market issues. PG&E will get five Civic 
hatchback-based electric vehicles this summer and 50 1995 Civic natural gas 
vehicles this fall, the companies said. The utility has been testing three 1993 
Accord natural gas vehicles since February. Edison will receive three Civic 
hatchback-based electric vehicles this fall.

STATES REQUEST CHANGES IN FCC'S NEW CALLER ID RULES; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: 
CRITICS ARGUE THAT PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regulators in California and other states are seeking changes in new federal 
"caller ID" rules to give consumers greater control over who gets access to 
their telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not available in California, caller ID is offered in about 40 other 
states for calls made within those states. The Federal Communications 
Commission rules, which will take effect in April, will allow caller ID to be 
used with interstate calls. 
</P>
<P>
 People with caller ID service have a device that displays the caller's number 
when the phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
 In petitions filed with the FCC, regulators in more than 20 states argue that 
the agency's rules don't adequately protect the privacy of people placing 
interstate calls to caller ID subscribers. They are also seeking assurances 
that the FCC does not intend to overturn individual states' caller ID rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has not indicated how it will respond to the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency issued the new rules two months ago, but the order received little 
attention outside regulatory circles. In the order, the FCC said it is striking 
a balance between "the privacy interests of both the called and the calling 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone companies have generally expressed satisfaction with the rules and 
would like to see the states adopt them, since it will be burdensome to abide 
by state and federal caller ID rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC rules on blocking calls are similar to what Pacific Bell had wanted 
California regulators to adopt for intrastate calls, said Mark Pitchford, 
director of consumer product marketing for Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is consumers' ability to keep their phone numbers from reaching 
caller ID subscribers in other states. Under the new FCC rules, people making 
interstate calls must first dial a special code to prevent their numbers from 
being relayed to caller ID subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the blocking code is cumbersome and does not sufficiently 
safeguard privacy. Many states permit automatic blocking on all calls made from 
a specific number, thus eliminating the need to dial a blocking code before 
every call. State regulators want the FCC to permit automatic blocking on calls 
between states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal standard means consumers will lose some measure of control over 
their personal information -- in this case, their phone number," said Beth 
Givens, director of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, an advocacy group based in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The states are also seeking clarification as to whether the FCC rules apply to 
intrastate calling. The agency's order states that "certain state regulation of 
. . . interstate caller ID must be preempted." Lawyers familiar with the order 
said the meaning of that phrase is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for the FCC to reconsider rules, especially when they 
provoke broad discussion. Some clarifications are expected. For example, the 
federal rules exempt emergency calls involving public agencies, specifically 
911 calls and poison control centers. It is not clear whether the exemption 
includes private agencies that offer emergency services, such as battered-women 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 FCC attorney Suzanne Hutchings said at least two dozen states have lodged 
comments with the commission, many of them seeking clarifications or changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Public Utilities Commission has taken the added step of 
challenging the FCC rules in federal appeals court in San Francisco, arguing 
that the FCC has overstepped its authority. PUC attorney Ellen LeVine said the 
appeal is on hold pending FCC clarification of its rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right to privacy is guaranteed in the California Constitution," LeVine 
said. "We think caller ID rules should be consistent with that right." 
</P>
<P>
 The new FCC rules reopen the longstanding controversy over caller ID in 
California. After a series of emotional hearings, the PUC in 1992 adopted 
caller ID rules so restrictive that neither Pacific Bell nor GTE, the state's 
two largest phone carriers, felt it was economically feasible to offer the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC requires phone companies to offer both per-call blocking, which 
entails use of a blocking code, and automatic blocking on outgoing calls from 
specific telephone lines, also called per-line blocking. The commission ruled 
that people who have unlisted numbers -- as nearly half the households in the 
state do -- would receive automatic blocking unless they chose otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC also requires phone companies to provide a third option in which 
people with automatic blocking could dial a special code to unblock 
transmission of their numbers on certain calls.

LOTUS SHARES WITHER ON WORD OF LOWER QUARTERLY RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lotus Development Corp. shares lost more than a fourth of their value Tuesday, 
as investors responded to the company's forecast of lower second-quarter 
revenue and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock closed down $14.375 at $37 per share on the Nasdaq, a drop of 28%. 
It was the most active issue on Nasdaq, with a volume of 12.7 million shares, 
compared to an average daily volume of about 1 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 After the close of trading Monday, Lotus announced that delays in new versions 
of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet and other office software had diminished its chances 
of meeting analysts' estimates for the quarter ending July 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotus said it expects revenue between $230 million and $240 million, with 
earnings of 20 to 25 cents per share. Analysts had forecast profit of about 48 
to 50 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotus has recently been trading in the $50-per-share range; shares had posted 
a 52-week high of $86.50 on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Charlotte Walker of Bear Stearns & Co. said Tuesday that Lotus stock 
has been trading too high but that the company will probably rebound as it 
ships a new generation of its office software this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The software business is a commodity business now, so your business is going 
to be affected by the products you ship. If you're late, you pay," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Tarter, editor of the industry SoftLetter newsletter, noted that the 
market for office software is saturated after more than a decade of growth. 
"There are not a lot of new buyers for spreadsheets and word processors," he 
said. "All the low-hanging fruit has been picked in those markets. The cost of 
selling this stuff has gone up because it's hard to find those users, and they 
have to be lured in." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its product delays, Lotus cited "the fact that our major 
competitor is at the top of its Windows desktop product cycle this quarter." 
That is a reference to Microsoft Corp., the largest PC software company. 
Microsoft rolled out new versions of office software over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said: "What you hope will happen is that their new products -- which, 
by the way, are getting great reviews -- will help (Lotus) rebound, and you'll 
go back and forth (with Microsoft), back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Tuesday's drop in share value, Lotus spokesman Richard Eckel said: "You're 
never happy about this type of reaction, but it wasn't unanticipated. Wall 
Street rewards consistency, and as Wall Street has shown before, if you deliver 
a surprise, you pay a price. But as we said (Monday), we think this is a 
one-quarter phenomenon."

STATE FARM SAYS HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE CRISIS LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., the largest property insurer in 
California and the United States, warned Tuesday of a "looming crisis" in 
California homeowners insurance precipitated by the withdrawal of two major 
insurers from the market after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without immediate action to pass a rational plan to provide relief, 
additional companies will be driven from the market," State Farm President 
Edward B. Rust Jr. told Gov. Pete Wilson and state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi in letters the insurer released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing massive losses from the Jan. 17 earthquake, 20th Century Insurance Co. 
and Farmers Insurance Group recently halted their writings of new earthquake 
and homeowners policies. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century is abandoning the two lines of coverage permanently. Farmers, No. 
3 in California homeowners insurance, called its action temporary but set no 
date for resuming sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Other carriers, including State Farm -- which has more than 25% of the 
California market -- have cut back on sales of earthquake and homeowners 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result, according to an insurance agents trade group, is that consumers 
are having trouble finding coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's insurance adviser, Marjorie M. Berte, said last week that the 
governor is concerned that an availability crisis in homeowners insurance could 
hurt real estate sales and the economic recovery.  
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi will outline his proposals to address the problem today, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rust called for a meeting of "all interested parties" to discuss possible 
solutions to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm, based in Bloomington, Ill., proposes creating a statewide, 
industry-supported earthquake insurance pool that would help reduce individual 
carriers' exposure to catastrophes, spokesman Bill Sirola said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would eliminate the state law requiring that any insurer selling 
homeowners insurance also offer earthquake coverage, Sirola added, but it would 
also restrict an insurer's ability to leave the market and dump all its 
earthquake policies into the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm and other insurers have also endorsed the proposed Natural Disaster 
Protection Act, federal legislation that would create a national, 
industry-financed pool to help cover catastrophes.

THE CUTTING EDGE; PLOWSHARES; 'FUZZY LOGIC' PROFESSOR TURNS HIS FOCUS TO TUMOR 
DETECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Keller once used a computer strategy called "fuzzy logic" in a quest to 
help soldiers find enemy tanks in the jungle. Now he's using the technique to 
find tumors in the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, a professor of computer and electrical engineering at the University 
of Missouri at Columbia, spent 12 years trying to develop fuzzy-logic computer 
algorithms that would help separate tanks from trees and other objects around 
the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 But his work never found its way onto the battlefield because the Cold War 
ended and his Pentagon funding evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Keller and several colleagues in Missouri are working on a project to 
apply fuzzy logic to medical imaging, particularly the mammogram X-rays used to 
detect breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The team hopes its techniques will help doctors find potentially cancerous 
patterns in the images more quickly and more often. Their techniques come into 
play after the image has been scanned, its contents digitized and fed into a 
computer for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it found anything suspicious, it would highlight that area and flag it for 
the radiologist," Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller's group also hopes its fuzzy logic can improve the usefulness of 
biopsies, in which human tissues and fluids are removed to see if they contain 
abnormal cells. Case in point: The computer could better identify chromosomes 
that might indicate genetic health defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Pathologists looking at chromosomes under a microscope can face difficulties. 
The chromosomes can be "bent, they're overlapping, sometimes they're 
compressed," Keller said. "It's not a real certain situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy logic itself isn't easy to define, and its usefulness has been hotly 
debated since the concept was spawned by Berkeley engineer Lotfi Zadeh in the 
mid-1960s. In essence, it's an effort to get computers to go beyond "yes or no" 
and "true or false" calculations and to understand shades of truth -- that is, 
to mix what amounts to judgment and intuition with hard facts to solve complex 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller's algorithms involve giving the computer -- his team uses Sun 
Microsystems workstations and Apple Macintoshes -- substantially more 
information than in conventional techniques, which could be useful in making a 
difficult decision.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the computer would attempt not only to determine whether or not a 
mammogram revealed a small blot, but also whether the blot was round or jagged, 
whether that meant it was a tumor and, if so, whether such a tumor is usually 
benign or malignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Keller's work find real use this time? He thinks so. His best guess is 
that a business will license the technology and bring it to market within five 
years. JAMES F. PELTZ

Palo Alto consulting company that helps companies do business on the global 
network; BarrNet (Bay Area Regional Research Network), a Northern California 
Internet service provider, and the Stanford University Center for Information 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy J. Medich, an engineer and marketing whiz, came on board as executive 
director in March. At an Internet conference in San Jose recently, she talked 
about the promise of CommerceNet. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q What is CommerceNet? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A CommerceNet is a consortium. There are two sides of it. One is that we have 
an on-line Internet server that is a directory that helps people find products. 
The other side is that we are a working consortium looking at tackling the 
business and technical issues of doing business on the Internet. There are some 
things that need to be done technically to make the Internet a place that's 
appropriate for business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How close are business customers to being able to buy through CommerceNet? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Once the buyer finds the seller, you're not in CommerceNet anymore. You come 
to CommerceNet to find the resource and then you're actually directly dealing 
with the end supplier. People are really just starting with what they're 
offering on the Internet. It turns out that it's a decent-size project to 
figure out what you want to offer there, how you want to present yourself, how 
you're going to maintain the data. Companies may have print material that is 
not organized in searchable databases. So they have to get that sorted out. 
That's sort of a long-winded answer to say that people aren't quite ready yet 
to do a lot of on-line transactions. But they are ready to have customers come 
and find out what's available and respond with e-mail or phone to the 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How many businesses are promoting their products through CommerceNet? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A We have 43 organizations working with us. About 30 have (computer) servers 
up and running. They include H-P, Intel, several divisions of IBM, National 
Semiconductor, Tandem, Digital, Amdahl, Apple. It's very much focused on the 
computer industry, since they tend to be the people who are connected to the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q But you expect to branch out? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A We're looking to see how we can get smaller businesses involved. Our 
sponsorship membership is $35,000 a year. Those are consortium members that 
take part in the working groups to define standards. It became clear right 
after the launch that there was a tremendous interest by small and medium-sized 
companies in participating not necessarily in the consortium but at least in 
getting the training and getting involved in the Internet. So we've created a 
subscriber level of $1,250 a year. It provides a place in the CommerceNet 
directory and training on how to get up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Bank of America is somehow involved? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Yes, BofA, Citicorp, Wells Fargo and First Interstate are all participating. 
They do a lot of electronic payment and credit now, but not on the Internet. 
They're interested in working with CommerceNet and other members to define how 
you would do payments on the Internet. We're trying not to sit around for two 
years defining things. We're trying to define problems and try things in a very 
fast start mode rather than talk about them too long. Our members are moving 
quickly, saying, "Let's try this and come back and report what worked and what 
didn't work." Make the fixes, deploy the technology, get other people to use it 
and through that set up de facto standards for doing business on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Who had the idea? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Marty Tenenbaum, the chairman of Enterprise Integration Technologies, 
proposed it and collaborated with BarrNet and Stanford. They proposed it to the 
federal government to get technology reinvestment project funding. We also had 
the backing of the state of California and Smart Valley, a Silicon Valley-based 
venture to look at improving the area's competitiveness. CommerceNet was one of 
55 projects that was approved out of almost 3,000 proposed. We have $6 million 
from the government over three years that we are required to match with 
industry contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Security is obviously a big issue on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A The area we're focusing on is transaction security. For that, EIT has 
developed a secure client-server technology that runs on the seller's computer 
and Mosaic (an easy-to-use Internet access program), which runs basically on 
any computer, so that it will allow secure transactions between the two. Both 
sellers and buyers can get "digital certificates" that attest that they are who 
they are. The technology will get submitted to the Internet standards body, and 
we hope it will become the standard way of doing secure transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What do you see as the biggest problem facing CommerceNet? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Right now it's the number of opportunities. There are so many ideas of what 
we could do and so much pent-up demand. One of our biggest challenges is to 
pick the ones we want to focus on and not get too diverted. Q&A Cathy J. Medich

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; IN DEVELOPMENT; BURN 
RUBBER AND RECYCLE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What do you do with old tires? Turn them into planters or swings? Use them for 
building material? Grind them into powder for carpeting or rubber roads? Think 
some more: There are about 2 billion whole tires in stockpiles and landfills 
throughout the nation, and another 240 million are replaced on autos each year. 
</P>
<P>
 One answer is to recycle them as fuel. After all, the typical radial tire is 
made largely of synthetic rubber, carbon black and other petrochemicals. Only 
3% of the tire's content does not contribute directly to its value as an energy 
source. Tire-derived fuel burns cleaner and hotter and has more than 20% more 
heating value than coal. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting last month, a joint venture among Los Angeles and Riverside counties, 
Mitsubishi Cement Corp. and a small company called Tyres began recycling tires 
to provide fuel for the kilns of the four major cement manufacturers in 
Southern California. Cement kilns, it turns out, are ideal users of the fuel: 
The tire is completely consumed and becomes a part of the final product; cement 
quality is improved, and the wire in the tire provides iron oxide -- a required 
raw material. Finally, the sulfur is neutralized by the limestone used in the 
cement process. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound and Slurry: Drying foods before shipping reduces freight costs and 
perishability. But a number of foods, such as orange juice, tomato paste and 
corn syrup, cannot be dried by conventional heat methods without using 
additives. Ingredients cooked at higher temperatures also change the chemical 
nature of the product. 
</P>
<P>
 A sonic dryer recently patented by U.S. Development Corp. and Purdue 
University scientists promises a remedy by substituting sound in the drying 
process. It relies on pulses of intense low-frequency sound waves that move 
relatively low-temperature air past the material. The end product is a powder 
that is like the original product with only the moisture removed. However, the 
sonic dryer works best with very wet slurries, and it is not the most effective 
way to make beef jerky. 
</P>
<P>
 New Spin on Storage: Computer hard drives, like closets, always seem to get 
full no matter how well you plan ahead. The problem is threatening to become 
worse as more information is digitized. But help is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM scientists have developed a sensor that will make it possible to store 
nearly 20 times more data on a computer hard drive. The new sensor, called a 
spin-value head, is five times more sensitive than today's best commercially 
available disk drive sensors. That means it can read bits of data crammed more 
closely together on the same square inch of disk surface -- in this case, a 
billion bits (a gigabit) per square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 To write information on a disk, an electrical current sent through a coil 
induces a magnetic field within the recording head that is projected through a 
small gap onto a spinning disk. To read the disk, the process is reversed.  
</P>
<P>
 The reading process becomes much more difficult as the size of the gap narrows 
because it produces an ever weaker induced current, limiting the number of bits 
per square inch. But the spin valve utilizes something called the giant 
magnetoresistive effect, which produces an electrical signal five times greater 
than the magnetoresistive sensors in today's disk drives. A magnetoresistive 
reading sensor is made of several thin layers of a magnetic material that 
changes its electrical resistance in a magnetic field. The giant version is 
composed of even thinner film. This in turn means the sensor can read bits that 
take up no more than half a micron of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Glues Put It All Together: The early Egyptians knew how to weld metals 
together. But they didn't have to contend with the advanced materials of today, 
such as specialty glasses, intermetallics, structural polymers and composites. 
Because of their light weight and ability to withstand high temperatures, these 
materials are increasingly being used in everything from aircraft and auto 
engines to advanced energy systems and chemical-processing plants. But joining 
them together is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of scientists are tackling that challenge. At Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute in Troy, N.Y., Robert Messler, author of "Joining of Advanced 
Materials," is studying a process known as self-propagating high-temperature 
synthesis. Reactions to produce oxides, carbines, aluminides, silicides and 
other compounds are created between the pieces to be joined, frequently under 
pressure. As a result, melting and bonding occur, even in instances where 
bonding by other means was virtually impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, researchers have developed 
a glue that withstands higher temperatures than conventional epoxies. The glue 
is made of cross-linked copolyester, molecules of oxygen and carbon that 
connect in chains. They can bond to other chains anywhere along their lengths, 
forming a stronger product than polyesters that bond only at either end. The 
glue will be important for a range of products, including grinding wheels and 
the next generation of supersonic aircraft. The aircraft, for example, would be 
subject to temperatures of approximately 180 degrees Celsius. Conventional 
epoxies break down at temperatures above about 150 degrees C. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

MICHAEL'S PACT WITH SONY IS UPHELD; POP MUSIC: BRITISH HIGH COURT RULES AGAINST 
SUPERSTAR'S LAWSUIT, WHICH CHARGED RECORD COMPANY WITH RESTRAINT-OF-TRADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision that should make the record industry sleep easier, the British 
High Court of Justice ruled Tuesday that superstar George Michael cannot walk 
away from his contract with Sony Music Entertainment Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 U.K. High Court Judge Jonathan Parker dismissed the 30-year-old singer's 
restraint-of-trade lawsuit in a 280-page opinion that characterized Michael's 
$12-million recording contract with Sony-owned Columbia Records as "reasonable 
and fair." 
</P>
<P>
 After the verdict, a Sony Music spokeswoman said the firm looks forward to 
continuing its relationship with Michael, who once vowed never to record for 
Sony again and said Tuesday that he will file an appeal as soon as possible. 
Michael, whose albums have sold more than 16 million copies in the United 
States alone, has not recorded for Sony since 1990's "Listen Without 
Prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked and extremely disappointed," said Michael during a press 
conference at London's Hotel Howard moments after leaving the courtroom. "I am 
convinced that the English legal system will not support Mr. Justice Parker's 
decision or uphold what is effectively professional slavery." 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter 20-month legal dispute was closely monitored by the record industry 
because a victory for Michael could have set a precedent overseas, requiring 
companies to sign artists for periods far shorter than the now-customary seven 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a favorable ruling for Michael in the British Court system would have 
had no legal bearing in the United States, insiders predicted that a 
pro-Michael verdict could have been used as grounds to raise the same issues 
for artists in U.S. courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most record companies have gone to great lengths to prevent artists of 
Michael's stature from jumping ship -- and reaction to the ruling among the 
industry's top brass on Tuesday was positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad people are beginning to pay more attention to what it means to honor 
a contract," said Charles Koppelman, chairman and CEO of the EMI Records Group 
North America, a competitor of Sony. "From my vantage point as an executive, 
everybody enters into these deals with excellent representation and their eyes 
wide open, including the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a company invests a tremendous amount of money in the development, 
marketing and promotion of a new artist and that artist succeeds, it's very 
difficult to deal with the idea that he suddenly no longer wants to be a part 
of your label."  
</P>
<P>
 The ruling follows a caustic court battle in which Michael's lawyers had 
argued that the huge Japanese conglomerate deliberately tried to sabotage the 
singer's career after he refused to appear in videos to promote "Listen Without 
Prejudice." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael originally signed with CBS Records as part of the pop duo Wham! When 
the act broke up in 1986, CBS exercised a clause in the contract and kept 
Michael on as a solo act. After Sony Corp. acquired CBS Records in 1988, the 
company renegotiated its contract with the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grammy-winning singer, whose real name is Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou, 
alleged that long-term contracts -- like the eight-album deal he signed with 
Sony until the year 2003 -- constitute a restraint of trade. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the trial, the judge allowed Michael's lawyers to force Sony 
to produce the contracts of other stars such as Michael Jackson and Bruce 
Springsteen, but the pacts were not exposed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A judgment on whether Michael must foot the bill for a reported $4.5 million 
in court costs is expected later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony resolved a similar lawsuit two years ago in Los Angeles when it settled 
out-of-court with singer Luther Vandross, who claimed his contract with the 
company had expired under an obscure California statute. Vandross remained with 
Epic Records, which is owned by Sony. Don Henley is currently involved in a 
similar legal dispute with Geffen Records.

THEATER REVIEWS; DEFT TELLING OF A 'BOYS' STORY; GARDEN GROVE COMMUNITY THEATRE 
PLAY ABOUT FOUR RETARDED AND SCHIZOPHRENIC MEN FEATURES SOME STANDOUT 
PERFORMANCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Tom Griffin's play, "The Boys Next Door" are four adults at a disadvantage. 
Two of them are retarded, one is borderline, the fourth is schizophrenic. But 
they have their advantages as well: Each is determined to live life to the best 
of his ability, and they share a therapeutic sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 They are involved in a project that places them at least marginally into the 
outside world under the guidance of a counselor. A production at the Garden 
Grove Community Theatre, under Gregory Cohen's intelligent and empathetic 
direction, does a very good job of telling their story with all its humor and 
most of its heartbreaking loneliness intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey Warfield, Darnell Suttles and Peter A. Balaskas respectively are 
excellent as Norman, whose every sentence has an "oh boy" in it; Lucien, hung 
up on his green library card with his name on it, and Barry, who thinks he's a 
golf pro and gives 25-cent lessons. Warfield's buoyant excitement, Suttles' 
sense of frustrated achievement and especially Balaskas' tightly reined anger 
work beautifully in Griffin's mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Daryl Mendelson stands out as the borderline Arnold, with a compulsion 
to talk and a drive to lead. The performance is notable for the actor's sense 
of comic timing, and for his ability to dredge up deep humanity in Arnold's 
limited world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plot revolves around counselor Jack, and Peter Dolan is very good in the 
role, hitting all the right buttons. But he seems not quite young enough for 
the part; Dolan's own maturity seems at odds with Jack's confusion over his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much of the production is more leisurely than it need be, Cohen has 
the inner rhythms down. However, the most affecting scenes -- Norman's first 
dance with Sheilah (Christina D. Dickinson) and Barry's disastrous first 
meeting in nine years with his loser of a father (Bill Adams) -- might be even 
more affecting if Dickinson were more physically afflicted (in the original 
production, Sheilah was severely disabled)and if Adams didn't try to give the 
unthinking father a nice, gentle side.

THEATER REVIEWS; MUCH 'ADO,' SLIGHTLY LESS SHAKESPEARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With its outdoor production of "Much Ado About Nothing," the Irvine Community 
Theatre joins that optimistic group that participates in the "summer 
Shakespeare" phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Shakespeare. It is summer. It is outdoors, and it is optimistic. But far 
short of phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Clark's staging -- on the back steps of the recreation building in which 
the group usually mounts its production -- is inventive, interestingly blocked. 
There is a not-too-insistent updating to the present, and Clark has injected 
some amusing anachronisms: Dogberry's guards stamp their feet and shout their 
lines in Marine Corps cadence; one of the guards, attacking Borachio, says 
"C'mon, punk, make my day." Cute. 
</P>
<P>
 But the play is Shakespeare, and Clark has come up with only a few actors who 
have much of an idea how to proceed with that. There is much ado here, but not 
much of it would be recognized by the Bard. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage to the very youthful approach that Clark has taken: The several 
romantic leads look young and, to good effect, they act young. It's refreshing. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Della Lisi and Robert Spors are charming as Beatrice and Benedick. Their 
initial petty bickering and their later mercurial shift to romantic bantering 
and true love are the stuff of collegiate years, the age probably intended by 
Shakespeare. Karl Persons' Claudio and Jenny McKenzie's Hero are similarly 
framed, and though they don't have the high energy of Lisi and Spors, they work 
well together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Geryl Anderson is very strong as the nasty Don John, who causes all the 
mischief in this tale of love almost destroyed by evil gossip, and Bill Carden 
is just as solid in the small role of Friar Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remainder of the cast is at a loss, none more so than Art Winslow as 
Hero's father, Leonato. The night this reviewer attended, Winslow barely knew 
his lines. And Dan Lookabill missed Dogberry by miles, apparently not having 
seen the great comic possibilities. His character sounded as straight as a CHP 
officer describing a highway accident for television news.

THEATER REVIEWS; PULLING LAUGHS OUT OF A HABIT; THE REVIVAL OF 'NUNSENSE' AT 
ORANGE COAST COLLEGE FEATURES DEVILISH SHENANIGANS.

<P>
 If there's a moral lurking somewhere in "Nunsense," it may be: Watch what you 
eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goggin's frothy little musical, now in a frothy little revival at Orange 
Coast College, begins with the Mother Superior of the Little Sisters of Hoboken 
informing us that Sister Julia's vichyssoise was bad, very bad. So bad that 52 
nuns died of botulism. 
</P>
<P>
 God does work in mysterious ways, letting those nuns go like that, with no 
money to bury them. Is that the health inspector at the door? At least he could 
wait until our amateur hour of a fund-raiser is over. Then we could plant them, 
then everything would be bliss again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound a tad ghoulish? Nah. "Nunsense," which won the New York Drama Critics' 
Circle award for best off-Broadway musical in 1986, is too soft-hearted to be 
provocative, too blithe to chill. It makes fun of Catholic dogma, but mainly it 
just tries to make fun. 
</P>
<P>
 That's certainly Alex Golson's approach at OCC. The director and his small 
cast emphasize the wackiness of "Nunsense," asserting vaudevillian exuberance 
to keep the show's energy high. All the shenanigans can feel labored and 
redundant after a while, but there are giggles along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 They start with the mother superior (Harriet C. Whitmyer) telling us, however 
abashed, that she originally worked in a leper colony "because all the good 
causes were taken." And about that potato soup? "For 52, bon appetit was also 
bon voyage." Whitmyer stands out with her giddy delivery, reaching a crescendo 
when the mother superior accidentally gets stoned near the end of Act I. 
</P>
<P>
 Goggin has given her a cartoonish but clear personality, as he has with the 
rest of the ladies in this unheavenly quintet. Sister Mary Hubert (Kathleen 
Dowd) may be only second in charge, but that doesn't stop her from chiding the 
mother superior whenever she can. She's also a madcap tap-dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Robert Anne (Catherine Petz) is on the rough side but has artistic 
ambitions; she's the Ethel Merman of the group. Sister Mary Leo (Brandeis 
McBratney) would rather do ballet than pray, but there's not much demand for it 
in the cloister. As for Sister Mary Amnesia (Elizabeth Fallin), her name says 
it all: She barely can remember why she's here in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the "environmental" aspect of the production (you are supposed 
to feel like church supporters, there to enjoy the amateur hour and then open 
wide your wallets), Golson has outfitted the musicians (Bill Wolfe and John 
Barton) in priestly garb and has the nuns themselves greeting ticket-holders as 
they take their seats. Such touches, and the intentionally crummy set by David 
Scaglione, lend a proper by-the-seat-of-our-pants ambience. 
</P>

SEATS STILL AVAILABLE FOR 'THREE TENORS' CONCERT; MUSIC: IF YOU'RE WILLING TO 
SHELL OUT $300 TO $1,000 FOR THE CARRERAS/DOMINGO/PAVAROTTI OUTING, DODGER 
STADIUM'S TICKET OFFICE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU. 
</P>

<P>
 If you don't want to wait for the TV broadcast, the record, the video, or the 
books, there's still time to buy seats to hear tenors Jose Carreras, Placido 
Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti at Dodger Stadium on July 16 -- if you're willing 
to pay between $300 and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Set for the evening before the World Cup championship soccer match, "Encore! 
The Three Tenors" brings the celebrated singers and conductor Zubin Mehta 
together for the first time in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40,000 seats in the stands, at $15 to $150, were sold out months ago 
through Dodger Stadium's ticket office and phone sales, say promoters of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers would not release exact figures for what is still available, 
but they say some tickets for seats on the stadium field are for sale at $300, 
$500 and $1,000, plus service fees of $10 to $12 each. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 of these high-end tickets were added to existing inventories 
recently when they were returned by what concert general manager Wayne Baruch 
calls "one institutional buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As with other international events, batches of tickets often are held back for 
visitors. An informed source says World Cup presenters simply overestimated the 
appeal of high-priced concert tickets to out-of-town purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most local brokers say they have no tickets for this event, although they say 
they may have some available closer to the concert date. Callers were referred 
to Dodger Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Very expensive tickets remain available, too, for the civic-minded. 
Invitations have just gone out for a post-concert dinner at Dodger Stadium 
benefiting the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation. While dinner tickets are also 
being sold separately, a $5,000 donation to the foundation includes a $1,000 
concert ticket, while a $2,500 donation includes a $500 ticket. All funds from 
the dinner, which Taylor is set to host, would go toward building a new 
facility in South Central Los Angeles providing shelter and medical care for 
HIV patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry if you can't go, however. Records, videos and PBS broadcasts are 
definitely in the works. Public television officials, for whom taped broadcasts 
of the 1990 concert have been among the top fund-raisers ever, are hoping to 
repeat history. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert will air live in some markets, including San Diego. But Los 
Angeles and Orange County television viewers won't be able to see it until the 
following evening, since it will be blacked out locally. 
</P>
<P>
 Event producer Tibor Rudas says he does not think it would be fair "to people 
who pay a fortune" to go to Dodger Stadium when they could have watched it at 
home. Boxed sets with video, audio and program book probably will be out in 
mid-October. There's even a "making of" documentary video expected out sometime 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 London Records advertises that the recording of 1990's "Three Tenors" concert, 
held in Rome during that year's World Cup finals, was "the world's No. 1 
classical bestseller" with more than 10 million copies sold. Officials at 
Warner Music Group, which acquired worldwide TV/radio, record and commercial 
video rights for the 1994 concert, say they hope to do even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Records and videos are advertised for Aug. 30 delivery. Meanwhile, due out on 
newsstands around the world July 1 is the official, $10 pre-concert program. 
San Francisco-based Collins Publishers expects a first run of about 300,000 
copies of the 70-page program, printed in the United States, Asia and Europe in 
five languages.

KCET INCREASES BUDGET TO $42.7 MILLION; TELEVISION: PRESIDENT AND CEO WILLIAM 
H. KOBIN ATTRIBUTES THE PUBLIC BROADCASTER'S BRIGHTER FISCAL OUTLOOK TO 'A 
DECADE OF ONGOING STRATEGIC PLANNING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Signaling a modest uptick in its economic fortunes, Los Angeles public 
television station KCET Channel 28 on Tuesday adopted a projected budget of 
$42.7 million for fiscal 1995 beginning July 1. For the first time in recent 
years, the station has not had to struggle to stay in the black. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Kobin, president and CEO, said that "as the station celebrates its 
30 years of service during 1994, it is well positioned for the future, as a 
result of a decade of ongoing strategic planning." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, approved by the station's board of directors, is $2.4 million more 
than last year's projections. In fiscal 1992-93, KCET had been forced to lay 
off 19 employees to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The current projected budget of $40.3 million will likely turn out to be at 
least $46 million because of unanticipated income. Some $4 million flowed in 
from PBS for the airing of 39 episodes of the acclaimed NBC drama "I'll Fly 
Away," plus the new two-hour opening episode updating the lives of the white 
lawyer and black housekeeper in the 1960s civil rights saga. Another unexpected 
$2 million came in for the KCET and NHK/Japan co-production of "Long Shadows," 
a 90-minute drama about the life of Japanese-born Haru Reischauer, the wife of 
former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Edwin Reischauer, which will air on PBS' 
"American Playhouse" Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 While production dollars for next season appear less -- $12.2 million vs. 
$18.6 million -- the difference is also because much of the new "Puzzleworks" 
children's puppet series was taped last season. Children's programming, 
including 20 new episodes of "Storytime," is at $5 million, the largest item in 
the station's production budget. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's public-affairs signature series, "Life & Times," which will enter its 
fourth season, is budgeted at $1.7 million, same as this year, for airing 22 
documentaries and 166 studio shows. The series is the major piece in the 
$3-million public affairs programming slot. Much of the rest will go toward 
"The Great War," an eight-hour series about World War I that is expected to air 
on PBS in 1996, being produced by Blaine Baggett ("The Astronomers"), KCET's 
director of public affairs and feature documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new budget, subscriptions and contributions are taking a bit of a 
seesaw track -- projected at $17.4 million for 1995, up from about $16.5 
million this season, while fiscal '93 money was $17.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard D. Farman, CEO of Southern California Gas Co., was elected to a 
two-year term as board chairman, succeeding E. Eric Johnson, chairman of TBG 
Financial Corp. Louise Henry Bryson, senior vice president for affiliate sales 
and marketing at Fox's fX cable division, is the new first vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 As the board prepared to meet, the Coalition vs. PBS Censorship picketed the 
station for not broadcasting three independently produced documentaries "about 
our community" -- "The Fire This Time," about the 1992 riots; "State of 
Emergency: Inside the LAPD," and "Por La Vida," about the plight of Latino 
street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Denying the censorship charge, Kobin said that "the coalition is capriciously 
using the word censorship as a weapon to force" broadcast. "KCET must regularly 
make editorial decisions on a day-to-day basis," he said in a statement. "That 
is both our right and our obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Goen, KCET's vice president of public information, said that "Por La 
Vida" has been accepted for broadcast and will air shortly; "The Fire This 
Time" was turned down because the station felt the subject was thoroughly 
treated, and "State of Emergency" is still under consideration.

MONEY TRANSFERS BY EX-PLATINUM EXECUTIVES LIMITED ; COURTS: SHAREHOLDERS IN 
CLASS-ACTION SUIT ALLEGE THAT THE IRVINE-BASED SOFTWARE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL 
PICTURE WAS MISREPRESENTED. THEY SOUGHT A FREEZE ON ASSETS TO ENSURE POSSIBLE 
PAYMENTS TO PLAINTIFFS.

 A federal judge on Tuesday placed limits on the amount of money that five 
former Platinum Software Corp. executives can transfer in order to make sure 
there will be money available to pay plaintiffs in a pending shareholder suit. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler ordered the defendants to notify the 
court if they plan to transfer more than $100,000 in cash or $10,000 in assets 
out of the country, attorneys in the case said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased with this order," said Helen Hodges, an attorney with the 
San Diego firm Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for shareholders had sought to freeze the assets of the defendants, 
but Stotler agreed only to the partial limitations as a compromise. The bulk of 
the assets of the defendants will be reserved for a potential judgment in case 
they lose the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders filed a class-action suit in January, alleging that the 
Irvine-based accounting software company violated federal securities laws by 
failing to tell investors about the company's sagging financial picture and 
misreporting earlier revenue. The suit seeks to recover more than $23 million 
from the former executives, who allegedly sold stock based on inside 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the company acknowledged that it had overstated its revenue for the 
previous 18 months, prompting four top executives, including founder and chief 
executive Gerald R. Blackie, to resign.  
</P>
<P>
 Hodges sought the asset freeze order after learning that Blackie transferred 
$500,000 to a Swiss bank account the day after he resigned from the company. 
Blackie's attorney argued that he was simply transferring money overseas 
because his domestic investments went sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum's former officers, Blackie, and Jon Erickson, former chief financial 
officer, left the company. Other executives being sued are Timothy McMullen and 
Kevin Riegelsberger, who resigned their posts as executives but remain 
employees of the company, and Mark Tague, former treasurer who left the company 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the former executives argued against the proposal to freeze 
assets, saying it would impose financial hardship on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignations and accounting fiasco forced the company into a crisis and 
caused its stock to fall to a third of its value before April 18. It has had to 
replace its management team, cut a third of its 825 employees, take a one-time, 
$15-million restructuring charge and cut its previously reported revenue by 
more than $17 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Morgenstein, attorney for Blackie, did not return calls Tuesday for 
comment. Blackie has taken a job as a consultant for PowerPay Software in 
Rockville, Md., which makes software for human resource departments. 
</P>
<P>
 If the defendants want to transfer more money overseas or into trust accounts 
than allowed under the court limits, they would have to get court permission. 
In Blackie's case, Stotler granted him the right to transfer up to $30,000 a 
year to his parents in New Zealand without court approval.

INVESTMENT ADVISER GETS 2-YEAR PRISON SENTENCE IN FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lake Forest investment adviser who pleaded guilty in federal court three 
months ago to defrauding investors of nearly $1.8 million has been sent to 
prison for two years and ordered to pay restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall C. Hutchens, 40, also was sentenced by a federal judge to three years' 
probation following his release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1990 to 1992, Hutchens used his company, Laguna Equities Inc., to sell 61 
investors securities that were supposedly issued by two insurance companies and 
backed by U.S. Treasury notes. Those securities, however, did not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors came mainly from Church of Christ congregations, because part of 
the yield on the 9.3% interest rate on the notes was supposed to go to 
church-related activities, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stanley L. Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchens previously settled a civil lawsuit filed by the Securities and 
Exchange Commission and agreed to repay investors. The SEC seized his assets to 
make partial refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, U.S. District Judge William J. Rea ordered Hutchens, as part of 
his sentence, to refund as restitution the remaining $549,364 owed.

2 EXECUTIVES RESIGN FROM GB FOODS; RESTAURANTS: RUBEN RODRIGUEZ AND ROBERT 
GIBSON WILL CONTINUE AS CONSULTANTS TO THE GREEN BURRITO PARENT COMPANY.

<P>
 GB Foods Corp. Chairman Ruben Rodriguez and Robert V. Gibson, executive vice 
president, have resigned to pursue other interests, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 GB Foods is the parent company of the Green Burrito Mexican-style restaurant 
chain.Rodriguez, who was also the chief executive officer, founded the first 
Green Burrito restaurant in 1980 and intends to operate several of the Green 
Burritos he still owns. Gibson is rejoining his Irvine law firm of Gibson & 
Haglund. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez will be replaced by William M. Theisen, who holds a controlling 
stake in GB Foods. Michael J. Scherr, an Omaha resident and associate of 
Theisen, will replace Gibson. Rodriguez and Gibson will do consulting work for 
GB Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the time is here for Willie Theisen to take over as chairman, 
president and chief executive officer," Rodriguez said Tuesday. "He's an asset 
to this company. Willie and I get along together . . . and it was the right 
time for him to take over." 
</P>
<P>
 Theisen, an Omaha resident who acquired a controlling interest in GB Foods in 
1992, is expected to move to Newport Beach this summer. Next month, Gibson 
said, GB Foods plans to move its corporate office to Newport Beach from 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 GB Foods has 67 restaurants, including about a dozen that are company-owned. 
The chain reported a $384,935 net loss for the first quarter, compared to a 
$23,612 net profit a year ago. First-quarter revenue declined to $1.3 million 
from $1.4 million a year earlier.

 What a dive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dive Restaurant, an eatery owned partly by Disney Studios President Jeffrey 
Katzenberg, is scouting for a location in Orange County.The restaurant's first 
location opened May 11 in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 Dive features high-end submarine sandwiches that are finished in wood-burning 
ovens. The Century City restaurant entertains diners with a 210-square-foot 
rear projection screen and 32 additional monitors that are scattered throughout 
the restaurant. The screens make it appear that the submarine-style restaurant 
is surfacing in a variety of different locations, including a back-yard 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The next Dive restaurant is scheduled to open in Las Vegas in March, 1995.

PASTA MAKER DROPS BID TO ACQUIRE AIR VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Small pasta maker Nona Morelli's II Inc., in search of greater 
diversification, said Tuesday that it has called off its planned $1.3-million 
purchase of a majority stake in privately owned Air Vegas Enterprises Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Morelli's chairman, Fred G. Luke, said that after eight months of 
negotiations, a "fairly straightforward transaction" had become "incredibly 
complex" and that he and Air Vegas President James Petty had reached an 
impasse.He said the two often were too busy with their own companies to talk 
with each other about the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Morelli, which went public in 1989 as a deli-fresh pasta and sauce maker, had 
offered to buy 53% of Air Vegas with the intent of building it into a low-cost 
regional carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Luke said, Morelli is looking at other acquisitions in the airline 
industry. He declined to identify the companies with which Morelli is 
negotiating. 
</P>
<P>
 Morelli, with annual revenue expected to exceed $3 million by June 30, the end 
of its fiscal year, also has ownership stakes in two gambling casinos under 
construction in Tunisia.

WIRELESS CABLE TV IN AREA MOVES CLOSER TO REALITY; MEDIA: CROSS COUNTRY SAYS IT 
HAS LEASED MORE THAN 30 CHANNELS FOR A NETWORK IN ORANGE AND L.A. COUNTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 Moving closer to creating a wireless cable TV network in Orange and Los 
Angeles counties, Cross Country Wireless said Tuesday that it has leased more 
than 30 channels in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The channels, which have been leased from universities and other educational 
institutions, would be broadcast to homes with special, rooftop antennas. 
Because a wireless operator's equipment costs are lower, its programming can 
undercut conventional prices for HBO, MTV or CNN by 15% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 The leased channels currently carry academic courses -- what schools call 
"distance learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country has worked out a deal for channels from Cal State Fullerton and 
other California State University campuses, the Pasadena Unified School 
District and Intelecom, a consortium of 42 community colleges from Bakersfield 
to San Diego. Among the community colleges are Saddleback College, Rancho 
Santiago College, Orange Coast College and four others located in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company said it has signed a letter of intent with the 
University of Southern California to lease its 10 channels. A USC official said 
an agreement should be reached by the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country proposes to build its main transmission tower atop Mt. Wilson, 
north of Pasadena. The construction would require approval of Los Angeles 
County officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Lichvar, engineering director of USC's ITV educational network, said 
three wireless cable companies were competing for the rights to lease its 
channels. Cross Country offered the most money, Lichvar said, and showed a 
track record of serving 42,000 homes in San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lichvar declined to say how much USC would receive from Cross Country. An 
agreement with five universities in the Cal State system calls for Cross 
Country to pay $100,000 a year plus at least 5% of future gross monthly 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross Country said it plans to use digital compression technology to expand 
the number of channels it has leased. For example, Intelecom has broadcast 
rights for just one channel, said Bob Miller, director of development. But with 
compression, the one channel could be expanded by four to 10 times, depending 
on the complexity of the program being carried.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: LAWSUIT ALLEGES THE IRVINE CO. MISLED TENANTS ABOUT 
RENTAL UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tustin lawyer who is appealing the dismissal of a fraud suit against the 
Irvine Co. has filed a similar lawsuit, alleging that the real estate developer 
misled people into believing that units it had rented were apartments when, in 
fact, they were condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer, L. Scott Karlin, said Monday that the new lawsuit simply preserves 
certain rights of 239 individual tenants who, his suit contends, were forced to 
leave complexes that were built as condos but marketed as apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest action was filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court to beat the 
deadline for cutting off such lawsuits. The first lawsuit, filed as a class 
action, was dismissed in September, 1992, but is pending on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenants were in four complexes: Santiago Hills in Orange; Mandevilla in 
Tustin; Villa Point in Corona del Mar; and Big Canyon in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. denies that it did anything wrong in changing over the units to 
condos in 1991, said Larry Thomas, the developer's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. allowed all tenants to remain until their leases expired, 
offered to sell them units on terms more favorable than those given to the 
public, offered other rental units and a month's rent free to those who didn't 
buy and provided moving allowances of $500 to $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "That far exceeded the law's requirements and the industry's standards," 
Thomas said.

WESTERN DIGITAL TO MARKET RECHARGEABLE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY; CONTRACT: 
IRVINE-BASED FIRM, STARTING TO DIVERSIFY, GETS 20% STAKE IN POWER BATTERY 
HOLDINGS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION DEAL.

<P>
 Broadening its reach beyond the computer industry, Western Digital Corp. said 
Tuesday that it will begin selling its technology for portable computer 
batteries to makers of batteries for camcorders and cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it would market its TakeCharge rechargeable battery 
technology through an exclusive distribution agreement with Power Battery 
Holdings Corp. in Bellevue, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital would acquire a 20% stake in Power Battery Holdings in 
exchange for granting the small company an exclusive distribution deal. Western 
Digital will hire contractors to make the batteries and Power Battery Holdings 
will distribute them to consumer electronics outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital's engineers invented a technology that permits rechargeable 
batteries to be plugged directly into a wall socket without the need for an 
additional charging unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Charles Haggerty said the move will diversify Western Digital 
away from personal computers. The company's primary business is making PC disk 
drives, or the electronic gear that stores data on a PC. 
</P>
<P>
 Disk drives account for 90% of Irvine-based Western Digital's billion-dollar 
business. A computer chip operation, which includes the dozen employees working 
on the TakeCharge technology, accounts for the remaining 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Company spokesman Robert Blair said Western Digital believes its chip division 
will be profitable in its fourth fiscal quarter ending June 30 for the first 
time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The TakeCharge marketing agreement represents the first time in roughly a 
decade that Western Digital has expanded its business focus beyond PCs. The 
company has been selling off various divisions to improve its financial 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggerty said the company is very optimistic about its plan to target cellular 
phone and camcorder batteries. In-STAT Inc., a market researcher in Arizona, 
estimates there are 20.2 million cellular phones currently in use in North 
America, while Dealerscope Merchandising estimates that 3.8 million camcorders 
were sold in the last four years.

SNAPPLE PLANS TO SNAP UP DISTRIBUTORS; ACQUISITIONS: THE ALTERNATIVE BEVERAGE 
MAKER IS PREPARING FOR THE BIG-TIME COMPETITION WITH SOFT-DRINK GIANTS PEPSI 
AND COKE. THE DEALS ARE TENTATIVE.

 Snapple Beverage Corp. moved to strengthen its distribution network Tuesday by 
planning to acquire sizable stakes in beverage distributors in Orange County, 
Los Angeles and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The deals are designed to help the East Meadow, N.Y.-based company compete 
with soft-drink giants Pepsi and Coke, which are challenging Snapple in the 
$6-billion alternative or New Age beverage market. 
</P>
<P>
 "Distribution is sort of like war, and Pepsi and Coke are spending lots of 
money to get their product into stores and keep it there," said Tom Pirko, 
president of BevMark, a New York-based consulting firm. "Everyone knew that, at 
some point, Snapple had to go head-to-head with Pepsi and Coke, and that's a 
big-money game.' 
</P>
<P>
 Snapple said it would end up with a 50% equity stake in Groux Beverage Corp. 
in Tustin, its exclusive distributor in Orange County. The proposed deal, with 
a value of about $10 million, calls for Snapple and Groux to subsequently 
establish a joint venture that would operate a distribution business in Texas. 
Groux Beverage officials declined to comment on the planned deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Snapple also said it would pay $25 million for a 50% interest in Haralambos 
Beverage Co., its Los Angeles-based distributor. And Snapple plans to spend 
$3.5 million to acquire Trinity Beverage Co., which distributes Snapple 
products in Texas.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the proposed transactions is pending definitive purchase agreements.

 Taco Bell is subsidizing the performance to thank firefighters who helped to 
save the Irvine Bowl from even heavier damage. "We are dedicated to not 
forgetting the accomplishments and sacrifices of these people," said Taco Bell 
spokesman Jeff Lightburn. "You might say that, thanks to the firefighters, the

UCI DEAN ROLLED WITH THE BUDGET PUNCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Hickok, dean of the UC Irvine School of Fine Arts, is one of 77 faculty 
members taking the latest early-retirement offer by the university, the third 
such offer since 1991. Appointed dean in late 1988, Hickok oversaw notable 
developments in the school but also encountered obstacles imposed by a 
budget-cutting state Legislature and electorate. In an interview Monday in his 
office on campus, Hickok looked back on his tenure and explained his decision 
to leave by July 1.  
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of the early-retirement incentive program is to get as many 
people off the payroll -- where there isn't any money -- and into the pension 
system, where there is a lot of money," Hickok said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply decided that I couldn't pass up this opportunity, particularly in 
view of the shape that the university is in financially and the fact that I 
don't see any improvement in the immediate future. I decided that there were 
other ways to spend my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 School of Fine Arts faculty members are taking the buyout, Hickok 
said. Further cost cuts are being made by furloughing some staff without pay 
for a month this summer and two months next summer. Some staff members say 
privately that they've been given the option of taking the furlough or losing 
their jobs. Karen Newell Young, director of public information at UCI, said 
Tuesday: "It's a program that does have the goal of reducing payroll costs, but 
it's entirely voluntary." 
</P>
<P>
 The School of Fine Arts production budget, which pays for "all our plays and 
concerts and dance events" will be reduced next year "by a significant amount," 
Hickok said. "We've had to simply pare back wherever we can." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not peculiar to the School of Fine Arts," he added. "This is going on 
all over the place. . . . Just about everything in the operation of UCI is now 
under very close scrutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's Cultural Events series, for instance, which was not part of Hickok's 
responsibilities, also will be shut down as of July 1, making UCI the only 
institution in the UC system not sponsoring such a series, according to a 
school official. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural events office has presented American Indian Dance Theatre, Ballet 
Folklorico Quetzalli de Vera Cruz, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, 
anthropologist Richard Leakey and author Kurt Vonnegut, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the cultural events office has been a co-sponsor with the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre of the "Feet First Contemporary Dance Series" at the theater. 
Douglas Rankin, Irvine Barclay president, said Monday that the series would 
continue under the theater's sole sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in for a period of years where things are going to remain quite 
difficult," Hickok said. "I'm sure they will come through it, and I think the 
new leadership of the university is going to be very helpful in that regard. . 
. . But after all, at the age of 67 1/2, I'm more interested in the immediate 
prospects, and they are not very bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the accomplishments during his tenure, Hickok counted: 
</P>
<P>
 * Recruitment of a "highly diverse faculty of excellent quality," including 
Donald McKayle and Bernard Johnson in dance, James Newton and RaeLinda Brown in 
music, and "a whole slew of people from diverse backgrounds," including 
Catherine Lord, in studio art. All of these appointments are full-time 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Improvement and building of facilities, including a new photography complex, 
a new arts building that houses the dance department, studio art facilities and 
administrative offices, and a still-to-be-completed video studio. 
</P>
<P>
 * Development of the first Ph.D. program (in art history) in the School of 
Fine Arts. "The first class of students will arrive next fall," he said, "and 
that's a significant achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, did we accomplish everything I wanted to accomplish?" he asked. "By no 
means. You never accomplish everything you want. That's just in the nature of 
the game, and, of course, 5 1/2 years ago who could have predicted that the 
state of California was going to suffer the financial blows that it's still 
suffering?" 
</P>
<P>
 Major setbacks began when a statewide bond measure to help develop new 
facilities failed in 1990. "We had developed a master plan for the development 
of the entire (Fine Arts) Village," he said, "but unfortunately Proposition 
143, upon which that development depended, did not pass." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he had to begin what he called a "dismantling" process. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means not accomplishing things that you were on the path to accomplish, 
a calling a halt to that, and it means cutting back on some things that were in 
place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reaching a point where it was a rare day that I did not go home in a 
state of depression. It's not my idea of fun to be in the process of, in a way, 
dismantling things. I was brought here to supervise growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, I want to make two things clear. One, my decision to retire is in no 
way an expression of any dissatisfaction with the new leadership of UCI. And 
the second thing is, while I am quote retiring unquote, as dean of the school, 
I have no intentions of going home and sitting in my rocking chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickok hopes to salvage the Irvine Camerata, a chamber vocal ensemble 
dedicated to early music that he founded upon his arrival in Orange County. But 
he admits the prospects are grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of that organization now is quite obscure because, as I leave the 
office of the dean, I have more or less destroyed the economic base of that 
organization and its logistic base," he said. The entire season last year was 
canceled because "we simply didn't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 "We always knew it was going to be difficult," he said. "If you want to make 
it in the choral scheme, you make sure you do 'Messiah' every year and other 
things that are immediately appealing. But that wasn't what we set out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickok and his wife, Roanne, plan to remain in the county. "We love it here," 
he said. "I'm going to maintain a small office at the university, although I 
won't have any official function, at least not immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to "refashion" his career as "a teacher and a conductor and as an 
arts consultant," he said. "So I'll be looking for opportunities to do that 
kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has some research projects he wants to work on, including a study of 
16th-Century Marian chants. Oxford University Press has expressed interest in 
his work, "although no contract has been signed yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am, of course, a workaholic," he said. "That's the way it is. And I have 
always thought of retirement as one step before death. But I've been able to 
rearrange my psychology, with some help, mainly from my wife and others, to 
think of retirement as one step before freedom, and so I'm out of the mode of 
thinking of retirement and into the mode of simply another life change, which I 
view positively."

COUNCIL VOWS TO SEEK LOW-COST HOMES; OXNARD: CONFRONTED BY ANGRY RESIDENTS, THE 
PANEL REVISED ITS EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH A DEVELOPER WHO PLANNED TO BUILD 
$90,000 HOMES. 
</P>

 Responding to angry claims of betrayal, Oxnard City Council members pledged 
Tuesday to do all they can to cut the price of new homes in a city-subsidized 
project so that trailer dwellers now packed into a tattered mobile-home park 
can afford to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted by dozens of farm workers from the 50-year-old Oxnard Mobilehome 
Lodge, council members said they have not forgotten a decade of city pledges to 
provide better homes for the 1,100 residents of one of the county's densest, 
most hazardous slums. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the driving force behind this project," Mayor Manuel Lopez assured a 
boisterous crowd of trailer park residents carrying placards blaring comments 
such as: "City Council, stop lying to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ending a three-hour hearing, the council changed an exclusive development 
agreement with northeast Oxnard landowner Donald T. Kojima to allow other 
developers to submit plans for less expensive types of housing to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the unanimous vote, a stream of speakers asked that the council do the 
right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the people who put food on your table," trailer park resident Jorge 
Calderon said. "Many times, we have heard you have a site for us, but that's 
your lies. It's time for you to not only listen to us, but to do something 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Sunday that the City Council -- after protracted 
negotiations marred by back-room council disputes -- was poised to approve a 
project to build 115 homes that officials conceded that most trailer park 
dwellers could never afford. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have discussed relocating park residents since a 1985 fire 
charred three trailers and left two dozen people homeless. An inspection in 
1991 found 1,197 health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement proposed Tuesday, Kojima would have sold 41 acres of 
farmland near St. John's Regional Medical Center for $5.3 million -- the bulk 
of it for the housing site and for a new school and park. Kojima would also 
have had first chance to submit a construction plan for council approval. The 
agreement went so far as to spell out how the city and Kojima would split some 
project profits. 
</P>
<P>
 No competition from other developers -- including nonprofit ones -- would have 
been considered had the council accepted Kojima's plan for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima had laid out in closed bargaining sessions his proposal for a community 
of 1,150-square-foot, three-bedroom manufactured homes to sell for about 
$90,000 -- an amount hard for mobile-home residents to repay, even with 
government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the council appeared ready to vote Tuesday on the purchase and 
development agreement as written until a dramatic, angry exchange essentially 
reopened the public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Andres Herrera had explained that the city had stopped considering 
the new project as relocation housing months ago because city hopes that the 
trailer park would close had not panned out. He acknowledged that many trailer 
dwellers would never qualify for homes in the new project. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is aching because I worked those fields," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, turning his attention to farm worker representatives, he angrily scolded 
them for not doing more to make the relocation work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you get your collective butts together," the councilman said. "Why 
don't you get off your collective butts and do your job for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 The farm workers' attorney, Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal 
Assistance, moved to the speakers' lectern and loudly declared: "We have been 
shut out of the process." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the next 45 minutes, she was not. In repeated exchanges with City 
Council members, she pressed them to delay approval of the agreement with 
Kojima so that other developers could submit projects more affordable for 
trailer residents. At first, council members did not seem to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this project on the books for what, 13, 12 years?" Councilman Tom 
Holden said. "And we're supposed to take three steps back. I'm dumbfounded. . . 
. Someone making $15,000 a year cannot afford to buy a house." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As discussions continued, trailer park owner Karen Guriel was also allowed to 
interject into the council's deliberations. She said the city's assertion that 
she had intended to close the trailer park -- a key premise in the city's move 
away from relocating park residents -- was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did we ever say we were going to close the park," she said. She 
argued for city relocation of her tenants so that she could move their aged 
trailers out and upgrade her facility with new trailers packed less densely 
than the present 28 per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you will remove the tenants, . . . Oxnard Mobilehome Lodge will not look 
the way it does now," she said. She pledged to spend $300,000 to replace its 
faulty electrical system. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with Lopez and Councilman Michael Plisky expressing strong interest 
in more development options, the council unanimously voted to change its 
agreement with Kojima so that it could consider other developers' plans 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that we would not preclude anything," Lopez said. "(I want) the 
least possible cost so it's more in reach." 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima said he was willing to consider developing any type of homes the 
council wants -- mobile homes, condos or the single-family houses he proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're flexible," he told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Fernandez, chief executive of Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., told 
the council that his low-income housing firm could provide a mix of rental and 
self-owned dwellings that the trailer residents could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Kojima said he did not know how to react to changes in the 
tentative agreement. "Give me a day. I'm not sure what I have now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCarthy, who had initially threatened the City Council with a federal 
investigation into improper expenditures of federal housing grants, said that 
the council had responded well and that her clients now have a better chance at 
new housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel some progress was made," she said. "At least there's an opening here." 
</P>
<P>
 But trailer park resident Consuelo Teran, 21, who has lived in the park nearly 
all her life, said she was not nearly as satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel about the same," she said. "Nothing changed. I don't believe anything 
until I see it now."

60% IN POLL SAY THEY BACK HIKE IN SALES TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 60% of Ventura County voters would support a sales tax for 
transportation, according to a telephone poll of 400 likely voters conducted by 
a consultant for the county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city leaders remain skeptical that the tax would pass, saying 
residents are still stumbling from the recession and the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
and are in no mood for higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Final results of the poll, conducted by Townsend, Hermocillo, Raimundo & 
Usher, are still being compiled, said Max B. Besler, a partner at the 
Sacramento-based political consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Besler outlined some of the poll's major findings Tuesday in a preliminary 
oral report to elected officials from each of the county's 10 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, conducted Thursday to Monday, questioned 400 Ventura County voters 
who have cast ballots in at least one election in the last four years, or 
registered since October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll asked: "Would you support or oppose a countywide half-cent sales tax 
increase for 20 years to fund transportation system improvements in the 
county?" 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of those questioned said they would vote yes, while 34% said they 
would vote no, Besler said. The other 6% were neither opposed to nor in support 
of the measure. The survey has a five-point margin of error, Besler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the makings within this community to get this measure passed," 
Besler told the group, gathered for a meeting of the Assn. of Ventura County 
Cities. "We've passed these on a lot tougher turf than Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 The consulting firm has run 11 transportation sales tax campaigns throughout 
the state and won nine, including in Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San 
Diego and Santa Clara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 If placed on the ballot and approved by a majority of voters in November, the 
measure would increase the sales tax in Ventura County from 7 1/4 cents to 7 
3/4 cents, raising more than $500 million in revenue and matching funds over 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the results of the poll, Besler recommended to officials that funds 
be divided so that 30% would be spent on local streets, 35% on highways and 35% 
on public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions included in the poll revealed that residents' main transportation 
concerns include synchronizing traffic signals, fixing potholes, increasing 
services for disabled residents and running clean-fuel buses, Besler said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also found that voters would be more inclined to support a measure that 
provided for a citizen oversight committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't necessarily believe that this should be postponed because of 
hard times," Besler said. "They see this as at least being on par with other 
problems, like crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is the largest county in the state without a local 
transportation sales tax to help pay for roads and public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Commission meets Friday to consider the consultant's 
findings and decide whether to recommend that the measure be placed on the 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission agrees to go forward with the measure, it would still face a 
series of hurdles before it can be placed on the ballot. The measure must win 
the support of the county and a majority of the cities -- or at least enough 
cities to constitute a majority of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Ventura, Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley -- as well as some 
smaller cities -- expressed skepticism about the poll and concerns about 
placing a tax on the November ballot. Ventura County voters defeated a similar 
measure in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consultants are getting paid to give information to the Transportation 
Commission," Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said. "The stats are 
wonderful but they don't take into account the reality that people who are not 
doing well financially are not going to want to increase the half-cent sales 
tax." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Brennan, polls director for The Times, cautioned against relying heavily 
on polls showing voter approval rates for fund-raising measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan said a poll he conducted a week before the June 7 election showed a 
healthy margin of support for three earthquake-related bond measures. All three 
were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surveys often tend to overstate the likelihood of voters supporting these 
things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders who oppose the tax also argued that because of the failed 1990 
campaign, voters do not believe that a sales tax is needed to fund 
transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 campaign, some officials said, transit leaders warned that the 
county could not afford Metrolink unless voters approved the transportation 
sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 However, despite failure of the tax, transit leaders found the funds to bring 
Metrolink to Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time this job was not sold," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton told 
Besler. "You have to sell it by saying that if it doesn't go through, we're 
going to lose services, and you have to stick by that." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission will meet Friday to vote on 
putting a half-cent sales tax for transportation on the November ballot. The 
meeting will be held at 10:30 a.m. at Camarillo City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. If 
approved by the commission, the proposal will go to the cities and Board of 
Supervisors for consideration.

SUPERVISORS DEBATE CUTBACKS IN PUBLIC SAFETY; BUDGET: BOARD DISCUSSES PLANS FOR 
1994-95 FISCAL YEAR AMID PROPOSED STATE FUNDING REDUCTIONS AND GROWING COUNTY 
DEFICIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 A mounting deficit and new state budget cuts could force Ventura County 
leaders to consider cutting into the criminal justice programs that they 
pledged to expand just three months ago, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a warning reminiscent of last year's budget scare, a county analyst 
cautioned the Board of Supervisors that without reductions in public safety 
budgets, the board would have to slash 17% from all other agencies to balance 
the fiscal year 1995 spending plan. Even with criminal justice included, the 
cuts could total 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't even count the additional $5.3 million in reductions that Gov. 
Pete Wilson could force on the county with his latest budget proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may have to look at all of the budgets, including public safety," said 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who asked for further analysis. "It may be impossible 
to do with just what remains of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 But one supervisor warned that the fiscal crisis may yet disappear, especially 
if the governor and state Legislature reconsider proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to panic and excite people until we get things settled down 
in Sacramento," Supervisor Susan K. Lacey said. "We're playing with people's 
lives here, people's safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the board voted to lay off 27 firefighters and levy new taxes on 
homeowners, only to reverse the decisions when the state came through with the 
needed funds. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson facing reelection this year, Ventura County leaders had assumed 
that he would not attempt further reductions. But the governor, reportedly 
unable to borrow money until he reduced the state's deficit, surprised them by 
announcing a stringent set of cuts last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, on the opening day of their budget study sessions, the supervisors 
asked county agencies to submit funding requests with 10% and 18% reductions. 
Earlier, agency heads had expected to absorb only a 2% cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not going to be very much fun in the next month," Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg told the board. "I'm confident 
everybody's going to be unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Wilson's announcement last week, the county faced a $16-million 
shortfall in the budget year starting July 1. Wittenberg proposed eliminating 
that deficit with $8 million from reserve accounts and $8 million in spending 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But finding places to cut has grown increasingly difficult because the county 
has discretion over less than one-third of the $488.2 million it will pay out 
next year, Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the county expects to spend $188.8 million on human services next 
year, but has control over only about $9.7 million of that. The rest comes from 
federal or state sources, or is limited by spending mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, $95 million of the $179.2 million spent on criminal justice is 
within the county's control. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the county voted to put $24 million in special sales tax revenue 
toward hiring more sheriff's deputies, prosecutors and public defenders. Some 
of the money, which was generated by the Proposition 172 half-cent tax, also 
went for the county's new jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do what no other county has done and give that money to public 
safety," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. "Now, with the things that have 
happened, it's a different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same holds true for $4 million in excess Proposition 172 revenue, which 
city governments and Ventura County firefighters had hoped to use for their own 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, politicians from every city in the county agreed to press the 
supervisors to fund the cities' drug prevention programs and youth-related 
crime outreach services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep in mind that the cities voted for (Proposition) 172 and are 
not getting any of the money," Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said at a 
meeting of the Assn. of Ventura County Cities. "We need to act promptly on 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal drew little support from the supervisors, overwhelmed by a day 
full of bad news on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "My comment to the cities," Howard said, "they're sitting there, the majority 
of them with surpluses. We clearly have no surplus; we have a very serious 
deficit."

VENTURA WANTS TO HIRE FORMER SANTA BARBARA OFFICIAL; GOVERNMENT: VETERAN 
ADMINISTRATOR RICHARD THOMAS HAS BEEN OFFERED THE JOB OF INTERIM CITY MANAGER 
PENDING SELECTION OF JOHN BAKER'S SUCCESSOR.

<P>
 The former top administrator in Santa Barbara has been offered the job of 
Ventura interim city manager, council members said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting July 1, Richard Thomas would run Ventura City Hall until the council 
selects a permanent replacement for outgoing City Manager John Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas -- who coincidentally has the same name as Ventura's police chief -- 
served as Santa Barbara's city administrator for 17 years before retiring in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done a terrific job in Santa Barbara and his references are just great," 
Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom said. "He's one of those people who are 
quietly effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford, who has been in touch with Thomas and other 
applicants for the job, declined to comment Monday on Thomas' selection or 
whether he has accepted the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 63, is vacationing in Idaho with his family this month and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the applicants they considered, council members said, Thomas seemed the 
best candidate to create a smooth transition between the current and future 
city managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be a nice, stabilizing person through the interim," Councilman Gary 
Tuttle said. "He's calm and rational, and he's done it before." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Santa Barbara council members raved about Thomas in interviews Tuesday, 
saying the only positive side to his retirement was that they could replace him 
with his protege of 15 years, the former deputy city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a profound sense of loss when he left," said Mayor Hal Conklin, who 
came onto the council in March, 1977, only two months after Thomas started his 
job in Santa Barbara. "He was responsible for a remarkable transition in the 
city of Santa Barbara, from the sleepy town, small-town state it was in when he 
arrived, to the development level it's at today. He brought the city staff into 
the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Conklin said that every time he met managers of other cities, it just reminded 
him how lucky Santa Barbara was to have Thomas at its helm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Miller, who has served on Santa Barbara's council for seven years, 
said he was an excellent manager of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He nurtured his staff and gave people the opportunity to develop, so they 
could progress through jobs in the city," she said. "He was also very 
supportive of women in administrative positions." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the deputy city administrator who succeeded Thomas is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council settled on Thomas after weeks of closed-door debate, 
finally choosing Baker's temporary successor 11 days before Baker is officially 
scheduled to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the council also considered Murray Warden, now the interim city 
manager in Encinitas, but Warden asked to be dropped from consideration this 
month when Encinitas wanted him to stay on longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members then interviewed Donald Penman, former city manager of Baldwin 
Park. Some council members said they preferred Thomas to Penman simply because 
Thomas is older and has more experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, this last week, Ventura's former city manager who preceded Baker, Ed 
McCombs, also threw his name into the hat. Council members, however, said they 
did not want to delay their appointment by taking time to interview McCombs. 
Besides, said some, the city needs new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, he was a good manager back then, but it's time to move on," Tuttle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they hope to find a permanent city manager within six 
months. In the meantime, the city will pay Thomas up to $10,000 per month, a 
city source said.

SLAIN MAN'S RELATIVES RELIVE ORDEAL 
</P>

<P>
 They can't bring back their loved one, but family members of Simi Valley 
murder victim Andy Lee Anderson can do what they did Tuesday: seek justice. 
</P>
<P>
 As admitted killer Timothy Chrestman pleaded not guilty to murder charges 
Tuesday at an arraignment in Ventura County Superior Court, Anderson's 
teary-eyed sister and his fiancee came forward to stand and watch the hearing 
from the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is worse than death," Laurie Anderson, 30, said later of the loss of her 
24-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman has told police that he accidentally shot the victim at a remote 
Rose Valley campground, an assertion the Anderson family finds hard to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the family and friends of so many other murder victims in Ventura County, 
the Andersons put themselves through a form of mental torture each time they go 
to court, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A victim's family not only has to face the person accused of killing a loved 
one, but see defendants such as Chrestman exercising their legal rights -- 
getting court-appointed lawyers and making various legal maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my family and friends are taking this hard," Laurie Anderson said. "And 
as time progresses, it doesn't get any easier. It gets worse. Not only do we 
have to deal with the death of my brother, but now we have to deal with this 
(defendant) taking us through all these court hearings. Why doesn't he just 
stand up and take his punishment?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said every family in murder cases tends 
to be intense about exacting justice. They want to make sure that the accused 
is convicted and punished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's hearing for Chrestman, Anderson's parents listened intently as 
Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher spoke with reporters about the case 
outside the courtroom. Asher said his client was remorseful about Anderson's 
death. He also said his client understands the pain and suffering of the 
Andersons. 
</P>
<P>
 The comment didn't sit well with Bob Anderson, the victim's father, who 
yelled: "He's nothing but a cold-blooded killer!" 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first public outburst by grief-stricken family or friends of 
Anderson. During Chrestman's initial court appearance March 10, several friends 
of the victim clapped, jeered and yelled insults at Chrestman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Andersons are not the only family paying close attention to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman's parents have also been at the four court hearings in the case. 
They have heard Anderson's friends berate their son and, for the most part, 
have remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Chrestman's mother suggested Tuesday that her son's critics wait before 
pronouncing judgment in the case. "I thought this was America," she said. Asher 
said the case has been tough on her, too, because she did everything she could 
to raise her son right, including making him go to church and participate in 
community sporting events regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim comes from a close family," Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's family has little patience for those supplying explanations for 
Chrestman's deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 And they can't believe that Andy Anderson, who had planned to wed 22-year-old 
Lori Quinn of Simi Valley next year, is no longer with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good listener to all his friends," said Carolyn Anderson, the 
victim's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope to help ensure justice by being in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel for my brother Andy and for all the future victims and the victims 
that have already been there in the past," Laurie Anderson said. "The main 
thing is I don't want anybody else to go through this."

MAN ARRESTED IN SALE OF BOGUS AUTOGRAPHED PHOTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Luftwaffe flying ace's signature was worth a lot of money to a Newport Beach 
man, police said Tuesday -- enough for him to sell hundreds of forgeries of it 
to unwary autograph collectors in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Shutt II, 48, now faces charges of grand theft by fraud, they said, for 
selling bogus autographed photos of German World War II flier Erich Hartmann, 
the most successful fighter pilot of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt's arrest could lead to the discovery of other forgeries in the lucrative 
autograph trade, Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Stanley Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't prove yet that he's the one who actually signed them," Weber said. 
"We may have to start calling other dealers and see if they have dealt with Mr. 
Shutt before." 
</P>
<P>
 Shutt could not be reached Tuesday for comment. He was released Monday on his 
own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shutt case sheds light on the musty world of World War II memorabilia 
dealers, who hire veterans of Allied and Axis fighting forces to sign thick 
stacks of photos that can sell for $75 to $100 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartmann, credited with shooting down 352 Allied warplanes -- most of them 
Russian -- signed dozens of photos and lithographs before his death in October. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Shutt offered a box of Hartmann photos to Thousand Oaks-based 
autograph dealers Terry and Angelika Kinsella, they said they were interested. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years, the Kinsellas had been dealing in autographs and photos 
of famous and notorious historical figures under the name A Piece of History 
International. 
</P>
<P>
 They had worked with the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Holocaust Museum in Los 
Angeles, helping to procure a document signed by Auschwitz concentration camp 
Dr. Josef Mengele and overseeing preservation of letters by Jewish diarist Anne 
Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 They recently published a biography of Grace Kelly, titled as she often signed 
her letters, "With Love, Gracie." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Kinsellas had developed a taste for "militaria" -- the photos, 
documents and autographs left behind by famous wartime personalities, 
particularly from World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 They even sold some of those items to Shutt over the years -- including the 
signature of Nazi architect Albert Speer -- for use in his own autograph 
business in Tustin, called King's Crown Gallery, Terry Kinsella said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Shutt announced in April that he was closing shop and offered to sell 
off his inventory, the Kinsellas met him in the lush lobby of the Westlake 
Hyatt Regency. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing them photocopies of letters Hartmann had written to him, Shutt offered 
to sell the Kinsellas a box of photographs, police said. The Kinsellas said the 
box contained 140 Hartmann glossies and 10 signed photos of Hans Baur, Adolf 
Hitler's personal pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Shutt opened his car trunk in the parking lot, the couple glanced at the 
top of the pile and hurriedly paid him $1,500 for the lot because they were 
rushing off on a publicity tour for the Kelly biography, Terry Kinsella said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after talking about Shutt with a fellow dealer, Kinsella says he grew 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the safes, took the photos out and spread them out on the desk, and 
said, 'Uh-oh, definite forgeries,' " he said. Police confirm that the 
signatures were forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Ink had pooled along the signature's looping lines, indicating the 
stop-and-start drawing of someone tracing an original Hartmann autograph, 
Kinsella said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he held a thin stack of photos up to the light, Kinsella said, the 
signatures all stacked perfectly atop each other as if they were one. 
</P>
<P>
 On advice of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Kinsella took the 
photos to another autograph dealer, who also concluded that they were forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the couple called Ventura County detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 They arranged to talk to Shutt about buying his whole collection and steered 
him again to the Hyatt lobby, where Weber sat nearby in plainclothes, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Bring everything you have, we'll settle on a price,' " Kinsella 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a little haggling, the Kinsellas agreed to buy some of the items, 
including more signed Hartmann photos, for $4,200, and took Shutt outside to 
consummate the deal, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he was arrested by Weber and Detectives William Gentry and Hal 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber said the detectives confiscated the rest of Shutt's collection, which 
includes forged signatures of at least eight to 10 other famous war figures, 
including renowned American fighter pilot Joe Foss. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Kinsellas said they take the blame for falling for the alleged 
forgeries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been taken before, and every major dealer in the nation has at one 
time or another," Kinsella said. "Our fallacy is we were really in a hurry."

MORRISSET EDGES WEISS BY 1 VOTE, EARNS SPOT IN RUNOFF; ELECTION: HE WILL FACE 
APPOINTED AUDITOR-CONTROLLER THOMAS O. MAHON IN NOVEMBER. COUNTING OF ABSENTEE 
BALLOTS CHANGED THE ORDER OF FINISH. 
</P>

<P>
 By a single vote, Oxnard accountant Richard Morrisset edged out rival Scott 
Weiss for the right to challenge Thomas O. Mahon for the countywide office of 
auditor-controller in November's election, final tallies released Tuesday show. 
</P>
<P>
 It marks the first time in Ventura County that a city or countywide election 
has been decided by a single vote, elections chief Bruce Bradley said. More 
than 90,000 votes were cast in the auditor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 The final absentee ballots also changed the order of finish, pushing Morrisset 
to second place after he trailed Weiss by 75 votes on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mahon, the appointed auditor-controller, failed to get 51% of the 
vote, he must now face the second-place finisher -- Morrisset -- in a November 
runoff. The final tally gives Mahon 35,561 votes, or 39.4%; Morrisset 17,195, 
or 19.1%, and Weiss 17,194, or 19.1%. Two other candidates shared the remaining 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon spent about $30,000 on his primary campaign, while Morrisset spent only 
$650. Weiss spent about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way to campaign is not by spending money," Morrisset said. "It is by 
using your time and commitment and using volunteers to get the word out." 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome stayed the same for all the other races in the June primary after 
the absentee ballots were counted, Bradley said. The Board of Supervisors is 
expected to certify the results Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, a Ventura accountant, said he was not surprised by the outcome. In the 
past two weeks, as absentee ballots were slowly counted, Morrisset's total 
consistently trekked upward, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what it boils down to is he did better on the absentee ballots, 
and I did better at the precincts," Weiss said. "There is no other logic to it 
as far as I can see." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrisset said he just "got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you win by a single vote, I don't think you can attribute it to anything 
else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said it was disappointing to come so close and lose. But he will not ask 
for a recount because of the expense, he said. An electronic recount would cost 
him $5,000; if the votes were recounted by hand, his out-of-pocket cost would 
be about $9,000, Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would reimburse Weiss only if a recount proved that an error had 
been made and that Weiss was the true second-place finisher, Bradley said. That 
is unlikely, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a good computer and it's been tested, it's going to count the 
ballots consistently time after time," he said. "Each vote is counted the same 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other minor races in the county have resulted in single-vote margins 
or even ties, this is the first time that a city or countywide primary has been 
won by one vote, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, there was a tie for a seat on the tiny Channel Islands 
Community Services District governing board, Bradley said. And in 1992, the 
race for a seat on the Bell Canyon Community Services District also resulted in 
a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the winners were chosen by the flip of a coin, Bradley said, 
adding that the districts were too small to justify the expense of a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such results are rare, they point out that even one person can make a 
difference by voting, Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One vote does count," he said. "That's the lesson here." 
</P>
<P>
 Voter turnout for the June primary was the lowest ever, at 33.6%, Bradley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Morrisset looks toward November, he said his strategy will be to send 
cadres of volunteers onto the streets to emphasize his campaign message: that 
Mahon is not a certified public accountant and was handed his job by his 
predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 All three losing candidates, including Weiss, have pledged to help him in his 
quest to unseat Mahon, Morrisset said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he is not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran against all of them to start with and I came out on top," he said. "And 
I fully expect to come out on top in the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon said he will spend about $50,000 to walk precincts, send mailers and 
meet with people in the next five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides performing audits, his office is responsible for keeping the county's 
financial records, monitoring its budget, and overseeing payroll and accounts 
payable. 
</P>
<P>
 His years of experience in various posts in the auditor-controller's office 
will help him serve as a chief financial officer as well as auditor, Mahon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Morrisset's challenge, he said: "I'm running on my record. I'm not 
running against him."

QUAKE-DAMAGED BUSINESS DISMANTLED; MARKET: OWNER SAYS IT'S TOO LATE TO BE SAD 
AS HE WATCHES DEMOLITION WITH RELIEF AND TALKS ABOUT REBUILDING HIS BUSINESS.

<P>
 Shafts of sunlight filtered through the holes in the ceiling of Joe Hijaz's 
Mayflower Market in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-year-old store owner fingered his prayer beads and smiled cautiously as 
a worker knocked another hole in the roof of the store that was damaged beyond 
repair in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what God has decided for us," Hijaz said, watching demolition of the 
building that he's owned since moving here from Jordan more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting for six months to get the permits and funding necessary to knock 
the building down, Hijaz said he long ago passed the point of sadness. "It's 
more of a relief to see things happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Workers spent much of Tuesday pulling apart the roof of the market on a corner 
of High Street in downtown Moorpark. It is the only business in the city that 
has to be demolished because of the Northridge quake, Councilman Scott 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said the city has moved as quickly as it could to begin the 
demolition so that Hijaz could rebuild on the same spot. But, the councilman 
said, six months has been a long time to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our response time was about average," Montgomery said. "When you're 
working with the federal government, though, you have to expect delays because 
of the red tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, the city has allowed Hijaz and his son to operate the 
market out of a detached back storage room that was undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign at the front of the roped-off building points customers to the back of 
the store. Hijaz has set up shop in three large shipping containers, each about 
eight feet tall and crammed with goods. A temporary roof he built connects the 
containers with the storage room. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijaz said sales have fallen from what they were before the quake. He said the 
sooner the demolition is finished, the sooner he can rebuild and the family 
business can return to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijaz will pay about $1,800 toward the demolition costs. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency will pay the remaining $17,000 it will take to clean the 
asbestos from the old building, knock down the brick walls and remove the 
rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijaz is trying to get a low-interest Small Business Administration loan to 
cover the $500,000 he said it will cost to rebuild. He said he wants to expand 
the store slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the SBA told him that he might qualify for a $200,000 loan, but has 
not come through with the money. He said he is looking for bank loans to make 
up the difference. He had no earthquake insurance to cover the loss. In any 
event, he said, he will have to wait for the federal loan before any 
construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SBA is even slower than FEMA," he said. "Every day we talk to the lady 
and she has about 20 questions and each question means another delay. I don't 
know. It's 19 years that I'm in this business, but this kind of thing is very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition team working on the market is scheduled to use bulldozers to 
knock down the walls of the building this morning, and Hijaz hopes to start 
rebuilding within three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows really," he said. "You know the routine . . . there's a lot of 
paperwork and red tape that you have to go through first."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY FAIR WILL OFFER COUNTRY, SOUL

 Tanya Tucker, the Marshall Tucker Band, two country groups and those old 
favorites the Temptations are among the entertainers scheduled to perform at 
this year's Ventura County Fair, which runs Aug. 17 to 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Country music singers Hal Ketchum and Carlene Carter will kick off 
festivities, the first of 17 performances at the 19-day event. 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FIREFIGHTERS FEAR ACTIVE FIRE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After fighting five brush fires in four days, including a two-acre blaze in 
Westlake Village on Tuesday, fire officials said there is mounting concern that 
this summer will be an abnormally active fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's blaze, sparked by welders working near dry brush, came within 100 
feet of several homes and took 57 firefighters two hours to extinguish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weed abatement saved these houses," Ventura County Battalion Chief Al 
Wilsey said. "Everything that wasn't cut burned clean to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 County fire officials said Tuesday that a lack of rainfall this winter, 
combined with hot temperatures, has left the brush dry and brittle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fuel that's out there right now is just waiting to burn," said Sandi 
Wells, a Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman. "If it continues to be hot 
and dry, people are going to have to be very careful." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the fire sparked by welders, a recent fire near Santa Paula was 
set by sparks from a car engine. Two of the recent fires -- one next to the 
Conejo Grade and one in Agoura Hills -- were believed to be set by arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most fires are caused by people who are careless, whether it's sparks from 
illegal fireworks or model rockets or a back-yard barbecue," Wells said. "But 
some are arson, and we have investigators who are keeping track of those 
fires." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, investigators have said there is no link between any of the recent 
blazes in the Thousand Oaks area, and they do not suspect that two fires blamed 
on arson were set by the same person, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to look into these cases. But in the meantime, we are urging 
people to be careful in the outdoors," she said. "This could be a long summer."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 3 HELD ON SUSPICION OF BURGLARIZING 
STORE

<P>
 Three Los Angeles-area men were arrested on suspicion of burglary early 
Tuesday after a sheriff's deputy caught them carrying out armloads of women's 
clothing from a Thousand Oaks store. 
</P>
<P>
 While on routine patrol about 2:40 a.m., Ventura County Sheriff's Deputy Brad 
Guzzard discovered the front window of Fashions for Less on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard smashed and several people loading women's apparel into a parked van, 
deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the few minutes that the suspects were in the store, they took 27 women's 
vests and 32 pants sets in assorted sizes and colors before being caught by 
deputies, Detective Pat Dain said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love to shop up here," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Police recovered the clothing, which was valued at about $2,000, and arrested 
Antonio Rodriguez Vasquez, 26, of West Hollywood, and Jose Luis Perez, 30, and 
Francisco Lopez Perez, 24, both of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dain said more suspects may have been involved, but possibly fled when Guzzard 
arrived. The three who were arrested were booked at the East Valley Sheriff's 
Station jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the store's alarm went off during the burglary, Fashions for Less 
Manager Shannon Whitney said it was the watchful eye of the deputy that foiled 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so happy because it would be very difficult to determine how much 
inventory we lost," she said. "We just really lucked out that the police were 
there." TRACY WILSON

 Construction of a 108-unit apartment complex for low-income senior citizens is 
scheduled to begin in July, after the Simi Valley City Council approved a 
$230,000 loan for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the loan to speed up construction of the long-awaited Las 
Serenas development. 
</P>
<P>
 USA Properties Fund asked for the loan to help subsidize rents for low-income 
senior citizens at the complex, which will be built on a vacant lot at Yosemite 
and Los Angeles avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents for the one- and two-bedroom apartments planned at Las Serenas will 
range from $365 to $630, a spokesman for USA Properties said. SARA CATANIA

 Rudyard Beldner isn't Scottish, but when he hears a reel, jig or strathspey, 
he and his group launch into a Scottish country dance. His wife, Eunice, isn't 
Ukrainian, but she can decorate wooden eggs like a famed Slavic artisan. 
</P>
<P>
 And the two are eager to share their talents at Thousand Oaks' annual 
International Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beldners will join artists, dancers and chefs from around the world and 
across the county in the all-day party, which will run from noon to 7 p.m. 
Sunday in Conejo Creek Park North, behind the Thousand Oaks Library on Janss 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish, German and Swiss high-steppers will dance on a rented stage, as 13 
groups perform every half-hour. Carlos Amezcua, an anchor with KTLA-TV's 
morning news, will host the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Arts Festival will also offer foods from around the world, 
including Mexican, Indian, Chinese and American. Nearly 60 artisans will 
exhibit crafts. From noon to 5 p.m., children will be able to paint ceramic 
tiles, which will later be laid in a walkway through the Civic Arts Plaza park. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the festival is free, but tiles cost $5 apiece. The event is 
funded by more than two dozen individual and corporate donations. STEPHANIE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 5 ARE CHOSEN FOR AIR POLLUTION BOARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives from five Ventura County cities were selected Tuesday to serve 
on a powerful countywide board that will shape air pollution policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Air Pollution Control Board members will be Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, 
Thousand Oaks City Councilwoman Judy Lazar, Ventura City Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures, Fillmore City Councilman Mike McMahan and Moorpark City Councilman 
Pat Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Councilwoman Nina Shelley and Port Hueneme Mayor Orvene Carpenter 
will serve as alternates. 
</P>
<P>
 The board members were selected Tuesday at a meeting of the Assn. of Ventura 
County Cities, which includes elected officials from each of the county's 10 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's action gives Ventura County cities a voice on the air pollution 
board for the first time. The city leaders will serve with the five county 
supervisors, who formerly made up the entire board. 
</P>
<P>
 The equal city and county representation is required by a state law approved 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is classified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency as a 
region with a "severe" air quality problem, despite improvements in recent 
years. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; HOLDEN EXPECTED TO RUN FOR REELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard City Councilman Tom Holden is expected to announce plans to run for 
reelection during a press conference scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, a 39-year-old optometrist, joined the council after defeating 12 
rivals in a special election last year to fill the seat vacated by Manuel 
Lopez, who was elected mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with Oxnard's budget shortfall without cutting city services, Holden 
has championed efforts to run the city like a business, advocating private 
management of public programs and private sector competition. His critics have 
charged that he has not done enough to create low-income housing in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the seat held by Holden, another council seat and the mayor's 
post will be up in the Nov. 8 election. Both Lopez and Councilman Mike Plisky 
have filed papers with the city clerk's office, but have yet to announce 
whether they intend to run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Former city employee John Zaragoza is the only other person to formally 
announce his candidacy for the City Council. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WAY OF PICKING VALEDICTORIANS CALLED UNFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying they feel cheated out of recognition for their academic achievements, 
two Channel Islands High School graduates are asking the Oxnard Union High 
School District to change the way it chooses valedictorians. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates Olivia Arboleda and Errol Nillo are protesting the district's policy 
of awarding equal weight to honors and regular classes when calculating the 
grade-point averages for valedictorian candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I think about it, I get angry," Nillo said. "It's obvious you could 
get better grades with easier classes." 
</P>
<P>
 During their four years at Channel Islands High, Nillo and Arboleda each took 
more than a dozen honors classes in subjects ranging from English to calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 And they each earned all A's except for two Bs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two were passed over for valedictorian in favor of two other graduates 
-- Christopher Ingel and Julio Coronado -- who took fewer honors classes but 
made slightly better grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands High and the four other high schools in the Oxnard district 
all recognize honors classes with heavier weight on students' school 
transcripts, listing grade-point averages on both a 5.0 and 4.0 scale. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 5.0 scale, honors classes are given more weight, with an A getting five 
points, a B four points and so on. The 4.0 scale treats all classes the same: A 
equals 4.0, B equals 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Nillo and Arboleda each had 4.54 grade-point averages on the 5.0 scale. 
Ingel's score on this measure was 4.1; Coronado's was 3.96. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the 4.0 scale, which the district uses to select valedictorians, 
Ingel's grade-point average was 3.98. Coronado's was 3.96. Arboleda and Nillo 
were tied at 3.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Nillo said his only two Bs were in honors chemistry and honors calculus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got penalized for taking honors classes," Arboleda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their concerns, Channel Islands High School Principal John Triolo said 
the district has no plans to change its method of choosing valedictorians. The 
district set its policy eight years ago after a committee of parents and school 
officials studied the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing valedictorians according to 5.0 scale would "favor kids who take the 
most honors classes," Triolo said. A 4.0 scale, on the other hand, "puts 
everybody on a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Students should not worry if they are not named valedictorian, he said, 
because colleges and employers are more concerned with class ranking, grades 
and the types of classes taken. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arboleda and Nillo said it hurt not to be recognized for their high 
grades. They still hope to persuade district officials to change the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really matter for my year anymore," Nillo said. "I just want to 
protect future generations." MAIA DAVIS

 Shade awnings, an information kiosk and more landscaping will be installed at 
the Ventura train platform this year, but not in time for the Ventura County 
Fair in August, according to a Ventura city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, on Monday approved more 
construction and landscaping work at the platform and authorized the city to 
advertise for bids on the project. City staff, in a report to the agency, 
estimate the cost for the project at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from a state transit grant. The estimated construction time is 
60 days and will begin after the fair ends. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FEE INCREASED FOR KEYS HOMEOWNERS 
</P>

<P>
 Owners of the waterfront homes in the Ventura Keys will have to pay more this 
year for the city to dredge their back-yard canals, under a proposal approved 
by the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, approved Monday night, raises the annual assessment to $2,000, a 
$300 increase over the 1993-94 charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, notice of a fee hike has drawn floods of Keys residents to City 
Hall to protest. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with settlement possible later this summer of a lawsuit brought by 
Keys homeowners against the city, there were only a few protests Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting on the settlement to end their fiscal frustrations, many residents 
this year were content to send letters of protest to the council rather than 
showing up in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the proposed settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by 
nearly one-third of the 300 homeowners in the assessment district, Keys 
residents would each pay $685 for last year and $749 for this year's dredging 
assessments, with an increase of no more than $64 per year thereafter in 
perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's engineer's report on the channels states that the fees should go 
up to pay for repairs to the walls of the channels, future dredging costs and 
possible installation of a plastic liner at the site where the city dumps silt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council did agree to minor changes in the engineer's report, 
following protests by those homeowners who did show up at the hearing, some 
residents said afterward that they still found the process trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very frustrating," said Karen Hoffberg, who lives on Sailor 
Avenue. "Year after year, they don't really listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the concessions the council did make this year, she said, "are too 
little, too late." CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY OKS PLAN TO RESTORE RIVER HABITAT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to restore the ecologically sensitive habitat at the mouth of the 
Ventura River has been approved by the Ventura City Council, clearing the way 
for work to begin as early as August. 
</P>
<P>
 Paid workers and volunteers will soon start uprooting invasive plants, which 
carpet the ground and choke out native vegetation that once thrived in the 
soil.The area's original plants provide food and shelter to wildlife that live 
in the estuary, the area where the freshwater of the river meets the saltwater 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed Monday night to earmark $193,000 for the first phase of the 
project. In future phases, workers will remove feral cats and other non-native 
animals from the area, create wooden trails to protect the sand dunes, and 
construct a visitors center and amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Conservancy is expected to contribute $400,000 as well to the 
Ventura River Estuary Management Project, and the state parks department is 
expected to add $150,000. The Ventura County Audubon Society has pledged $8,500 
in volunteer in-kind services. CONSTANCE SOMMER

TRANSIENT SURRENDERS IN BANK ROBBERY

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old transient has surrendered in connection with the robbery of a 
Bank of America branch in Oxnard, police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Christopher Jimenez met Oxnard police officers at 3:25 p.m. Monday at a 
bar on Mercantile Street to surrender for a robbery he said he committed

PEOPLE: TRAMMELL CROW NAMES CHIEF OF WYNDHAM ITS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trammell Crow Co. announced Tuesday that James D. Carreker has been appointed 
president and chief executive, effective Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreker, 47, will remain president and chief executive of Wyndham Hotels & 
Resorts, a job he has held since 1988. He succeeds J. McDonald Williams, 53, 
who will become chairman of the Dallas-based commercial real estate firm. The 
company's current chairman, Trammell Crow, is retiring and will become chairman 
emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreker is credited with turning around the troubled Wyndham Hotels and with 
more than doubling the size of the Dallas-based chain, which is owned by the 
Trammell Crow family. The hotel company is not directly affiliated with the 
Crow real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five years, Trammell Crow has shifted its focus from 
development to real estate services such as property management. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreker's "appointment speaks about where we see ourselves going in the 
service business," Williams said. "He has transformed Wyndham into a success 
story in a service-oriented business."  
</P>
<P>
 Trammell Crow, founded in 1948, is the country's largest commercial real 
estate service firm -- more than twice as big as its nearest competitor -- and 
manages more than 235 million square feet of assets. It also owns more than $8 
billion in commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroya Nobuhara has been appointed president and chief executive of Los 
Angeles-based Sanwa Bank California. Nobuhara, 53, succeeds Isao (Steve) 
Matsuura, who has been named general manager of the New York branch of Sanwa's 
parent organization, Sanwa Bank Ltd. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Nobuhara's first U.S. assignment. He joined Sanwa Bank Ltd. in 1965 
and has held a number of management jobs in Japan and abroad since then. His 
most recent was as director and general manager of the corporate banking 
department in Tokyo, where he was responsible for managing the bank's largest 
commercial accounts.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael F. Henn has been named senior vice president and chief financial 
officer of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp., effective July 11. Henn, 46, was 
previously executive vice president and chief financial and administrative 
officer of Vons Cos. in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Kaufman & Broad is a leading home builder in the West and is 
among the largest builders in metropolitan Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 GranCare Inc. has named Erich J. Wolters to the new position of senior vice 
president of operations, with responsibility for the operation of the Culver 
City-based firm's 80 facilities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Wolters was senior vice president of Transitional Hospitals Corp.

YOUR MONEY ; FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW LOSES 33 ON 'MISERABLE DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks suffered a third straight losing session Tuesday as the dollar's 
precipitous drop raised concerns that the Federal Reserve Board will have to 
raise interest rates to resolve the currency crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average and broader market indicators finished 
substantially lower, though they were above their worst readings of the day. 
The blue chip indicator was off 33.93 at 3,707.97. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in Tuesday's trading, the Dow fell more than 50 points, tripping 
"circuit breakers" on the New York Stock Exchange that restrict certain types 
of computer-guided trading. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miserable day," said Edward Nicoski, chief market strategist for 
investment firm Piper Jaffray Inc. in Minneapolis. "The internals of the market 
were absolutely horrible," he said, noting that losing NYSE issues outnumbered 
gainers by a margin of more than 3 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Market measures that comprise a wide range of stocks also dropped sharply. The 
NYSE composite index fell 2.30 to 249.10, and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index 
fell 4.14 to 451.34. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks 
skidded 10.06 to 708.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling grew intense shortly after midday as the dollar sank against the 
Japanese yen to a depth not seen in the post-World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
 A depressed dollar is considered inflationary because it can cause American 
consumers to pay higher prices for imports. It also erodes the value of 
dollar-denominated assets, possibly lessening demand among foreign investors 
for U.S. stocks and bonds, Nicoski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar slipped for the first time ever below the 100-yen mark, hitting 
99.90 briefly in New York, before recovering later in the day. It closed at 
100.35 yen in New York, down from 101.90 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also took a major hit against the German mark, ending at 1.594 
marks, down from 1.600 and the lowest level since May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency has come under relentless selling pressure due to a variety 
of factors, including persistent trade tensions with Japan and expectations of 
higher investment returns in other foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's collapse unsettled investors who believe the Fed may raise 
interest rates to boost the U.S. currency, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates could attract foreign investment money back to the dollar, though 
they also raise the risk of slowing the economy and biting into corporate 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank has raised rates four times this year in an effort to dampen 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The falling dollar and fear of another increase in rates sent the Treasury's 
30-year bond yield higher for a third straight day. The long bond's yield rose 
to 7.49% from 7.46% on Monday. The last time the yield hit that level was May 
13. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 3/8 point, or 
$3.75 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're back into the soup again that we were in back in February and 
March, when people were worrying about the Fed raising rates," said Marshall 
Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney Shearson. 
</P>
<P>
 Weakness in technology stocks added to the gloomy atmosphere on Wall Street, 
where investors were preoccupied with speculation about whether the Fed will 
try to counteract the dollar's decline. 
</P>
<P>
 A dramatic worsening in the country's trade deficit added to the anxiety about 
the dollar. The Commerce Department said the shortfall in the balance of trade 
in goods and services soared to $8.40 billion in April from $6.87 billion in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lotus tumbled 14 3/8 to 37 and headed Nasdaq's list of active issues. The 
software company surprised Wall Street late Monday by disclosing that 
second-quarter sales and earnings won't reach expectations because of product 
shipment delays and disappointing sales of desktop software. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other software stocks were dragged down by the news. Microsoft dropped 7/8 
to 52 5/8, Broderbund fell 1 3/4 to 41 and Novell lost 1/2 to 14 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer slipped 1 1/8 to 26 and Intel was off 7/8 at 58. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quaker Oats plunged 8 1/4 to 73 5/8 after Nestle's chairman and chief 
executive said the company is not interested in acquiring the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 4 1/4 to 102 1/8 as a 
strike began after negotiations between labor and management broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Healthcare retreated 2 5/8 to 40 1/2 after the company said it is not 
for sale. The stock rose 2 1/8 on Monday on market talk that it was a takeover 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling in stock markets overseas set a negative tone for U.S. trading. In 
Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei average fell 338.87 points, or 1.60%, closing at 
20,813.16. Stocks closed lower in London, where the Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 30.9 points to 2,940.2. Shares also closed lower in Paris. 
Mexico's Bolsa index fell 25.92 points, or 1.14%, to 2,257.69. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, stocks managed a modest recovery, with the DAX average closing up 
14.45 points at 1,983.27.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE KING OF LATE NIGHT IS STILL 'LARRY'; 'SANDERS,' THAT IS. 
AND 'DREAM ON' ISN'T FAR BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for a television break tonight in whicJ. Simpson is not the topic? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're an HBO subscriber, be advised that the funniest talk show host on 
television is not weepy Sally Jessy Raphael, feisty Jay Leno or even the 
celebrated David Letterman. It's Larry Sanders, who, in reality, isn't a talk 
show host at all. He's fictional. 
</P>
<P>
 For several seasons, HBO's Wednesday-night grouping of "The Larry Sanders 
Show" and "Dream On" has given prime time its most scintillating comedy 
twosome, a joined-at-the-hip couple of urbanely witty and satirical half hours 
for viewers who do know who's buried in Grant's tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Counter-programming local news and network news magazines, "Dream On" and "The 
Larry Sanders Show" begin new seasons tonight, the former airing at 10, the 
latter at 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream On" stars Brian Benben as a divorced parent buffeted by a life so 
turbulent and chaotic that his survival from week to week seems in doubt. "The 
Larry Sanders Show" stars Garry Shandling as the insecure, neurotic, 
self-obsessed, much-in-need-of-therapy host of a traditional late-night talk 
show. But when the camera's red light comes on, he's transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's always been a tossup as to which series was funnier. Yet, based on 
new-show samplings, the highest performing partner this season will be "The 
Larry Sanders Show." As always, the acting is so artfully straight-faced and 
the scripts so full of in-the-know nuance that "The Larry Sanders Show" seems 
to reek of behind-the-scenes television reality. And, if it is all make 
believe, at least it amusingly feeds our misconceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by executive producers Shandling, Peter Tolan and Paul Simms and 
directed by Todd Holland, tonight's episode ranges from merely funny to 
rip-roaring A+. We open with Larry three months into his self-imposed exile 
from the business, disheveled and miserable in a Montana cabin, again pining 
for the spotlight while watching tapes of his old shows a la Norma Desmond 
reliving her silent film career in "Sunset Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, he wasn't meant to be Father Nature. When a bird chirps outside, he 
snaps: "Get off the porch, (expletive)!" 
</P>
<P>
 Also wretchedly unhappy is Larry's posturing talk show sidekick, Hank (Jeffrey 
Tambor), who is still reeling from the big comedown. It's a tough job market. 
Having resorted to announcing lottery winners on TV, Hank is now a teary, 
chain-smoking mess. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Larry's producer, the resourceful Arthur (Rip Torn), who plots a way for 
Larry to get his talk show back with "dignity," and in no time at all Larry is 
again being babied and pampered and smarminess and insincerity are back on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Larry Sanders Show" has always had the gift of flat-out hilarious gab, 
squirting throwaway lines and other conversational wit while shrewdly 
intersecting plots with actual events. At one point tonight, Larry hides in a 
closet to eavesdrop on negotiations over his fate just as Leno was said to have 
done when NBC was deciding whether to retain him or hire Letterman as Johnny 
Carson's successor on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Next week finds Larry harassed by a woman who publicly claims he impregnated 
her while in Montana. Although funny in spots, it's a big drop-off from 
tonight. Closer to form is Episode 3, with Larry getting grief from his 
obnoxious father and, as always, getting entirely wrapped up in himself, so 
much so that he fails to notice that one of his key staffers is unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn and Tambor are nothing less than heroic on this series, and Shandling is 
a perfect Larry. 
</P>
<P>
 Every bit their equal is "Dream On" star Benben, but unfortunately the show's 
opener (half of a two-parter that concludes next Wednesday) is labored, only 
intermittently funny and definitely not up to old standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of his ex-wife's husband -- that gleaming superman, Dr. Richard 
Stone -- has appeared to open the way for Martin Tupper (Benben) to fulfill his 
fantasies and return to her good graces. But that plan goes awry when he and 
her child are abducted from Stone's memorial service by two loony screenwriters 
(Jamie Gertz and Scott Bakula) who hope to make a deal to turn the kidnaping 
into one of those movies "ripped from tomorrow's headlines." It doesn't take 
long for the entire episode to yellow like yesterday's headline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 IN HOT WATER. It does take all kinds . . . unfortunately. Some humans are 
oblivious to suffering, some insensitive to it, some in denial. Still others 
occupy another category entirely, seeming to take sheer delight in the pain of 
other beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge for yourself about that slabhead, Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh last week devoted a portion of his syndicated television show (on 
KCOP-TV Channel 13) to ridiculing criticism of a "Today" program cooking 
segment. In that segment a live lobster had its tail cut off and its body slit 
and opened before being sauteed -- still writhing -- in a pan as co-host Katie 
Couric stood nearby, saying, "What a way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The segment was rerun and criticism of it mocked by Limbaugh in a manner that 
was crude even by his standards. As the poor live lobster was being sliced open 
and pan-fried, the gleeful Limbaugh provided his own lobster-in-pain sound 
effects ("Oooh! Ow! Ouch-ouch!") while his studio crowd of sycophants greeted 
his low burlesque with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh loves to gratuitously taunt and pull the chains of those with whom he 
disagrees. The jeer, having no intellectual basis, often becomes an end in 
itself, Limbaugh's motivation being that thinkers ahead of the curve sometimes 
make easy targets. He is the kind of guy who would have hooted at Copernicus. 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts on invertebrates, by the way, lobsters are complex 
creatures that have a brain and sensitivity to pain. That immediately elevates 
them above some TV and radio talk show personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Couric, the recoiling horror she expressed while the live lobster was 
being dismembered and fried in front of her was obviously feigned, given her 
smirking review of the incident during a recent appearance on "The Late Show 
With David Letterman." Playing to a studio audience that found it all very 
humorous, she euphemistically likened the usual method of boiling lobsters 
alive to giving them a "bath." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "Today" got an unwanted visitor during Monday's debut of its widely 
publicized studio set whose street-level panoramic windows allow pedestrians to 
observe the show and be observed themselves. Visible through a window was a 
seven-foot "lobster" on assignment from People for Ethical Treatment of 
Animals. The sign it was waving read, "No Lobsters Today." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch-ouch!

MOVIE REVIEW; 'BHAJI ON THE BEACH': MORE THAN SAND, SURF; GURINDER CHADHA'S 
FILM IS AN INSIGHTFUL LOOK AT THE DIFFICULTIES OF BRIDGING CULTURES AND 
GENERATIONS, BUT IT NEVER FORGETS TO HAVE FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bhaji on the Beach" is one of those small but remarkable pictures that smiles 
at the supposed difficulties of movie-making. Warm and charming while 
sacrificing neither its integrity nor its point of view, it covers considerable 
personal and political territory without overreaching or condescending. And it 
never forgets to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The debut film of director and co-story writer Gurinder Chadha, apparently the 
first Indian woman living in Britain to direct a film in that country, "Bhaji" 
is further evidence that Britain's supposedly moribund film industry is turning 
into cinema's most celebrated invalid. Though economic difficulties have 
seriously curtailed output, those British films that do get made are invariably 
models of strength and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 The seriocomic story of a day trip to the seaside resort of Blackpool by 
several generations of women, "Bhaji" has points in common with other socially 
conscious British directors, particularly the pioneering Ken Loach, who Chadha 
views as a mentor, and Mike Leigh, whose ideas of extensive rehearsals to 
define character she has made her own use of. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as indicated by the bhaji of the title, an only-in-England snack derived 
from a traditional Indian dish, this is very much its own film, flavored by the 
distinctive sensibility of the Indian community that it depicts. 
</P>
<P>
 For while "Bhaji's" key protagonists may sound just like the English they live 
among, they are separated from them not only by skin color but also by the 
difficulties of being a transitional generation, with one foot in the clannish, 
fearful society of their immigrant parents and the other in the modern Western 
world their futures will take place in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bhaji" begins in Birmingham, an industrial city in the Midlands, and its 
almost too-rapid introduction of characters gives audiences a sense of the 
crowded, hectic conditions of the Indian community there, with married children 
still living with their parents, and the whole business overseen by a network 
of vaguely related, invariably censorious older women known collectively (as 
they were in the similarly themed "The Joy Luck Club") as aunties. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time a bus holding a cross-section of women sets out for a day of 
"female fun" at Blackpool under the tutelage of feminist Simi (Shaheen Khan), 
two of the passengers, each with her own romantic crisis, have come into focus 
as the film's parallel protagonists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginder (Kim Vithana) has precipitated a crisis in the close-knit community by 
leaving her husband, Ranjit (Jimmi Harkishin), and moving into a women's 
shelter with her young son. And Hashida (Sarita Khajuria), a college graduate 
about to enter medical school, knows she will cause even more of a sensation if 
word gets out that a) she is pregnant though unmarried and b) the father is a 
young black man of Caribbean descent named Oliver (Mo Sesay). 
</P>
<P>
 When the bus arrives at Blackpool, the city itself, with its gaudy, Coney 
Islandish air of down-at-the-heels frivolity, becomes a character in the film. 
A place like this by definition encourages a loosening of bonds, allowing 
everyone from teen-age sisters Ladhu and Madhu to decorous Auntie Asha (Lalita 
Ahmed) to engage in amusing flirtations. And with both Ranjit and Oliver headed 
toward Blackpool to try to resolve their difficulties, more serious events are 
likely as well. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this ability to move with grace and ease between comedy and drama that 
is "Bhaji's" particular accomplishment. For though Meera Syal's script deals 
with provocative issues from racism to the place of women and the often 
injurious power of custom and tradition, both she and director Chadha employ a 
fluid touch that allows points to be made with welcome subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical to this accomplishment is the fondness and empathy for its characters 
that marks the film's every scene. The chance to put situations close to their 
own experience onto the screen must have meant a great deal to everyone 
involved, and the sense of vivid life that results has made "Bhaji on the 
Beach" into a film that manages to be as pleasant as it is pointed.

Original "Brady Bunch" cast members, as well as stars from other TV series of

 NEA's New Partner: In the first major realization of the type of cultural 
partnerships among government agencies that Jane Alexander has been advocating 
since taking over the helm of the National Endowment for the Arts, the NEA 
received a $400,000-grant this week from the Clinton Administration's National 
Service Corp. to help finance a three-city initiative on literacy. The grant 
will aid a new NEA program called the Writers Corps, which will connect 60 
young adult writers in Washington, the Bronx and San Francisco with troubled 
children and teens to teach them to read and write about their experiences. 
Since becoming NEA chairman last October, Alexander has been meeting with 
Cabinet-level officials about the need for financial and creative 
collaborations, both as a way for the arts agency to have an impact on social 
issues and to attract new sources of funding.

 New Art Showcase: A building at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Camden 
Drive in Beverly Hills, formerly occupied by Gump's, is likely to be the home 
of PaceWildenstein, a new branch of the world's largest art dealership. The 
powerhouse gallery was created in 1993 when Wildenstein & Co., a Paris-based 
dealer of Impressionist and Old Master paintings, acquired a 49% interest in 
Pace Gallery of New York, a major contemporary art dealership. Plans for a 
Beverly Hills gallery were announced after the merger, but no details were 
confirmed. "It's an incredible space," Mark Glimcher, PaceWildenstein's 
director of operations, said of the Wilshire Boulevard location. "It certainly 
fills my bill. We want our galleries to be really accessible and part of 
everyone's everyday lives, like our New York gallery on 57th Street." But 
negotiations for the building are not complete and no decision will be made 
until a director of the West Coast operation is named, probably in mid-July, 
Glimcher said.

 Sarajevo Culture Drive: Celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz and author 
Susan Sontag have created a limited edition poster that will be sold to benefit 
the people of war-torn Sarajevo. The poster features a photo Leibovitz took at 
a Sarajevo diving pool, plus commentary by Sontag, in her own script, about the 
role of culture as a form of "moral resistance" to war. The poster sells for 
$35 through New York's Montblanc de la Culture Foundation. POP/ROCK

 No West Coast Stops: The only Southern California date for the WOMAD world 
music festival, July 10 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, has been canceled. 
Primus, Arrested Development, Midnight Oil and Live were among the acts 
scheduled for the festival, which was also canceled for San Francisco, its only 
other West Coast venue. The festival is still scheduled on the East Coast, 
however, with founder Peter Gabriel to headline. TELEVISION

 Expanded News Block: Pat Harvey and David Jackson will anchor a new KCAL 
Channel 9 newscast from 7 to 8 p.m. beginning July 11. The new newscast will 
expand the station's nightly news block to four hours, from 7 to 11 p.m. The 
network will do away, however, with its 6:30 p.m. newscast, instead leading 
into the news block with the syndicated programs "Inside Edition" and "American 
Journal" from 6 to 7 p.m. Harvey and Jackson will also continue to anchor the 
station's 9 p.m. newscast. COMEDY

 A Funny Thing Happened to Me . . .: John Wayne Bobbitt, who became a favorite 
subject for comedy fodder last year after his wife cut off his penis, is now 
looking for his own comedy writer. Bobbitt took out a classified ad in 
Tuesday's Daily Variety seeking a "great writer with stand-up experience" to 
help him embark on a "national comedy tour." Manager Aaron Gordon said Bobbitt 
planned to work up five to seven minutes of "100% autobiographical" material to 
become an emcee at comedy clubs around the country. Gordon said Bobbitt's debut 
would be within 30 to 60 days at a "big name" L.A. club. SHAUNA SNOW

THEATER REVIEW; NAKED ANGELS ASCEND TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles is teeming with one-act festivals. The New York-based Naked Angels 
have joined the trend with "More Naked at the Coast," eight one-acts at the 
Coast Playhouse. It's a rip-roaringly entertaining follow-up to last year's 
"Naked at the Coast," which featured 11 short works by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's opener, Jon Robin Baitz's "It Changes Every Year," directed by 
Darrell Larson, gingerly explores the emotional minefield of the mother-son 
relationship. Lorinne Dills Vozoff and Bibi Besch play two moms who are being 
taken out to a Mother's Day lunch -- by their sons' gay lovers. Kurt Deutsch 
and Timothy Britten Parker play the lovers, who have decided to swap moms this 
year and avoid the annual rehashing of ancient family dramas. Baitz wisely 
leaves much unsaid in his touching drama, and Larson's direction is similarly 
restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Pugliese's "Snuff," directed by Geoffrey Nauffts, is a chilling morality 
tale about the roles rationalization and compromise play in the process of 
corruption. Nauffts (filling in for an ailing Joshua Malina) plays an 
idealistic young film editor being led on the road to perdition by his 
colleague Al (Xander Berkeley), a human sewer in gold chains with a diabolic 
investment scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 In "A Hudson Moon," directed by F. Emeryl, a man and a woman give radically 
conflicting versions of their first date. Timothy Britten Parker's play, which 
features Gina Gershon and Billy Strong, is a Nichols and May routine that turns 
unexpectedly serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's funniest offering is Ned Eisenberg's "Fruits and Nuts." Picture 
"No Exit" with belly laughs. Eisenberg and Laura Jane Salvato play a 
hilariously enraged couple trapped in an existential nightmare of a 
relationship. Director Joumana Rizk officiates over the comic mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pay-Per-Kill," Warren Leight's polemic against capital punishment, directed 
by Jace Alexander, is a blunt-instrument satire. Although intended as farce, 
Leight's concept of pay-per-view executions doesn't strike one as so 
far-fetched after all, in light of recent media excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Lonergan's "Heartsick Pioneer," directed by Bruno Kirby, is a wistful 
boy-meets-girl valentine in which a heartsore female cop (Catherine Lloyd 
Burns) is haltingly wooed by a lonely security guard (Parker). 
</P>
<P>
 In the political drama "Limbo," directed by Kate Baggot, playwright Pippin 
Parker paints a savage portrait of the United States as the 800-pound gorilla 
of world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Breen's testosterone-packed "Midnight and Morning Rain," directed by 
Alexander, could be subtitled "Men Who Bond Too Much." Four guys, friends since 
childhood, gather to watch baseball, drink beer and shoot the breeze. Their 
comfortable rapport is shattered when the taboo subject of their boyhood 
homosexual experimentation is broached. 
</P>
<P>
 The precision-perfect performance art/dance troupe Instant Girl does 
show-stopping turns in both acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting throughout the evening is exceptional, the directing accomplished, 
the material insightful. A heavenly company, Naked Angels is warmly welcome in 
the City of Angels. 
</P>
<P>

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; LITTLE RICHARD'S VOICE GETS LOST IN THE MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the Coach House Sunday night, 61-year-old rock legend Little Richard was 
ill prepared. What could have been a true rock event was instead a frustrating, 
uneven display of talent and pique. 
</P>
<P>
 His band showed up hours late for its sound check, only doing a cursory one 
when the show should have already started. The result was a shortened 
performance, numerous microphone and feedback problems, and, even at its best, 
a sound mix that obscured what people had come to hear -- Richard's voice and 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the quieter songs could you hear his voice clearly above the din of 
his six-piece band. His splendid piano work was even more buried. 
</P>
<P>
 The set included several of his better burners, including "Good Golly Miss 
Molly," "Lucille," "Jenny Jenny," a breakneck "Ready Teddy," "Long Tall Sally" 
and a slowed-down version of "The Girl Can't Help It." He also covered Larry 
Williams' "Boney Moronie," Chuck Berry's "Rock & Roll Music" and a bit of Jimmy 
Reed's "Baby, What You Want Me to Do."  
</P>
<P>
 The show's momentum was continually derailed by Richard stopping, sometimes in 
mid-song, for spoken digressions. It was maddening because amid the awful sound 
and Richard's own erratic showmanship it was clear that the talent that shook 
rock into consciousness three decades ago remains intact. JIM WASHBURN

DANCE REVIEW; CHOREOGRAPHERS OFFER FOUR PREMIERES OF OBSCURE WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first five minutes of Dawn Stoppiello's new "Six to the End" take place 
virtually in darkness, an image that became an unintentional metaphor for much 
of the hermetic work on the "4 X Four" program Sunday at the Fountain Theatre 
in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The title actually should have been "4 by Four by Four" because the program 
consisted of four new works by four choreographers working to four original 
scores.In addition to Stoppiello, the choreographers were Nan Friedman, Irene 
Feigenheimer and Christine Sang, who worked to music, respectively, by Mark 
Coniglio, Rick Ford, Matt Kaplowitz and Rolfe Kent. 
</P>
<P>
 Described as a work in progress, Stoppiello's piece fortunately abandoned its 
obscure dream-state opening, in which the choreographer moved furniture props 
around as MaryHunter Ellegood and Robin Ziemer engaged in slow-motion balances 
and other acrobatic combinations, to shift to interesting movement variation 
tasks, all to Coniglio's atmospheric music. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman's "Trace" relied almost entirely upon movement resources to exploit 
supportive and antagonistic partnering. It was danced to Ford's moody sound 
washes, however, without much differentiating force among the various push-pull 
elements by Scot Hendricks and Linda Lehovec (replacing the injured Friedman). 
</P>
<P>
 Bambi Anderson appeared with Feigenheimer in her "Rewind, Refocus -- Shift," 
whose abstract follow-the-leader movement ideas could scarcely support 
intimations of relationship and memory between two women. Kaplowitz wrote an 
appealing chamber score, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Sang's solo, " 'Flaming June': A Woman Stuck in a Painting," remained utterly 
obscure as the choreographer's self-absorbed movement demands delineated the 
character in a virtually autistic state. Kent created a suitably episodic and 
uninvolving score. CHRIS PASLES
