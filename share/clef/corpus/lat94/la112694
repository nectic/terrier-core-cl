CLINICS SEE FEWER PATIENTS AFTER PROP. 187; HEALTH: OFFICIALS AT O.C. 
FACILITIES SAY FEAR CONTINUES TO KEEP PATIENTS AWAY. MANY AREN'T AWARE THAT 
ENFORCEMENT IS ON HOLD.

 Physicians at the East Los Angeles clinic became concerned when Lilian Morales 
uncharacteristically missed an examination for precancerous lesions on her 
uterus. Reaching her by telephone at home, health workers soon ascertained what 
had happened: Morales, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, feared she would be 
reported to immigration authorities. So she stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to convince her to come in," said Dr. Rene Sanchez, a staff physician 
at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles, a nonprofit facility 
that serves a largely immigrant clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario, although not universal, has become familiar in some largely 
immigrant communities, many health providers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the passage of Proposition 187, according to administrators at many 
clinics, many fearful immigrants such as Morales have skipped appointments for 
routine examinations, both for themselves and their children -- the latter 
often U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, visits to some clinics serving immigrants took a dramatic 
dive after passage of the proposition and in some communities, health officials 
said, fear continues to keep patients away. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, officials said patients now are showing up in steady numbers 
-- thanks largely to the educational efforts of the Latino media. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing from the community is that the word is getting out" that 
Proposition 187 is not being enforced, said Russ Inglish, executive director of 
Orange County's Coalition of Community Clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if (patient visits) have reached previous levels," Inglish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Hughes-Lopez, executive director of the South Orange County Community 
Clinic in San Juan Capistrano, where about 60% of the patients are Latino, said 
the initial decline in patients has leveled off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been no further decrease," she said. "I think the Spanish (media), 
which I watch every night, does a good job of enforcing the positive message." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hughes-Lopez said, many patients ask warily upon coming in whether they 
need documentation of their legal status to obtain treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had many, many inquiries," she said. "They literally walk up to the 
person in the window and say, 'Am I going to be asked for papers?' " 
</P>
<P>
 When patients have been seen before at the clinic, they generally are more 
trusting and will risk an inquiry, she said. But the clinic official said she 
is concerned about people who are not plugged into the medical system and feel 
they have no one to ask.  
</P>
<P>
 In some quarters, physicians and health officials said the fear of being 
reported under Proposition 187 still is keeping undocumented patients from 
seeking basic care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our clinic is having a high incidence of no-shows" said Jean Forbath, who 
sits on the board of Share Our Selves, a Costa Mesa clinic. "I think that 
people are afraid to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Forbath said the clinic's staff, which typically sees 30 patients daily, 
recently had 14 no-shows in one day. The usual number is four or five, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The illegal Hispanic community is afraid," said Dr. Fernando Montelongo, a 
general practitioner in Orange and president of the California Hispanic Group, 
a group of board-certified doctors. "The rumors are out there that they are 
going to be deported." 
</P>
<P>
 OrNda HealthCorp, an organization that owns about a dozen Southern California 
hospitals, sent out a news release Monday saying many Latino patients are 
shying away from medical attention for themselves and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had calls including those from women whose babies are suffering 
extremely high temperatures or have been injured, and they are afraid to visit 
the hospital because they believe they will be reported," Roseann Gonzalez, the 
company's Latino community liaison for Orange County, is quoted as saying. "We 
are trying to communicate that they have nothing to fear. It is not our 
position to police our patients." 
</P>
<P>
 OrNda hospitals include Chapman General in Orange, Coastal Communities in 
Santa Ana, Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, Doctors Hospital of Santa Ana, 
Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center and Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and 
Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 Failure to identify and treat diseases at an early stage "could be a public 
health hazard," said Dr. Juan Ruiz of the Clinica Oscar Romero near downtown 
Los Angeles. "Disease could be really advanced if people wait until the last 
minute to come to us. That could put the entire community at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 In the insular neighborhoods where many recent immigrants live, word has often 
not filtered down that court challenges have blocked implementation of 
Proposition 187 -- which, among other things, would deny non-emergency public 
health care to illegal immigrants and require that providers turn in those 
suspected of being undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know exactly what's going on and they're being scared away," 
said Ruiz, chairman of the board of Clinica Oscar Romero, which serves a large 
Central American population in the Pico-Union neighborhood. "As a physician, it 
really concerns me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital outpatient clinics and nonprofit community facilities -- often 
favored by an undocumented population that is leery of contacts with government 
-- have reported a steady 10% to 20% decline in patient visits during the last 
two weeks, according to the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few people understand what a temporary restraining order is, and what 
they've heard is that the overwhelming majority of Californians voted to turn 
(undocumented) people in," said David Langness, vice president of the council, 
which represents 250 health-care facilities across Southern California. "That 
frightens many folks and keeps them away from health care." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some Los Angeles clinics, such as the South-Central Family Health 
Center, have continued operating at capacity since Proposition 187 was 
approved. "We're not turning anyone away these days, but we are keeping 
ourselves busy," said Sue Scott, director of the South-Central center. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles County health facilities -- probably the nation's largest care 
providers for illegal immigrants -- there is no definitive indication that 
residents are avoiding health care facilities in large numbers. Anecdotal 
reports that prenatal visits or immunization rates dropped at some county 
facilities after Proposition 187's passage do not necessarily signal a trend, 
officials caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been nothing that has popped up and smacked us against the face," 
said Toby Staheli, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, which operates six hospitals, six comprehensive health centers 
and 39 public health centers. "It's just too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at some inner-city private clinics, workers have been busily attempting to 
contact missing patients and otherwise let residents know that nothing has 
changed for illegal immigrants, pending resolution of a court case in Los 
Angeles concerning the legality of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that there has been an impact, but it varies from clinic to 
clinic," said Yolanda Vera, a staff attorney in the Los Angeles office of the 
National Health Law Program, a legal services support center that works on 
health issues. "There's a lot of confusion out there, and there are people who 
are fearful of coming in, whether for clinic appointments or for treatments of 
something that may become an emergency down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that Proposition 187 may be having an effect was publicly 
spotlighted in the last week when 12-year-old Julio Cano of Anaheim died. His 
parents said they had avoided taking him to a hospital because they feared 
being asked about their immigration status. Both parents are illegal immigrants 
from Mexico, as was the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said Julio had acute leukemia, a childhood cancer that can 
lead to aggressive infections and cause death in a matter of months or even 
weeks. But whether Julio's life might have been saved by an earlier diagnosis 
of acute leukemia remains uncertain, medical experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of hospitals and clinics in California receive some public 
funding, meaning virtually all state health facilities would be required under 
the dictates of Proposition 187 to deny services to anyone who could not 
demonstrate lawful immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the requirement could jeopardize the existence of some private 
clinics, particularly those serving poor immigrant communities. This may be one 
reason, according to Proposition 187 advocates, that clinic operators have been 
so vociferous in pointing out the early impacts of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Follow the money," said Barbara Coe, a founding member of the Proposition 187 
movement. "Of course, they don't want to lose patients -- that's why we've been 
attacked so viciously -- it's a threat to their coffers." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187's opponents -- who included most professional medical 
associations -- have long warned that implementation of the wide-ranging 
measure could result in a sharp decline in preventive care and a consequent 
rise in emergency room cases and preventable deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Many physicians also cited the potential for epidemics, as immigrants would 
likely avoid immunizations, screening and treatment for tuberculosis (still 
widespread in many immigrants' homelands) and treatment for sexually 
transmitted ailments and other infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest concern is that we're going to see a drop-off in things that 
aren't emergencies," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of public health disease 
control programs for Los Angeles County. "Immunizations are preventive, and 
most people will put them off with the slightest excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments after approval of Proposition 187, however, Gov. Pete Wilson 
pointedly sought to quell the fears of a health disaster and made clear his 
intention to continue providing everyone -- regardless of immigration status -- 
with government-funded services considered essential to public health, 
presumably immunizations and contagious disease screening and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such a policy would seem to violate the intentions of Proposition 
187's framers, Wilson has indicated that his obligation to protect 
Californians' health is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his executive order after passage of Proposition 187, Wilson 
directed officials of the Department of Health Services to issue emergency 
regulations "which provide for the continued availability at all levels of 
government, independent of citizenship or immigration status, of such public 
health services as they deem necessary to protect the general public from 
threats to the public health." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all is on hold pending the resolution of the court challenges. But the 
sense of worry is evident at many clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Prenatal examinations at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles 
have dropped about 60% since just before the election, administrators say. 
Immunizations against infectious childhood diseases such as measles, polio and 
diphtheria have nose-dived more sharply. Clinic physicians administered 72 
immunizations during the first 15 days of November, compared to a normal rate 
of 400 child immunizations for that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's directly tied to the fear of Proposition 187," said Rodolfo Diaz, 
executive director at the federal- and state-funded facility, which logs about 
150,000 patient visits annually. "The undocumented parents, the parents of 
mixed undocumented and resident families, are not bringing their kids in. 
People are fearful. They think we're going to start reporting them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Clinica Oscar Romero in Pico-Union, patient visits declined more than 
50% during the first five days after the election, Ruiz said. Activity has 
since rebounded to about 70% of the pre-election clientele, he added, thanks to 
an aggressive advertising and outreach campaign notifying residents that no one 
would be denied services or turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clinics in Ventura County have also reported a dip in client visits, with 
the Clinica Vista seeing half its normal patient load, according to Dr. Chris 
Landon, who runs the prenatal facility Clinica Vista in the city of Ventura. 
Landon attributes the decline at least partially to concerns over Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley on a recent weeknight, the normally bustling Free Clinic was 
empty. "I don't know why no one is here, but I fear it is because of Prop. 
187," said FredBauermeister, director of the clinic, which provides medical 
care to about 4,700 clients. Alarmed at the decline of patients at some 
inner-city health facilities, a new coalition of organizations that opposed 
Proposition 187 plans to tape public service announcements in Spanish and 
English next week to advise illegal immigrants to continue seeking health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The message "will be especially targeted to pregnant mothers -- we'll tell 
them to continue to seek prenatal care," said Langness, whose organization is 
co-sponsoring the announcements along with the Hollywood Women's Policy Center, 
Asian-Pacific Planning Council, Community Clinics Assn. and the Los Angeles 
Unified Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop-off in immigrant patients is more notable in urban clinics than at 
rural sites, said Arnoldo Torres, a Sacramento-based policy consultant who 
represents 15 nonprofit clinics statewide. In rural facilities, Torres said, 
workers cited no significant decline in patient visits since the passage of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have as much media attention in the rural communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, no definitive statistics are available on November patient 
levels. However, some initial data and anecdotal evidence indicates a drop-off 
in some segments of the massive government-operated system. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparing election week of 1994 with the same week during 1993, 
administrators found that prenatal visits systemwide were down 4.2%. However, 
officials cautioned that such a decline did not necessarily indicate a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 At the El Monte Comprehensive Health Center, which provides everything from 
dental services to prenatal checkups, a sharp reduction has occurred in 
immunizations administered since October, according to Edis Callejas, who 
manages the immunization clinic.

 FRISKY HOLIDAY: If hearing some dog lovers refer to Christmas as "Santa Paws" 
days makes you cringe, try this one: The Irvine Animal Care Center has a deal 
Saturday, Dec. 3. For $10, you can have your dog's picture taken with Santa 
Claus at 92 Corporate Park Plaza in Irvine -- a remembrance your dog can enjoy 
for years to come. . . . It's for a cause: The money goes to help care for the 
animals housed at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 BALANCING ACT: For years you've heard politicians debating a "balanced 
budget." Here's an Orange County group that plans to do something about it -- 
even though it won't count. The Concord Coalition, a nonprofit citizens group 
begging for a balanced federal budget, holds its own little congress in Irvine 
on Jan. 7, 1995, called Debtbuster 2000. The idea is to put together a 
five-year balanced budget plan. . . . It has no effect, of course, but, says a 
spokesman, they'll pass it along gratis to the real Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE JULIUS: Quick, without looking at the picture above, name the most 
famous doctor in America. Yes, some would say Doctor J -- Julius Erving -- the 
11-time NBA All-Star who's now a businessman and TV commentator. . . . Erving's 
popularity is high seven years after retirement: Cal State Fullerton this week 
announced that Erving will be keynote speaker in April at its annual auction to 
raise money for athletics at the university and Fullerton city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 PRIVATE EYES ONLY? Would it raise an eyebrow if you walked into your local 
City Council meeting and saw everyone watching adult movies? That's what a 
group in Orange wanted their council members to do this week, to accent how 
upset they are that Cablevision isn't able to control inadvertent showing of 
the Playboy Channel on their home screens. . . . Council members decided 
against a public screening -- but each agreed to take a tape home for private 
viewing. Warns Councilman Fred L. Barrera: "We haven't heard yet from the guys 
who want that channel."

SHOPPERS SWARM AFTER BARGAINS; BUSINESS: THE AMPLE SIZE OF CROWDS IN O.C. 
OUTPACES SPENDING ON TRADITIONAL FIRST DAY OF HOLIDAY RETAIL SEASON. SALES 
TOTALS APPEAR TO BE UP SLIGHTLY AS BARGAIN HUNTERS, DISCOUNTS HOLD SWAY.

 Lilliam Lee started her holiday shopping before sunrise Friday, driving to 
Irvine to get a coveted admission ticket to this weekend's annual St. John 
Knits half-price sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee then hurried to Newport Beach's Fashion Island to queue up with hundreds 
of other bargain seekers waiting for I. Magnin's 9 a.m. liquidation sale. At 
9:30, as others were still in line out front, Lee was heading home to 
Huntington Beach with a pair of casual suits in hand. "They were marked down, 
with the 20% off, to about $140," Lee said. "You can't do better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by discounts, prizes and other promotions, consumers marched on the 
nation's shopping malls in large numbers Friday for the start of the holiday 
shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Orange County, retailers sounded an optimistic note. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been busier this morning than ever before," said Angel Holt, manager of 
the Clothes Minded store in Laguna Beach. "A lot of people are shopping for 
themselves. A lot of button-down tops and sweaters are going like mad. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in general are feeling real good about the prospects for '95." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Cherbak, a retail industry analyst in Costa Mesa for national 
accounting firm Deloitte & Touche: "Today is pretty much up to expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 There were similar reports from across the nation. Traffic in downtown Chicago 
was heavy, parking lots were full, and the shoppers wall-to-wall at Marshall 
Fields, but they described themselves as bargain-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday retail sales are expected to be especially strong in the East, and the 
season appears to be off to a rousing start in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, crowds were widespread at the Aventura Mall, one of the area's 
largest shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far today, it's busier than expected," said Jennifer Toro, a sales 
assistant at the mall's Macy's store. "People were waiting outside at 7:30 a.m. 
when I came in to work. Sales this year are much better than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout was also impressive at the flagship Macy's store on 34th Street in 
Manhattan. "I can tell you that it's been packed all day since the store opened 
at eight," said Macy spokeswoman Patti Schrickram. "There were people waiting 
at the doors, throngs of shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing trend in New York, however, was similar to that elsewhere. 
Although the crowds were large, many weren't buying. The lines to see Macy's 
famed Santa, Santaland and the Puppet Theatre were sometimes longer than many 
of the cash register lines combined. 
</P>
<P>
 While turnouts were heavy nationwide, actual sales appeared to be up only 
slightly over last year's -- and much of that business was generated by 
bargain-hunters. Indeed, there was a shopping frenzy in Newport Beach at I. 
Magnin's Fashion Island store, where Pinkerton guards stood watch over long 
lines of both devotees and first-time shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after Thanksgiving isn't my idea of a good time," said Carole 
Neustadt, an Aliso Viejo resident and a longtime I. Magnin shopper. "I'm only 
here because they're closing and having a sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers said they plan to spend more money this holiday season than 
last, confirming recent surveys that found rising consumer confidence. Others, 
however, said they will make their purchases later in the season to take 
advantage of any additional discounting. Shoppers also said they will keep the 
fragile economy in mind as they reach for their purses and wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim residents Edmundo and Leticia Medina shopped at Mervyn's in the newly 
renovated Anaheim Plaza for clothing and toys for friends and relatives. But 
they also bought warm clothes for themselves for an upcoming holiday visit to 
the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medinas said they paid for both the shopping spree and their upcoming 
vacation with savings amassed earlier in the year when he feared losing his 
job. But the likelihood of a layoff dissipated in recent months, so the Medinas 
are springing for snow gear and heading for the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shopper, Alicia Lopez, said she is unemployed at the moment but has 
enough confidence in the economy that she's willing to spend money on Christmas 
presents for her 12 grandchildren. Lopez, a 59-year-old Anaheim resident, saved 
for the holidays earlier in the year while working in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I will have a problem getting a new job after New Year's," 
Lopez said. "So it's OK to spend some of my savings now. . . . I don't have 
much of the green stuff, but they are all going to get some clothes because 
that is what they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Some were willing to spend more heavily if the price was right. Darlene Mims 
of Los Angeles shopped for a dollhouse for her daughter and found the best 
price at Toys R Us in Culver City. She ended up buying three -- sets 
representing Latinos, Anglos and African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Discounts were definitely on shoppers' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Target store in North Hollywood, for example, about 800 people lined up 
before the store opened to take advantage of sales and a promotion -- a free 
"Holiday Survival Package" that included coupons, shampoo, lotion, snacks and 
antacids. The package was offered to the first 1,000 customers at each Target 
store nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Orange County Marketplace in Costa Mesa, the parking lot began to 
fill shortly after 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look down the aisles, and it's pretty packed," said Operations Manager Ed 
Beddoes as he surveyed the early morning traffic jam. "People are out here 
looking for the bargains. There's some stuff you just can't get in the malls." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos resident Judy Giles, 46, an administrative assistant for a Long 
Beach-based company, was at the Marketplace to shop for her daughter, 
Stephanie. "I paid $75 for a pair of Ugg boots here," Giles said. The after-ski 
fur-lined footwear, she said, cost $125 at department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketplace shopper Peggy Alcantar, 50, of Laguna Hills said she's prepared to 
spend "a couple of thousand" on Christmas presents -- but only if the price is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was bad," Alcantar said. "But the economy seems to be bubbling a 
little more this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove resident Eloise Hicks, 56, said she is buying clothing and a few 
toys for her three grandchildren, despite the fact that she has taken a buyout 
offer and will leave Northrop Corp. on Dec. 22. "They gave me a golden 
handshake, and it was too good to resist," Hicks said. "Next year is going to 
be a lot less good to the grandchildren unless I find something again right 
away in aerospace." 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of bargains was especially evident at I. Magnin, the 118-year-old 
department store chain that began a liquidation sale on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers were eager to get a good deal, even if they didn't know what was 
for sale. One first-time shopper asked passers-by if I. Magnin carries 
menswear. "My boyfriend will kill me ," the woman said, "if we wait in this 
line and they don't have men's clothing." 
</P>
<P>
 At the I. Magnin in Newport Beach, hundreds of people gathered early in the 
mistaken belief that the sale would begin at 8 a.m. Tempers flared when store 
personnel said that doors would remain locked until 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the bargain hunters stayed anyway, and a lengthy line snaked 
through the outdoor shopping center all day as shoppers waited their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin wasn't alone in using advertised sales to draw business. Shop 
windows across the region heralded promises of 25%, 30% and 50% off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retailers are doing what they have to do to get people using their plastic 
and spending their cash," analyst Cherbak said. "You see a lot of promotional 
items, free gifts with purchase and lots of sales." 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte & Touche surveyed about 175 shoppers at a dozen Southland malls on 
Friday to identify buying trends. The accounting firm said it found that 
department stores offering more expensive clothing had difficulty drawing 
buyers. After years of weak clothing sales in Southern California, however, 
survey respondents on Friday expressed a strong interest in apparel -- a sign, 
analysts said, that shoppers want good garments but at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm buying clothing for my kids," said Deena Goucher, a Moreno Valley 
resident who shopped at Anaheim Plaza on Friday. "It's going to be a small 
Christmas, and the gifts will be practical, like clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday shoppers also were out in force at Knott's Berry Farm. The day after 
Thanksgiving is the only time that the Buena Park attraction sells more retail 
admissions than theme park tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina residents Cindy Martin and Sherri Jackson took their daughters -- but 
left husbands and sons at home -- when they headed off to search for 
knickknacks at the park's dozens of retail shops. "You can tell we're hard-core 
shoppers," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Martin and Jackson said they aren't spending too freely, though, because 
friends and family members are either out of work or facing the possibility of 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband works at Long Beach Naval Shipyard, and it's supposed to go back 
on the base closure list again in 1995," Jackson said. "We're going to have 
that threat hanging over us again."

O.C. ECONOMIC RECOVERY SPURRED BY GROWING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; OPTIMISM: WITH 
EMPLOYMENT INCREASING AT LAST AND HOME SALES SURGING, THE OUTLOOK HAS 
BRIGHTENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County consumers are the most confident they've been in four years. 
Home sales have surged, even in the face of rising interest rates. And this 
week the county got perhaps the best news of all: After four years of decline, 
employment in Orange County is climbing again. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers and businesses are beginning to feel that they are on solid ground 
again, and analysts sense that Orange County's recovery, though plodding up to 
now, is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 That is benefiting people such as Edith Dodd of Anaheim Hills. Dodd, 59, 
retired two years ago from Rockwell International, but last month the former 
engineer decided to re-enter the labor force to pay for live-in nursing care 
for her mother in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd had success immediately, landing one of the 700 jobs offered by the new 
Super Kmart store in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County retailers, brimming with optimism for strong holiday 
sales, are adding jobs as well as boosting orders for goods, and that will help 
maintain the economy's momentum. Retailers said they got off to quick start 
Friday, when shoppers flocked to stores for the start of the Christmas shopping 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in general are feeling real good about the prospects for '95," said 
Tony Cherbak, a retail industry analyst at accounting firm Deloitte & Touche, 
who spent Friday surveying retailers and shoppers in Orange County. "Retailers 
in Orange County are upbeat. . . . It's going to be a great Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers' optimism is reflected in their willingness to make major purchases 
too. D.J. and Julieann Martin last month bought their first home -- a spacious 
four-bedroom house in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's back to normal. Things are turning around," said Julieann Martin, a 
customer service manager at the National Education Center in Irvine. Her 
employer had layoffs in the summer, but Martin says she now feels secure in her 
job. And her husband, a fleet and truck manager at a Chevrolet dealership, is 
on track to make 20% more this year. "I just think we're moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that Orange County has lost almost 50,000 jobs since the recession 
in mid-1990, the area still has far to go before it is restored to the luster 
of the previous decade. Not until 1996, economists say, will the county return 
to pre-recession job levels. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pains of layoffs aren't over. The shutdown of Hughes Aircraft's 
complex in Fullerton next year will put as many as 1,000 workers on the streets 
and remove another 5,000 jobs from the county. There is also lingering weakness 
in the computer industry and banking and finance, where consolidations are 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those factors, plus the fact that the recovery hasn't shared its benefits 
equally, has left many skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it," plumber Joseph Gallegos said of the heralded economic 
upswing. Gallegos, 26, said he had to postpone his wedding because he has not 
had steady work. "For me, it's been real slow," he said this week, sitting in 
the plumbers union hall in Santa Ana, hoping to be called out on an assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegos' union leader, Ted Reed, says the work overall for his membership 
remains slow. But Reed said he is hopeful about 1995: "People we know say 
there's a lot of possibilities for jobs next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The work of plumbers, carpenters and others in construction should pick up as 
the housing market continues its recovery -- and there are clear signs of that 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent reports show home sales in Orange County are up 22% for the first 10 
months of 1994 compared to the same period last year. And the momentum seems to 
be building, real estate executives and bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
 At Downey Savings & Loan in Newport Beach, President Stephen W. Prough said he 
has had back-to-back monthly records in funding loans. And 70% of those have 
been for home purchases, a very good sign, Prough said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's retail real estate climate has improved as well, with a surge in 
development of theaters, restaurants and bookstores. Work began recently on 
what will be one of America's largest movie complexes, a 21-screen Edwards 
Theater in the Irvine Spectrum business park. And major retailers such as 
Wal-Mart stores are moving into new facilities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the first year of a sustained recovery in real estate," said Walter 
Hahn, an economic specialist at Kenneth Leventhal & Co., an accounting firm in 
Newport Beach. "This recovery is going to continue to build on itself until the 
next national recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoddy and Kelly Fritz waited for a year before they plowed their savings last 
month into a $186,000 house in Aliso Viejo. "It's a dream for us," said Hoddy 
Fritz, who works at Union Bank in Irvine. Fritz, 28, believes the housing 
market is headed for growth. "We feel over the five-year period that it's a 
pretty good investment," he said of their three-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence appears to be spreading among corporations as well. And as that 
happens, workers will see more full-time jobs added to the large numbers of 
part-time and temporary employees that companies have hired in recent months -- 
a trend that is common in the early stages of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Employers still are not certain of the economy in the long run and are 
relying on temporary workers," said Sue Foigleman, manager for Manpower 
Employment Services in Orange County. But in a positive sign, temporary-help 
firms say more businesses are converting temporary jobs into permanent ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Orange County, which plunged to 5.1% in October, now stands at 
its lowest level in three years. More significantly, state figures released 
this week showed that October marked the second consecutive month of 
year-to-year job increases -- which had not been seen since the onset of the 
recession. Job gains were recorded in services, construction and non-durable 
manufacturing, particularly in apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big news is that real employment is up," said Robert Barnum, president of 
American Savings Bank in Irvine. Local workers "may not be getting high-paying 
aerospace jobs -- they may be in retail -- but they're getting jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 That sums up the sentiments of Greg Arlotta as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlotta, who lives in Laguna Niguel, was laid off a year ago when Topa Thrift 
and Loan closed its El Toro office. Arlotta had 10 years' experience in 
banking, mainly making large fund acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlotta recently found work at the Wine Exchange in Orange, where he does 
everything from tasting wine to hauling crates around. "I'm certainly not 
making what I was making," he said. But "I like what I do. I was a wine nut. I 
used to buy wine here." 
</P>
<P>
 From his view, Arlotta said, "I think the economy is slowly improving."

COLOMBIA REBELS WELCOME PLAN FOR PEACE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN AMBRUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cautious optimism swept Colombia on Friday as leaders of as many as 12,000 
Marxist rebels unexpectedly embraced a peace proposal unveiled by President 
Ernesto Samper's 3-month-old government. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said a first round of talks could begin in February or March aimed 
at ending South America's oldest war. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opportunity could well be the last in many years to put an end in a 
peaceful and honorable way to the fratricidal struggle that has done so much 
harm to Colombia," Atty. Gen. Orlando Vasquez said as he offered to serve as a 
mediator in future talks. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman in Mexico for the largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, said the organization welcomed the government's 
peace initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian governments have been at war for 30 years with the FARC, the 
National Liberation Army, or ELN, and other smaller groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Every government in the last decade has tried and failed to make peace with 
the rebels. Officials said the reason for optimism now lies in Samper's 
decision to take an approach that is radically different from previous 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 In outlining his proposal, Samper said he will negotiate before a cease-fire 
is established. And, in a departure from the last government's austere 
free-market economic policies, Samper is emphasizing land redistribution and a 
large spending program for housing, health and education. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Samper vowed to rein in human rights violations by the military 
and right-wing paramilitary squads that have been blamed for hundreds of 
political killings in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process that we will begin to prepare is directed at bringing a 
conclusive end to the war," Samper said in his peace proposal speech in Cauca, 
one of Colombia's most conflict-ridden states. "Colombians should be warned 
that while the peace process lasts, acts of violence will continue to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The previous administration of President Cesar Gaviria signed agreements with 
three rebel organizations, encompassing more than 3,000 guerrillas, and 
convoked a constitutional assembly to address political participation and other 
issues raised by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gaviria's attempts at reconciliation with the two largest groups broke 
down over cease-fire violations. After a failed round of talks in Mexico in 
1992, warfare resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gaviria's neo-liberal policies, which critics said deepened poverty for 
millions of Colombians, the Samper government is emphasizing social investment 
that appeals to the guerrilla groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to increased spending on social programs, the new government is 
committed to distributing more than 1 million hectares of land to poor farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Given their growing sense of international isolation in an increasingly 
non-Communist world, the guerrillas may now be willing to settle for an 
expansion of these policies rather than an all-out socialist solution, analysts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 A tougher stand on human rights abuses is also directed at gaining the 
guerrillas' trust. 
</P>
<P>
 FARC formed a legal political party, the Union Patriotica, during a truce in 
the mid-1980s, only to watch hundreds of its members assassinated by death 
squads in subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper has said he is placing human rights offices in all military garrisons 
and is pushing through Congress approval of the Second Geneva Protocol on 
treatment of civilians, prisoners and wounded in time of war. 
</P>
<P>
 He is considering asking the Red Cross to verify whether human rights are 
being respected in regions of conflict and has asked the guerrillas for a 
similar commitment to international conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Samper government has accepted that there is a very real problem with 
human rights and has made an important political decision to eradicate those 
violations," said Daniel Garcia Pena, a member of the government's peace 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "That and a unilateral commitment to crack down on paramilitary groups as part 
of a larger policy on private security groups and gun control are indications 
to the guerrillas that the government is speaking seriously to their concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no guarantee that the guerrillas will follow through with the peace 
process in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 FARC runs a profitable business in cocaine and heroin smuggling, and ELN is 
heavily involved in the businesses of kidnaping and extortion, especially 
against the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that guerrillas legally re-entering society could not necessarily 
expect to live as well as they have illegally, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But with significant increases in terrorist acts, kidnaping and theft this 
year, the Samper government seems desperate for a global solution to its 
criminal problem. It is trying to work out political arrangements for 
guerrillas and judicial ones for drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's largest business associations have also been receptive, offering 
to set up a fund to help the guerrillas return to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that degree of flexibility from key elements of Colombian society, the 
guerrillas may now have a unique window of opportunity they cannot afford to 
pass up, analysts said.

NEW EAST EUROPE RETAILERS TOLD TO PUT ON A HAPPY FACE; COMMERCE: WESTERN

 It was 7:45 a.m. -- 15 minutes before opening -- when the salesclerks at Kmart 
congregated in the menswear department for their daily dose of religion, 
free-market style. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen women in bright red smocks gathered around a bargain bin of flashy 
neckties, their hands clasped reverently as a supervisor preached from the 
store's Ten Commandments of Good Sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The capitalist lesson for today: Smile even if you feel lousy. Dress up even 
if you prefer jeans. Oblige customers even if they treat you rudely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look in the mirror every morning and make sure the impression you give is a 
good one," boss Hana Pekarova said sternly. "You are making money for the whole 
store." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a familiar exhortation -- every morning begins with such recitations. 
But it was one that still invoked blank stares and painful winces among the 
unknowing and disbelieving. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers scream even when it is not my fault! one clerk confided. A customer 
threatened to never shop here if I didn't stop bothering her, another grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer service -- that groveling prescript of capitalism that has brought 
the Free World 30-minute pizza delivery, mufflers with a lifetime warranty and 
dentists who send birthday cards -- has been a hard sell in the former 
Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years of free enterprise have stocked shops from Warsaw to Zagreb, 
Croatia, with consumer goods like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 But converting the souls behind the counter has proved a more deviling 
pursuit. The notion of pampering the customer is so incongruous in former East 
Bloc countries that customer service has no linguistic equivalent in most 
languages, forcing exasperated tongue-tied employers to resort to English. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no miraculous place where you can send employees and have them come 
back as different people," said Imrich Gombar, director of human resources for 
Kmart in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, where the company has taken over 13 
state-owned department stores. "We had to change the whole environment, from 
the management structure to the training process." 
</P>
<P>
 Unsuspecting companies, frantic to capture the nascent market after the fall 
of communism, put virtually anyone on the sales floor, only to discover their 
front-line converts were unrepentant disciples of a system in which the 
"customer is always right" maxim had been turned on its head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because, under communism, everything from toilet paper to bicycles was in 
short supply, it settled in the psychology of people that those behind the 
counter were in a superior position," said sociologist Jaroslava Stastna of the 
Central European University. "It created a distorted relationship with the 
customer." 
</P>
<P>
 At the highbrow, British-owned Hotel Bristol in Warsaw, the management 
interviewed 4,000 people before they found 290 who were considered suited for 
the hotel's doting customer-service program, so exacting it tallies pillow 
preferences (foam or feather) on a computer log of guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of those who made the cut have since quit, many in search of less taxing 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its demands, the Bristol requires employees to bathe daily, wear 
deodorant, refrain from eating garlic and spicy foods, keep a toothbrush and 
toothpaste on hand, avoid nail biting, wear only clear nail polish and keep 
fingers out of mouths, ears and noses. Their hair must also be washed daily and 
be kept "restrained" in color and style. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Bristol employees are expected "to be happy and friendly," said 
Ingrid Eras, the hotel's personnel and training manager, who rejects 20 
candidates for every job that opens. Some applicants are turned away at the 
door, advised to return only after getting a haircut and fresh clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discipline we require has been the hardest part for most people," Eras 
said. "It is not easy telling people to completely change their thinking and 
personal habits, that what they have been doing for the past 15 or 20 years is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Eras' successes is sales director Agnieszka Jasinska, who started two 
years ago as a bleach-blonde clerk with bright red nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasinska said her family was shocked when she cut her hair, threw away the 
bleach, stripped the nail polish, bought pin-striped suits and toiled without 
complaint for 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a very different person today," said Jasinska, now a natural brunette. 
"I had colleagues who couldn't take the pressure, especially the demanding 
guests. It took a long time. But I now realize it doesn't matter to guests if I 
have problems at home; they still expect the same service." 
</P>
<P>
 Putting on a happy face has been one of the least popular and most ridiculed 
notions of customer service in the former Communist world, where service with a 
sneer was long considered a badge of honor and duplicity was tolerated but 
despised. 
</P>
<P>
 Under communism, restaurants and shops often kept registers in which 
dissatisfied customers were to lodge complaints. But waiters and salesclerks 
were so ornery and intimidating that most customers didn't dare pencil an 
entry. Even if they did, the scribblings were usually ignored or the 
complainers unceremoniously shown the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being nice is forced under capitalism, just like being rude was under 
socialism," said Polish satirist Jacek Fedorowicz in a popular radio broadcast 
chronicling changes in Poland. "A human being does only what it pays him to do, 
and under capitalism it pays to be nice and smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Grazyna Lobaszewska, a training consultant for McDonald's restaurants, said 
Central and Eastern Europeans are perplexed by Western expectations that 
unhappy emotions be put aside until after work. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's, for example, insists that Polish employees smile when they are in 
contact with customers, a requirement that strikes many as artificial, 
insincere -- even sinister. "If he is smiling, I am sure he is laughing at me," 
Fedorowicz said of the counter help, echoing a commonly held fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the fast-food giant installed showers in its 17 Polish restaurants 
to address "the delicate issue" of spotty personal hygiene, McDonald's has 
urged managers to delve into the personal problems of employees and juggle work 
assignments accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers preoccupied with an illness at home, for example, are assigned to the 
kitchen instead of the food counter so their worries are not taken out on 
customers. Customer service does not have to translate into cultural 
insensitivity, Lobaszewska said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not unusual for someone in the United States who has a big problem at 
home to say, 'Fine, thanks,' when asked at work how he is doing," she said. 
"Our tradition is different. When you have something on your heart, you don't 
hide it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even sensitive employers, however, have occasionally resorted to grand schemes 
to shake up the staff and demonstrate how seriously they take the new vaulted 
status of the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kmart, Gombar yanked the door frame from the Prague general manager's 
fifth-floor office and deposited it on the ground floor, the store's busiest 
retail area. The message: Under capitalism, sales work is just as valued as 
traditionally esteemed managerial tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 The store also astonished its clerks when it required them to wear name tags 
proclaiming, "I am here for you." The clerks balked, insisting the tags be 
revised to say, " We are here for you," a concept more in line with 
Communist-era practices, when lazy salespeople would snarl at advancing 
customers, then sit back and enjoy the anonymity of their numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart refused to change the tags and has since made some clerks squirm further 
by introducing another threatening nicety: an American-style pin saying, 
"T.L.C. (Think Like Customers). Ask Me What It Means." 
</P>
<P>
 To motivate the staff, the company is rewarding its cheeriest clerks with 20% 
monthly bonuses, determined in part by an undercover team of customers that 
completes a 17-question survey after snooping around the store. "You cannot 
build an American system here, but we can get as close as possible," Gombar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Delta Air Lines, the largest American carrier with routes in the former 
East Bloc, role models were deemed the best way to introduce new employees to 
the Delta way of business. An army of Delta employees from the United States 
and Western Europe were deployed for "side-by-side" training with counterparts 
in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 New employees are also flown to corporate headquarters in Atlanta for a 
down-home lesson in customer hospitality, which includes a frank discussion 
about the bottom line: Nine in 10 dissatisfied customers don't complain; they 
simply don't come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peer pressure is one of the best ways to change behavior," said Anna Van 
Exel, assistant manager for customer service training. "If the acceptable thing 
is to provide good customer service, then it creates a good environment for the 
others." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the guards at Prague Castle, residence of Czech President Vaclav Havel 
and one of the most popular tourist attractions in this tourist-crazed capital, 
are working on their people skills. Now sporting designer uniforms (a gift to 
Havel from Hollywood costumer Theodor Pistek), a handful of guards have 
enrolled in Dale Carnegie self-improvement courses. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent evening session, the guards joined an Avon lady, a doctor, a 
soldier, a yellow-pages salesman, a computer programmer, two college students 
and a dozen others hoping their $1,000 investment will help make friends and 
influence enemies -- and maybe advance them in the ranks along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 School President Temi B. Miller said the course teaches that "a true smile 
comes from within" and that through self-discovery it is possible to reverse 
the bad habits of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Castle guard Martin Bernasek, a skeptic who was sent by his commander to a 
class in the summer, was so taken by it that he now assists other students. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernasek is still not a big advocate of matter-of-fact smiling. (It degrades 
the value of a real smile, he says.) But he said the Czech Republic would be a 
much happier place if more people enrolled in such courses. It is not only a 
matter of undoing communism, he said, but changing a centuries-old "mind-set of 
subjugation" that dates to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been acting this way for 300 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some companies have shied away from such self-help programs, instead 
crossing their fingers and trusting employees to pick it up on the job. Others 
forked out huge sums for training, only to have employees quickly revert to old 
habits. Many simply barked out new instructions and hoped for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 At the towering Bila Labut department store in Prague, a worn 60-year-old 
shopping center that was recently sold to private owners, a young saleswoman 
was asked why she was smiling at passing customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are supposed to," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A long pause followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why," she said with a puzzled look. 
</P>
<P>
 Did anyone tell you why? 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I wasn't told anything." 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby counter, a scowling senior colleague looked on disapprovingly, 
then buried her name tag beneath her sweater when approached by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Private ownership means saying the wrong thing to the wrong person could get 
you in trouble, she said. "Under communism we would speak to you, but not 
anymore," she grunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the unfriendly clerk disobeyed the directive to deliver service with 
a smile, she had mastered something her grinning counterpart had not. She had 
grasped what training experts say is one of the least understood principles of 
customer service in Eastern Europe: that the behavior of individual employees 
is linked to the prosperity of the business, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lesson repeated day after day at the century-old Prague Secondary 
Commercial School, a vocational center for teen-agers preparing for careers in 
retail sales. Between 10% and 20% of students are dismissed each year because 
they are caught stealing from the shops where they serve as apprentices, making 
honesty second only to courtesy on the school's lesson plan. 
</P>
<P>
 School Principal Jindrich Brtnicky said stealing was common under communism as 
well. But it is taken more seriously now because private shop owners, who 
sponsor students, are unwilling to absorb the losses like state-owned 
enterprises once did. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great problem is both grown-ups and kids still don't feel part of the 
firm where they work," Brtnicky said. "The way of working under the previous 
system is still in each of us. It has left a stain on us that might take a 
generation to remove." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall in a classroom for aspiring retailers, 16-year-old Olga Zaluska 
professed to have solved the problem. When she graduates, she said, she does 
not intend to repeat the mistakes of her mother, a longtime salesclerk who 
seldom smiles at work. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described entrepreneur, Zaluska said she plans to open her own store.

 Murphy was recently on assignment in Prague.

ACCENT IS ON GERMAN IN SOUTH CAROLINA 'BOOM BELT'; DEVELOPMENT: ONCE-SLEEPY 
REGION IS BEACON FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT. BUT SOME FEAR LOSS OF SMALL-TOWN FEEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Paul Foerster moved to Spartanburg in 1967 as an executive with a German 
chemical-products firm, his new home, he says, "met all of the specifications 
of a sleepy little Southern mill town." 
</P>
<P>
 There were few other foreign firms (or foreign-born residents, for that 
matter), and the ones that were here all were in some way related to textiles, 
far and away the dominant industry.  
</P>
<P>
 As seen when driving on the interstate today, past a clutch of fast-food 
joints and chain motels, this unpretentious city of 44,000 still looks like a 
sleepy Southern town. But Spartanburg is now one of the twin capitals of a 
growing metropolitan area that boasts the highest concentration of direct 
foreign investment in the nation, much of it German.  
</P>
<P>
 The influx of dollars and new influences into the Greenville-Spartanburg area 
has wrought astounding social and economic change. "In many ways, Spartanburg 
and Greenville today may be more sophisticated than Atlanta," said Walter B. 
Edgar, director of the University of South Carolina Institute of Southern 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a gross overstatement, as Edgar readily admits a moment later. But for 
their size, the cities are surprisingly cosmopolitan -- a byproduct of the 
infusion of foreign investment and newcomers.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, the area has seen $4.2 billion in capital investment, 
much of it coming from such firms as Hitachi, Michelin and now BMW, which, with 
much fanfare and fireworks, officially opened its first plant outside of 
Germany here last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The transformation from sleepy backwater to international business beacon has 
not been without conflict. The town of Greer, on BMW's doorstep, is one of the 
poorest in the state. But even so, many of its residents were not happy with 
the coming of BMW, fearing that the presence of the corporate giant would 
destroy its small-town flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was in some sectors a lot of resentment that the way of life is going 
to change so drastically over the next few years," said Don Wall, the mayor of 
Greer. "But I think most people realize now that change is inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of change is that Foerster, a German citizen, this year was elected 
chairman of the Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce.  
</P>
<P>
 Another is the increasing presence of European delis and Japanese restaurants 
sprinkled throughout the two larger cities, and the new prominence of foreign 
languages -- including German -- in school and college curricula. The number of 
foreign-born residents is not large -- the new companies only import their top 
managers -- but BMW spokesman and South Carolinian Robert Hitt said nobody 
takes notice anymore when they hear someone speaking German in the supermarket. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious signs of change are in service-industry oriented Greenville 
(population 60,000), where the downtown boasts modern office buildings, a Hyatt 
Regency Hotel and a smattering of exotic restaurants, galleries and shops. The 
Chamber of Commerce claims the county has more engineers than any other county 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 You know you've left grits-and-poke-sallet territory when you hit Greenville, 
perhaps the only South Carolina city outside of touristy Charleston -- and 
probably the only city of its size anywhere in the South -- where you'll find 
restaurants serving such dishes as sesame-encrusted salmon served on a bed of 
field greens with shiitake mushroom fingers and topped with a wasabi 
vinaigrette. The dish was on the menu at the restaurant where BMW hosted a 
party for international journalists in conjunction with its plant opening. 
</P>
<P>
 If the journalists came expecting to find an accent on regional quaintness, 
they left disappointed. Aside from the frequent references to Southern 
hospitality and the ubiquitous Carolina drawls, the opening ceremony could have 
taken place anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In ceremonies that were televised live throughout the region, the Greenville 
Symphony Orchestra performed pieces by Aaron Copland, Leonard Bernstein and 
George Gershwin. Afterward at a reception, the 2,000 invited guests dined on 
lobster medallions, smoked sturgeon and roast rack of lamb Provencal.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is South Carolina at its best," one sated state official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 1992 decision by Bavarian Motor Works to build its $400-million 
plant here that first signaled, as Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said recently, 
that "little South Carolina is a big league player in the global economy." 
Before the first car rolled off the production line, the company's total 
projected investment had reached $800 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Business Week magazine, in a cover story, christened the 377-mile stretch of 
Interstate 85 between Atlanta and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., America's new boom 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
 But the corridor -- and especially the Greenville-Spartanburg area -- has been 
attracting international business for more than three decades. Beginning in the 
late 1950s, while the rest of the Deep South was mired in racial controversies, 
South Carolina began to aggressively recruit industrial development, first from 
Northern states, then overseas. The area is reaping the benefits of its 
foresight. 
</P>
<P>
 With 215 international firms, South Carolina ranks 13th among U.S. states in 
foreign investment. BMW is the 76th German firm to invest in the state. Most of 
the German money has gone to what is called the upstate region around 
Greenville and Spartanburg. There also is significant investment in the region 
from Japan, Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
 One large factor in the area's favor is its location halfway between the 
booming cities of Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C. It also has the state's largest 
airport and is dissected by two interstates and two major railroads, allowing 
easy market access. 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of the BMW plant goes far beyond the 2,000 jobs it eventually 
will provide and the $1 billion it is expected to pump into the area's economy. 
The company's prestige and reputation for quality craftsmanship will be a major 
boon for a state that has long ranked near the bottom in national high school 
graduation levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The typical European view of education in the United States is that it's no 
good and that it is especially not good in the Southeast in general," Foerster 
said. But South Carolina has made recent improvements in its education system 
-- as have a number of other Southern states -- and schools in Greenville and 
Spartanburg are considered by many to be among the best in the state.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest benefit of BMW coming here is that other companies might say, as 
Campbell predicted: "If it's good enough for BMW, maybe it's good enough for 
us."  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest factor in the area's success in attracting foreign 
investors has been the state's training program for new workers. Since 1961, 
South Carolina has provided free, specialized training for workers when a major 
industry decides to build a plant or substantially expand. For BMW, in addition 
to the $130 million in other incentives, the state even screened job applicants 
-- more than 60,000 people for the 570 initial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor is the state's relatively calm racial climate. The Confederate 
flag that still flies over the Statehouse has sparked demonstrations, and the 
state Supreme Court heard arguments on whether it should come down on the same 
day that BMW held its opening ceremonies. But South Carolina has been largely 
free of the bloody clashes and high tensions that long made Mississippi, 
Alabama and southern Georgia undesirable areas for relocating businesses, Edgar 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Public facilities and colleges were desegregated relatively smoothly in South 
Carolina in 1963, Edgar said in his book "South Carolina in the Modern Age."  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of South Carolina political and business leaders in the 1960s and 
1970s, Edgar said: "They didn't say: 'We are selling social stability,' but 
that's what they were selling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To get a glimpse of what the upstate area was like before three decades of 
foreign investment and the influx of newcomers, one needs not venture far. 
Until recently, the town of Greer -- which straddles the Spartanburg County and 
Greenville County border -- did not try to partake of the region's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades Greer was a company town, dominated by the three textile mills 
that furnished modest cookie-cutter housing for its workers in four mill 
villages, each with company-owned stores. Residents were dependent on the 
companies for just about everything. With the decline of the domestic textile 
industry in the 1950s and 1960s, the town went into decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The central business district became dreary, almost nonexistent.  
</P>
<P>
 "Greer had reached the point of diminishing returns," said City Administrator 
Ken Westmoreland. "It was about at the point of collapse. (The city's 
neighborhoods) would've become ghettos in the not too distant future." 
</P>
<P>
 Things started to improve about three years ago -- one year before BMW decided 
to relocate next door -- when newly elected city leaders decided to take 
advantage of its location and started aggressively wooing development.  
</P>
<P>
 Given the new pro-business attitude of town officials, you'd think there would 
have been dancing in the streets when BMW announced it would build here. 
Instead, Greer officials and BMW have been at odds from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Greer had planned to increase its tax base by annexing the proposed BMW 
site. When the governor surprised everyone by presenting BMW as a done deal, 
Greer asked the company if it would voluntarily allow annexation. The city 
offered police and fire protection in return for $2 million a year in taxes. 
The money, Wall said, would have helped the city cope with the increased growth 
BMW's coming would cause.  
</P>
<P>
 When the company refused, Greer annexed it anyway. The state Supreme Court 
blocked the move. The state then stepped in to build a road that would open up 
a new industrial development corridor while at the same time diverting traffic 
from the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Another sore point for Greer officials is that BMW calls the factory its 
Spartanburg plant when it actually abuts Greer. In the town's view, Greer is 
experiencing the impact of the plant but getting no direct financial benefits 
and none of the glory. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they thought they'd be able to lure some of BMW's suppliers 
to Greer, but so far the suppliers have elected to build elsewhere. In fact, 
some suppliers are locating as far away as Georgia in hopes of doing business 
with both BMW and Mercedes, which is building a factory in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy is over the name of a city road that runs past the 
plant. The company wants it renamed "BMW Parkway." The city, still smarting 
over what it considers shabby treatment, refused. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship is improving -- the city and the company are cooperating on a 
few projects -- and Westmoreland predicts that the road may be renamed when 
tempers cool off. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are confidant the town's future is assured, with or without BMW. 
Greer has seen nearly $30 million in capital investment in the last three 
years, including 12 new residential subdivisions with a planned 3,000 houses 
ranging in price between $65,000 to $200,000. Because of the new housing and an 
aggressive annexation program, city officials say the population has increased 
40% since 1990, to 14,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring his town, proudly showing off development projects and making 
ambitious predictions about its growth, Westmoreland said: "I think Greer, in 
fact, will have a fighting chance for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 And he added: "BMW is really just immaterial."

BOSNIA AIR STRIKE ABORTED; ALLIED INDECISION CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO scrambled warplanes Friday for a third bombing sortie this week against 
rebel Serbs besieging the Bosnian "safe area" of Bihac, then aborted the air 
strike in a display of division and indecision in the Western alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officers of the U.N. Protection Force ordered the show of international 
resolve to save embattled Bihac after Serbian nationalists in both 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia defied the latest U.N. demands that they cease a 
rampage said to be killing as many as 100 Bosnian Muslims each day. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the U.S. and European aircraft closed in on targets in Serb-held 
territory surrounding Bihac, they were ordered to hold fire by the U.N. 
commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and NATO sources gave conflicting accounts of why the demonstration of 
NATO might was called off. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military command in 
Naples, Italy, which is in charge of the air support operation, blamed bad 
weather for obscuring the bombing targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Military sources in Sarajevo said Rose had given Bosnian Serb leaders a final 
chance to stop their advance into the collapsing Muslim refuge and called for 
the show of NATO air power only "as a precautionary move." 
</P>
<P>
 The head of U.N. peacekeeping operations in New York, Kofi Annan, disclosed 
that the NATO aircraft were fired at by the rebels with surface-to-air 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conflicting signals could be read by the rebels as indications that NATO 
has no more appetite for enforcing its edicts than does the U.N. peacekeeping 
mission, which has refrained from strict application of Security Council orders 
to protect Bosnian safe areas for fear of Serbian retaliation against U.N. 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs could very well conclude that they have nothing to lose by taking 
Bihac," said one U.N. official, noting that the disgruntled Serbian rebels in 
Bosnia and Croatia appear to be hoping any future NATO attacks will prod 
Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic to resume open support for their 
territorial conquests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalist gunmen loyal to Radovan Karadzic, the self-proclaimed president of 
Serb-occupied territory in Bosnia, had penetrated deep into the Bihac haven 
Thursday, burning villages as they advanced, U.N. military spokesman Jan-Dirk 
von Merveldt told reporters in Sarajevo at the mission's daily briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels also took hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers hostage Thursday to deter 
threatened air strikes. Fears that the more than 250 Canadian, French, Russian 
and Ukrainian captives could be subjected to retaliation may have played a role 
in Rose's decision to call off the air attack. It would have been the third air 
strike against the Serbs hammering Bihac since Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at risk are about 1,200 Bangladeshi soldiers -- some without weapons -- 
who have been trapped in the Bihac area in northwestern Bosnia for days. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic and his arch-nationalist military chieftain, Gen. Ratko Mladic, have 
vowed "all-out war" against the U.N. mission if NATO exposes their rebels to 
further punishment from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission's civilian chief, Yasushi Akashi, had observed earlier in the 
day that any force employed to halt the Bihac offensive would have to be 
minimal, because "we don't want to impinge on the diplomatic process," said 
Claire Grimes, spokeswoman at the U.N. mission headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi, Rose and U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali had been hailing 
an imminent breakthrough in negotiations toward a cease-fire for all of Bosnia, 
until receiving word from U.N. military observers that Serbian forces had 
resumed heavy artillery shelling of the safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened U.N. push for a cease-fire in the Bihac area was also cited as 
the reason U.N. officials in New York were unable to work out details for 
imposing a weapons-exclusion zone around the besieged city, although European 
sources blame divisions within NATO for the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, ambassadors of the 16 NATO countries, meeting in Brussels, agreed 
to provide any air support the United Nations would need to enforce such a 
zone, but they left the actual creation of the demilitarized area up to the 
world body. 
</P>
<P>
 Western officials said the proposal may be placed back on the front burner 
this weekend if the fighting in Bihac does not stop. European governments still 
want to reserve it as a last resort, fearing that it might provoke the Serbs 
into attacking U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose announced Thursday night that he had gained tentative approval from the 
warring factions for a local cease-fire around Bihac and claimed Friday morning 
that the truce was holding. However, reports from ham radio operators and 
international aid workers in the Bihac region indicated that heavy fighting 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs, supported by Serbian nationalist allies in the breakaway 
Krajina area of Croatia that completes a rebel cordon around Bihac, continued 
their advance Friday despite warnings from U.N. commanders.  
</P>
<P>
 At least four heavy artillery shells were fired into the center of Bihac in 
the afternoon, Grimes said, inflicting an unknown number of casualties in a 
city whose population has swelled to nearly 70,000 by the influx of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 more Muslims from surrounding villages streamed into the center of 
Bihac in search of protection from the advancing rebels, reported Peter 
Kessler, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic condemned the persistent attacks on the 
Bihac safe area, appealing to NATO to make good on its promises to protect 
Bosnian civilians targeted by the rebels in their quest for an ethnically pure 
Greater Serbia. "There is no justification for inaction anymore," Silajdzic 
told reporters in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO's hesitant reaction appeared to display a widening rift between the 
United States, which advocates a get-tough policy with the defiant Serbs but 
has no troops at risk, and alliance countries with peacekeepers on the ground 
in Bosnia.  
</P>
<P>
 The division over how to respond to Serbian provocations throughout Bosnia has 
also taken its toll on relations between Moscow and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev said Friday that the U.S. decision 
to stop enforcing a U.N. arms embargo against Bosnian Muslims was "an open 
challenge to the basic document of international law -- the U.N. Charter." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing an international law conference in Moscow, Kozyrev said the United 
Nations had never been defied "so openly and roughly" as in the former Yugoslav 
federation. He said the defiance comes from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev made the remarks before traveling to Bonn for talks in advance of next 
week's meeting of the "Contact Group" on the Balkans conflict -- the foreign 
ministers of the United States, Russia, Germany, France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, which shares Slavic heritage and Orthodox religion with the Serbs, has 
opposed the use of force by what was designed as a humanitarian mission, 
instead supporting evenhanded sanctions and diplomatic pressure on all 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Moscow and Art Pine in Washington 
contributed to this report.

SHOPPERS SWARM AFTER BARGAINS; BUSINESS: THE AMPLE SIZE OF THE CROWDS OUTPACES 
SPENDING ON TRADITIONAL FIRST DAY OF HOLIDAY RETAIL SEASON. SALES TOTALS APPEAR 
TO BE UP SLIGHTLY AS PROMOTIONS AND DISCOUNTS HOLD SWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Galvanized by price cuts, prizes and countless other promotions, consumers 
descended on the nation's shopping malls in heavy numbers Friday, creating a 
genuine rush on the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although turnouts in much of the nation were among the largest ever, sales 
appeared to be up only slightly over last year -- and much of that business was 
generated by bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was a buying frenzy at stores offering big discounts on pricey 
merchandise. Thousands jammed I. Magnin stores in Southern California, snapping 
up merchandise on the first day of a liquidation sale of a longtime retailer 
that will soon close its doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after Thanksgiving isn't my idea of a good time," said Carole 
Neustadt, an Aliso Viejo resident who searched for deals at an I. Magnin in 
Newport Beach. "I'm only here because they're closing and having a sale." 
</P>
<P>
 There were similar reports from across the country. Traffic in downtown 
Chicago was heavy, parking lots were full and the shoppers wall-to-wall at 
Marshall Field's, but they described themselves as bargain-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers said they planned to spend more money this holiday season, 
confirming recent poll reports of rising consumer confidence. But many of those 
planning to spend more also said they plan to spend later to take advantage of 
any additional discounting during possible season close-outs -- a mixed outlook 
for an industry that is trying to put an end to that holdout habit.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while spending levels may have been moderate in much of the country 
Friday, industry analysts expect sales to build closer to Christmas. Most 
analysts are predicting sales increases of 5% to 10% nationally and 5% to 7% in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those symbolizing shopper attitudes were Pamela Cox and Susan 
Cox-Simmons, twin sisters who roamed for deals at the Westside Pavilion in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm inclined to wait for more bargains, but it depends on what I find today," 
Cox said. "If I know the cost is the least for something on my list -- I'll 
buy."  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, shoppers in Southern California appeared to be responsive to 
promotions as well as discounts. At a Target store in North Hollywood, about 
800 people lined up before the doors opened to take advantage of sales and a 
promotion -- a free "Holiday Survival Package" that included coupons, shampoo, 
lotion, snacks and antacids. The package was offered to the first 1,000 
customers at each Target store nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza sponsored a Santa Claus parade Friday, 
complete with marching bands. It seemed to work. After just four hours of 
business, the mall's KayBee toy store was on pace to double the sales generated 
a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating big business, manager Karl Allen brought in nearly all of his 
employees and said he still could have used more to accommodate the lines of 
parents stretching across the store's aisles in search of Power Rangers 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as busy as I can ever remember," Allen said. "I had people at the 
gate when I came in at 7:30 this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The toy business also boomed at the FAO Schwarz store in the Glendale 
Galleria, where manager Michael Edgelow said: "It's a psychotic day -- a crazy 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, prize giveaways boosted the turnout at the Sherman Oaks 
Galleria for the kickoff of promotions that will continue through Christmas 
Eve. Shoppers who obtained a free membership in the Galleria's Top Shopper Club 
were eligible for random drawings for $100 and $250 gift certificates and for 
free trips to Hawaii, Lake Tahoe and Desert Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other malls, the Century City Shopping Center offered free gift 
wrapping and free engraving. It also offered free gifts with minimum purchases 
and free use of a massage chair for weary shoppers. But the most common shopper 
incentives were discount sales events. , Bullock's and Robinsons-May marked 
some merchandise down 50%, and the Broadway offered savings of 33% to 40%. The 
Los Angeles-based Broadway chain was satisfied, if not exactly euphoric, with 
the consumer response to its discounts, said Bill Ihle, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus far, turnout has been good and we've been pleased," Ihle said. "Sales 
have been within expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations of Southland retailers are generally upbeat, recent polls 
have shown. But sales increased only slightly compared to the same Friday a 
year ago because serious bargain hunters did much of the buying while others 
merely window-shopped, said Richard Giss, a Los Angeles-based partner with the 
retail services group of the accounting firm Deloitte & Touche. "Clearly, 
consumers are being drawn by door-busting sales and promotions," Giss said. 
"The idea is to get the shoppers in early because it helps build more customer 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte & Touche surveyed about 175 shoppers at a dozen Southland malls to 
identify buying trends. Giss said surveyors found that department stores 
offering more expensive clothing had difficulty drawing buyers. But after years 
of weak clothing sales in Southern California, survey respondents Friday 
expressed a strong interest in apparel -- a sign that shoppers want garments at 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's on-the-scene survey underscored findings of a Deloitte & Touche poll 
earlier this month, a survey that indicated that consumers are more optimistic 
about the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Lopez, an Anaheim resident, may personify that combination of 
thriftiness and optimism. Lopez, 59, is unemployed but expects to find work 
early next year. For that reason, she shopped for her 12 grandchildren at a 
Mervyn's store in Anaheim Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I don't have much of the green stuff, but they are all going to 
get some clothes because that is what they need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were willing to spend more heavily if the price was right. Darlene Mims 
of Los Angeles shopped for a dollhouse for her daughter and found the best 
price at Toys R Us in Culver City. She ended up buying three -- sets 
representing Latinos, Anglos and African Americans. The merchandise filled more 
than 10 boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The slump in apparel sales is expected to end nationwide this holiday season 
largely because of pent-up demand. Retailers said women's mohair sweaters and 
velvet blouses and skirts were popular Friday. Sweater shirts and flannel 
shirts for men sold well. Children's favorites included the Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers, Lion King merchandise and electronic learning aids such as 
GeoSafari. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buying seems to be concentrated on moderate items -- products under $50," 
said Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based retail economist and head of Barnard's 
Retail Consulting Group. "Nationwide, the malls are packed, but shoppers are 
mainly seeking low prices and good buys." 
</P>
<P>
 At the upscale three-level Bellevue Square in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, 
despite the pricey feel of many of the mall's stores, most shoppers had 
functional items in mind and gave no indication of spree-buying or reckless 
credit abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Maria Bryant of nearby Redmond said they plan to spend perhaps $400 
for everybody in the family. "I guess if we include ourselves, maybe $500 or 
$600," Mike said. "That's more than we spent last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday retail sales are expected to be especially strong in the East, and the 
season appears to be off to a rousing start in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, crowds were widespread at the Aventura Mall, one of the area's 
largest shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far today, it's busier than expected," said Jennifer Toro, a sales 
assistant at the mall's Macy's store. "People were waiting outside at 7:30 a.m. 
when I came in to work. Sales this year are much better than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout was also impressive at the flagship Macy's store on 34th Street in 
Manhattan. "I can tell you that it's been packed all day since the store opened 
at 8," said Macy spokeswoman Patti Schrickram. "There were people waiting at 
the doors, throngs of shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing trend in New York, however, was similar to that elsewhere. 
Although the crowds were large, many weren't buying. The lines to see Macy's 
famed Santa, Santaland and the Puppet Theatre were sometimes longer than many 
of the cash register lines combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers around the country do not know yet just how good sales were Friday, 
but this year's day after Thanksgiving extravaganza clearly upheld its 
tradition as a major shopping day.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Murphy of Ft. Lee, N.J., said the family has required her husband to 
shop on the day after Thanksgiving ever since the year he put it off until 
Christmas Eve and wound up buying everything at the Newark airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all got stuff that said 'New Jersey, the Garden State,' " she said.

FALLING IN LOVE ISN'T AS BORING AS SCIENCE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Behavior is ruled largely by genetics, scientists tell us. Our DNA guides 
whether we are a hard-driving executive or a moon-bedazzled poet, a vigorous 
athlete or a desk-bound accountant, even whether we bowl or play bridge in our 
spare time or go to church on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even our love lives are manipulated by puppet masters in our genes. Who we 
love and when we love them -- not to mention when we divorce them -- are often 
as preordained as our height and hair color, researchers say.  
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps not how we fall in love. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether love comes creeping up unexpectedly on little cat feet or strikes with 
the intensity and furor of a spring thunderstorm may be one of the few aspects 
of our private relationships in which the nurturing influence of our parents 
outweighs the mandates of hereditary chemicals, according to new research from 
psychologists at UC Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 In a study of twins published in the most recent issue of the journal 
Psychological Science, Niels G. Waller and Phillip R. Shaver have shown that 
genes play virtually no role in our approach to ardor, a surprising and 
refreshing exception in an area that is increasingly seen as being ruled by 
inflexible DNA, researchers say.  
</P>
<P>
 "Behavioral genetics has basically gotten boring, because you already know the 
result before you do the study: There is a substantial genetic contribution and 
family environment doesn't count for anything," said geneticist Michael Bailey 
of Northwestern University. The new study's conclusion is exciting "because it 
is so different from everything else that has come up." 
</P>
<P>
 The genetics of behavior has proved a fertile field for research and 
publication in recent years. Most studies of personality indicate that about 
50% of variability among individuals is attributed to genes, with a much 
smaller percentage resulting from parental influence and the remainder arising 
from individual life experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Several recent books, such as "Evolution of Love" and "Anatomy of Desire," 
have explored the genetic imperatives that created the idea of love and romance 
in the first place and that have honed the nature of relationships between men 
and women. 
</P>
<P>
 Evolutionary behaviorists argue that the "trophy wife," the young and 
beautiful woman married by a successful businessman after shedding his older, 
less glamorous spouse, is the logical outgrowth of the primitive chieftain's 
effort to spread his seed by choosing the woman who superficially appears most 
fertile. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, the woman's willingness to marry the older and, perhaps, 
less attractive male arises from her need for the protection and resources he 
can devote to her children, so that her own genetic line will endure. These 
fundamental imperatives drive all of us in our search for mates, according to 
psychologist David Buss of the University of Michigan, "but usually we have to 
settle for what we can get, which is usually something less than ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 In the UC Davis study, Waller and Shaver studied 338 female and 107 male twin 
pairs identified through the California Twin Registry maintained at the 
university. About three-quarters of the subjects were identical twins, the rest 
fraternal. 
</P>
<P>
 Studying twins is the most common way to sort out the varying influences of 
nature and nurture. Identical twins share all of their genes, while fraternal 
twins, on average, share only half of them. If a trait is genetic, identical 
twins should share that trait much more commonly than fraternal twins. 
</P>
<P>
 To analyze each twin's "love attitudes," the researchers used a 
well-established six-part scale devised by sociologist John A. Lee of the 
University of Toronto more than 20 years ago. Because of his previous studies 
of classical literature, Lee assigned Greek names to the six dimensions of love 
-- Eros, Ludus, Storge, Pragma, Mania and Agape. The contribution of each 
dimension to an individual's overall love attitude is determined by asking 
subjects how strongly they agree with a series of 50 questions that illustrates 
the components. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who score high on Eros place considerable value on love and passion, are 
self-confident, enjoy intimacy and self-disclosure and fall in love fairly 
quickly. One of the statements measuring Eros was: "My lover and I were 
attracted to each other immediately after we met." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who score high on Ludus value the fun and excitement of romantic 
relationships, especially with multiple alternate partners. They are generally 
not interested in self-disclosure, intimacy or "getting serious." A sample 
item: "I try to keep my lover a little uncertain about my commitment to 
him/her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Davis researchers analyzed the answers for each subject to determine 
whether the individual profiles were related to genetics or family nurturing. 
Their overwhelming conclusion was that "individual differences in romantic love 
are due almost exclusively to environment" -- how the child was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, Waller said, is "the first clear case where the environment . . . 
is playing a much stronger role than genetics in creating a family resemblance. 
This is the first set of psychological variables that I know of where 
heritability plays such a small role." 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also interviewed the spouses of 172 of the twins and found 
that their views on romantic love were quite similar to their mates', a 
refutation of the adage that opposites attract. There were two major exceptions 
to that finding, however -- those whose profiles fit in Mania (an indicator of 
obsession) and Ludus. 
</P>
<P>
 One interpretation, Waller said, is that when both partners avoid commitment 
(Ludus) or when both partners are dependent and jealous (Mania), it is 
particularly difficult to maintain a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers speculate that love attitudes may not be the only trait 
controlled by a person's rearing. In a second study, still under way, Shaver is 
finding that loneliness is also more a product of nurture than nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The take-home message here is that there are strong influences that siblings 
share," Waller said. "They may possibly be being exposed to the same parents, 
growing up in culturally homogeneous neighborhoods, having similar peer groups, 
etc., which shape their love attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he added, "these shared experiences have a lasting impact on 
interpersonal relationships. The twins in the study ranged in age from 16 to 
90, and the older twins were no less similar to one another than the younger. 
Environmental influences, like genetic, have a lasting impact."

</P>
<P>
 To determine how people fall in love, researchers divide attitudes about 
romance into six categories. A series of 50 questions helps determine how large 
an influence each category plays in their love lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * Type: Eros (Passion) 
</P>
<P>
 * Characteristics: Value love and passion, are self-confident, enjoy intimacy 
and self-disclosure, fall in love fairly quickly 
</P>
<P>
 * Type: Ludus (Fun) 
</P>
<P>
 * Characteristics: Value the fun and excitement of romantic relationships, 
especially with multiple partners 
</P>
<P>
 * Type: Storge (Family affection) 
</P>
<P>
 * Characteristics: Value friendship, companionship and reliable affection 
</P>
<P>
 * Type: Pragma (Pragmatic) 
</P>
<P>
 * Characteristics: Practical, entering a relationship only if it meets certain 
criteria 
</P>
<P>
 * Type: Mania (Obsession) 
</P>
<P>
 * Characteristics: Desperate and conflicted. Yearn intensely for love, but 
experience pain and jealousy  
</P>
<P>
 * Type: Agape (Spiritual love) 
</P>
<P>
 * Characteristics: Centered on what they give to a partner instead of what 
they receive. Selfless, spiritual

HEALTH CLINICS REPORT DECLINES AFTER PROP. 187; HEALTH: DOCTORS SAY FEAR IS 
SCARING PATIENTS AWAY. MANY IMMIGRANTS ARE UNAWARE THAT ENFORCEMENT IS ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Physicians at the Eastside clinic became concerned when Lilian Morales 
uncharacteristically missed an examination for precancerous lesions on her 
uterus. Reaching her by telephone at home, health workers soon ascertained what 
had happened: Morales, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, feared she would be 
reported to immigration authorities. So she stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to convince her to come in," said Dr. Rene Sanchez, a staff physician 
at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles, a nonprofit facility 
that serves a largely immigrant clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario, although not universal, has become familiar in some largely 
immigrant communities, many health providers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the passage of Proposition 187, according to administrators at many 
clinics, many fearful immigrants such as Morales have skipped appointments for 
routine examinations, both for themselves and their children -- the latter 
often U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to identify and treat diseases at an early stage "could be a public 
health hazard," said Dr. Juan Ruiz of the Clinica Oscar Romero near Downtown. 
"Disease could be really advanced if people wait until the last minute to come 
to us. That could put the entire community at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 In the insular neighborhoods where many recent immigrants live, word has often 
not filtered down that court challenges have blocked implementation of 
Proposition 187 -- which, among other things, would deny non-emergency public 
health care to illegal immigrants and require that providers turn in those 
suspected of being undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know exactly what's going on and they're being scared away," 
said Ruiz, chairman of the board of Clinica Oscar Romero, which serves a large 
Central American population in the Pico-Union neighborhood. "As a physician, it 
really concerns me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital outpatient clinics and nonprofit community facilities -- often 
favored by an undocumented population that is leery of contacts with government 
-- have reported a steady 10% to 20% decline in patient visits during the last 
two weeks, according to the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few people understand what a temporary restraining order is, and what 
they've heard is that the overwhelming majority of Californians voted to turn 
(undocumented) people in," said David Langness, vice president of the council, 
which represents 250 health care facilities across Southern California. "That 
frightens many folks and keeps them away from health care." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some clinics, such as the South-Central Family Health Center, have 
continued operating at capacity since Proposition 187 was approved. "We're not 
turning anyone away these days, but we are keeping ourselves busy," said Sue 
Scott, director of the South-Central center. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles County health facilities -- probably the nation's largest care 
providers for illegal immigrants -- there is no definitive indication that 
residents are avoiding health care facilities in large numbers. Anecdotal 
reports that prenatal visits or immunization rates dropped at some county 
facilities after Proposition 187's passage do not necessarily signal a trend, 
officials caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been nothing that has popped up and smacked us against the face," 
said Toby Staheli, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, which operates six hospitals, six comprehensive health centers 
and 39 public health centers. "It's just too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at some inner-city private clinics, workers have been busily attempting to 
contact missing patients and otherwise let residents know that nothing has 
changed for illegal immigrants, pending resolution of a court case in Los 
Angeles concerning the legality of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that there has been an impact, but it varies from clinic to 
clinic," said Yolanda Vera, a staff attorney in the Los Angeles office of the 
National Health Law Program, a legal services support center that works on 
health issues. "There's a lot of confusion out there, and there are people who 
are fearful of coming in, whether for clinic appointments or for treatments of 
something that may become an emergency down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that Proposition 187 may be having an effect was publicly 
spotlighted in the last week when 12-year-old Julio Cano of Anaheim died. His 
parents said they had avoided taking him to a hospital because they feared 
being asked about their immigration status. Both parents are illegal immigrants 
from Mexico, as was the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said Julio had acute leukemia, a childhood cancer that can 
lead to aggressive infections and cause death in a matter of months or even 
weeks. But whether Julio's life might have been saved by an earlier diagnosis 
of acute leukemia remains uncertain, medical experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of hospitals and clinics in California receive some public 
funding, meaning virtually all state health facilities would be required under 
the dictates of Proposition 187 to deny services to anyone who could not 
demonstrate lawful immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the requirement could jeopardize the existence of some private 
clinics, particularly those serving poor immigrant communities. This may be one 
reason, according to Proposition 187 advocates, that clinic operators have been 
so vociferous in pointing out the early impacts of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Follow the money," said Barbara Coe, a founding member of the Proposition 187 
movement. "Of course, they don't want to lose patients -- that's why we've been 
attacked so viciously -- it's a threat to their coffers." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187's opponents -- who included most professional medical 
associations -- have long warned that implementation of the wide-ranging 
measure could result in a sharp decline in preventive care and a consequent 
rise in emergency room cases and preventable deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Many physicians also cited the potential for epidemics, as immigrants would 
likely avoid immunizations, screening and treatment for tuberculosis (still 
widespread in many immigrants' homelands) and treatment for sexually 
transmitted ailments and other infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest concern is that we're going to see a drop-off in things that 
aren't emergencies," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of public health disease 
control programs for Los Angeles County. "Immunizations are preventative, and 
most people will put them off with the slightest excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments after approval of Proposition 187, however, Gov. Pete Wilson 
pointedly sought to quell the fears of a health disaster and made clear his 
intention to continue providing everyone -- regardless of immigration status -- 
with government-funded services considered essential to public health, 
presumably immunizations and contagious disease screening and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such a policy would seem to violate the intentions of Proposition 
187's framers, Wilson has indicated that his obligation to protect 
Californians' health is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his executive order after passage of Proposition 187, Wilson 
directed officials of the Department of Health Services to issue emergency 
regulations "which provide for the continued availability at all levels of 
government, independent of citizenship or immigration status, of such public 
health services as they deem necessary to protect the general public from 
threats to the public health." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all is on hold pending the resolution of the court challenges. But the 
sense of worry is evident at many clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Prenatal examinations at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles 
have dropped about 60% since just before the election, administrators say. 
Immunizations against infectious childhood diseases such as measles, polio and 
diphtheria have nose-dived more sharply. Clinic physicians administered 72 
immunizations during the first 15 days of November, compared to a normal rate 
of 400 child immunizations for that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's directly tied to the fear of Proposition 187," said Rodolfo Diaz, 
executive director at the federal- and state-funded facility, which logs about 
150,000 patient visits annually. "The undocumented parents, the parents of 
mixed undocumented and resident families, are not bringing their kids in. 
People are fearful. They think we're going to start reporting them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Clinica Oscar Romero in Pico-Union, patient visits declined more than 
50% during the first five days after the election, Ruiz said. Activity has 
since rebounded to about 70% of the pre-election clientele, he added, thanks to 
an aggressive advertising and outreach campaign notifying residents that no one 
would be denied services or turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clinics in Ventura County have also reported a dip in client visits, with 
the Clinica Vista seeing half its normal patient load, according to Dr. Chris 
Landon, who runs the prenatal facility Clinica Vista in the city of Ventura. 
Landon attributes the decline at least partially to concerns over Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley on a recent weeknight, the normally bustling Free Clinic was 
empty. "I don't know why no one is here, but I fear it is because of Prop. 
187," said Fred Bauermeister, director of the clinic, which provides medical 
care to about 4,700 clients. Alarmed at the decline of patients at some 
inner-city health facilities, a new coalition of organizations that opposed 
Proposition 187 plans to tape public service announcements in Spanish and 
English next week to advise illegal immigrants to continue seeking health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The message "will be especially targeted to pregnant mothers -- we'll tell 
them to continue to seek prenatal care," said Langness, whose organization is 
co-sponsoring the announcements along with the Hollywood Women's Policy Center, 
Asian-Pacific Planning Council, Community Clinics Assn. and the Los Angeles 
Unified Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, several health officials say the initial fear after 
Proposition 187 appears to have passed, and that patients are returning in 
increasing numbers -- thanks largely to the efforts of the Latino media. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing from the community is that the word is getting out" that 
Proposition 187 is not yet being enforced, said Russ Inglish, executive 
director of the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics. "I don't know if 
(patient visits) have reached previous levels," Inglish said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other clinic officials say the drop-off in patient visits continues. "In our 
clinic, we're having a high incidence of no-shows," said Jean Forbath, who is a 
board member of Share Our Selves in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop-off in immigrant patients is more notable in urban clinics than at 
rural sites, said Arnoldo Torres, a Sacramento-based policy consultant who 
represents 15 nonprofit clinics statewide. In rural facilities, Torres said, 
workers cited no significant decline in patient visits since the passage of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have as much media attention in the rural communities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, no definitive statistics are available on November patient 
levels. However, some initial data and anecdotal evidence indicates a drop-off 
in some segments of the massive government-operated system. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparing election week of 1994 with the same week during 1993, 
administrators found that prenatal visits systemwide were down 4.2%. However, 
officials cautioned that such a decline did not necessarily indicate a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 At the El Monte Comprehensive Health Center, which provides everything from 
dental services to prenatal checkups, a sharp reduction has occurred in 
immunizations administered since October, according to Edis Callejas, who 
manages the immunization clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are afraid to bring their children in," Callejas said 
Wednesday as she sat behind her desk at the near-empty clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although November is traditionally a slow time for immunizations -- August and 
early September mark the big back-to-school rush -- Callejas says she has been 
alarmed at the recent drop-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who did stop by the county clinic was Elvi Flores. Six months 
pregnant, and without immigration documents, Flores said the talk about 
Proposition 187 worries her, but she had heard that the measure was not being 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the health of my children is the most important thing," said Flores, 
who was accompanied by her 3-year-old son, Armando, a U.S. citizen. "Of course 
I'm worried about (Proposition 187), but my baby is my most critical concern 
now."

 President Clinton is banking on the early experience with the relatively 
small-bore North American Free Trade Agreement to help him sell Congress on the 
gigantic General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which would reduce tariffs and 
other trade barriers among 124 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 GATT will be the sole item on the agenda when Congress reconvenes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA is not exactly a miniature GATT. For one thing, NAFTA will eventually 
remove all barriers to trade between its three participants, while the global 
agreement would reduce and equalize tariffs around the world but not eliminate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The final verdict on NAFTA, which took effect in January, is years away. 
Nevertheless, most analysts agree that the early experience under NAFTA shines 
a favorable light on trade liberalization generally. Nowhere to be found is the 
"giant sucking sound" that 1992 presidential candidate Ross Perot warned about 
-- the sound of U.S. manufacturing jobs drawn to Mexico, where labor is so much 
cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the contrary, NAFTA may result in more jobs for workers in the United 
States, not fewer. Caterpillar Inc., for example, reports that its sales of 
giant earthmoving equipment to Mexico during the first half of the year soared 
77% above last year's levels. Midwestern farmers are selling three times as 
much corn to Mexico this year as last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to NAFTA, new exports to Mexico and Canada have helped our businesses 
create as many as 100,000 jobs," Clinton claimed in a recent speech. "In the 
six months after the treaty's adoption, exports from the United States to 
Mexico increased nearly 20%, about three times the rate of our overall export 
growth in this time of economic expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. residents are also buying more Mexican products, more than offsetting the 
surge in U.S. exports to Mexico. The U.S. trade surplus with Mexico dropped by 
half during the first six months of 1994, from $1.64 billion a year earlier to 
$810 million this year. But analysts say many of the Mexican goods being bought 
in the United States are not replacing U.S.-made products but are items that 
buyers in the United States otherwise would not have bought at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every U.S. industry is coming out ahead. Economist Charles W. McMillion of 
MBG Information Services, a business information, analysis and forecasting firm 
in Washington, says the United States has boosted its exports of plastics, 
iron, steel and fertilizer. Mexico is selling more electronic equipment, 
surgical instruments and optical equipment to the United States, as well as 
automobiles and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The losers (in the United States) are high-tech, high-wage, California-type 
products, and the winners are bulk commodities," McMillion said. "It's 
completely at odds with the theory that we export high-skill, high-wage 
products to Mexico and we import simple products and raw materials." 
</P>
<P>
 With import taxes falling, Mexico has purchased 44,000 U.S.-made automobiles 
during the first 10 months of 1994, six times the number purchased in all of 
1993, according to the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, McMillion said in an interview, the Big Three auto 
companies have increased the number of cars they are building in Mexico and 
selling in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, argues the Clinton Administration, NAFTA is clearly a net plus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we predicted that NAFTA could support 200,000 jobs within two 
years. We are right on track to achieve this," U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor said in a statement marking the first anniversary last week of 
congressional approval of the trade pact. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that no one has used the trade agreement as the basis to 
challenge U.S. environmental regulations or health and safety standards -- 
although there has been no significant progress in beginning a border cleanup 
in Mexico that was a central element of the trade plan's environmental 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ironies of the angry debate over the North American accord has been 
the effect it has had in the Midwest, where much of the opposition was centered 
-- and where manufacturers such as Caterpillar, long a backer of the trade 
plan, and farmers are happily taking advantage of the lowered barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The center of American export industry is the Midwest," said Barry P. 
Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution, a public policy research 
organization in Washington. "Yet it was the Midwest congressional bloc that 
voted against it." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the border town of Laredo, Tex., business is booming as big diesel rigs 
rumble back and forth across the border at an ever-increasing rate. Restaurants 
have opened, distribution warehouses have been established, and the Mall del 
Norte has been expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year ending Sept. 30, 1993, roughly 113,500 trucks entered the United 
States from Mexico at the Laredo-Nuevo Laredo border crossing. That figure grew 
a year later to nearly 191,000, according to Audrey Adams, the district 
director of the U.S. Customs Service. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, U.S. shipments to Mexico increased threefold. 
</P>
<P>
 When Adams served in the same region a decade ago, it was not uncommon for 
U.S. merchandise bound for Mexico to sit in a warehouse for nearly a year while 
Mexican taxes were assessed and paperwork was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, "it's just not happening like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, goods are flowing into the region from throughout the United States, 
and they move right along into Mexico. And products from Mexican factories -- 
television sets, for example, or windshield wipers for cars being assembled in 
this country -- are moving north. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no problem getting the permits," she said. "It's a very free flow of 
cargo." 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember that whole thing about the 'giant sucking sound?' The increases in 
imports are impressive -- but the increases in exports are even more 
impressive." GATT's Main Points 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the chief provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
accord, which Congress will consider in a special session next week: 
</P>
<P>
 * TARIFFS: Reduce and equalize tariffs around the world but not eliminate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * SCOPE: Expand the reach of the international trading system to make it 
possible for companies involved in accounting, banking and advertising to do 
business around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 * COPYRIGHTS: Strengthen enforcement of copyright laws to provide protection 
for pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * SUBSIDIES: Cut agriculture subsidies so that the prices of produce in 
foreign markets are not kept so artificially low that U.S. goods seem 
overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
 * REFEREE: Establish an international body, the World Trade Organization, with 
authority to regulate global commerce.

BRISK SALES REPORTED AT VALLEY STORES; BUSINESS: SHOPPING RUSH REFLECTS LARGE 
CROWDS NATIONWIDE AND SHOWS HOW FAR LOCAL MALLS HAVE COME SINCE JAN. 17 QUAKE. 
SALES TOTALS APPEAR TO BE UP SLIGHTLY AS DISCOUNTS HOLD SWAY. 
</P>

 Galvanized by price cuts, prizes and promotions, consumers descended on the 
nation's shopping malls in heavy numbers Friday, creating a genuine shopping 
rush on the traditional start of the holiday buying season -- and reflecting 
how far San Fernando Valley malls have come in recovering from the January 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But while turnouts in much of the nation were among the largest ever, actual 
sales appeared to be up only slightly over last year -- and much of that 
business was generated by bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, the Broadway and Sears, Roebuck & Co. reported brisk business 
at Northridge Fashion Center, even though about 200 quake-damaged stores are 
still closed at the mall situated near the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Galleria fared well, and the Glendale Galleria appeared to be 
benefiting richly from the Northridge mall's continuing troubles, with early 
counts indicating twice as many holiday shoppers as last year. 
</P>
<P>
 From across the country came reports of a buying frenzy at stores offering big 
discounts on pricey merchandise. Thousands jammed I. Magnin stores in Southern 
California, snapping up merchandise on the first day of a liquidation sale of a 
longtime retailer that will soon close its doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic in downtown Chicago was heavy, parking lots were full and the shoppers 
wall-to-wall at Marshall Fields, but they described themselves as 
bargain-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers said they planned to spend more money this holiday season, 
confirming recent poll reports of rising consumer confidence. But many of those 
planning to spend more also said they plan to spend later to take advantage of 
any additional discounting during possible season close-outs -- a mixed outlook 
for an industry that is trying to put an end to that holdout habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while spending levels may have been moderate in much of the country 
Friday, industry analysts expect sales to build closer to Christmas. Most 
analysts are predicting sales increases of 5% to 10% nationally and 5% to 7% in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, Friday was an important test for malls damaged in 
the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At Northridge Fashion Center, two anchor stores -- the Broadway and Sears -- 
opened earlier this month, amid dusty construction work that will continue into 
next spring on the 200 smaller stores still closed by damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Mackay, manager of the Broadway, said the store "opened a little quieter 
than we'd like," but said that sales in recent weeks have been ahead of last 
year's pace. At Sears, which spent more than $8 million on repair and 
renovation work, store manager Ed Tiritilli said big crowds Friday erased his 
post-quake apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Sears opened at 8 a.m., 300 people were lined up outside the 
doors, Tiritilli said. By 10, the parking lots were filling, as shoppers rushed 
to get 10% discounts on purchases made before 11 a.m. "We were waiting to see 
what would happen without a mall," Tiritilli said. "The response has been 
excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sears' hardware department Friday morning, Gale Marsh, 36, carried in her 
outstretched arms a $40 drill, a $15 drill bit set, a $20 plier set and a $20 
screwdriver set -- all Hanukkah gifts for her tool-collecting husband. "He 
doesn't use them," she said. "But he likes to own them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the holiday decorations department at Sears, Arpig Sorkazian, 41, and her 
16-year-old daughter, Silva, of Northridge were shopping for a Nativity set 
because the one they had last year was destroyed by the quake. Though insurance 
covered most of the $75,000 in damage their home sustained, they said the quake 
has squeezed their holiday budget -- a $75 Nativity set was rejected in favor 
of one that cost $25 -- and has made shopping less convenient. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go all the way to Burbank, Glendale and Topanga (Canyon 
Boulevard)," Arpig Sorkazian said. "We wouldn't have to if everything were 
fixed here." 
</P>
<P>
 The giant Glendale Galleria might have benefited most from Northridge Fashion 
Center's ongoing earthquake troubles. That mall appeared headed for 150,000 
shoppers Friday, double the average daily traffic during the holiday season, 
said Richard Giss, a partner with the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche who 
spent the day at the Galleria tracking shopping activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those symbolizing shopper attitudes were Pamela Cox and Susan 
Cox-Simmons, twin sisters who roamed for deals at the Westside Pavilion in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm inclined to wait for more bargains, but it depends on what I find today," 
Cox said. "If I know the cost is the least for something on my list -- I'll 
buy."  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, shoppers in Southern California appeared to be responsive to 
promotions as well as discounts. At a Target store in North Hollywood, for 
example, about 800 people lined up before the store opened to take advantage of 
sales and a promotion -- a free "Holiday Survival Package" that included 
coupons, shampoo, lotion, snacks and antacids. The package was offered to the 
first 1,000 customers at each Target store nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The toy business also boomed at the FAO Schwarz store in the Glendale 
Galleria, where manager Michael Edgelow said: "It's a psychotic day -- a crazy 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, prize giveaways boosted the turnout at Sherman Oaks 
Galleria for the kickoff of promotions that will continue through Christmas 
Eve. Shoppers who obtained a free membership in the Galleria's Top Shopper Club 
were eligible for random drawings for $100 and $250 gift certificates and for 
free trips to Hawaii, Lake Tahoe and Desert Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations of Southland retailers are generally upbeat, recent polls 
have shown. However, sales increased only slightly compared to the same Friday 
a year ago because serious bargain hunters did much of the buying while others 
merely window-shopped, Giss said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, consumers are being drawn by door-busting sales and promotions," 
Giss said. "The idea is to get the shoppers in early because it helps build 
more customer traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Deloitte & Touche survey of 175 shoppers at various Southern California 
malls Friday, Giss said 77% of the respondents said they would spend as much or 
more this year on holiday gifts than last year, and 57% said they feel secure 
in their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are confident in their ability to deal with this economy, Giss said. 
"They think it's going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Giss said surveyors found that department stores offering more expensive 
clothing had difficulty drawing buyers. But after years of weak clothing sales 
in Southern California, survey respondents Friday expressed a strong interest 
in apparel -- a sign that shoppers want garments at low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The slump in apparel sales is expected to end nationwide this holiday season 
largely because of pent-up demand. Retailers said women's mohair sweaters and 
velvet blouses and skirts were popular with women Friday. Sweater shirts and 
flannel shirts for men sold well. Children's favorites included the Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers, Lion King merchandise and electronic learning aids such 
as GeoSafari. 
</P>
<P>
 Scaffolding still surrounds the quake-cracked exterior of Sherman Oaks 
Galleria, but the mall opened 11 days after the quake, and its department store 
anchors finished repairs in July. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, minutes after the mall opened at 9 a.m., a line of 10 people had 
already formed at the Kay-Bee Toy Store on the second floor. At the back of the 
toy store line, Norm Braverman carried a $15 plastic pop-up toy, a $4 football 
and a $13 Power Rangers Light-Up Desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does it do? Damned if I know," said Braverman, a 43-year-old financial 
analyst with the county Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Downstairs, the Comic King collectibles store is counting on parents like 
Braverman to join what has already become a feeding frenzy for toys that have 
anything to do with the Power Rangers -- the super hero stars of a children's 
television program. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched earlier this year by Richard Fuksman, a 15-year-old comic book 
collector turned entrepreneur, the Comic King has loaded up on Power Rangers 
inventory, including the latest must-have piece: the White Tigerzord, a 
ferocious-looking vehicle one of the Power Rangers rides into battle. 
</P>
<P>
 But while other toy stores offer the Tigerzord for as little as $60, the Comic 
King offers it for $125. "It's cheaper up there," Richard said, pointing to the 
Kay-Bee store upstairs. "But they'll only have it for half an hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Some were willing to spend more heavily if the price was right.  
</P>
<P>
 "Buying seems to be concentrated on moderate items -- products under $50," 
said Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based retail economist and head of Barnard's 
Retail Consulting Group. "Nationwide, the malls are packed, but shoppers are 
mainly seeking low prices and good buys."

HEALTH CLINICS REPORT DECLINES AFTER PROP. 187; HEALTH: DOCTORS SAY FEAR IS 
SCARING PATIENTS AWAY. MANY IMMIGRANTS ARE UNAWARE THAT ENFORCEMENT IS ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Physicians at the East Los Angeles clinic became concerned when Lilian Morales 
uncharacteristically missed an examination for precancerous lesions on her 
uterus. Reaching her by telephone at home, health workers soon ascertained what 
had happened: Morales, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, feared she would be 
reported to immigration authorities. So she stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to convince her to come in," said Dr. Rene Sanchez, a staff physician 
at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles, a nonprofit facility 
that serves a largely immigrant clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario, although not universal, has become familiar in some largely 
immigrant communities, many health providers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the passage of Proposition 187, according to administrators at many 
clinics, thousands of fearful immigrants such as Morales have skipped 
appointments for routine examinations, both for themselves and their children 
-- the latter often U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid they're going to walk in here and we're going to call the 
INS," said a spokeswoman for Clinica Medica Para La Mujer, a Van Nuys 
family-planning office that serves many Latino women. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to do that, but that's what they think." 
</P>
<P>
 At Clinica Latina Femenina in San Fernando, medical assistant Raquel Gonzales 
said patient visits were off 5% since the initiative passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When patients call for information . . . they ask if they need ID or 
something special," she said. "This did not happen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to identify and treat diseases at an early stage "could be a public 
health hazard," said Dr. Juan Ruiz of the Clinica Oscar Romero near Downtown. 
"Disease could be really advanced if people wait until the last minute to come 
to us. That could put the entire community at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 In the insular neighborhoods where many recent immigrants reside, word has 
often not filtered down that court challenges have blocked implementation of 
Proposition 187 -- which, among other things, would deny non-emergency public 
health care to illegal immigrants and require that providers turn in those 
suspected of being undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't know exactly what's going on and they're being scared away," 
said Ruiz, chairman of the board of Clinica Oscar Romero, which serves a large 
Central American population in the Pico-Union neighborhood. "As a physician, it 
really concerns me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital outpatient clinics and nonprofit community facilities -- often 
favored by an undocumented population that is leery of contacts with government 
-- have reported a steady 10% to 20% decline in patient visits during the last 
two weeks, according to the Hospital Council of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few people understand what a temporary restraining order is, and what 
they've heard is that the overwhelming majority of Californians voted to turn 
(undocumented) people in," said David Langness, vice president of the council, 
which represents 250 health care facilities across Southern California. "That 
frightens many folks and keeps them away from health care." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some clinics, have continued operating at capacity since 
Proposition 187 was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still status quo for us," said Magdalena Beltran-del Olmo, spokeswoman 
for the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Panorama City. "It's still busy -- 
lots of flu, lots of cold-related ailments." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not turning anyone away these days, but we are keeping ourselves busy," 
said Sue Scott, director of the South Central Family Health center. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles County health facilities -- likely the nation's largest care 
providers for illegal immigrants -- there is no definitive indication that 
residents are avoiding health care facilities in large numbers. Anecdotal 
reports that prenatal visits or immunization rates dropped at some county 
facilities after Proposition 187's passage do not necessarily signal a trend, 
officials caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been nothing that has popped up and smacked us against the face," 
said Toby Staheli, a spokeswoman for the county Department of Health Services, 
which operates six hospitals, six comprehensive health centers and 39 public 
health centers. "It's just too early to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet at some inner-city private clinics, workers have been busily attempting to 
contact missing patients and otherwise let residents know that nothing has 
changed for illegal immigrants, pending resolution of a court case in Los 
Angeles concerning the legality of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that there has been an impact, but it varies from clinic to 
clinic," said Yolanda Vera, a staff attorney in the Los Angeles office of the 
National Health Law Program, a legal services support center that works on 
health issues. "There's a lot of confusion out there, and there are people who 
are fearful of coming in, whether for clinic appointments or for treatments of 
something that may become an emergency down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that Proposition 187 may be having an effect was publicly 
spotlighted in the last week when 12-year-old Julio Cano of Anaheim died. His 
parents said they had avoided taking him to a hospital because they feared 
being asked about their immigration status. Both parents are illegal immigrants 
from Mexico, as was the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said Julio had acute leukemia, a childhood cancer that can 
lead to aggressive infections and cause death in a matter of months or even 
weeks. But whether Julio's life might have been saved by an earlier diagnosis 
of acute leukemia remains uncertain, medical experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of hospitals and clinics in California receive some public 
funding, meaning virtually all state health facilities would be required under 
the dictates of Proposition 187 to deny services to anyone who could not 
demonstrate lawful immigration status. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the requirement could jeopardize the existence of some private 
clinics, particularly those serving poor immigrant communities. This may be one 
reason, according to Proposition 187 advocates, why clinic operators have been 
so vociferous in pointing out the early impacts of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Follow the money," said Barbara Coe, a founding member of the Proposition 187 
movement. "Of course, they don't want to lose patients -- that's why we've been 
attacked so viciously -- it's a threat to their coffers." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187's opponents -- who included most professional medical 
associations -- have long warned that implementation of the wide-ranging 
measure could result in a sharp decline in preventive care and a consequent 
rise in emergency room cases and preventable deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Many physicians also cited the potential for epidemics, as immigrants would 
likely avoid immunizations, screening and treatment for tuberculosis (still 
widespread in many immigrants' homelands) and treatment for sexually 
transmitted ailments and other infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest concern is that we're going to see a drop-off in things that 
aren't emergencies," said Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of public health disease 
control programs for Los Angeles County. "Immunizations are preventative, and 
most people will put them off with the slightest excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 In comments after approval of Proposition 187, however, Gov. Pete Wilson 
pointedly sought to quell the fears of a health disaster and made clear his 
intention to continue providing everyone -- regardless of immigration status -- 
with government-funded services considered essential to public health, 
presumably immunizations and contagious disease screening and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such a policy would seem to violate the intentions of Proposition 
187's framers, Wilson has indicated that his obligation to protect 
Californians' health is paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his executive order after passage of Proposition 187, Wilson 
directed officials of the Department of Health Services to issue emergency 
regulations "which provide for the continued availability at all levels of 
government, independent of citizenship or immigration status, of such public 
health services as they deem necessary to protect the general public from 
threats to the public health." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all is on hold pending the resolution of the court challenges. But the 
sense of worry is evident at many clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Prenatal examinations at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles 
have dropped about 60% since just before the election, administrators say. 
Immunizations against infectious childhood diseases such as measles, polio and 
diphtheria have nose-dived more sharply. Clinic physicians administered 72 
immunizations during the first 15 days of November, compared to a normal rate 
of 400 child immunizations for that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's directly tied to the fear of Proposition 187," said Rodolfo Diaz, 
executive director at the federal- and state-funded facility, which logs about 
150,000 patient visits annually. "The undocumented parents, the parents of 
mixed undocumented and resident families, are not bringing their kids in. 
People are fearful. They think we're going to start reporting them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Clinica Oscar Romero in Pico-Union, patient visits declined more than 
50% during the first five days after the election, Ruiz said. Activity has 
since rebounded to about 70% of the pre-election clientele, he added, thanks to 
an aggressive advertising and outreach campaign notifying residents that no one 
would be denied services or turned in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley on a recent weeknight, the normally bustling Free Clinic was 
empty. "I don't know why no one is here, but I fear it is because of Prop. 
187," said Fred Bauermeister, director of the clinic, which provides medical 
care to about 4,700 clients. Alarmed at the decline of patients at some 
inner-city health facilities, a new coalition of organizations that opposed 
Proposition 187 plans to tape public service announcements in Spanish and 
English next week to advise illegal immigrants to continue seeking health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The message "will be especially targeted to pregnant mothers -- we'll tell 
them to continue to seek prenatal care," said Langness, whose organization is 
co-sponsoring the announcements along with the Hollywood Women's Policy Center, 
Asian-Pacific Planning Council, Community Clinics Assn. and the Los Angeles 
Unified Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, several health officials say the initial fear after 
Proposition 187 appears to have passed, and that patients are returning in 
increasing numbers -- thanks largely to the efforts of the Latino media. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm hearing from the community is that the word is getting out" that 
Proposition 187 is not yet being enforced, said Russ Inglish, executive 
director of the Orange County Coalition of Community Clinics. "I don't know if 
(patient visits) have reached previous levels," Inglish said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, no definitive statistics are available on November patient 
levels. However, some initial data and anecdotal evidence indicates a drop-off 
in some segments of the massive government-operated system. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparing election week of 1994 with the same week during 1993, 
administrators found that prenatal visits systemwide were down 4.2%. However, 
officials cautioned that such a decline did not necessarily indicate a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 At the El Monte Comprehensive Health Center, which provides everything from 
dental services to prenatal checkups, a sharp reduction has occurred in 
immunizations administered since October, according to Edis Callejas, who 
manages the immunization clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are afraid to bring their children in," said Callejas on 
Wednesday, as she sat behind her desk at the near-empty clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although November is traditionally a slow time for immunizations -- August and 
early September mark the big back-to-school rush -- Callejas says she has been 
alarmed at the recent drop-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who did stop by the county clinic was Elvi Flores. Six months 
pregnant, and without immigration documents, Flores said the talk about 
Proposition 187 worries her, but she had heard that the measure was not being 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the health of my children is the most important thing," said Flores, 
who was accompanied by her 3-year-old son, Armando, a U.S. citizen. "Of course 
I'm worried about it (Proposition 187), but my baby is my most critical concern 
now."

 AGAINST THE ODDS: Do the Cal State Northridge Matadors have a chance to beat 
highly ranked UCLA in today's basketball season opener (C10)? Believe it or 
not, Las Vegas thinks they do. "We see upsets all the time," says oddsmaker 
John Avello. . . . But don't buy those Final Four tickets just yet. Asked for 
the odds on CSUN going that far, Avello says "there isn't a number high enough 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE TUBE: Win or lose, the Matadors will get more than the usual exposure 
in today's game. . . . The contest will be televised on cable at 2 p.m.

 EMPOWERED: Women were once told they couldn't have it all. Well, try telling 
that to the women at Everywoman's Village in Van Nuys. The Village, as it is 
now known, serves 7,000 men and women and offers classes ranging from sensual 
dance to power blackjack and tai chi (B4). 
</P>
<P>
 WRECKING BALL: Eight months after it was condemned because of quake damage, 
the five-story Van Nuys building that once housed the Valley's largest public 
health center started to come down (B3). . . . The demolition, above, was 
started during the Thanksgiving weekend because of lighter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 CELEBRATION: Hanukkah has hit the big time, according to Zev Garber, professor 
of Jewish studies at Valley College in Van Nuys. Garber says the holiday 
appeals to intermarried Jews "overwhelmed by the threatening nature of 
Christmas. It's a way to assert equality with the non-Jewish partner." . . . In 
today's religion column (B15), Garber talks about the holiday's spiritual and 
militaristic elements.

 LANDMARK: The folks at Disney have found another way to catch our fascination. 
The featured attraction is the new animation building, just off the Ventura

"Fantasia" (B1). Michael Arkush

SHOPPERS SWARM AFTER BARGAINS; BUSINESS: THE AMPLE SIZE OF THE CROWDS OUTPACES 
SPENDING ON TRADITIONAL FIRST DAY OF HOLIDAY RETAIL SEASON. SALES TOTALS APPEAR 
TO BE UP SLIGHTLY AS BARGAIN HUNTERS, DISCOUNTS HOLD SWAY.

 Galvanized by price cuts, prizes and countless other promotions, consumers 
descended on the nation's shopping malls in heavy numbers Friday, creating a 
genuine shopping rush on the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 But while turnouts in much of the nation were among the largest ever, actual 
sales appeared to be up only slightly over last year -- and much of that 
business was generated by bargain hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there was a buying frenzy at stores offering big discounts on pricey 
merchandise. Thousands jammed I. Magnin stores in Southern California, snapping 
up merchandise on the first day of a liquidation sale of a longtime retailer 
that will soon close its doors for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day after Thanksgiving isn't my idea of a good time," said Carole 
Neustadt, an Aliso Viejo resident who searched for deals at a Magnin in Newport 
Beach. "I'm only here because they're closing and having a sale." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks, more than 100 people lined up in the 
morning chill waiting for department stores to open. Suky Pobojeski was there 
before 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales," the 42-year-old Newbury Park homemaker said. "They're everywhere. I 
want to hit them all. In fact, I was telling my husband this morning I wish 
there was more of me to go to the different stores." 
</P>
<P>
 There were similar reports from across the country. Traffic in downtown 
Chicago was heavy, parking lots were full and the shoppers wall-to-wall at 
Marshall Fields, but they described themselves as bargain-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers said they planned to spend more money this holiday season, 
confirming recent poll reports of rising consumer confidence. But many of those 
planning to spend more also said they plan to spend later to take advantage of 
any additional discounting during possible season close-outs -- a mixed outlook 
for an industry that is trying to put an end to that holdout habit.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while spending levels may have been moderate in much of the country 
Friday, industry analysts expect sales to build closer to Christmas. Most 
analysts are predicting sales increases of 5% to 10% nationally and 5% to 7% in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those symbolizing shopper attitudes were Pamela Cox and Susan 
Cox-Simmons, twin sisters who roamed for deals at the Westside Pavilion in Los 
Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm inclined to wait for more bargains, but it depends on what I find today," 
Cox said. "If I know the cost is the least for something on my list -- I'll 
buy."  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, shoppers in Southern California appeared to be responsive to 
promotions as well as discounts.  
</P>
<P>
 At the JCPenney Co. store at the Oaks, for instance, sales clerks were handing 
out 6,500 Christmas ornaments that contained coupons worth $5 to $250. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to give something out without asking for something in exchange," 
said clerk Sharon Wascher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza sponsored a Santa Claus parade Friday, 
complete with marching bands. It seemed to work. After just four hours of 
business, the mall's KayBee toy store was on pace to double the sales generated 
a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating big business, manager Karl Allen brought in nearly all of his 
employees and said he still could have used more to accommodate the lines of 
parents stretching across the store's aisles in search of Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Department stores at the Oaks have so far been unable to find enough workers 
to fill their holiday slots. Marketing director Diana Brandes said the stronger 
economy has brought more shoppers but fewer people needing temporary, hourly 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, prize giveaways boosted the turnout at the Sherman Oaks 
Galleria for the kickoff of promotions that will continue through Christmas 
Eve. Shoppers who obtained a free membership in the Galleria's Top Shopper Club 
were eligible for random drawings for $100 and $250 gift certificates and for 
free trips to Hawaii, Lake Tahoe and Desert Hot Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other malls, the Century City shopping center offered free gift 
wrapping and free engraving. But it also offered free gifts with minimum 
purchases and even free use of a massage chair for weary shoppers. But the most 
common shopper incentives were discount sales events. For example, Bullock's 
and Robinsons-May marked some merchandise down 50%, and the Broadway offered 
savings of 33% to 40%. The Los Angeles-based Broadway chain was satisfied, if 
not exactly euphoric, with the consumer response to its discounts, said Bill 
Ihle, a company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thus far, turnout has been good and we've been pleased," Ihle said. "Sales 
have been within expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations of Southland retailers are generally upbeat, recent polls 
have shown. But sales increased only slightly compared to the same Friday a 
year ago because serious bargain hunters did much of the buying while others 
merely window-shopped, said Richard Giss, a Los Angeles-based partner with the 
retail services group of the giant accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche.  
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, consumers are being drawn by door-busting sales and promotions," 
Giss said. "The idea is to get the shoppers in early because it helps build 
more customer traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Deloitte & Touche surveyed about 175 shoppers at a dozen Southland malls to 
identify buying trends. Giss said surveyors found that department stores 
offering more expensive clothing had difficulty drawing buyers. But after years 
of weak clothing sales in Southern California, survey respondents Friday 
expressed a strong interest in apparel -- a sign that shoppers want garments at 
low prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's on-the-scene survey underscored findings of a Deloitte & Touche poll 
earlier this month, a survey that indicated that consumers are more optimistic 
about the Southern California economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Lopez, an Anaheim resident, may personify that combination of 
thriftiness and optimism. Lopez, 59, is unemployed but expects to find work 
early next year. For that reason, she shopped for her 12 grandchildren at a 
Mervyn's store in Anaheim Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, I don't have much of the green stuff, but they are all going to 
get some clothes because that is what they need," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were willing to spend more heavily if the price was right. Darlene Mims 
of Los Angeles shopped for a dollhouse for her daughter and found the best 
price at Toys R Us in Culver City. She ended up buying three -- sets 
representing Latinos, Anglos and African Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 The slump in apparel sales is expected to end nationwide this holiday season 
largely because of pent-up demand. Retailers said women's mohair sweaters and 
velvet blouses and skirts were popular Friday. Sweater shirts and flannel 
shirts for men sold well. Children's favorites included the Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers, Lion King merchandise and electronic learning aids such as 
GeoSafari. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buying seems to be concentrated on moderate items -- products under $50," 
said Kurt Barnard, a New Jersey-based retail economist and head of Barnard's 
Retail Consulting Group. "Nationwide, the malls are packed, but shoppers are 
mainly seeking low prices and good buys." At the upscale three-level Bellevue 
Square in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, despite the pricey feel of many of 
the mall's stores, most shoppers had functional items in mind.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Maria Bryant of nearby Redmond said they plan to spend perhaps $400 
for everybody in the family. "I guess if we include ourselves, maybe $500 or 
$600," Mike said. "That's more than we spent last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday retail sales are expected to be especially strong in the East, and the 
season appears to be off to a rousing start in some regions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, crowds were widespread at the Aventura Mall, one of the area's 
largest shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far today, it's busier than expected," said Jennifer Toro, a sales 
assistant at the mall's Macy's store. "People were waiting outside at 7:30 a.m. 
when I came in to work. Sales this year are much better than last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout was also impressive at the flagship Macy's store on 34th Street in 
Manhattan. "I can tell you that it's been packed all day since the store opened 
at eight," said Macy spokeswoman Patti Schrickram. "There were people waiting 
at the doors, throngs of shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing trend in New York, however, was similar to that elsewhere. 
Although the crowds were large, many weren't buying. The lines to see Macy's 
famed Santa, Santaland and the Puppet Theatre were sometimes longer than many 
of the cash register lines combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers around the country don't know yet just how good sales were Friday, 
but this year's day-after-Thanksgiving extravaganza clearly upheld its 
tradition as a major shopping day.

CENTRAL AMERICA; LEADERS WORRY: AFTER PROP. 187, THE DELUGE; LATIN PRESIDENTS 
FEAR A MASSIVE RETURN OF CITIZENS. THEY HOPE TO LOBBY CLINTON AT UPCOMING MIAMI 
SUMMIT. 
</P>

<P>
 Central American presidents will carry the divisive issue of immigration to 
next month's Summit of the Americas in Miami, where they plan to tell President 
Clinton that only improved economies can stanch the northward flow of illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing outrage at California's Proposition 187 and other symptoms of what 
they see as an anti-immigrant backlash, the region's leaders have begun a 
full-scale lobbying effort to prevent a feared massive return of citizens to 
cash-strapped and politically troubled home countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a kind of new racism (in the United States) that is very dangerous," 
Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol said. "We are extremely worried about 
our compatriots . . . (and) we must study why the U.S. people are turning to 
rejection of minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 "Denying health and education to children is really deplorable," Honduran 
President Carlos Roberto Reina said, echoing others who have said the 
California measure, approved overwhelmingly by voters, violates basic human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Central America's economies rely heavily on the money that its 
citizens living in the United States send home. An end to those remittances, 
because Central Americans are either being deported or forced further 
underground, would spell disaster for the region, officials here argue. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of El Salvador -- the source country of tens of thousands of illegal 
immigrants in Southern California -- is especially acute. Salvadorans in the 
United States were granted temporary protected status in 1990 because of the 
civil war that raged between leftist guerrillas and a U.S.-backed government in 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
 That special status allowed many Salvadorans to live and work in the United 
States legally. It expires at the end of the year, and with the war officially 
over since 1992, an extension seems unlikely. The prospect has sent Salvadoran 
officials into panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol made a personal appeal to Vice President Al Gore during an 
ecological meeting in Managua, Nicaragua, last month, and Salvadorans on both 
the left and right are lobbying to have the status extended, saying that the 
stability of the country is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 The remittances from Salvadorans in the United States exceed $800 million a 
year, more than all export income combined, according to the Central Bank here. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Guatemalans and Nicaraguans also send home money that is 
crucial to those nations' economies. Neither group has the same protected 
status as the Salvadorans, but through asylum and other programs, many have 
been able to establish legal, if temporary, stays. They too would be hurt under 
measures aimed at clamping down on immigrants, officials in Central America 
maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fear is the 187 phenomenon is going to spread," said Managua Mayor 
Arnoldo Aleman. "It is not going to stop in California."  
</P>
<P>
 The Central American presidents hope to use the upcoming summit to make a case 
for stopping illegal immigration by bolstering economic and commercial ties 
between their countries and the United States. They want increased access to 
U.S. markets and a shot at attracting more foreign investment as a way to make 
their economies stable enough to support an eventual return of exiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as being of mutual benefit, a two-way road," Nicaraguan Foreign 
Minister Ernesto Leal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon Sol agreed: "The United States is going to have immigrants -- with 
laws like 187 and without them, with extended stays and without them -- because 
that is the reality. The people of Central America will go to the United 
States, or they will go elsewhere, in search of better living conditions if 
they don't find them in their countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and 33 of the hemisphere's heads of state begin the three-day summit 
in Miami on Dec. 9, the first such meeting in 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Clinton's newly weakened position, however, it remains unclear whether 
the plea of the Central Americans will have much impact. U.S. officials in 
Central America seem to be preparing for the inevitable, seeking to emphasize 
the potential benefits of returning, highly skilled, U.S.-trained exiles. An 
Unwelcome Proposition 
</P>
<P>
 Although they concede that conditions in their countries have contributed to 
the flight of their peoples, leaders of Central American nations still say they 
are furious about U.S. immigration initiatives such Proposition 187. They plan 
to make ther strong feelings known during President Clinton's summit in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is going to have immigrants -- with laws like 187 and 
without them, with extended stays and without them -- because that is the 
reality."

REP. MICHEL WARNS GOP OF EVILS OF HUBRIS; HOUSE: THE RETIRING MINORITY LEADER 
TELLS THE NEW LEADERS NOT TO BE 'CLAWING AT POWER.' HE ALSO ADMITS REGRET FOR 
LOSING A CHANCE AT SPEAKER'S SEAT. 
</P>

<P>
 Republicans marching toward a majority in the House of Representatives got a 
stern warning from outgoing leader Robert H. Michel: Don't let it go to your 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, the top Republican in the House since 1981, also said in an interview 
published Friday in the Chicago Tribune that the "contract with America" 
Republicans campaigned on could actually worsen the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The 71-year-old Michel, who was first elected to Congress in 1956, decided not 
to seek reelection this year, so he was not in the running for the Speaker's 
seat when his party won control of the House for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first interview since the election, Michel told the paper he was 
disappointed about that. While watching election returns Nov. 8, it dawned on 
him what might have been. "I said, 'Oh my God, wouldn't it have been nice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the power Republicans are now tasting can corrupt them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope it doesn't go to our newly elected leaders' heads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, known for consensus-building rather than confrontation, said he has 
already spoken to Newt Gingrich, the conservative Georgia Republican who is in 
line to become House Speaker, about potential excesses. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited Gingrich's plan to concentrate power in the Speaker's office and 
install committee chairmen to his own liking, partly scrapping the seniority 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "That brings a lot more power up here to the leader," Michel said. "Newt knows 
what he's doing. I didn't crave power when I was leader. I don't know if it 
would have changed if I were Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a danger in clawing at power because power corrupts and 
absolute power corrupts absolutely," he said, borrowing a famous dictum of 
19th-Century British historian Lord Acton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich spokesman Tony Blankley said Gingrich has great respect for Michel's 
opinions, but believes his own style is best for a majority party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our judgment . . . that the organization we had in the past, while 
suited for a minority party, would not provide the kind of cohesive leadership 
we need to actually get legislation passed," Blankley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Michel also criticized the "contract with America," saying 
its tax-cutting and defense-spending provisions could worsen the budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 Republican House candidates signed the 10-point contract, 
essentially a congressional party platform. 
</P>
<P>
 But Michel said its promised $500-per-child tax credit and other provisions 
would be money losers and could drive up the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel said he was proud to spearhead President Ronald Reagan's economic plans 
but acknowledged that "we ran up one healthy deficit for our kids out there."  
</P>
<P>
 Michel acknowledged Republicans had inflicted a devastating blow to Democrats, 
but said he doesn't expect Democrats "to take this thing lying down." 
</P>
<P>
 "Overplaying your hand in the majority can lend itself to the minority in 
justifying itself in really sticking it to you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel also assailed what he called the election's "nationalized campaign of 
antagonism." 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one whale of a negative campaign against the President," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled listening to conservative radio talk shows before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen to those people's venom," he recalled telling his wife. "Ye gods, 
that's what people are listening to. I'm thinking: 'Jeepers, creepers, if 
that's what motivating the people out there. . . .' "

ISRAEL AND SYRIA: 1 GOAL, 2 VIEWS; MIDEAST: U.S. TRIES TO BROKER DIFFERENCES IN 
PERCEPTION AS OLD ENEMIES STRIVE FOR PEACE.

 It was, the Syrian foreign minister said later, a most shocking scene: 
American Jewish leaders took over the office of a leading congressman, and one 
even sat in the lawmaker's own chair. To the Syrian, it was a clear indication 
of the unchecked power of the Jewish lobby in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials in turn expressed alarm at the astonishment voiced by the 
foreign minister, Farouk Shareh. To them, Shareh's reaction to the meeting in 
the office of House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) 
underlined a potentially troublesome blind spot in the world view of the Syrian 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 As Secretary of State Warren Christopher prepares for another Middle East 
shuttle next month to mediate peace talks between Israel and Syria, U.S. 
officials are becoming increasingly concerned that miscalculations by the 
Syrians may become a serious obstacle to agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say they are cautiously optimistic that Israel and Syria will 
come to terms next year, before the election season reaches full steam in 
Israel and the United States in 1996. But they worry that the process will be 
complicated -- and possibly derailed -- by the way Syria's leaders view 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has said Syrian President Hafez Assad and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin are seriously striving to reach an agreement that will end the 
Middle East's most bitter conflict and probably clear the way for a 
comprehensive peace between Arabs and Israelis for the first time since the 
birth of the modern state of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are meticulous negotiators who are unwilling to complete an agreement 
until they are sure the details are just right. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials do not object to the painstaking negotiations, but they are 
becoming concerned that one side or the other might inadvertently scuttle the 
talks by pressing for more than the other side is able to give. 
</P>
<P>
 On Rabin's side, the process is complicated by Israel's internal political 
situation. He has said repeatedly that he will not accept an agreement unless 
he is sure that it will win the support of a majority of the Israeli public. To 
Rabin's right, the opposition Likud Party is trying to whip up resistance to 
the foundation of the talks -- the exchange of land, the Golan Heights, for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 On Assad's side, U.S. officials are concerned that the Syrian president is so 
determined to impress other Arab leaders with his toughness that he will fail 
to take "yes" for an answer on his bedrock demand for Israeli withdrawal from 
the Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 On each side, distrust of the other may be so pervasive that genuine attempts 
at compromise will be written off as empty posturing. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say the primary purpose of Christopher's frequent trips to 
Damascus and Jerusalem is to try to nudge the Syrian and Israeli negotiating 
positions closer together. But they say a major secondary objective is to try 
to reconcile the differences between the way the two sides view reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has said he tries to explain to each leader the other's viewpoint, 
to correct misperceptions on either side and to identify possible areas of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say it is a slow and subtle process, because Christopher tries 
to avoid direct confrontations with either Assad or Rabin. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of this year, the Syrian leadership has been trying to reach out to 
the Israeli public and the American Jewish community to convince them of 
Assad's good intentions. But most of the overtures have been a bit off-key, 
often because of Syria's perceptions of history and reality. 
</P>
<P>
 When Shareh visited the United States in early October to attend the opening 
of the U.N. General Assembly, for instance, he made two highly unusual gestures 
toward Israel and its U.S. backers. He granted an interview to Israeli 
television, and he met with a group of American Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting with the Jewish leaders was held in Hamilton's office because 
Shareh was already there for a meeting with the Foreign Affairs Committee 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 No one on the American side considered the venue at all unusual, but Shareh 
viewed it as confirmation of his belief that Jewish groups wield undue 
influence on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareh's interview with Israeli television was unprecedented. Less than three 
years earlier, at the Middle East peace conference in Madrid, he had refused to 
go ahead with a press conference until Israeli reporters left the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the interview was diplomatically vague. But in response to the last 
question, Shareh infuriated many Israelis by insisting that Syrian gunners had 
never attacked Israeli civilian targets during the wars between the two 
countries. He said people who believe otherwise were misled by the 
"Zionist-controlled international news media." 
</P>
<P>
 Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said later that 
Shareh's answer had undone at least part of the good that the interview had 
done for Israeli-Syrian relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambassador speculated that Shareh probably genuinely believed that Syria 
had not shelled Israeli civilians and that international newspapers were 
controlled by pro-Israel Jews; both assertions are integral parts of 
traditional Syrian propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad participated personally in another slightly out-of-focus attempt to 
reach Israeli public opinion. During a joint press conference with President 
Clinton in the Syrian capital of Damascus last month, Assad called on the 
diplomatic correspondent of the Jerusalem Post to ask a question. Syrian 
officials had agreed in advance to permit the correspondent to attend the press 
conference and ask a question. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporter asked about public opinion polls showing that a majority of the 
Israeli population distrusted Assad's motives and doubted his assertions that 
he wanted to make peace. Assad, finding the question offensive, replied angrily 
that his word should be good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing we have that proves our design for peace, except our saying 
that we want peace," he said. "And anyone who does not believe what we are 
saying, he would have no other way for peace."

PALESTINIAN MEDIATORS HOPEFUL AFTER HAMAS POSTPONES RALLY IN GAZA CITY; 
MIDEAST: FREEZING RAIN FORCES CANCELLATION. DELAY MAY HELP EASE FACTIONAL 
TENSIONS, OBSERVERS SUGGEST.

 Leaders of the militant Islamic movement Hamas called off a rally Friday that 
they had hoped would draw tens of thousands of supporters into the heart of the 
Gaza Strip exactly a week after Hamas members clashed there with Palestinian 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas announced that the rally was postponed until today because a freezing 
early morning rain had turned many of Gaza's dirt roads into mud. But 
Palestinians who have been mediating between Hamas and Palestine Liberation 
Organization leader Yasser Arafat's administration welcomed the postponement as 
a sign that both sides are interested in easing tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a man who has been carrying on the reconciliation efforts, I am very 
glad," said Dr. Ahmed Tibi, an activist in the PLO's mainstream Fatah faction. 
"Today was a test case, and all of us passed it. It is a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday evening, Hamas announced that a memorial service will be held today in 
Gaza for Imad Akil, a member of a Hamas militia who is believed to have killed 
more than a dozen Israeli soldiers before being shot dead by troops a year ago. 
Akil is a folk hero to many Gazans. His picture is commonly displayed in shops, 
and audiocassettes detailing his life in heroic terms sell well. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ongoing efforts of Tibi and other mediators to work out an overall 
political accord between Arafat and Hamas, negotiations now seem limited to 
day-to-day crisis management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that we are suffering from some sort of sickness," said Dr. 
Haidar Abdel Shafei, a former Palestinian peace mediator who has become one of 
Arafat's harshest non-fundamentalist critics in Gaza. "It is a sort of moral 
sickness, and it is the product of the quality of Palestinian leadership over 
the years." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdel Shafei blames what he terms Arafat's authoritarian leadership style for 
Gaza's deepening economic and political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been doing things one way, and it is far from a democratic way, for so 
many years that he's unable to change now," Abdel Shafei said. "It is 
endangering the peace process, and it is endangering our prospects for 
realizing our national objectives." 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between Hamas and Arafat's struggling self-governing authority 
exploded into the first armed clash between Palestinian police and militants on 
Nov. 18, after thousands of Hamas supporters gathered at a mosque in Gaza City 
for noon prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police reportedly opened fire after some worshipers spilled out of 
the mosque into the street and began pelting the police with stones and 
taunting them as tools of the Israeli army. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 12 Palestinians died in the ensuing riot, and more than 100 were 
wounded. Hamas and another extremist group, Islamic Jihad, have termed the 
confrontation a massacre and are demanding that Arafat accept responsibility 
for the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has appointed a commission of inquiry but has blamed Israeli agents, 
Hamas and Iran for the casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 He also staged two rallies supporting him and the Palestinian Authority that 
he heads, one in Gaza and the other in Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands attended the rallies, which were meant to show that Arafat's Fatah 
faction still dominates the Palestinian streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The rallies infuriated Hamas, and its leaders seem determined to contest 
Arafat for popular support.

PALESTINIAN CAMP FIGHTING KILLS 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Vicious fighting broke out early Friday between supporters and opponents of 
PLO leader Yasser Arafat in a refugee camp in the southern Lebanese city of 
Sidon, leaving 10 people dead and 15 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Ein el Hilweh, a community of 60,000 Palestinian refugees, became a 
battleground as followers of the militant Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements, 
which oppose Arafat's peace accord with Israel, fought Arafat loyalists with 
AK-47 assault rifles and grenade launchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arafat loyalists, led by Lt. Col. Kemal Medhat, attempted to oust the 
dissidents from certain areas of the camp. The dissidents' strength has grown 
since the signing of the limited autonomy accord with Israel in September, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the anti-Arafat forces, Lt. Col. Munir Makdah, blamed the 
Palestine Liberation Organization chief for fomenting the confrontation to 
divert world attention from the deaths last week of at least 12 Arafat 
opponents who clashed with Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's nine-hour battle -- the worst in the camp in more than a year -- 
stopped when mediators arranged a cease-fire for noon prayers, but residents 
reported that firing could be heard again as night fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon's Palestinian factions complied with a Lebanese army order in 1991 to 
surrender their heavy weapons, but an exception was granted for medium- and 
lightweight arms, based on the camp leaders' fear of attacks similar to the 
massacres in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN FATAL BLAZE AT POLISH PORT; FIRE: A TEEN-AGER WAS TRAMPLED 
AS FANS FLED MTV AWARDS TELECAST. 200 OTHERS REMAIN HOSPITALIZED.

 Polish authorities suspect that a fire that killed two people Thursday night 
at a big-screen telecast of the MTV European Music Awards in the port city of 
Gdansk was intentionally set, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too early to say it was arson, but everything so far indicates that it 
was," said Wojciech Deptula, spokesman for the Gdansk regional police. "That is 
what all the witnesses say." 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-year-old girl was trampled to death when panicked fans fled through a 
narrow doorway in the burning concert hall, which is located in the Gdansk 
Shipyard, birthplace of the Solidarity mass labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
 A second victim, believed to be a woman, was found burned beyond recognition 
in the charred ruins of the building, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people were injured in the blaze, including two firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred people remained hospitalized on Friday, including 16 listed in 
critical condition, according to the Gdansk provincial governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 About 700 rock fans had packed the concert hall to watch a live satellite 
broadcast of the music awards, which were presented late Thursday night and 
early Friday in Berlin. The Gdansk event was organized by a local radio 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters three hours to bring the blaze under control; it burned 
dangerously close to the shipyard's chemical storage facilities, although it 
did not spread beyond the concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Evacuation of the burning building was delayed, according to some accounts, 
because fans initially believed the fire was part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses told police that youths had been seen spilling flammable 
liquids in the hall prior to the fire. Others said a Molotov cocktail had been 
thrown into the building, and there were reports of a man with a bottle of 
gasoline jumping on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have put together a portrait of a suspected arsonist," Deptula said. "But 
the building is still being inspected by a team of arson specialists."

ATTACK ON ARTIST MAY HAVE BEEN MISTAKE

<P>
 A car bomb explosion that blew off the legs of a prominent Dutch artist may 
have been a case of mistaken identity, a national newspaper reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch Television reported Friday night that an arrest had been made in the 
case, but no further details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Scholte, one of the country's most successful contemporary artists, was 
seriously injured when a hand grenade exploded in his car shortly after he 
started it Thursday. He was listed in stable condition at the city's Free 
University Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rotterdam daily NRC Handelsblad said the car bomb was likely meant for an 
Amsterdam lawyer who had recently received several death threats. The NRC, the 
nation's newspaper of record, did not cite its sources.

MARINES HEAD TO WATERS OFF BOSNIA IN CASE PEACEKEEPER RESCUE NEEDED

 The Clinton Administration dispatched 2,000 U.S. Marines to waters off 
Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday in case they are needed to help rescue U.N. 
peacekeeping forces being held hostage by Serbian nationalists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines are assigned to a Navy amphibious group that includes a helicopter 
aircraft carrier and an amphibious assault ship.It was on a port call in 
southern France before Friday's order. 
</P>
<P>
 The action followed a flurry of telephone conversations between top U.S. 
policy-makers and their counterparts in the United Nations and in European 
governments that have peacekeeping troops stationed in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the major mission of the Marines will be to stand by to 
help rescue the U.N. peacekeepers if the Serbs should start harming them or 
holding them as political hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Expeditionary Unit to which the troops are attached is trained in 
rescue procedures and includes a special operations unit. It is also equipped 
with mechanized weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the deployment is the only military action the 
Administration is contemplating now. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphibious group now on its way to Bosnia is expected to reach the 
Adriatic Sea in a couple of days. The flagship of the group is the Nassau, a 
helicopter carrier.

RESEARCHER ACCUSED OF FAKING DATA; SCIENCE: EX-MIT STAFFER IS APPEALING THE 19 
ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT. HER STUDY PURPORTED TO USE GENES TO TRANSFER DISEASE 
RESISTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators have concluded that a former MIT researcher faked 
research on antibodies, raising false hope that she had discovered a way to 
transfer resistance to disease, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Office of Research Integrity said it found Thereza Imanishi-Kari 
guilty of 19 allegations of misconduct, including charges she lied to cover up 
her actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Imanishi-Kari has filed an appeal with the Department of Health and Human 
Services, officials said. Investigators told Imanishi-Kari of their findings 
three months ago and released them to the public Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the appeal fails, Imanishi-Kari will be barred from receiving federal 
grants or contract money for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The research was funded by grants from the federal Public Health Service while 
Imanishi-Kari worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her results 
were published in the April 25, 1986, issue of the journal Cell in an article 
co-authored by Nobel laureate David Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 The article "purposed to show that a gene from one strain of mouse had been 
transferred to another strain of mouse, resulting in the latter's production of 
high levels of antibody molecules it would not normally produce -- antibody 
molecules mimicking the antibody molecules produced by the original strain," 
investigators said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble began when a colleague, Margot O'Toole, reported that she could not 
duplicate the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declined to file charges in July, 1992, but HHS continued to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 After Imanishi-Kari's data was challenged, she lied to cover up her 
fabrications, investigators said. "Further fabrications appeared in her letter 
of correction, also published in Cell, and in two grant applications submitted 
to the National Institutes of Health," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The results had no immediate impact on human health, but they may have led 
other scientists to waste time and resources, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides raising the false hope that a way had been found to transfer 
resistance to disease, the research may have caused other researchers to pursue 
unproductive studies," the statement said. "Other scientists have not been able 
to reproduce the most significant findings claimed in Cell." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they arrived at their conclusions after reviewing 
scientific evidence and performing a computerized statistical analysis that 
showed the false data was not made up of chance errors, but deliberate ones 
aimed at a particular result.

JESSE JACKSON JOINS CALLS TO DENY KEY SENATE POST TO HELMS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson joined the outcry over Sen. Jesse Helms' remarks about 
President Clinton, urging that Helms be denied the chairmanship of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent Friday to Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, Jackson said 
Helms' "reckless" and "irresponsible" behavior should disqualify him from the 
post when the Republicans take control of Congress in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms, a North Carolina Republican, suggested the President was so unpopular 
with military personnel in North Carolina that "he'd better have a bodyguard" 
if he visits the state. The remark, in a newspaper interview, came days after 
Helms called Clinton unfit to be commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a jarring, destabilizing message around the world," Jackson wrote. 
"Lesser governments could be overthrown by such a statement implying military 
disloyalty."

TOMMY BOYCE; CO-WROTE HIT SONGS IN '60S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>

 Tommy Boyce, who with Bobby Hart formed one of the top songwriting teams of 
the mid-1960s, has killed himself, it was learned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce, who with Hart also wrote most of the material for Don Kirshner's 
made-for-TV "The Monkees," was 55, Nashville police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found dead Wednesday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. His 
wife found the body and she told police he had left a suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1960s Boyce and Hart wrote "Last Train to Clarksville," "Valleri" 
and "I'm Not Your Steppingstone." 
</P>
<P>
 They also wrote the 1964 hit single "Come a Little Bit Closer" for Jay and the 
Americans. It reached No. 3 on the pop charts that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce was born in Charlottesville, Va., and moved with his family to Los 
Angeles as a child. He was taught to play guitar by his father, a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 His first success was in 1959, when a song he penned, "Be My Guest," became a 
Top 10 hit for Fats Domino. 
</P>
<P>
 After teaming up with Hart, the duo wrote "Pretty Little Angel Eyes" and 
"Under the Moon of Love," two songs that hit the charts in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce briefly pursued a solo singing career, recording for RCA in late 1962. 
He had a minor hit with "I'll Remember Carol." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966 Boyce and Hart were named musical directors for the NBC-TV situation 
comedy series "The Monkees."  
</P>
<P>
 Among other songs, they wrote "The Monkees Theme (Hey, Hey, We're the 
Monkees)." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men later recorded a Top 40 tune, "Out and About," and followed it up 
with a Top 10 hit, "I Wonder What She's Doing Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975 the two joined former Monkees Mickey Dolenz and Davy Jones to tour and 
record an album for Capitol, "Jones, Dolenz, Boyce and Hart." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyce and Hart split up in the mid-'70s, although both continued to work in 
the music industry. Boyce went to England and worked with Iggy Pop and Meatloaf 
before returning to the United States, while Hart worked in the United States 
for such groups as the Partridge Family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia credits the team with more than 300 
compositions and sales of more than 42 million records.

VIOLA SPOLIN; GURU OF IMPROVISATIONAL THEATER METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viola Spolin, whose innovative dramatic training groups date to the Depression 
and gave impetus to two generations of improvisational performers, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The creator of Theater Games and author of the celebrated "Improvisation for 
the Theater" was 88 when she died Tuesday in Los Angeles, a spokesman for the 
family said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally published in 1963, the first of her several books became a bible of 
the improvisational theater movement -- a movement she shepherded to success in 
the 1950s, beginning with the Compass Theater in Chicago, where students 
included Elaine May, Mike Nichols and later Alan Arkin, Peter Boyle and Valerie 
Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered the grande dame of improvisation, she divided her teachings into 
222 exercises and gave them such mystical names as "Abstract Where" and 
"Transformation." They came from years of work, not just with actors but with 
children, educators, ministers and psychologists when she directed workshops at 
Esalen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The games emerged out of necessity," she told The Times in 1974. "When I had 
a problem (directing) I made up a game. When another problem came up I made up 
a new game." 
</P>
<P>
 Although little-known outside the theater scene, her training and performance 
techniques have become valued tools in the United States and England. 
</P>
<P>
 She emerged from the drama group Neva Boyd's in Chicago. She became drama 
supervisor for the Depression-era Works Project Administration's Recreational 
Project in Chicago. It was a period when government supported thousands of 
unemployed actors throughout the country.  
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, she worked with ghetto children and found that she communicated 
more easily with those young people by replacing language with action; thus 
were born her "games." 
</P>
<P>
 She had come to Hollywood in 1946 and established a Young Actors Company but 
returned to Chicago to found the Compass with her son, Paul Sills, the creator 
of "Story Theater." From its ashes rose the Second City improvisational group, 
out of which came many of the original "Saturday Night Live" crew. 
</P>
<P>
 She urged her students not to burden themselves with "someone else's old 
material" -- meaning playwrights' -- but to become detached and aware. "You 
don't have time to think about yourself . . . all your senses are involved in 
playing a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 One critic wrote that her games were "structures designed to almost fool 
spontaneity into being." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, again in Los Angeles, she conducted workshops for the companies 
of the "Rhoda" and "Friends and Lovers" TV series and appeared as the mother in 
the Paul Mazursky film "Alex in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
 Avery Schreiber, a longtime disciple of Miss Spolin's who continues to teach 
her drama games on both coasts, said Friday that her work "has had a huge 
impact on all of us (comedic actors). 
</P>
<P>
 "Where (director Konstantin) Stanislavsky taught that there should be conflict 
in acting, Viola said you couldn't have conflict without an agreement," said 
the former TV comic, who added that members of the old Second City group 
continue to gather regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Spolin's techniques are now in use throughout the country in university, 
community and professional theater training programs and in educational courses 
unrelated to drama. Even environmentalists employ her games, substituting her 
"There" with "Where" to point out potential environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her son, she is survived by her husband, Robert Kolmus Greene, and 
another son, William Hall Sills. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial donations are asked to be made to the hospice group at St. Joseph 
Medical Center in Burbank.

M. SHAPP; EX-GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Gov. Milton Shapp, a creative populist who guided Pennsylvania through 
the 1970s and was believed to be the first person of Jewish faith to declare 
for the presidency, has died at 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapp, a millionaire businessman before he turned to politics, died Thursday 
of complications of Alzheimer's disease at a hospital in suburban Wynnewood, 
said family friend Richard Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 While governor from 1971 to 1979, the Democratic and popular Shapp instituted 
a state income tax and a state lottery and brought modern management to 
Pennsylvania government. He also lifted Pennsylvania from near-bankruptcy, 
leaving it with a $50-million surplus when he left office after serving the 
two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapp aimed for higher office, but gave up a run for president in 1976 after 
losing to "no preference" in the Florida primary. He jokingly titled his 
unpublished memoirs, "I Never Became the First Jewish President." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of his legacy will be as an advocate of the powerless. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania's lottery provides money for programs for the elderly. Shapp also 
set up a toll-free citizen hot line to the governor and agencies controlling 
strip mining and land reclamation that became national models. 
</P>
<P>
 He established financial disclosure requirements for top state officials, a 
strict ethics code for state employees and a "sunshine law" to open government 
to more public access. 
</P>
<P>
 His involvement with national politics began with his work for John F. 
Kennedy's presidential bid in 1960. Shapp was later a consultant to the Kennedy 
Administration on business and the Peace Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a hardware salesman who was a Republican, Shapp preceded his 
political career by spending 20 years building Jerrold Electronics Corp. -- his 
middle name was Jerrold -- to bring cable television to mountain-locked 
communities. He sold the company in 1966 for more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapp's gubernatorial tenure was tainted by corruption. Though never linked to 
wrongdoing, some of his aides and Democratic allies were indicted. However, 
only one lower-level official was convicted for taking kickbacks.

MEMBERS OF INTERIM RWANDA PARLIAMENT ARE SWORN IN; AFRICA: NEW MPS PLEDGE TO 
WORK TOWARD UNITY IN NATION WHERE UP TO A MILLION PEOPLE DIED IN MASSACRES AND 
CIVIL WAR.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwanda in stalled an interim Parliament on Friday with the enormous tasks of 
reconciling its two main ethnic groups, rebuilding its economy and ushering in 
democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the 70 members of the Transitional National Assembly stood, Bible 
in hand, and took an oath before hundreds of their countrymen in a Kigali 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 They pledged to work toward unity of their central African country, in which 
up to a million people died in massacres and civil war between April and July. 
Most of the victims were members of the minority Tutsi tribe killed by the 
majority Hutu. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first step toward democratic rule, toward unity of our country, 
and you men and women must work to make that a reality," Prime Minister Faustin 
Twagirimungu told them. 
</P>
<P>
 The assembly is made up of representatives nominated by eight political 
parties and the Tutsi-led rebel army that defeated the previous Hutu-dominated 
government and army in July. 
</P>
<P>
 It allegedly excludes parties implicated in the genocide. Members will serve 
for five years, after which presidential and parliamentary elections have been 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 Head of State Pasteur Bizimungu presided over the swearing-in, accompanied by 
Vice President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Rwandans and outsiders believe that the country cannot know peace as long 
as nearly 2 million Hutus, including the troops and militia of the former 
government, are exiled in Zaire, Burundi and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 The government says it wants to put on trial many of those in exile for their 
role in genocide after the assassination of military strongman and president 
Juvenal Habyarimana on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the assembly's most difficult task will be reviving an economy 
shattered by war and starved of foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Western donors are holding back new aid and emergency credits until Rwanda 
reaches an agreement with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, 
which seek repayment of $9 million in arrears. 
</P>
<P>
 Western nations also want to see a move toward democratic rule as conditions 
for resuming bilateral aid.

RWANDA APPOINTS FOREIGN MINISTER

<P>
 Rwanda has named a new foreign minister to replace the former minister who 
fled to Paris last month with up to $187,000 in government cash, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new minister appointed by Prime Minister Faustin Twagirimungu was Anastaza 
Gasana from Twagirimungu's Republican Democratic Movement party, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasana, a former ambassador to the United States, takes over from Jean-Marie 
Ndagijimana, a Hutu, who fled to Paris saying he had fallen out with the 
government over reprisal killings and jailings of Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials in Kigali say he was a thief who stole money meant for Rwanda's 
New York mission.

ARISTIDE CALLS ON U.S. TROOPS TO DISARM THUGS, ARMY UNITS; HAITI: HE SAYS 
RETURN TO DEMOCRACY IS JEOPARDIZED. AMERICAN MILITARY IS WARY OF BEING DRAWN 
INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, voicing his government's growing distress, 
said Friday that Haiti's fragile return to democracy will be jeopardized if 
U.S. troops here fail to disarm civilian thugs and army units with questionable 
loyalty to the new rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to continue disarming the terrorists, those who are killing people 
and still have weapons, waiting for the moment to come out and make trouble," 
Aristide said in an interview in the Presidential Palace. "It is not enough to 
just disarm some of them. We should be moving fast. This is the cry of the 
Haitian people. It is the will of the Haitian people, and I welcome this cry, 
and I share it." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's comments marked the first public note of discord between his 
government and Washington since his return Oct. 15, although he and U.S. 
officials stressed that working relations remain excellent. In his statements, 
the president betrayed what appears to be increasing nervousness over some U.S. 
actions here -- particularly concerning the size and role of the Haitian army 
-- and over the Clinton Administration's plans to turn security duties over to 
a U.N. force within the shortest time possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, sitting in a sparse office, showed a flash of indignation when asked 
why U.S. forces, which had arrested many of those suspected of participating in 
political violence against his followers, have freed some of the most notorious 
people after about three weeks' detention. Among those freed have been Max 
Paul, the former head of the port and a close business associate of former 
Port-au-Prince police commander Michel-Joseph Francois. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials had said previously that those arrested would be turned over to 
the Haitian judicial system once it is functioning again. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have declared that they now view the Haitian situation as 
stable. Wary of getting sucked into law enforcement activities they are not 
trained for, they have stopped searching for weapons.

MILITARY SEEKS TO GIVE MORE ACTIVE ROLES TO RESERVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. armed services, in a step endorsed by Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry, are looking for ways to make more use of reservists in carrying out the 
military's work, a Defense Department spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expansion is the right word to use" because no new roles are being 
considered, the spokesman, Maj. Tom Schultz, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Military reserves and the National Guard already perform more than one-third 
of the military's daily activities, ranging from administrative support to 
airlift, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater use of reservists would make it easier for the U.S. military to meet 
global commitments at the same time the size of the U.S. armed forces is being 
scaled back. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 1.03 million people in the six Reserve and National Guard wings 
under Defense Department control. About 1.6 million men and women are on active 
duty in the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not looking at doing anything new . . . just looking at things we're 
already doing and finding ways to expand that," Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry has endorsed the concept of greater use of reservists, Schultz said. The 
Army, Navy and Air Force are engaged in determining how it could be done, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its Friday editions, the New York Times said officials were considering 
having reservists use annual training to carry out real operations, including 
overseas peacekeeping assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the plan say it would give reservists valuable experience while 
reducing the strain on regular troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army plans to send a battalion of 430 reservists and 110 active-duty 
soldiers for a six-month rotation in a multinational observer force in the 
Sinai, the first time since the Army began sending troops there in the early 
1980s that it was sending reservists.

PROP. 187 SPONSORS BLAME FOES FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' FEARS OVER SEEKING HEALTH 
CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Proposition 187 is enjoined by the courts, those fearful of using public 
health care services can only look to the measure's foes for blame, sponsors of 
the ballot initiative say. 
</P>
<P>
 "187 has had no effect at all on public health care yet," Ron Prince said. "If 
there's a misperception of such a prohibition, I'd look more at the 
misinformation campaign of our opponents (before the election) trying to incite 
that fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many lies spread about this that it's understandable there 
could be some confusion. But the people to look to for responsibility for that 
are the people who spread those lies and deliberately encouraged it for 
political gain because they knew they weren't true and they wanted to frighten 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Prince strongly defended the health care provisions of the 
initiative, which, if they take effect after court challenges, would bar 
illegal immigrants from receiving non-emergency service at any publicly funded 
hospital or health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're here illegally, they won't be able to get it for free if it's not 
emergency health care," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 co-author Alan C. Nelson went a step further, suggesting that 
opponents of the initiative should "work in a positive way" to persuade illegal 
immigrants to go back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "187 will make it a lot tougher for illegals to stay here, and that's the 
intent," said Nelson, director of the federal Immigration and Naturalization 
Service during the Ronald Reagan Administration. "Maybe some of these groups 
ought to tell them maybe they ought to be returning to their home countries and 
go to the schools and (medical facilities) there." 
</P>
<P>
 David Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, 
bristles at such statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ron Prince and others like him need to look inward and perhaps accept some of 
the blame for this hateful initiative instead of trying to spread it out to 
everybody else," Langness said. They were the ones who wrote it and got it 
passed, he added, "and now that the consequences are coming home to roost, in 
typical fashion they want to blame everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not leadership, that's cowardice."

STORM BATTERS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH RAIN, SNOW AND HIGH WINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A powerful winter storm moved across Northern California on Friday, shutting 
down two major highways and bringing rain, hail, snow and strong winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate 80 over the Donner Summit near Truckee and U.S. 50, the main 
east-west route to Lake Tahoe, were closed for most of the day by heavy snows 
and high winds, the California Highway Patrol reported.The roadways were 
reopened around 7:30 p.m., but chains were required. 
</P>
<P>
 Snowfall amounts through today may total 12 to 15 inches in the 
Shasta-Siskiyou region, the National Weather Service said. The higher 
elevations of the Sierra Nevada may receive two to three feet of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm brought widely scattered showers to the San Francisco Bay Area, 
causing minor flooding at some intersections. Hail was reported in Oakland and 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm produced sporadic rainfall of about half an inch in the Bay Area 
during the early morning. Novato in Marin County had more than two inches later 
in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain gauges in the Santa Cruz Mountains indicated that some areas received 
more than an inch of rain overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cold front moved through the Bay Area, some locations reported winds 
gusting to near 50 m.p.h.

ANOTHER LOOK AT FIRE DEPT. PERSONNEL; INDEPENDENT PANEL WILL REVIEW AUDIT'S 
FINDINGS OF PREJUDICE AND HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rightly, the Los Angeles Fire Commission signaled this week that it is 
concerned about the Fire Department's personnel practices. A city audit of the 
department had found that women and minority firefighters were subjected to 
sexual and racial harassment; however, top fire officials claimed that the 
department's own data contradicted the audit's findings. Now the commission has 
appointed an independent panel to find out what's really going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, to be led by attorney Gilbert T. Ray, will review the disputed 
audit, interview department members and examine other Fire Department data. Ray 
cautioned that his four-to-six-week study will "be far from a definitive 
piece." But definitive or not, if Ray's panel corroborates the audit's 
findings, the Fire Department must take immediate remedial steps. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, made public earlier this month, paints an appalling picture of life 
inside the Fire Department for women and minority recruits. White males hold 
95% of the top department posts, none of which are held by Asian Americans, 
blacks or women. The audit identified what it termed "rookie kill stations," 
where efforts are made to run women and minorities out of the department -- 
this after 20 years of affirmative action policies. Those efforts, 
unfortunately, have been successful; the audit found the attrition rate for 
women and minorities to be significantly higher than for white men. There is 
simply no excuse for harassment and racism, and if the commission's independent 
panel finds the audit credible, change must be immediate and far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, serious allegations such as those lodged against the Fire Department 
have also been made against other city agencies of late. Just this year, both 
the Los Angeles Police Department and the city's Department of Water and Power 
came under intense scrutiny and criticism in the wake of appalling charges of 
sexual harassment. In response, the Police Commission has created a unit within 
the LAPD to investigate complaints of harassment and discrimination. The DWP, 
following a $1.5-million settlement of a harassment case brought by a former 
employee and revelation of about 100 sexual harassment complaints against the 
agency over the last two years, says it is reviewing its procedures for 
handling sexual harassment cases. It also says it is renewing its commitment to 
ending this illegal and disgraceful behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, top fire officials may need to step forward as well, and city officials 
must hold the department accountable for any reform that is needed.

A BLESSED MOMENT OF PEACE IN ANGOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The days-old truce appears to be holding in Angola. But if history is any 
guide there is no guarantee this latest deal will nurture a lasting peace in 
what is Africa's longest civil war ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has encouraged democracy in the southwestern 
African nation by recognizing President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who was 
elected freely and fairly. That diplomatic step was a breakthrough departure 
from the policy of the Reagan and Bush administrations, which refused to 
recognize Dos Santos because of his early flirtation with Marxism and his prior 
support from the Soviet Union and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi, the man who would be president, is likely to 
settle for nothing less than a high degree of power. A runoff election between 
Savimbi, who polled 40% in the last election, and Dos Santos, who won 49%, is 
scheduled for 1996 -- if this cease-fire holds that long. That ought to satisfy 
Savimbi, who has charged the elections were marred by fraud, although the 
United Nations declared the voting honest. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce -- the third attempt at peace in five years -- also guarantees 
Savimbi's UNITA rebel movement a place in government. The deal promises Savimbi 
and his supporters several government jobs immediately, possibly including the 
vice presidency for him. That has to be an improvement over the past 
winner-take-all arrangements that excluded the Savimbi camp from the top ranks 
of government. Yet Savimbi didn't personally sign the truce. Citing fears for 
his personal safety, he sent an emissary to the ceremony in Lusaka, Zambia, and 
requested 150 bodyguards. A bad sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Savimbi has proven that he cannot be trusted, this time he may have 
had good reason to believe his life was in danger. After talks were concluded 
successfully, the Angolan army continued to attack UNITA's positions. That's no 
way to encourage trust or peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil war has raged in Angola since 1975 and independence from Portugal. At 
least 500,000 Angolans have died in the fighting, which has devastated much of 
the country. Like Somalia, Angola remains full of weapons and pocked with land 
mines, a legacy of misguided Cold War largess. The conflict pitted the might of 
the United States and men of southern Africa who backed Savimbi against the 
might of the Soviet Union and men of Cuba who back Dos Santos. The outside 
"help" escalated an internecine and ideological conflict into a full-blown war 
that continued after the superpowers lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hope, however, in the region. South Africa is a model of 
reconciliation. Namibia shines with its strong constitution and stable 
government. Angola should take a lesson from those nations.

WHY NO COUNTRY CAN STAND ON ITS OWN; WHAT'S NEEDED IS MULTILATERAL REGULATION 
OF MIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Next month the leaders of the Central American nations and top U.S. and 
Mexican officials will arrive at the Western Hemisphere summit in Miami 
prepared to discuss the migration issue. There is no longer any avoiding it. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all parties in this hemisphere realize that the movement of populations 
across international borders is likely to be a top-table agenda item at any 
such conference for some time to come. For in the aftermath of passage of 
California's Proposition 187, many U.S. politicians -- far too many -- are 
scrambling to figure out how to respond nationally to what they see as the will 
of the people. Or is it simply to exploit political opportunity? Whatever the 
motive, it now seems obvious that something like Proposition 187 will make it 
onto the national stage before long. 
</P>
<P>
 What's especially galling to students of hemispherical politics, however, is 
any suggestion that Mexican authorities have been oblivious to the growing 
friction. In his final State of the Nation address, outgoing Mexican President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari criticized Proposition 187 in no uncertain terms: 
"Local political interests in California tend to blame Mexican workers for the 
ills of that society." The farsighted Salinas added, "Mexico affirms its 
opposition to that xenophobic campaign and will, in fact, continue defending 
the labor and human rights of our migrant workers." 
</P>
<P>
 While that necessary stand no doubt pleased many domestic constituencies, it 
also prompted Mexican human rights authorities to point out that Mexican 
immigration laws are among the harshest and that no fewer than 60,000 
undocumented workers in Mexico -- who are often treated not any better, and 
sometimes worse, than illegal immigrants in the United States -- were deported 
last year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the problem is neither solely a California one nor even a U.S. one but 
one affecting the hemisphere. This is why real progress toward more humane 
regulation of migration will not be made and cannot be made by one nation, much 
less one state. Any such negotiated agreement would not, of course, be a simple 
matter: Both the U.S. and Mexican constitutions, for instance, offer large 
guarantees of freedom to travel and emigrate. Even so, what's needed is some 
way to regulate the flow of workers across borders -- making it aboveboard and 
legal, eliminating the exploitation that comes with criminality. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that a serious bilateral effort to formulate such an approach would 
do far more to regulate cross-border migration, relieve domestic tensions and 
improve Mexican-U.S. relations than all of the grandstanding ideas on both 
sides of the border. As Times Op-Ed page contributor Jorge Castaneda put it 
Friday, "Many business and political leaders in Mexico are now espousing the 
stance that very few (including this writer) staked out during the NAFTA 
debate: that Mexico should have pressed for a chapter on immigration, even if 
that meant complicating the treaty's ratification." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, The Times has suggested a bilateral accord or some kind of 
"North American Free Labor Agreement" as a way of controlling the immigration 
flow. A cross-border labor agreement would only do what NAFTA aims to do with 
the cross-border movement of capital and goods: better regulate the salutary 
economic integration that is already taking place among the United States, 
Mexico and Canada. Such an achievement would be far better than anything else 
now on the horizon.

HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I believe Michael Dear and Jennifer Wolch's article ("Herding the Homeless Is 
an Unjust Answer," Commentary, Nov. 14) contained several inaccurate statements 
regarding the homeless and their adverse impact on the business climate in this 
city. Dear and Wolch wittingly criticize everything from the mayor's plan to 
deal with the homeless, to a California recession, to city government for not 
streamlining permits for new commerce, and of course, resentment toward a 
growing tide of anti-homelessness by other cities that have now enacted 
ordinances against panhandling, feeding programs and public sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently completed a 70-page college research paper ("The Shelter-Resistant 
Homeless and Crime: Los Angeles and Santa Monica"). My research showed that the 
homeless are having a significant impact on crime, the deterioration of the 
area and flight of businesses. A large percentage of the homeless, especially 
the shelter-resistant, are hard-core criminals with prior felony arrests. Some 
of the more prevalent crimes committed by the homeless are murder, robbery, 
rape and burglary of businesses and automobiles. Begging and "pan-hustling" are 
special problems where intimidation is used to acquire donations -- some making 
up to $75 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Los Angeles, which encompasses the Skid Row district, has the 
smallest population in the city at 37,753 residents. Homeless persons represent 
approximately 10% of this population. When comparing this area's crime to the 
other 17 geographic areas of the city, the crime rate per 1,000 persons is four 
times greater than any other area in the city. In Santa Monica, where the 
homeless make up less than 2% of the city's population, they account for over 
one-third of police patrol services and 46% of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Business analysts in Los Angeles report a 45% vacancy factor in the Downtown 
district. They cite the homeless problem and the crime associated with this 
issue as the single greatest reason given by businesses leaving the area -- no 
one cited a recession or inept permit process for moving out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 I for one support Mayor Richard Riordan and Deputy Mayor Rae James' efforts to 
deal with this critical issue. The homeless problem can be solved and the area 
revitalized, but it's going to take some tough decisions on the part of the 
mayor and his staff at the expense of alienating some homeless advocates.

MCMILLAN ON HEMET SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Susan Carpenter McMillan's Column Right, "Ultra-Liberals Fight 
Morality in the Schools" (Nov. 15), we must respond and set the record 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hemet School Board is being sued for its implementation of Sex Respect, 
Teen Aid, and Choosing the Best by a group of concerned parents who have 
children in the school district. Attorneys from Planned Parenthood, People for 
the American Way, and the law firm McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and Enersen are 
representing the parents in this suit. We support their efforts not because we 
are "middle-aged proponents of . . . free-love" as McMillan suggests. We oppose 
the curricula because they are medically inaccurate, racist and gender-biased. 
</P>
<P>
 In our 60 years of service, Planned Parenthood has always supported the 
teaching of abstinence as the wisest choice for young people. The endless 
campaign to misrepresent the goals of Planned Parenthood has grown tiresome, 
and has fooled very few. Each year, thousands of churches, schools and 
community organizations invite Planned Parenthood to present comprehensive 
sexuality education because they know they will get the facts from us. Planned 
Parenthood educators discuss ways teens can say no, reject peer pressure and 
make responsible decisions about their sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot expect every teen to delay sexual activity. The fact McMillan 
conveniently overlooks is that well over half of American teens have already 
engaged in sexual intercourse by the time they graduate from high school. 
Should teens face unwanted pregnancy because people like McMillan feel their 
behavior is immoral? Should young girls who are forced into unwanted sexual 
activity be led to believe they are at fault because Sex Respect taught them 
that boys have difficulty controlling their hormones? Should sexually active 
teens be denied information about HIV/AIDS that could potentially save their 
lives because of the narrow-mindedness of the Hemet school board majority? 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Planned Parenthood has always believed that parents should be 
the primary sexuality educators of their children. Planned Parenthood supports 
parental involvement and school-based sexuality education. We are not suing 
school systems that dare to teach abstinence, we are suing school systems that 
persist in denying lifesaving sexuality information to their students. 
</P>

<P>
 Certainly writer-commentator Susan McMillan ought to know better. The ACLU is 
her support rather than the "ultra-liberal sidekick" of any pressure group, for 
the very press freedom which she lives by -- no less than the rest of us -- is 
alive and well in this country in large part because the First Amendment has 
its watchdog the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 And I wonder whether McMillan has ever lived and worked abroad, for surely she 
would have found that press freedom is rare indeed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, teen-age sex is the issue upon which writers are hired to be 
helpful and are expected not to be carried away by the emotions of the moment. 
It enlightens nobody to accuse Planned Parenthood of advocating free love. 
</P>
<P>
 Also missing from McMillan's competence is awareness of ACLU's limitations. It 
is funded in pennies and does jobs in dollars. Rather than ambulance-chasing as 
McMillan suggests, ACLU's intercession in this case is indicative of a critical 
constitutional issue involved under ACLU criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 As a reporter in New York in 1938, I learned to rely on the ACLU and have 
supported it ever since. It is our ultimate press support, while our free press 
is our ultimate democracy support.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; VOLUNTEERISM: ASK AND THEY WILL COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From parents coaching their children and other youngsters on the soccer field 
to retirees teaching illiterates to read, the number of volunteers across 
Orange County has grown dramatically in recent years. It is a welcome 
development, but there is still room for more. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not have seemed that more were needed this week when a number of people 
wanting to help distribute food and clothing for Thanksgiving were told that 
most charities had all the bodies they could use. A spokesman for United Way in 
Irvine noted that many people "want to participate on (Thanksgiving) Day for 
the moment," a noble impulse. But he also reminded those wanting to lend a hand 
that "there's still a need with Christmas coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County reported this month that 55% of 
Orange County residents volunteer, with nearly half of them helping more than 
one organization. That is an impressive increase from the 29% figure just five 
years ago. The results of the two surveys also represented a turnaround in 
Orange County's profile compared to the national one. The 1989 survey had 
Orange County far below the national percentage of volunteers; this year's put 
it slightly above. 
</P>
<P>
 The higher number was especially welcome because of the tough times reported 
by charities in just staying even in cash donations from one year to the next. 
The recession has led to the exodus of a number of companies from the county. 
Those that do remain are often not as flush as in the past and unable to dig as 
deeply when charities come knocking. Their workers, too, though they have 
managed to hang onto their jobs, do not always feel confident enough to 
contribute money to a church or soup kitchen or senior citizens group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteer Center has aggressively recruited volunteers in the past few 
years, a wise tactic that helped account for the increase. Officials at some 
charities said they believed another factor was that more people were able to 
see for themselves that their efforts were needed as the number of homeless on 
the street increased. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's survey also showed that 90% of county residents see volunteerism 
as important in solving community problems, though only 55% get involved. Most 
who do not volunteer said they do not have time. That is understandable. But 
charities are right to keep knocking on people's doors. The economy is less 
than robust, and disasters like the Laguna Beach fires periodically increase 
the need for help.

CLIPPERS GET HOPES UP BEFORE LOSING YET AGAIN; PRO BASKETBALL: ELLIS' HOT 
FOURTH-QUARTER SHOOTING HELPS WIPE OUT NETS' 20-POINT LEAD BEFORE COMMITTING 
COSTLY MISSTEP IN 107-102 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the outcome in the balance, New Jersey Coach Butch Beard had one thought: 
Let the Clippers win against someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson helped answer Beard's silent prayer with 22 points and 14 
assists Friday as the Nets handed the Clippers their 12th consecutive loss, 
107-102, at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to be the first victim," Nets center Benoit Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ellis scored 19 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter when the 
Clippers' rally stalled on Ellis' misplaced feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 105-102, Ellis hit an apparent three-pointer to tie the game with 
seconds to play. But his feet were on the out-of-bounds line and the basket 
didn't count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellis did have both feet out of bounds. He (the official) called it right," 
said Clippers Coach Bill Fitch, who is 0-2 this season against the team that 
fired him in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets nearly blew the 20-point lead they built in the third quarter by 
allowing the Clippers to close to 104-102 on a layup by Ellis with 1:03 
remaining. Fouled by Kevin Edwards on the drive, Ellis failed to convert the 
free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the three-point line is closer this year, but in the heat of the 
moment, I didn't realize how far I was behind it," Ellis said. "I just knew 
that we needed a three." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers were helped in part by Beard's decision to rest Anderson and 
Derrick Coleman during an eight-minute stretch when Los Angeles rallied. 
</P>
<P>
 Both returned with 2:29 to play, but the benching stiffened Anderson's 
muscles. He was already playing with a sore left wrist that kept him out for 
most of the second half against Sacramento two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clippers are hungry," Anderson said. "They just keep coming at you like 
wild lions. You go out there lackadaisical and they'll beat you. I'm just glad 
we got off to a good start. It gave us a little breathing room." 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, Anderson committed a turnover, but Tony Massenburg missed a 
jumper. Ellis fouled Gilliam, who made one of two free throws to give the Nets 
a 105-102 lead with 36 seconds left. 
</P>

 Just when the Clippers appeared to be hopelessly out of it, they regained 
momentum by scoring 11 straight points to pull to 76-70 with 2:45 left. But New 
Jersey came right back, running off the final nine points to take an 85-70 lead 
into the fourth quarter.

 The Clippers shot a woeful 36 percent (nine-of-25) in the third.

LAPD CAPTAIN SAYS COLISEUM IS SECURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the letter (Viewpoint, Nov. 19) from the Pasadena police commander 
who volunteered his people to police Ram-Raider gams. I can assure him the 
Coliseum is the best-policed stadium in the country.My officers are the most 
experienced, best trained, and best supervised police officers there are. I 
have been the officer in charge of the off-duty LAPD officers at the Coliseum 
since 1979. While the media make much of fan violence, in truth, less than a 
fraction of 1% of the spectators are unruly, and we usually eject them before 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge all football fans to come to our games, college and professional, and 
see how enjoyable the event is, and how quickly and efficiently unruly fans are 
dealt with.

MURRAY CAN'T THINK ABOUT RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Mr. Murray, 
</P>
<P>
 I understand your lament that one of the "better" teams from the Pacific 10 
will not be representing the conference this year. We all know how God-like the 
Nittany Lions are, stuffing that terrific Illinois offense (31 points), 
pounding an excellent Indiana team (35-29) and only allowing Northwestern 475 
yards, including 275 through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 I will go slowly, realizing your football IQ is on the wrong side of the Bell 
Curve, and explain some facts. Oregon won its last six games. The Ducks beat, 
among others, USC, Arizona and Washington. When they played a suspect defense 
(Stanford), they crushed them. They won the Pac-10 title outright. I know, you 
still believe there are better teams in the conference who could stay on the 
field with Penn State. Who, perchance, are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Feel free to write more disparaging remarks on the Ducks. Please build Penn 
State up all you want. They will simply make more noise when they fall. 
</P>

 Shame on you, Jim Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 Your attack on the Ducks was too bad. You could have taken a different path. 
Why not celebrate the Cinderella aspect of this team? Why not recognize that 
the Ducks have overcome every obstacle to claim sole possession of a great 
football conference championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the joy that many on the West Coast feel for the Ducks comes from 
their climb through the vitriolic pessimism of prognosticators like yourself 
who said at season's start that Oregon would finish far back in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you have given up in your own personal struggles. Maybe you still look 
for a note from your doctor to get you out of a tough assignment, but these 
young men of Oregon haven't and don't. They'll be in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 2 
believing in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Take your sarcasm out of the oven -- it's a bit hard-baked.

 Love your column. Read it every chance I get. You make me laugh. You even make 
me want to become a sports columnist at times. 
</P>
<P>
 But you're wrong about the Oregon football team. Nothing I say will convince 
you of that, so we'll just have to wait until Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 I can understand a little ribbing about the matchup. But you went overboard. I 
kept expecting you to come back with a favorable comment to soften the tone, 
but you never did. You never recognized the Ducks' achievements. No pat on the 
back. No offer of any hope from a nationally recognized and respected member of 
the media. You just buried the knife and then kept on twisting it. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the players will read your column. And don't think it won't mean a 
lot to them. I don't know what your goal was in writing it, but I hope it has a 
positive impact on the team.

 Your inability to deal with the fact that a Southern California school was not 
good enough to represent the Pac-10 in this year's Rose Bowl is obvious, and 
amusing to Oregonians. 
</P>
<P>
 We only hope the caravans of Oregon Duck fans returning from Pasadena after a 
Duck victory won't have more Oregon-bound stowaway Californians aboard, looking 
to escape the L.A. area in search of a better quality of life -- and the Pac-10 
title.

 Using you as an example, hopefully more athletes will realize that a

not the players, have the right and responsibility of selecting their starting 
team.

THE NFL; HERE COMES JIMMY AND THE CHANGE GANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GLAUBER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah, late November. The time for division races to heat up, for exciting 
matchups that hold playoff implications, and -- oh, yes -- for all those 
coaching rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Houston Oilers have already made a change, but they certainly won't be 
alone. There could be as many as six to 10 changes by next season, with Jimmy 
Johnson to be mentioned at least once in every coaching search. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a closer look at the uncertain coaching situations around the league: 
</P>
<P>
 Carolina: The Panthers have just about given up hope that Joe Gibbs will 
change his mind and leave the broadcast booth. That leaves two college coaches 
as the front-runners: Miami's Dennis Erickson and Florida's Steve Spurrier. If 
Carolina can't get either, then the Panthers will look at Minnesota Vikings 
defensive coordinator Tony Dungy, Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Butch 
Davis and Philadelphia Eagles coach Rich Kotite, if he is fired by new Owner 
Jeffrey Lurie. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit: With Wayne Fontes' ouster almost a foregone conclusion, look for 
Owner William Clay Ford to check out Dungy first. Others who could get a look: 
Pittsburgh Steelers defensive coordinator Dom Capers, Davis, San Francisco 
49ers offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan and 49ers defensive coordinator Ray 
Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston: There's a clause in new coach Jeff Fisher's contract that allows him 
or the team to void the deal after this season. The Oilers have indicated they 
want Fisher for the long term, in part because they're convinced he would be in 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia: It's looking more and more as if Lurie will remove Kotite, 
despite the Eagles' success this season. But there are two ways Kotite could 
remain: If the Eagles get to the NFC championship game or if Lurie can't 
convince Johnson to come to Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay: Sam Wyche is almost certain to go. Johnson would be a logical 
candidate, because the Bucs could offer him full control over personnel 
matters. But the imminent sale of the team could hurt their chances of getting 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati: If General Manager Mike Brown decides he has had enough of David 
Shula -- a big if, considering Brown's snail-like pace at making decisions -- 
then look for him to promote offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver: When an owner starts saying his players need more discipline from the 
head coach, that's not a good sign. But Pat Bowlen believes Wade Phillips is 
growing into the job, so Phillips could survive. Then again, perhaps Bowlen 
will rethink his decision last year not to hire Shanahan. Bowlen may also take 
a look at Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Paul Hackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis: Mercurial Owner Robert Irsay indicates Ted Marchibroda is safe 
for 1995. Then again, Irsay once indicated he wouldn't leave Baltimore, no? 
Irsay might allow Director of Football Operations Bill Tobin to promote brother 
Vince, the team's defensive coordinator. Then again, Irsay might not do 
something so logical. 
</P>
<P>
 Raiders: Has Al Davis had enough of Art Shell? Davis will never tell. But this 
year's disappointing season could spell trouble. Replacements? Use your wildest 
imagination, because anything's possible with Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle: Has Tom Flores had enough in his second incarnation as head coach? 
Flores insists he hasn't, but don't expect that to stop the Erickson rumors 
from resurfacing. Another potential candidate is defensive coordinator Rusty 
Tillman. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams: By next year, the Rams will likely be playing in a new city, and perhaps 
with a new coach. The Rams haven't turned the corner under Chuck Knox. Up next? 
Look for a run at Johnson, and maybe even a look at Mike Ditka. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans: Jim Mora appears safe for now. Owner Tom Benson likes Mora, and 
since the coach has done a decent job with a team in transition, he figures to 
stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Giants: Dan Reeves has had huge disagreements with George Young, and 
Reeves has been rumored to be interested in the Carolina and Tampa jobs. But 
Reeves will not back out of his commitment in New York unless he is pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami: So you think owner Wayne Huizenga has put all those Johnson rumors to 
rest by giving Don Shula a three-year contract? Well, don't be surprised to see 
more speculation about Johnson, especially if the Dolphins falter down the 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Jets: Pete Carroll has been on the job for less than a year, so it's 
difficult to imagine him being booted. But imagine the Jets giving up on 
General Manager Dick Steinberg -- a distinct possibility if the team doesn't 
make the playoffs -- and Carroll could be a casualty of a new front-office 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco: If George Seifert doesn't get the most out of his team -- i.e., 
win a Super Bowl -- Owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. would consider replacing him 
with Johnson. And unless Johnson got the Dolphins' job, he would think 
seriously about going to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The brief tenure of the run-and-shoot is just about over. Good riddance. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Oilers have fired offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride, the 
Atlanta Falcons are the only team in the league employing a pure run-and-shoot 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 During its heyday in the late '80s and early '90s, the run-and-shoot was in 
place in Atlanta, Houston and Detroit, and the Buffalo Bills' no-huddle offense 
was an offshoot. But now, the Oilers have junked the run-and-shoot, the Lions 
have been using a tight end in their offense the last two seasons, and the 
Bills' offense has struggled so much that the team has attempted to fix it by 
slowing the pace by huddling before some plays. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, two run-and-shoot quarterbacks, former University of Houston 
stars Andre Ware and David Klingler are on the outs in the NFL. Ware was waived 
by Detroit last year, hung around briefly with the Vikings and is now in the 
Canadian Football League. And Klingler, a bust so far in Cincinnati, has been 
replaced by Jeff Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 Falcons quarterbacks coach Mouse Davis, who introduced the run-and-shoot in 
the USFL in 1983, says the offense "has so much fan appeal. It makes the game 
so much more exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one problem, Mouse. It doesn't win championships, which is why the system 
is nearly extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look for the 49ers to pursue Cowboys receiver Alvin Harper when he becomes 
an unrestricted free agent next year. The 49ers aren't satisfied with John 
Taylor's performance, and Harper would be the perfect complement to Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Look for the Rams to make a final decision on moving in the first 10 days 
of December. St. Louis continues to be the heavy front-runner.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; WHITTINGHAM'S MASTERY ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham has "owned" a lot of races in his brilliant career, and, 
at 81, he retains his firm grip on the Matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 A fixture on the Hollywood Park fall stakes schedule since 1981, Sunday's 
$400,000 race is the final major turf event of the year for fillies and mares. 
Only once in this decade has Whittingham not won the Matriarch. His Royal Touch 
finished eighth and her stablemate Petalia was 10th in 1990, behind longshot 
winner Countus In. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the Grade I has belonged to Whittingham and he also closed out the 
'80s successfully when Claire Marine clicked. All told, he has won the race 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Hall of Fame trainer is to keep his hot streak going, however, he will 
have to do so with a different weapon from the one he has wielded the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time Eclipse Award champion Flawlessly is gone, having been retired a 
month ago. The Affirmed mare started her roll with a victory over Fire The 
Groom in 1991, beat Super Staff in a stakes record 1:46 the following year, 
then in 1993 out-battled Toussaud by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham will be trying this time around with Aube Indienne, a 4-year-old, 
French-bred daughter of Bluebird. 
</P>
<P>
 She certainly is no Flawlessly, but Aube Indienne hasn't lost since joining 
Whittingham's barn. She upset Corrazona in the Las Palmas Handicap, then 
followed that with a half-length victory in the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon during 
the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita.  
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne doesn't have anyone recalling some of the great female grass 
champions of the past, but a solid case could be made for her regarding the 
Eclipse Award were she to win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give her two Grade I successes to close the year, one more than 
Hatoof, the leading candidate. However, Hatoof has run against better 
competition. Among her victims in the Beverly D. was Flawlessly and she was 
also second to Tikkanen in the Breeders' Cup Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight fillies and mares will oppose Aube Indienne, who drew the rail.  
</P>
<P>
 Alywow will make her Hollywood Park debut in the Matriarch and the 3-year-old 
Alysheba filly has had a productive year. 
</P>
<P>
 She has won three of eight starts and most recently was second to Raintrap in 
the Rothmans International. Mike Smith, the leading money-winner in the 
country, will be in to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange will make her first start on the turf since finishing last in the 
Gamely Handicap on May 30, 1993 and will also try to go over $1 million in 
earnings. Claimed for $50,000 by trainer Bill Spawr for owners Sid and Jenny 
Craig, Exchange has 13 victories in 27 starts and $929,950 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The other stakes on the card and the final event in Hollywood Park's 
$1.8-million Autumn Turf Festival is the inaugural Hollywood Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150,000 race drew a field of six and will mark the return of Hollywood 
Gold Cup winner Slew Of Damascus. The Slewacide gelding has been idle since 
finishing a distant fourth in the Pacific Classic Aug. 13 at Del Mar. Chris 
McCarron will ride Slew Of Damascus, who has five victories in nine starts on 
the turf. His opponents are Inner City, Firm Pledge, Rapan Boy, 
Ventiquattrofogli and Romarin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham might not have Flawlessly around anymore, but he does have her 
full brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect, a 2-year-old, is the co-third choice at 4-1 in today's $250,000 
Generous Stakes at a mile on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-competitive in his first two sprints, starts, Perfect improved a bunch 
when adding blinkers were added and he was given trying more distance, and won 
winning the final race of the Oak Tree season, defeating maidens by nearly two 
lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 If he likes the grass as much as his older sister did, Whittingham has another 
star on his hands. Eddie Delahoussaye will again ride the colt. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-2 favorite in the Generous is Claudius, who is proven against winners 
and on the grass. He won the Hopemont at Keeneland after breaking his maiden 
for trainer Bill Mott. Kent Desormeaux has the call on the son of Majestic 
Light. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the field are Dangerous Scenario, who will mark the first mount back 
for jockey Randy Romero, who retired earlier this year, but has decided to try 
a comeback in California; Lab Test, Native Regent, California Cup Juvenile 
winner Fandarel Dancer, Supremo, the 7-2 second choice; Mr Jim and Our Gatsby. 
</P>
<P>
 Three races later, Bail Out Becky is the 5-2 choice against nine other 
2-year-old fillies in the $200,000 Miesque Stakes at a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Mott and to be ridden by Desormeaux, Bail Out Becky, a daughter of 
Red Ransom, has two victories, a second and a third in four starts on turf. She 
won the $50,000 Green River at Keeneland before a four-length triumph over 
allowance rivals at Churchill Downs. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 All starters in the Matriarch will carry 123 pounds except for the 
3-year-olds, Alywow, Wandesta and Las Meninas, who will carry 120. . . . The 
race will be televised nationally by ESPN. It will be run as the seventh on the 
card and post time is 3:45 p.m. . . . Jockey Pat Valenzuela, who returned to 
action Thursday after having been sidelined since Oct. 6, didn't ride Friday 
night and isn't expected to ride today or Sunday after suffering a deep bruise 
on his right thigh when unseated by Ataboy Chad in Thursday's ninth race.

JAPAN APPROVES A TAX CUT PLAN; U.S. LUKEWARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to spur Japan's recovery that drew only lukewarm praise from the 
United States, Parliament gave final approval Friday to a reform package that 
immediately slashes the income tax but later raises the sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The income tax cuts -- $56 billion in 1995 and $36 billion for 1996 and 
subsequent years -- are due to be roughly balanced starting from 1997 by 
increased taxes on purchases of goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction in total taxes over the next two years is meant to accelerate a 
budding recovery, thereby increasing demand for foreign goods and reducing 
Japan's huge trade surplus. A one-year 1994 tax cut of $56 billion was passed 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 At the July summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations held in 
Italy, Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama pledged to enact such a stimulus 
program by year's end. The United States had pressed especially hard for Japan 
to implement tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale, in an interview after the shape of the plan 
was clear but before final legislative approval, described the tax package as 
"helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's not a very strong stimulative package," he added. "We accept it. But 
they have been reluctant to use the fiscal stimulation tool the way the West 
would use it under similar circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale predicted the Japanese economy might possibly achieve 3% growth next 
year, but said this is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax reform package's handling of a 1997 sales tax increase is the result 
of a complex compromise among politicians and influential Finance Ministry 
bureaucrats. As of April, 1997, the tax on purchases of goods and services will 
jump to 5% from the current 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finance Ministry, worried about balancing the government's budget as 
Japan's society becomes increasingly elderly, had argued that the sales, or 
consumption, tax should be hiked to 7% in 1997, if not sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasoning was that in future decades, as a larger percentage of citizens 
are retired but continue to spend out of their savings, such a shift toward 
heavier consumption taxes rather than income taxes would help maintain 
government revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 When former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa proposed a tax reform package 
along the lines of the Finance Ministry's proposal in February, he was forced 
to back down after a rebellion over the sales tax hike from his coalition 
partners, the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger. 
</P>
<P>
 But Murayama, whose Socialist party had vowed to repeal the sales tax when it 
was in the opposition, announced his about-face in September, saying Japan 
needed a tax hike to pay for welfare in its rapidly aging society. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Socialists and New Party Harbinger are allied with the conservative 
Liberal Democratic Party in a new ruling coalition, and they have supported the 
smaller consumption tax hike. The upper house of Parliament gave final approval 
to the four-bill package Friday on a 151-85 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Several thousand demonstrators marched through Tokyo's government district 
Friday to protest the sales tax increase and Murayama's decision as prime 
minister to overturn most of the Socialists' leftist policies.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS MAKE AN ABOUT-FACE; DOW JUMPS 33.6; MARKETS: ONE 
ANALYST CALLED IT "A NATURAL KNEE-JERK REACTION" AFTER SHARP DROP EARLIER IN 
THE WEEK. TRADING WAS LIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a surprisingly strong about-face, stocks closed sharply higher in Friday's 
abbreviated trading sessions, although analysts cautioned that the rally may 
have been exaggerated because of light volume. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.64 points Friday to 3,708.27. The 
gain ended a week that took the Dow down 46 points Monday and another 92 
Tuesday before it steadied Wednesday with a slight 3-point loss ahead of the 
Thanksgiving holiday. For the week, the Dow fell 106.99 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the early part of the week, bonds did not make much of a move. The 
benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond yield barely slipped to 7.94% from 7.95% 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks advanced broadly Friday, with strength in the pharmaceutical and 
high-tech sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, advances topped declines 1,491 to 564, with a light 
113,820,500 shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Trude Latimer of Ferguson, Andrews called the advance a "continuation of 
bottom fishing" from Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fair number of people believe there will be a year-end rally, even if they 
do not believe it's a trend that will follow through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a natural knee-jerk reaction to what happened earlier in the week," 
said Alfred E. Goldman, vice president at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 A flood of new economic data next week may decide how the markets end the 
year. Included are reports on purchasing orders, the gross domestic product and 
November employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The employment report data on hourly wages will get a careful look as the 
October figure was up a strong 0.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourly wage figure is seen as a sign of budding inflationary pressures. 
Inflation erodes the value of bonds and is being closely monitored by the Fed 
in charting its policy on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Dow industrials plunged 91.52 points to 3,677.99, the biggest 
one-day loss since the Fed started pushing interest rates higher in February. 
The Fed is hoping to slow economic growth and forestall inflation. Fears also 
swept the market about corporate earnings and the desirability of stocks 
because some investors fear the Fed tightenings will dampen economic growth and 
make it difficult for corporations to boost profits in the coming quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Voting shares of Box Energy Corp. rose 38%, following a $48-million takeover 
bid late Wednesday by Idaho potato magnate J. R. Simplot. Simplot's all-cash 
offer, equal to about $15 a share, would end a seven-year feud between the 
octogenarian investor and the management of Box Energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Box Energy's Class A voting stock climbed 4 1/4 to close at 15 1/2, 
the second-biggest percentage increase on the U.S. composite market. News of 
the offer also rallied the company's more widely traded Class B non-voting 
stock, which was up 3/4 at 9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * High-technology stocks were among the day's winners, with Hewlett-Packard up 
1 5/8 at 97 1/4, Motorola up 1 at 56 3/4 and International Business Machines 
gaining 1 1/4 to 70 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel Corp., however, the day's most active Nasdaq stock, was down 1 1/4 at 63 
7/8 after acknowledging it knowingly sold its flagship Pentium microprocessors 
with a "bug" that can lead to errors in sophisticated mathematical 
calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks that are sensitive to changes in the economy benefited. Allied Signal 
rose 1 1/4 to 32 1/8, Alcoa rose 2 3/8 to 80 3/8 and International Paper was up 
1 1/4 to 69 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stocks ended mostly lower abroad. In Tokyo, the Nikkei index slipped 0.2%. 
In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 0.2% 
lower, while Frankfurt's DAX index ended 0.1% lower. Stocks in Paris rose 0.6%. 
The Mexican market's Bolsa index closed up 46.21 points at 2,485.17 -- a gain 
of 1.89%. At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. precious metals markets were closed Friday but gold closed in London at 
$384.95 per ounce, up from $384.20 late Thursday. Silver traded in London at 
$5.16 an ounce, up 1 cent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hog prices bounced higher Friday in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures 
market as meat packers sought hogs to fill slaughter schedules. Traders said 
the rebound would not last as marketing schedules return to normal. Cash prices 
are trading at the lowest levels in 20 years and have dragged futures down. 
Analysts said aggressive herd expansion created a bumper supply of hogs this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's futures exchanges were closed Friday, extending Thursday's 
Thanksgiving holiday.

U.S. GROUP TO ACQUIRE WESTIN HOTELS FROM JAPAN'S AOKI; LODGING: SOUTH COAST 
PLAZA HOTEL IN COSTA MESA AND TWO IN SAN FRANCISCO AREA ARE INCLUDED IN THE 
$561-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. investor group said Friday it agreed to buy Westin Hotel Co. from Aoki 
Corp. of Japan for $561 million, in another sign of the resurgent interest in 
the recovering hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal also marks another pullback by a Japanese multinational that invested 
heavily in high-profile but ill-fated U.S. properties during the 1980s. An 
Aoki-led group paid $1.53 billion for Westin in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin manages 80 hotels in 19 countries, although most of the properties are 
owned by outside parties. However, the sale includes Aoki's ownership stakes in 
the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa, the Westin St. Francis hotel 
in San Francisco and the Westin Hotel at San Francisco International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not include ownership of the Westin Bonaventure in downtown Los 
Angeles or Westin's Century Plaza & Tower in Century City, which are owned by 
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and JMB Realty Corp., 
respectively, nor Westin's Mission Hills resort in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 The group buying Westin includes Starwood Capital Group, a privately held firm 
in Greenwich, Conn., that acquires real estate on behalf of wealthy clients 
such as the Pritzker family (which owns Hyatt Hotels) and the Ziff publishing 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also includes the investment banker Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New 
York, and Edward Thomas Cos., a Beverly Hills-based hotel operator that owned 
the Beverly Hills Hotel from 1953 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Starwood group, in addition to acquiring ownership stakes in the Westin 
properties in Costa Mesa and San Francisco, would also purchase Aoki's equity 
interests in 10 other Westin hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki would retain its ownership of nine other properties in the United States 
and Canada, but Westin -- under the Starwood group's control -- would continue 
managing those hotels and control the Westin name worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin's Bonaventure in Los Angeles was symptomatic of the hotel industry's 
struggle in the early 1990s. The insurer Equitable assumed ownership of the 
1,400-room hotel after its previous owners defaulted on a $75-million mortgage 
held by Equitable in late-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel industry's prospects have improved markedly in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising occupancy rates and room prices, spurred by the economy's overall 
recovery and a dearth of lodging construction in recent years, are providing 
hotels with solid financial gains this year, and analysts predict continued 
growth in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Slatkin, a principal with Edward Thomas Cos., said that is a key reason 
why his firm is part of the group buying Westin, a Seattle-based company that 
was founded in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second full year of recovery for the lodging business, and the 
near- to medium-term outlook includes double-digit improvements in both sales 
and profits," Slatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aoki decided about a year ago to unload. In February, it struck a deal to 
sell Westin to a Mexican conglomerate, DSC, for $708 million. But that deal 
collapsed early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki, a Japanese construction company, plans to use the Westin proceeds to 
pare its bulging debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Starwood's founder and chief executive, Barry Sternlicht, said in a telephone 
interview that "if you owned anything in the 1980s, it was worth less in the 
'90s, and Aoki wasn't immune to that."

'MR. SONY' PULLS THE PLUG; MORITA'S RESIGNATION SAID UNRELATED TO MOVIE WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Akio Morita, who built Sony Corp. into an international powerhouse and 
established himself as one of Japan's most visible and controversial 
businessmen, resigned on Friday as the company's chairman after nearly a year 
of ill health. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita, 73, co-founded Sony's predecessor company in 1946. Over the next four 
decades, he and his firm did much to define the contemporary consumer 
electronics business, perfecting products such as the transistor radio and the 
color television set and inventing entirely new markets with innovations such 
as the videocassette recorder and the Walkman. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Morita established himself as the maverick of Japan's corporate 
elite, cultivating a global image for Sony long before that was fashionable and 
garnering publicity with outspoken commentary on trade issues and U.S.-Japan 
relations. He also presided over Sony's foray into Hollywood, which may prove 
to be the biggest blemish on an otherwise stellar record. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita was sidelined by a stroke late last year, and since then has undergone 
a slow and difficult partial recovery. He had handed over day-to-day operations 
of Sony to Norio Ohga, his long-time No. 2, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the period of his recuperation, Mr. Morita has from time to time 
expressed his wish to resign as chairman," Sony spokesman Andrew House said 
Friday. "He put in a formal tender of resignation on Nov. 16, and that was 
formally accepted at the board of directors meeting today." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials insisted that the timing of Morita's resignation was 
unrelated to Sony's mid-November announcement that it was taking a staggering 
$2.7-billion write-off on Sony Pictures Entertainment, on top of a $510-million 
operating loss on the Culver City-based studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect there will be that kind of interpretation, but it has nothing to do 
with this," Managing Director Nobuyuki Idei told a news conference. "It's a 
completely different subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Morita will now assume the title of "founder and honorary chairman," Sony 
said. The company left the post of chairman vacant Friday "and there are no 
further management changes planned at this point," House said. 
</P>
<P>
 The write-off on Sony Pictures Entertainment amounted to an admission that 
Sony's multibillion-dollar Hollywood adventure has thus far been a disaster. 
And though Morita has largely avoided direct association with the debacle, his 
belief in the advantages of having electronics "hardware" and entertainment 
"software" under one roof was a key factor in Sony's fateful decision to buy 
Columbia Pictures in 1989 for $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita's departure could increase the pressure on both Ohga and Michael P. 
Schulhof, a Morita protege who oversees Sony's U.S. operations and has direct 
responsibility for the entertainment operations. Sony insists publicly that it 
will stay the course in the film business, but some analysts say they would not 
be surprised if the company were seeking a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures, the parent of Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures, has been 
hit hard by spectacular flops such as "Last Action Hero" and a series of 
embarrassing and expensive executive changes. And little has come of the 
much-touted "synergies" between electronics and entertainment -- only Sony 
Music, a record company, has consistently performed well. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita was hospitalized from the time of his stroke until May and has mostly 
been at home since then, House said. "He has recovered a great deal of his 
power of speech and he is able to understand people without any problem at 
all," he said. However, Morita is partially paralyzed on his left side and is 
using a wheelchair, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita has long been an outspoken critic of various business practices both of 
U.S. and Japanese firms. His 1986 autobiography "Made in Japan" criticized what 
he called short-sighted American business practices. In more recent years he 
has also criticized some aspects of Japanese management. He has argued, for 
example, that in Japan employees' salaries should be raised and stockholders 
should receive higher dividends. Many of his criticisms have been made in a 
spirit of trying to promote improved U.S.-Japan ties by revising practices that 
cause problems in the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita's internationalist views were reflected in Sony's 1961 decision to 
become the first Japanese company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Over 
the years, American and other foreign investors responded with enthusiasm. 
Foreign ownership twice rose to a peak level of 47%, once in 1973 and again in 
1981. Currently, 29% of Sony stock is foreign-owned, according to company 
statistics. Morita Resigns as Sony Chairman 
</P>
<P>
 Sony co-founder and Chairman Akio Morita resigned Friday after nearly a year 
of ill health, ending an era for the pioneering consumer electronics and 
entertainment company. Some career highlights of the internationally known 
businessman: * 1946: Morita, an heir to a sake-brewing business, pools $500 
with partner Masaru Ibuka to establish a small engineering company that later 
changes its name to Sony. Their first headquarters was located in the remains 
of a bombed-out Tokyo department store. * 1955: Leads Sony's purchase of rights 
to the transistor, which helped facilitate the company's design of a radio 
small enough to fit inside a pocket, thus creating a mass-market for transistor 
radios. * 1961: Trying to globalize Sony, Morita has its shares listed on the 
New York Stock Exchange -- the first Japanese company to do so. * 1968: Helps

U.S. GROUP TO ACQUIRE WESTIN HOTELS FROM JAPAN'S AOKI; LODGING: SOUTH COAST 
PLAZA HOTEL IN COSTA MESA AND TWO IN SAN FRANCISCO AREA ARE INCLUDED IN THE 
$561-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. investor group said Friday it agreed to buy Westin Hotel Co. from Aoki 
Corp. of Japan for $561 million, in another sign of the resurgent interest in 
the recovering hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which includes the 390-room Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, 
also marks another pullback by a Japanese multinational that invested heavily 
in high-profile but ill-fated U.S. properties during the 1980s. An Aoki-led 
group paid $1.53 billion for Westin in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin manages 80 hotels in 19 countries, although most of the properties are 
owned by outside parties. However, the sale includes not only the Westin South 
Coast Plaza but also the Westin St. Francis hotel in San Francisco and the 
Westin Hotel at San Francisco International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not include ownership of the Westin Bonaventure in downtown Los 
Angeles or Westin's Century Plaza & Tower in Century City, which are owned by 
Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States and JMB Realty Corp., 
respectively, nor Westin's Mission Hills resort in Rancho Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-story Westin in Costa Mesa has seen its occupancy increase by about 15% 
in the past year, in part because of the completion of a bridge linking the 
hotel to the South Coast Plaza shopping complex. The hotel is also near the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The group buying Westin includes Starwood Capital Group, a privately held firm 
in Greenwich, Conn., that acquires real estate on behalf of wealthy clients 
such as the Pritzker family (which owns Hyatt Hotels) and the Ziff publishing 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also includes the investment banker Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New 
York, and Edward Thomas Cos., a Beverly Hills-based hotel operator that owned 
the Beverly Hills Hotel from 1953 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The Starwood group, in addition to acquiring ownership stakes in the Westin 
properties in Costa Mesa and San Francisco, would also purchase Aoki's equity 
interests in 10 other Westin hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki would retain its ownership of nine other properties in the United States 
and Canada, but Westin -- under the Starwood group's control -- would continue 
managing those hotels and control the Westin name worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin's Bonaventure in Los Angeles was symptomatic of the hotel industry's 
struggle in the early 1990s. The insurer Equitable assumed ownership of the 
1,400-room hotel after its previous owners defaulted on a $75-million mortgage 
held by Equitable in late-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hotel industry's prospects have improved markedly in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising occupancy rates and room prices, spurred by the economy's overall 
recovery and a dearth of lodging construction in recent years, are providing 
hotels with solid financial gains this year, and analysts predict continued 
growth in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Slatkin, a principal with Edward Thomas Cos., said that is a key reason 
why his firm is part of the group buying Westin, a Seattle-based company that 
was founded in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second full year of recovery for the lodging business, and the 
near- to medium-term outlook includes double-digit improvements in both sales 
and profits," Slatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aoki decided about a year ago to unload. In February, it struck a deal to 
sell Westin to a Mexican conglomerate, DSC, for $708 million. But that deal 
collapsed early this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki, a Japanese construction company, plans to use the Westin proceeds to 
pare its bulging debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Starwood's founder and chief executive, Barry Sternlicht, said in a telephone 
interview that "if you owned anything in the 1980s, it was worth less in the 
'90s, and Aoki wasn't immune to that."

 Money Supply Moves Higher: The two broadest measures of the nation's money 
supply rose in the week ended Nov. 14, the Federal Reserve Board reported. The 
Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,587.7 billion 
from a revised $3,587.4 billion the previous week.An even broader measure, M3, 
rose to a seasonally adjusted $4,265.4 billion from a revised $4,265.0 billion. 
The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted 
$1,143.3 billion from $1,143.8 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, 
deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus 
accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus 
less-liquid accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of $100,000.

 PaineWebber Facing Two Lawsuits: PaineWebber Group Inc. has been sued by two 
clients who accuse the brokerage of duping them into buying risky limited 
partnerships. The two lawsuits, which seek class-action status, follow the 
disclosure early this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission is 
investigating PaineWebber as part of a broad review of Wall Street's limited 
partnerships sales.The suits, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by 
customers from DeQueen, Ark. and Boulder, Colo., seek unspecified damages. The 
SEC is reviewing whether PaineWebber misrepresented risks and rewards when it 
sold about $2 billion of partnerships that invested in real estate and energy 
projects and other assets from 1980 to 1992, people familiar with the review 
said. PaineWebber customers lost money in such investments when property and 
energy prices declined.

 National Gypsum Trust Wants Out of Asbestos Settlement: A National Gypsum Co. 
trust sought to withdraw from a $1.3-billion settlement worked out among 
asbestos manufacturers, saying court decisions in favor of its insurance 
carriers may leave the trust without enough money to pay its share of claims 10 
years hence. Under the so-called Georgine settlement, National Gypsum and about 
20 other companies are to support a fund for settling asbestos-related injury 
claims. About 260,000 individual claimants have opted out of the settlement.

 World Bank Warns Zaire: The bank said Zaire's withering economy would get no 
new cash until its government can prove it is serious about reforming economic 
corruption and mismanagement."We're talking pay-as-you-go -- they first have to 
prove they're able to take significant steps to put some sanity into the 
system," Eugene Scanteie, principal economist at the World Bank, told Reuters. 
Zaire's economy has shrunk to its 1958 pre-independence level. Scanteie, 
meeting with ministers, members of business, unions and political parties in 
Kinshasa, said even if Zaire immediately repaid the $60 million it owed the 
bank, no new funds would be offered on the basis of promises alone.

NEW 'BEETLE' MAY BE BUILT FOR AMERICAS; AUTOS: VOLKSWAGEN MAY LAUNCH AN UPDATED 
VERSION OF THE POPULAR BUG TO BE SOLD IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.

<P>
 A new generation Volkswagen Beetle is moving closer to a return to the U.S. 
market, where it could re-establish the auto maker's reputation for building 
cheap, spunky transportation, analysts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen's supervisory board met Friday and may have approved the program, 
which calls for the all-new front wheel-drive vehicle to be built in Mexico for 
sale in the United States, Canada, Mexico and possibly elsewhere in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkswagen did not issue a statement about the car following the conclusion of 
the meeting. VW officials in the United States were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that board approval of the car was 
expected at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United Sates, the new Beetle is expected to sell for $12,000 to $13,000 
and compete in the heart of the subcompact market with cars such as Chrysler 
Corp.'s Neon, Ford Motor Co.'s Escort and Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s Civic. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on VW's Concept 1 car displayed at major auto shows last year, the new 
Beetle will cram new technology such as dual air bags into the classic bug 
shape remembered fondly by millions of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike yesterday's air-cooled engine mounted over the rear-drive wheels, the 
new Bug will have a water-cooled engine mounted in front. 
</P>
<P>
 The target market will be children of Baby Boomers who drove the original 
Beetle in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting approval of the program," said Chris Cedergren, an analyst 
with AutoPacific Group, a California-based automotive consulting firm. "Total 
annual production for this car could go to 300,000 units a year, and it's 
earmarked more for the Americas as opposed to the European market." 
</P>
<P>
 VW still builds the current generation Beetle, first introduced in the late 
1930s, in Mexico and Brazil. But safety and emissions regulations forced VW to 
withdraw it from the U.S. market in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedergren said VW wants to sell about 75,000 to 100,000 new generation Beetles 
in the United States. The total could eclipse VW's total U.S. sales, which came 
to 84,468 vehicles for the first 10 months of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 While VW's sales this year have improved dramatically because of the 
long-awaited introduction of the new Golf and Jetta models, they are still way 
below the company's late 1960s' U.S. heyday, when sales exceeded 200,000 
vehicles a year.

 Chrysler Minivans May Be Recalled: Federal regulators are leaning toward 
asking the auto maker to recall about 4 million of its popular minivans because 
of allegedly unsafe rear door latches, the Detroit News reported.The rear hatch 
doors in Chrysler Corp. minivans have popped open in 51 accidents, with 74 
passengers being thrown out and 25 deaths reported, the government said. NHTSA 
has been investigating the safety of the latches since October, 1993. Critics 
of the minivan, led by attorneys for crash victims, claim the vehicle's rear 
liftgate door is prone to pop open in rear-impact collisions. Chrysler 
spokesman Rick Deneau said the Detroit News' report of a possible recall 
request was "premature."

<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration said Friday that it has allowed Leisure 
Air to resume flying some of its planes, and said it would closely monitor the 
charter carrier to assure safe operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Winston-Salem, N.C.-based scheduled and charter airline -- which serves 
Los Angeles -- suspended flights Nov. 18 after it was unable to demonstrate 
compliance with FAA safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the FAA said its inspection team has worked closely with Leisure 
Air officials and has determined that the carrier may resume flying four of its 
five Airbus A-320s. It also has two DC-10s and a Boeing 757. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Broderick, FAA associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, said Leisure Air has made changes to meet regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA takes its mission of ensuring the safety of the flying public most 
seriously, and will continue to closely monitor Leisure Air," Broderick said in 
a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure Air runs scheduled flights between Atlanta, Georgia, Orlando and West 
Palm Beach, Fla., Los Angeles, Boston, and Hartford, Conn. It also flies 
charters to the Caribbean, Mexico and Hawaii.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: WET SEAL SHARES GAIN 20% AFTER ANALYST PROJECTS REBOUND

<P>
 Shares in Wet Seal Inc. climbed 20% Friday after an analyst projected a strong 
fiscal 1995 for the Irvine-based specialty retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 CNBC's Dan Dorfman reported that money manager Chuck Royce expects the company 
to post earnings of as much as 30 cents a share for the coming year as clothing 
stores move away from the grunge look.Wet Seal specializes in young women's 
apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Friday, the company's shares climbed 75 cents to close at 
$4.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman said Royce also expects Wet Seal's earnings to climb to 60 cents a 
share in the year ending January, 1996. For its latest year, the company posted 
a loss of $2.3 million, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $140.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grunge is dead," said Eric Appell, senior analyst at Torrey Pines Securities 
in San Diego. He projected earnings of 15 cents a share for Wet Seal in fiscal 
1995.

 Report Sees Problems With Pooling Business Loans: Pooling loans to small 
businesses and selling them as investments would present numerous problems, the 
U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said in a staff report.Such loans are so 
diverse that it would be tough for banks to evaluate them as a category, OCC 
economists Christopher Beshouri and Peter Nigro said. The report may cool 
enthusiasm on Capitol Hill and elsewhere for the idea of syndicating small 
business debt to stimulate such lending. Such a market would be similar to the 
secondary mortgage market monitored by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 
Spokesman Lee Cross said the comptroller's office was taking no stand on the 
issue.

ONCE HECTIC MORTGAGE-REFINANCING PACE SLOWS TO CRAWL; REAL ESTATE: HIGHER 
INTEREST RATES DROP ACTIVITY TO A FIVE-YEAR LOW IN ORANGE COUNTY. LENDERS PUSH 
NEW-HOME LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Recent increases in mortgage rates have pushed home refinancing activity in 
California to its slowest pace in more than five years, with Orange County 
showing an 87.1% decline in October from a year ago, according to a report 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,685 homes were refinanced here in October, compared to 13,084 
homes refinanced in October, 1993, according to Dataquick Information Systems 
in La Jolla. Statewide, 19,968 homes were refinanced last month, compared to 
124,232 during the same month last year, a drop of 83.9%, the company found. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates this year have caused the refinancing market to all but 
collapse. Rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate home loan averaged nearly 9% last 
month, a significant increase from the 6.7% average for October, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 "The decline was expected, but it still hit the lending industry hard," said 
Donald L. Cohn, Dataquick's chief executive officer. "Most lending institutions 
have been trying to make up for some of the decline by increasing loan activity 
in other categories, especially loans to home buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, about 30% of all home loans made by lenders nationwide have been 
refinances. A year ago about 69.8% of such loans were refinancings, but by 
October that had dropped to about 26.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 With a consolidation underway in the mortgage lending industry, institutions 
are attempting to cope by increasing loan activity in other areas, targeting 
new-home buyers in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through that 're-fi' mania, " said Craig Davis, executive vice 
president of mortgage origination for American Savings Bank in Irvine. About 
65% of the loans made by American Savings in January were refinances, he said. 
For October, the number dropped to about 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are focused now on new-home loans, mostly adjustable rate mortgages," 
Davis said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said American Savings, Orange County's largest thrift, expects to make $500 
million in new-home loans during November, which would be a company record.

CZECHS TURN OUT TO BUY INTO INDUSTRY; PRIVATIZATION: STOCK IN 1,849 STATE 
COMPANIES IS TRANSFERRED. MORE THAN 80% OF ADULT CITIZENS NOW OWN SHARES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Czech Republic on Friday ended a privatization program with nearly all 
available shares sold. About a third of the country's industry has been 
transferred to about 6 million investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, unprecedented in the former Soviet bloc, was undertaken to break 
up state monopolies and give financially troubled companies new, private 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Although only Czech citizens and investment funds were eligible to buy, the 
move also opened doors to foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares from the coupon privatization are now routinely traded on the Prague 
Stock Exchange and the computerized RM System. 
</P>
<P>
 "Free entry and direct access were the main priorities," Dusan Triska, chief 
architect of the program, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program began three years ago, every adult Czech was entitled to buy 
government-issued coupons for a token fee of 1,000 crowns ($35). The coupons 
were used either to bid individually or through investment funds on shares in 
1,849 state-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the government declared an end to the bidding after nearly all 
shares of the privatized companies were sold. More than 80% of the adult 
population became shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The same scheme was used on a lesser scale in Slovakia before the peaceful 
breakup of the former Czechoslovak federation, and it is expected to be 
continued there next year. 
</P>
<P>
 A news agency said Friday that Ukrainians whose savings were devalued by 
inflation would get certificates allowing them to buy shares in privatized 
state companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Czech critics say the ambitious project did not live up to all expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the coupon-based shares belong to several large investment funds 
closely connected to big banks, which have been reluctant to drive the indebted 
companies they own into restructuring or bankruptcy.

ECONOMISTS CAUTION MEXICO TO INCREASE SAVINGS RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico, which helped tip Latin America into the 1980s debt crisis, is again in 
a fix due to its over-dependence on foreign capital, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The country that has been the darling of foreign investors for much of the 
1990s has suddenly found itself in need of what many say should long have been 
the motor oil of its economic development -- private savings by its own people. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans need to "change our habits, especially by saving, because domestic 
savings are now the key element to achieve our economic goals," said Jose 
Manuel Contreras, head of the Mexican Institute of Financial Executives, or 
IMEF, a powerful forum of bankers meeting here this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In an annual report, released in this central Mexican city, the IMEF raised a 
startling point about a country that -- until this year -- was considered a 
star among emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 While foreigners poured more than $26 billion into Mexico's stock market over 
the last four years, Mexicans may have actually pulled more money out than they 
put in over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the weak aspects of Mexico's recent evolution is the lack of domestic 
savings," the report says, noting that the country saves only about 15% of the 
wealth it produces, or less than half that of bustling emerging economies like 
Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of investing in stocks, bonds and other assets that grease the wheels 
of economic expansion, analysts say Mexicans have developed an attitude that is 
typical after years of pent-up demand during the cash-strapped period of the 
debt crisis: Buy now, save later. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending has risen, imports have soared above exports and the country 
has financed the growing trade bill by attracting copious amounts of investment 
from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, the tables turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Political instability at home and rising interest in the United States forced 
foreign investors to think twice about risking their money in Mexico's markets, 
triggering an exodus of dollars over the course of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Mexico needs investment to cover what the IMEF expects will be a 
$26-billion current account deficit this year, partly inflated by the country's 
growing trade imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 Failure to make up the difference creates balance of payments problems, and 
this year Mexico's central bank has been forced to use its own hard currency 
reserves to bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists say that faced with the unpredictable foreign investment panorama 
over the next few years, the incoming government of President-elect Ernesto 
Zedillo will have to rely more on Mexicans for investment needs -- a 
habit-changing challenge that no one expects to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, as a country, don't save," Jonathon Heath, chief economist at Mexico's 
third largest bank Banca Serfin, said bluntly at a news conference this week. 
"Mexico has always relied on foreign savings." 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, the IMEF said one of the factors behind the low national 
savings rate is the funneling in the last five years of some $20 billion that 
could have gone into Mexican stocks into newly privatized industries such as 
banks and telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of state firms now in private hands, wealthy Mexicans will have 
fewer investment alternatives and are likely to step up their activity in the 
Bolsa, as Mexico's stock market is called, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The IMEF estimated national savings could actually surge from 15% of gross 
domestic product to about 26% over the next six years, while it expects the 
rate of foreign investment coming into Mexico to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Heyman, president of Baring Securities in Mexico and author of part of 
the report, said ordinary Mexicans are likely to contribute to the build-up of 
national savings by stepping up activity in local pension and mutual funds as 
the economy grows and markets become more sophisticated.

STILL STUFFED? HERE'S A FEAST FOR THE EARS; JAZZ: SOME 300 MUSICIANS, INCLUDING 
VOCALIST MICKI RHYNE AND GUITARIST RON ESCHETE, PLAN TO DISH OUT SOME HEARTY 
FARE AT BASH '94 IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>

 Looking for a way to burn those excess holiday calories? The Orange County 
Musicians' Bash '94 at the Red Lion Hotel in Costa Mesa on Sunday will provide 
plenty of opportunity for exercise. With music scattered over five different 
venues inside the hotel, as well as dancing in the big-band and Dixieland 
rooms, you could run yourself crazy trying to see it all. 
</P>
<P>
 With some 300 musicians scheduled to take part over 10 hours, Bash '94 takes 
on marathon proportions. But we suggest you forget about sprinting from 
performance to performance and, instead, pick your favorites from the Bash 
program and spend some time with them. Or just wander, stopping here and there 
when something catches your ear. With the variety being offered at this year's 
fest, there's much to grab your attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The scope of this annual event reflects on the status of live music in Orange 
County and gives the listening public a chance to see performers who may not 
have been as visible as they might be. While the number of venues presenting 
live music continues to fluctuate, it's encouraging to see that the ranks of 
performers, as mirrored by their participation in the Bash, are still large, 
dedicated and eager to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bash, sponsored by the Orange County Musicians' Club, an offshoot of Local 
7 of the American Federation of Musicians, also gives insight into the quality 
of the singers and instrumentalists in Southern California. Few areas of the 
country are as blessed with as much top-notch talent, and nothing demonstrates 
this better as when they come together at the Bash. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, vocalist Micki Rhyne, who just wrapped up another stint at 
Merv Griffin's Atlantic City hotel, or guitarist Ron Eschete, who travels the 
world with pianist Gene Harris' quartet and has just released a solo album on a 
major jazz label. That kind of talent is the rule, not the exception, at this 
year's Bash. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event -- a fund-raiser for the club's financial assistance and 
scholarship programs -- provides a chance to catch up with the hometown 
musicians and find out how their careers are going. We talked to three Orange 
County performers who'll figure prominently on Sunday to find out "What's up?" 
</P>
<P>
 The message on Tom Kubis' phone machine reveals both his musical ear and his 
sense of humor: "Leave a message at the sound of the A-sharp, slightly flat, 
beep." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a safe bet that when calling the arranger, composer, saxophonist, 
bandleader and educator, he won't be home. Kubis, who brings his big band to 
the Red Lion to support the Bash '94's grand marshal, Steve Allen, has one of 
the busiest and most diverse careers in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 His band has been backing comedian-songwriter Allen for the last few years, 
making appearances with the television legend at Sherman Oaks' Moonlight Tango 
club and at L.A.'s El Rey Theatre. The ensemble does the same for 
trumpeter-vocalist Jack Sheldon, who makes frequent Southland appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the Kubis band plays a date on its own. The group is due to 
record a new album in January and has one in the can with Sheldon ("I'm 
particularly proud to have been a part of it," says Kubis). Without the band, 
Kubis tentatively is scheduled to travel with Allen to Sweden sometime next 
year to record with a big band there. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to this the fact that Kubis is a full-time instructor at Golden West 
College in Huntington Beach, where he teaches synthesizer, commercial music and 
leads the school orchestra, and his work as composer-arranger (his titles are 
played by high school, college and professional bands around the world), and 
you've got yourself one busy guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Did we mention he still finds time to make appearances with his 
Dixieland-influenced ensemble Swing Savant? 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the music business," Kubis said when asked why he pursues so many 
different avenues. "If you don't have your fingers in everything, you can't 
make house payments." 
</P>
<P>
 His relationship with Allen may be his most visible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve's written some 5,000 tunes in his life, some 30 a week. He's an 
absolute gentleman and a joy to work with; fun, funny. And his tunes are great. 
They cover all the bases: Latin, jazz, different forms of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubis also does his share of writing, joking that he probably has as many 
arrangements under his name as Allen has compositions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got books of big-band arrangements, little band and combo arrangements, 
everything you can think of," Kubis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major portion of my life is centered around the school now," he said, 
"but writing is my existence. I enjoy doing that more than anything in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Karen Gallinger gave one of the most upbeat performances at last 
year's Bash. Working with keyboardist Jack Reidling's trio, she heated up the 
jazz room with a good-time version of "Makin' Whoopee," then took a turn toward 
the sultry with a bossa-nova paced version of "In Summer."  
</P>
<P>
 That versatility has been captured on her new CD, "Karen Gallinger Live at the 
Jazz Bakery" on Seabreeze records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really go in expecting to make a record," said Gallinger of the 
date, "but after we heard it, everyone agreed it should be a release." 
</P>
<P>
 Even more amazing was that she hadn't previously worked with part of her 
supporting cast: drummer Joe LaBarbera and bassist Ton Warrington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just one of those days when everything came together," she said of the 
disc, which includes straight-ahead jazz, swing, Latin and more contemporary 
tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallinger, who works frequently in area clubs (her album release party will be 
at Lunaria in West L.A. on Friday), said she's already looking forward to doing 
another disc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to do something more contemporary, more along the lines of the 
Crusaders' type music. Those are my roots; R&B, funk and pop. But I'll do 
straight ahead when I work with Jack (Reidling on Sunday). I enjoy singing in 
different styles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Up until last December, bassist Luther Hughes was the most visible jazz 
musician in Orange County. Before his tenure as leader of the house band at 
Vinnie's Ristorante in Costa Mesa ended then, he could be heard backing guests 
on weekends at the Italian eatery and, before that, at Vinnie's now-defunct 
Laguna Niguel location and, before that, El Matador in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really miss those days," said Hughes, who'll appear at the Bash with 
guitarist Frank Potenza. "It was nice to be able to call the guys you want to 
play with and make your own tailor-made environment. I've always got my eye 
open for another venue, but only half an eye now because I'm so busy practicing 
Aikido three to five times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Other things occupy Hughes' time as well. As a member of Gene Harris' quartet, 
he travels the globe with upcoming stops in Seattle, Hawaii and Japan scheduled 
in the next few months. Weekends he can be found with keyboardist Ronell Bright 
at Maple Drive Restaurant in Beverly Hills, and he recently played Croce's in 
San Diego with saxophonist Hollis Gentry and keyboardist Mark Massey, both 
onetime regulars at Vinnie's and El Matador. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' experience booking clubs was put to use in organizing Bash '94. Asked 
to make recommendations of whom to see at the event, Hughes begins to gush. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the Dale Spaulding blues band with Bill Steck, the piano player. 
Bill's an old friend -- we used to play at Hungry Joe's with (vibraphonist) 
Dave Pike. And there's Ron Eschete (guitarist and band mate in the Gene Harris 
quartet). I always recommend Ron above all others. And Glen Garrett's 
(Brazilian) band is not to be missed. We had the whole 20-piece lineup at El 
Matador once, and they took the room off." 
</P>
<P>
 He also mentions singer Rhyne (he'll play bass for her), Tubop with trombonist 
Andy Martin, pianist Massimino, singer Gallinger, drummer Matt Johnson, pianist 
Reidling. It's hard to get him to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own appearance with old friend Potenza, Hughes said, "We'll do some 
of Frank's tunes, some of my tunes, we'll play a tune Jim Hall wrote and 
performed with Bill Evans. Mark Massey will play acoustic piano, but it will 
still be a contemporary group. You don't have to play electric to be 
contemporary." 
</P>

JAZZ REVIEW; THINK OF SUNDAY AT SPAGHETTINI AS BIRDLAND SOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Al Williams closed Birdland West in Long Beach earlier this year because 
of the weak economy, he has had some time on his hands. He's still busy with 
his Rainbow Promotions company, which puts on the annual Long Beach jazz and 
blues festivals, but not busy enough, he confided Sunday evening at 
Spaghettini. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursdays at Birdland used to be Williams' night to shine as a drummer. He has 
worked with most of the major L.A. musicians, and every Thursday night he led 
his Jazz Society at his now-defunct nightspot in straight-ahead sessions that 
concentrated on one thing: having some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaghettini's talent booker, recognizing an opportunity, lured Williams to the 
lounge, where the tradition continues Sundays. Williams brings in his Jazz 
Society, featuring singer Barbara Morrison.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of his dual roles as promoter and player, Williams knows everyone, and 
the band he leads here is particularly talented. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the youngest member, saxophonist Rickey Woodard. The 
Nashville product, who's especially adept at injecting strong rhythm-and-blues 
feeling into his play, has worked with organist Jimmy Smith, the Ray Charles 
Orchestra and the Juggernaut big band of Frank Capp as well as the 
Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra. His release for the Candid label, "California 
Cooking!" was one of 1991's most soulful, sax-led quartet recordings, out of a 
tradition that includes fellow tenor players Stanley Turrentine and the late 
Hank Mobley. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's pianist Phil Wright, who had stints as arranger/studio musician 
for both Chicago's Chess Records in the early '60s and later Capitol Records 
after he moved to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Henry Franklin, known as "The Skipper," is valued as an accompanist by 
singers and front-line musicians for his strong, resonant tones. Put them 
together with vocalist Morrison, known here and abroad for her strong blues and 
ballad ways, and you've got a combo that, in the vocabulary of the day, can 
rock the house. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's exactly what they did. Though many of the groups passing through 
the Spaghettini lounge work as accompaniment to barroom chatter and the whir of 
drink-mixing blenders, that wasn't the case here. The band was assertive from 
its opening number, exactly what the good-sized turnout wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 The first set opened with "My Romance," a mid-tempo exercise that featured 
Woodard's flurries of 16th notes and his quirky yet attractive way of breaking 
up a line. "There Will Never Be Another You" featured Wright wringing a lyrical 
improvisation from Spaghettini's cranky, out-of-sorts piano while Franklin gave 
a display of fleet phrases and ringing two- and three-note blends.  
</P>
<P>
 Woodard took to the crowd during "Body and Soul," serenading nearly everyone 
for a moment or two at a proximity that allowed one to see the tarnish deep 
inside the bell of his horn. 
</P>
<P>
 With Morrison, the band cruised through an uptempo version of "No Greater 
Love" followed by a ballad-paced "Candy." The singer played both songs 
straight, relying on her caramel-colored tones and astute rhythmic sense to 
carry each word. Her finest moments came on the touching "Make the Man Love 
Me," which she delivered convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group's second set was much looser and a good deal less serious. This 
occasionally hurt the presentation, as songs began on stumbling introductions 
or closed on badly contrived endings. But what fell between was lively, 
swinging and full of spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 As they covered tunes from Duke Ellington, Stevie Wonder and Percy Mayfield, 
the quintet played up each one's rhythms and bluesy feeling. Woodard and 
Morrison are especially adept in this style, and the set became a free-for-all 
that produced the evening's most animated moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The set got off to a hot start with "Sweet Georgia Brown," which featured 
Williams' impressively detailed drum solo. At one point, Williams (an excellent 
conga player) played with his bare hands, an effort that drew strong applause. 
</P>
<P>
 This ongoing engagement is the perfect way to end a weekend, and a sure spirit 
lifter. In a sense, it's as if Birdland hasn't closed after all; its party-like 
atmosphere has just moved south to Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Al Williams' Jazz Society with Rickey Woodard, Phil Wright, Henry Franklin 
and Barbara Morrison appears every Sunday at Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch 
Parkway, Seal Beach; 6:30 p.m. No cover. (310) 596-2199.

IT'S THE FORMAT, STUPID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, KLOS-FM has billed itself as the "Home of Rock and Roll."In one 
fell swoop, however, the station severed its living link to the heritage it 
pretended to claim ("KLOS Rocks Its Personnel," Morning Report, Nov. 18). 
</P>
<P>
 By firing Joe Benson, Bob Coburn and Gino Michelini, the home of rock 'n' roll 
has slipped off its foundation. Thank God for KSCA-FM (101.9). Maybe this young 
upstart will show KLOS that its decline in the ratings has been due more to the 
stodgy sameness of its album rock format than to any deficiency in the on-air 
personnel.

ALBUM REVIEWS; SOMETHING TO CHEW ON FROM BAZOOKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Bazooka, "Blowhole", SST  
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 Jack Brewer and Bazooka,"Saved From Death in the Dream World", New 
Alliance  
</P>
<P>
 One of the worst forms of musicianly social climbing occurs when rock guys try 
on jazz garb and suddenly start acting and sounding as if they've discovered 
real culture. One need look no further than the hilarious cover of Bazooka's 
new album to be assured that this particular trio of rock guys is in no danger 
of becoming stuck up through exposure to more exacting jazz traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blowhole," the all-instrumental band's third release (after a 1991 
self-marketed cassette and last year's SST debut, "Perfectly Square"), follows 
Bazooka's precedent of playing mainly for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Bazooka tries to have a bit too much fun: At 68 minutes, "Blowhole" 
could have been pared back to a more reasonable length without sacrificing 
anything vital. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dispensable items are two of the three cuts drawn from the jazz 
canon. The Charlie Parker composition, "Billie's Bounce," doesn't come across 
with enough verve to justify its 8 1/2 minutes, and an even longer, 
album-closing take on Sonny Rollins' "G-Man" is just an excuse for the band to 
blow off steam after the real points have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 A more pithy reading of Thelonious Monk's "Rhythm-A-Ning" succeeds as a 
lighthearted notion, although the rhythm section is a bit muscle-bound for the 
task at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 If considered a jazz act, Bazooka doesn't add up: Drummer Vince Meghrouni 
(pronounced muh- ROO-nee ) and bassist Bill Crawford are most comfortable 
pounding and churning like rock guys, not pirouetting and swinging like jazz 
players. Saxophonist Tony Atherton doesn't have the tonal presence and 
amplitude of a first-rate jazz soloist, and his linear flow isn't sufficiently 
daring or sweeping in its movement to make his improvisations the highlight of 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
 But taken as a rock band that uses jazz-influenced improvisational techniques 
(and records live without edits or overdubs), Bazooka makes lots of sense. 
Riff-construction is the band's greatest strength; its original compositions 
string together juicy bits, each one to be savored through frequent repetition 
until it's time to move on to a contrasting riff-based mood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Procedure" reaches back to funky '70s jazz-fusion a la Herbie Hancock 
(although one or two other cuts in this mode become redundant). In "Painful 
Therapeutic Process," the emphasis alternates between slow, heavy Black Sabbath 
cadences and shotgun rhythms borrowed from the Johnny 
Burnette/Yardbirds/Aerosmith hand-me-down "Train Kept A-Rollin'." 
</P>
<P>
 The album peaks with "Bring On the Painkillers" (a wry bookend to "Painful 
Therapeutic Process"), in which brisk Latin currents and a surging bass riff 
similar to the Doors' "Break On Through" provide the foundation for Atherton's 
sharpest, most liberated blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the trio goes beyond its preoccupation with riff-building and soars as 
an ensemble into free flight. The 10 1/2-minute "Turkey Tenders" is another 
good, episodic piece in which a swaggering main current gets momentarily 
blocked by regal interludes, with a funky-blues shuffle thrown in to spark the 
homestretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bazooka's collaboration with Jack Brewer, a veteran punk singer (with 
Saccharine Trust) and garage rocker from Long Beach, was not only improvised, 
but also impromptu: According to the album notes, Brewer and Bazooka turned up 
at the same studio in 1992 to work on separate projects, and the singer-poet 
invited the trio on the spur of the moment to provide the backdrop for some 
spoken-word performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the unpremeditated nature of the session, which the album notes assure 
us lasted just an hour, the results are remarkably cohesive. Bazooka's 
instrumental rhythms and dynamic shifts are a consistent fit for Brewer's vocal 
cadences -- and vice-versa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer's words are thoughtful but not vivid; biblical allusions are frequent, 
and philosophical abstractions dominate. The best pieces are the pithiest, 
especially "No Lunch (for You, Jack)," in which sultry blues vamps and comical 
sax commentary flesh out Brewer's wry reflections on the lofty artistic 
aspirations, and considerably less grand daily exigencies, that come with being 
a struggling poet (is there any other kind?). 
</P>
<P>
 It's Brewer's tone that sticks with you, more than his words. In a medium 
where haranguing and overheated declamation are common, Brewer manages to be 
both dramatically insistent and gentle . The performances are notable for the 
sheer humaneness that shines through, even if the images seldom grip.

<P>
 ** 1/2, Psychic Rain, "Never Was", Greico Records  
</P>
<P>
 At a pop moment when young rock bands tend to see rewards in taking extremist 
stances both in attitude and musical approach, Psychic Rain is more attuned to 
a golden mean of pop-rock classicism. 
</P>
<P>
 On its self-released CD debut, the Orange County foursome shows enough 
all-around skill not to need to fall back on attitude. Instead, it leads with 
good melodies and the solid, openly emotional singing of Greg Stoddard, whose 
voice is reedy but packs a decent punch. 
</P>
<P>
 At times he recalls Hoodoo Gurus singer Dave Faulkner, or a less intense 
version of Graham Parker or Joe Jackson. Lead guitarist Brian Christopher 
Stewart etches each song with tasteful, varied colorations, and drummer Norm 
Antonini teams with bassist Patrick Shannon to form a crisp rhythm section; 
Antonini also is a valuable backup singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Without blatantly imitating any single influence, Psychic Rain falls into the 
mainstream of eager, even-tempered pop craftsmanship once occupied by the 
Hooters. Some raw and brooding touches suggest that the band, despite its 
uncommon polish, also wants a connection to the indie-rock movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychic Rain's leading theme is that pop-rock perennial -- the bewilderment of 
seeing good love go bad. The exception, "Windows," tackles another familiar 
theme -- domestic abuse. While offering no special insights, neither does it 
stumble on the common pitfalls of cliche, sensationalism and sentimentality. 
</P>
<P>
 All seven songs are well-wrought and thoroughly enjoyable while the CD spins. 
But Psychic Rain hasn't yet achieved the distinctive lyrical voice or stylistic 
slant needed to make well-wrought music truly hit home. The band's foundation 
for building toward that goal is certainly strong. 
</P>
<P>

PLANTS; QUEENLY CYCLAMEN REIGNS AS A CROWNING GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treat a cyclamen like a queen, and this regal flowering plant will reward you 
with a long reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call them queens because they each like to have their own little throne," 
says Janelle Wiley, color specialist at Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Peek under the leaves of any cyclamen planted at Sherman Gardens, and you'll 
see what Wiley means. Each plant is slightly elevated so that the top of its 
tuberous root system is an inch or so above soil level. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cyclamens do not like wet crowns," says Wiley. "Planting them a bit high so 
they have good drainage is the main trick to growing them well. Other than 
that, they're pretty easy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Wiley's metaphor is an effective way to remember how to plant cyclamens, 
it could also be used to describe their appearance.  
</P>
<P>
 Though these plants provide cool-season color over a long period of time just 
like pansies, the effect they create is entirely different. Coolly serene 
instead of brightly cheerful. Patrician rather than perky. Grace Kelly versus 
Doris Day. 
</P>
<P>
 You could think of a cyclamen's rather starchy-looking, silver-marbled, 
heart-shaped leaves as royal ruffs; its tall, straight flower stems as 
aristocratic necks rising above them; and its large, but slender flowers as 
imperial heads, nodding ever so slightly to acknowledge your presence. These 
blooms, incidentally, make excellent cut flowers that last seven to 10 days -- 
if lobbing them off doesn't make you feel like you're committing regicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley likes cyclamens best in flower beds all by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so elegant; they don't need anything else," she says. But, if you 
prefer combination plantings, Steve Minoru Goto, president of Cyclamen Growers 
in Lake View Terrace, suggests mixing them with English and/or fairy primrose 
and candytuft or with ornamental kale. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a bit more daring, he says, consider white-flowering cyclamens 
interspersed with red poinsettias, as Disneyland is doing in one of its annual 
beds this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer growing cyclamens in pots, again they look splendid solo. Or, 
for an entirely different look, combine them with a bit if ivy, an impatiens or 
two, and a top knot of liriope in a moss-lined, hanging basket, as Sherman 
Gardens has done in its Tea Garden setting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ideal location for planting cyclamens is in a area with bright, filtered 
light. Any area where you've had success with impatiens or tuberous begonias 
would be fine. A situation with morning sun/afternoon shade could also work, 
especially along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cyclamens need a lot more sun than people suppose," says Goto. "They don't 
like deep shade. But they also like cool temperatures. That's why they should 
generally be planted in a protected area inland." 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclamens also perform best in rich soil; amend their bed with compost or 
other organic material before planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Gardens adds sharp sand to its potting soil mix (two parts soil to one 
part sand) to help ensure good drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the soil moist the first week or two until the plant has established new 
roots. Then water whenever the top inch of the soil has dried out or the 
plants' leaves begin to look soft and spongy rather than stiff and crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 Feed lightly but frequently. ("Cyclamens are grazers," says Goto.) The easiest 
way to accomplish this, he says, is adding a half tablespoon or so of a 
slow-releasing fertilizer like Osmocote to the soil at the time of planting and 
repeat the process every three months through the plant's bloom cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you planted cyclamens in, say, November, then you would add more Osmocote 
to the soil in February, and again in April, and then stop until next fall, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, Sherman Gardens uses a water-soluble fertilizer Wiley describes 
as "gentle" (10-10-5) at regular strength every two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove dead leaves to prevent bacterial diseases and maintain a cyclamen's 
well-bred appearance. Also remove spent flowers to keep the plant flowering 
instead of producing seed. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't cut the stems the way you normally would though, advises Goto. Water 
collecting in the remnant of the hollow stems can cause rot. Instead grasp the 
stem near the base, twist it, and yank it out. Do the same when you remove 
blooms for cut flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow Goto and Wiley's recommendations, and cyclamens will continue producing 
flowers above their elegant ruffs of marbled leaves well into spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the weather heats up, a cyclamen slows down. At this point, you have 
three choices. 
</P>
<P>
 You can treat the plant as an annual and pull it out and discard it. This is 
the alternative most often taken. 
</P>
<P>
 You can treat it the way you would a bulb and force it to go dormant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stop fertilizing when the cyclamen stops producing flowers and begins to look 
worn out," suggests Wade Roberts, director of Sherman Gardens. "Start slowing 
down on water, too, and then stop completely. When the plant is thoroughly 
dried out, dig it up, store it in a dark place, and replant it in late fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Or you could do what Paul Brackman of Progressive Growers in Vista, another 
cyclamen grower, does, and that is essentially nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm too lazy to dig things out, dry them out, store them and then remember to 
plant them at the right time the following year," says Brackman. "I prefer 
letting nature run its course." 
</P>
<P>
 So his cyclamens stay in the ground year round. They stop blooming and lose a 
few leaves, and the summer water needed to keep his tuberous begonias going 
rots out a portion of the cyclamens occasionally. But the ones that make it 
just keep getting better, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one white cyclamen last year that's about 6 years old that developed a 
tuber about eight inches across and produced as many as 125 flowers at a time 
at the height of the season," he says. "It was an amazing sight." 
</P>
<P>
 The length of a cyclamen's reign is up to you. But whether you keep it for a 
season or let it run its natural course, it's going to put on a royal show.

ENTERTAINING; NAPKINS AND CENTERPIECES ADD A GRACIOUS TOUCH OF TRADITION AND 
CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Napkins are as essential to a fine holiday table as candlelight and crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries the charm of a well-laid table has captivated writers: In the 
17th Century, Guillaume de Rebreviettes marveled at a table with "napkins 
disguised as several types of fruit and birds." 
</P>
<P>
 "I use my napkins whenever possible -- not just during the holidays and on 
special occasions," said Pennsylvania collector Marlene Harris, who is 
determined to keep the fine art of napkin presentation alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perfectly folded, they send a message to guests that you took the time to 
extend a gracious welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 An indispensable part of the finest trousseaux, table linens were for 
centuries passed down just as ceremoniously as family jewels and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 Francoise de Bonneville, author of "The Book of Fine Linen," reports that her 
French homeland was one of the first countries to adopt the table napkin. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, napkins as we know them date to 15th-Century Reims, a city legendary 
for its luxurious cloth. The court of Charles VII instituted a royal linen 
office to ensure that only the most glorious touailles -- or serviettes, as 
they were later called -- graced the infant monarch's table. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades later in Italy, Catherine de Medicis created a stir by enlivening her 
banquets with woven damask designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Until at least the mid-18th Century, table napkins were much larger than we 
now use, in part because they often covered the entire body. They were knotted 
about the neck and, in some households, were even shared by adjacent diners. 
</P>
<P>
 For special occasions, professional folders fashioned them into everything 
from pheasants to mythological animals to trees. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, white-on-white napkins, usually 
with embroidery and perhaps some openwork hemstitching, prevailed at dinner 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to linens being used to spice up a table, there is a long 
tradition of using centerpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 A silvery epergne, brimming with fruit and flowers, was once the mainstay of 
any elegant table, greeting guests in a charming, courtly way. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabella Beeton counseled readers a century ago that "flower arrangements 
should be low, so as not to inhibit conversation across the table." 
</P>
<P>
 She was one of the few of her time to do so. Most Victorian centerpieces were 
towering and lavish, brilliant showcases for flowers, palm fronds and fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though contemporary displays are considerably more diverse, the rules for 
concocting them are not. Color is a festive way to unify components. Silver 
makes an equally compelling focal point. Mixing assorted shapes or pieces from 
different periods creates visual interest as well.

HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; WHEN VINYL FLOOR TILES BUCKLE, FIX PROBLEM, NOT 
JUST SYMPTOM

 Q. I put some vinyl floor tiles in our kitchen during the summer, and there's 
a problem with three tiles in front of the dishwasher. I believe that because 
of moisture from the dishwasher, the tiles have buckled and are no longer fully 
attached to the floor. If I flatten them out, is it OK to reglue them? 
</P>
<P>
 R.W., Santa Ana A. The first thing you'll need to do is find the cause of the 
moisture, says Becky Gonzalez of Anaheim Centsible Tile. It may be a bad door 
seal or leaking hose, but you'll need to correct that before you replace any 
tile. If the tiles are warped, flattening them won't do any good; get new ones. 
After pulling up the old tiles, let the floor dry out for a few days before 
installing new ones. 
</P>

 Q. Last January, we had a mess created when we removed our Christmas tree. 
Dried needles were everywhere, and they were very difficult to remove from the 
carpet. We also had spots where tree sap had fallen. Is there a trick to saving 
your carpet from a droopy Christmas tree? 
</P>
<P>
 W.I., Irvine A. Prevention is probably the best advice, says Mark Silverberg 
of New York Carpets in Anaheim. To keep needles from getting on the carpet, 
keep sheets or tarps around the tree as you move it. Also, make sure no one 
steps on the fallen needles. This can dig them into the fibers and make them 
harder to remove. Make sure you're using a good vacuum; rent a good one if 
necessary. The best are the upright models that have a "beater bar" that pulls 
debris out of the carpet and into the vacuum. For the sap spots, try putting an 
ice cube on them and freezing them off, which also works to remove bubble gum. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. The power flickers in our house for no reason. I thought it was because we 
had some drain on our system, but then it began happening late at night when 
very few electrical items are on. What could be happening? 
</P>
<P>
 T.H., Newport Beach A. You may have a problem in the main panel, probably in 
the main circuit breaker, says Mike McCoy of Current Supply in Westminster. In 
California, the main panels are covered, but they're usually outside because of 
our mild climate. This leaves them open to sand and dust, which can pit the 
components and cause a problem like this. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We recently bought a home that has nice bathroom faucets. However, I'm 
annoyed that the hot turns on clockwise while the cold turns on 
counterclockwise. Can this be changed easily? 
</P>
<P>
 W.T., Anaheim Hills A. Buy two of one stem, says Ron Albright of Albright 
Plumbing & Heating in Los Alamitos. Usually faucets are sold with the handles 
turning in opposite directions. This is done especially with lever handles, 
because most people like both to turn in toward the sink. When you have round 
handles, many people like them to turn in the same direction. The stem is 
relatively easy to replace, and most hardware and plumbing stores carry them. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. I need to complete the exterior paint job on the peaks on my roof, which is 
made of asphalt shingles. Being leery of heights, I wanted to know about any 
safety tips for walking around up there. 
</P>
<P>
 P.P., Fullerton A. Asphalt shingles are pretty stable and are not as 
treacherous to walk on as a wood shake or tile roof, says Jim Gorman of Rancho 
Lumber in Westminster. Just make sure you have solid, rubber-soled shoes and 
also make sure you're getting up there in late morning or early afternoon, 
after the dew and moisture have burned off. You also may want to take a broom 
to sweep off any leaves or debris in front of you that could cause you to slip.

 Nothing sets the mood for a special occasion more beautifully than the amber 
glow of candlelight. To help set the tone for the holidays, consider some 
one-of-a-kind candles and candlesticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among unique candleholders available are those created by Aubrey Robin of 
Newport Beach and sold at Elements in the Irvine Marketplace. Robin uses beads, 
wire and cement to make her candlesticks ($18 each). 
</P>
<P>
 Glass gems from old jewelry are the beads of choice for Robin, 28. "They have 
the best color," she said. Robin uses wire similar to that found in tire treads 
and a plastic cement. "The cement compound is fun to use," Robin said. "You can 
make some wacky stuff with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other unusual holders and candles at Elements:  
</P>
<P>
 Scented gourd candles (about $43) are by Arolyn, based in Manhattan Beach. The 
gourds are cut and scooped, then filled with scented paraffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Multicolored candles ($10 and up) by Queen Bee in Los Angeles are dipped, then 
stripped, for a fishnet look. 
</P>
<P>
 Votive holders (about $11) of aluminum and glass by Moshumi of San Francisco 
look like mini outdoor lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass candlesticks (about $28) handcrafted by Ambient in Chicago double as bud 
vases. 
</P>
<P>
 HML of Los Angeles molds its sticks ($45) from old gate finials. They are 
available in black iron or gold-dipped. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Elements at (714) 854-3690. Stylistic Fixtures 
</P>
<P>
 Using silk rope, shades, tassels and convex mirrors on gold brass, white opal 
and cobalt glass, some traditional lighting fixtures are getting a new 
interpretation from the American Glass Light Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fixtures I design echo stylistic themes of the antiques I collect," said 
Sandy Littman, an architect by training and president and chief designer of the 
New York-based company. "I love the look of griffins, stars and urns." 
</P>
<P>
 Littman got her start designing discotheques in the mid-1970s. Her experience 
with lighting for discos and dance clubs formed the foundation of her present 
work -- which includes sconces, pendants and uplights. 
</P>
<P>
 Among American Glass Light's new pieces ($400 and up) is the Karina up-light, 
a glass bowl that hangs from a coordinating silk rope. It is adorned with two 
gold griffins and a central gold ball. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call (212) 371-4800. Mattress-to-Go 
</P>
<P>
 When you need an extra bed, at home or away, an Aero Bed may be the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as cumbersome as a futon, but more comfortable than an air mattress, the 
Aero bed, made of durable vinyl, inflates in less than a minute and quickly 
adjusts from firm to soft with a one-touch control. 
</P>
<P>
 Two models are available: the Extra Bed operates electrically from any wall 
socket, and the Travel Bed can be used indoors or outdoors with a cordless 
pump. 
</P>
<P>
 The twin bed can support up to 500 pounds, the full up to 750 pounds and the 
queen up to 1,000. All use standard flat or fitted sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 For storage, they roll up like sleeping bags and tuck away in their own duffle 
bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra bed is sold with a washable, quilted mattress cover, cord, patch kit 
and carrying bag. The travel bed includes the mattress cover, rechargeable 
cordless pump and patch kit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both models are offered in twin (about $99), full (about $150) and queen 
(about $200) sizes. They are available at Bed, Bath and Beyond in Huntington 
Beach and at Brookstone stores, located at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, 
Main Place/Santa Ana and the Brea Mall.

WILDLIFE; PUTTING OUT THE UNWELCOME MAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may find a mouse in the house, bats in your belfry, opossums in the garage 
or squirrels in the attic when wildlife seeks warmer creature comforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Uninvited wildlife is best managed with a policy of exclusion, 
conservationists say. 
</P>
<P>
 With exclusion, you find a way to discourage, or exclude, animals from your 
territory. It is a low-impact method of dealing with wild visitors that results 
in fewer injuries to the animals than trapping does and is much less likely to 
cause them undue stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people try live-trapping a marauder, transporting it several miles and 
then depositing it into a new environment. That method is not recommended, 
though, because the animal will not know where to find food and water in the 
new location and is often injured fighting with another adult as it tries to 
carve out a new territorial niche.  
</P>
<P>
 Conservationists urge people to block unwelcome animals from their homes and 
to remove obvious outdoor attractions such as a dish of pet food. Otherwise 
they advise leaving alone those that pose no threat.  
</P>
<P>
 Entry holes, once located, can usually be blocked with sheet metal, foam 
insulation or metal screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding the entry hole is not always easy. Some bats, for instance, can 
squeeze through an opening less than three-quarters of an inch in diameter. If 
these nocturnal creatures take up residence in your attic and you feel 
compelled to evict them, you can best determine their exit sites at dusk, when 
they generally leave their roost to feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bats are much more benign than their reputation suggests. They consume 
hundreds of tons of destructive insects each year and help pollinate many 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike squirrels and raccoons, one or two bats in a seldom-used attic will 
provide few clues that they are there. They don't chew holes in your home or 
destroy insulation. Robert Benson, public information officer for Bat 
Conservation International, estimated that 80% of bats living in buildings and 
outbuildings go undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 Single bats that get into living quarters are most often misplaced youngsters. 
Open a window and close all doors -- after the bat gets its bearings, it will 
generally fly out the window. This technique works with birds as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bat alights and you can get close, Benson suggested putting a coffee 
can over it. The bat will most likely crawl into it because it is a dark, safe 
place. Put on gloves, cover the end of the can with a piece of cardboard and 
carry it outside to release the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a whole colony in your attic, you probably want to exclude them. 
Find their entry point, wait until all the animals have vacated for the night, 
then hang a piece of bird netting over the outside of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Fasten the netting in place across the top and part way down the sides but 
leave the bottom open. This will allow the bats to fly out -- they hit the net 
and drop down -- but they won't be able to re-enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait three or four days to make sure all the animals have vacated, then seal 
the hole.

DO-IT-YOURSELF: AND FOR OUR NEXT TRICK, WE'LL TURN A JIGSAW INTO A SANDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Often the sign of a good do-it-yourselfer is the ability to improvise in 
situations and develop various "tricks" or techniques for making a job easier. 
Here are four techniques we've found that will come in handy when working in 
your home shop: 
</P>
<P>
 * You can turn a bench-type jigsaw into a power sander by screwing a hanger 
bolt into one end of a sanding block and mounting it in the lower chuck of the 
saw. This easy-to-make attachment consists of a block of soft wood measuring 
3/4-by-1 1/2-by-3 inches with the wood screw threads of the hanger bolt screwed 
into the center of the end grain. Bore a hole in the block so that the 
1/4-by-2-inch hanger bolt won't split the block. Then, using rubber cement, 
glue coarse abrasive paper to one side and fine to the other. Or, use 
adhesive-backed paper like 3M's Press 'n Sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Clamp the protruding machine screw threads of the hanger bolt into the lower 
chuck of the saw. Different shaped blocks can be made to smooth specific work 
pieces. Turning on the saw will move the sanding block rapidly up and down to 
smooth the edges of a work piece held on the saw table. 
</P>
<P>
 * You can prevent hammer dimples, often called owl's eyes, when nailing on 
soft wood by making a protective shield from 1/16th-inch thick plastic 
laminate. Cut the spoon-shaped shield so it has a 6-inch-long by 3/4-inch-wide 
handle with a 1 1/2-inch diameter "bowl" on the end. Bore a 1/8-inch hole in 
the center of this round "bowl" of the spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 To use the shield, start the nail and then place the shield over the head of 
the nail. Hold the shield flat against the surface of the wood with your 
fingers out of the way of the hammer. Drive the nail in until it's flush with 
the surface of the laminate shield. Then remove the shield and drive the 
projecting nailhead flush with or below the surface with a nail set. 
</P>
<P>
 * To make one wide board by edge-gluing two narrow ones, the mating edges must 
be perfectly true. Dressed lumber rarely has edges accurate enough for joining. 
However, using a portable circular saw, you can make the edges fit precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 Clamp both boards with their edges slightly butted together to the top of a 
pair of sawhorses. Clamp a metal straightedge as a guide so the saw kerf falls 
exactly on the joint between the two boards. Make the cut. If the edges still 
do not match precisely, adjust the boards in their clamps and make a second or 
third cut to close the gap. The result will be two straight and true mating 
edges that will produce a virtually invisible joint. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mounting a piano-type hinge on the edge of a piece of plywood can be tricky 
because the drill bit for the mounting screw holes can easily be deflected by a 
glue joint or a tough knot. Solve this problem by nailing a 1/8-inch thick pine 
reinforcement strip to the edge of the plywood. Punch the center marks and bore 
the holes through the strip. It will support the drill bit and keep it 
straight. Remove the guide strip before installing the hinge. This technique 
also works for installing hinges on other delicate surfaces where a slip might 
mar the finish.

THE BEST PLANTS FOR THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cyclamens that have been grown outdoors and are acclimatized will perform much 
better than ones that were propagated in a heated greenhouse and hurried to 
market, according to Steve Minoru Goto of Cyclamen Growers. Here's what to look 
for: 
</P>
<P>
 * A plant with stiff leaves.A cyclamen should have leaves strong enough to 
support its own weight if turned on its head. Since you would break off all the 
flowers if you tried this, which a nursery wouldn't appreciate, push down on 
the leaves instead and see how much resistance they offer. If they spring back 
readily, that's good. If they fall away from your touch, keep looking. 
</P>
<P>
 * A plant with a lot of small leaves rather than a few large ones. Overly 
large leaves are an indication the cyclamen's growth was forced, which makes it 
a weaker, more vulnerable plant than one grown at a more natural rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * A plant with shorter stems. Stems over eight inches tall could indicate the 
cyclamen was over-fertilized. SHARON COHOON

BUGS; NOT ALL SPIDERS ARE MAN'S BEST FRIENDS ON EIGHT LEGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite their creepy, crawly ap pearance, most spiders are the homeowner's 
friends because they help keep insect pests under control. But there are a 
couple of spiders you do have to watch for. Spider Homes 
</P>
<P>
 Of the few native American species that bite humans, only the black widow and 
the brown recluse spiders have bites that can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the female black widow that is dangerous. About one-half-inch long, it 
has a yellow or red hourglass design on the underside of its shiny black body. 
The black widow often lives under furniture, in debris and in outbuildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The brown recluse spider is also about one-half-inch long. It has a brown body 
and a distinctive dark, violin-shaped mark on its head. It inhabits places 
similar to the black widow, as well as folds of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The black widow is commonly found in the South, and the brown recluse is 
mainly a denizen of the Southwest and West. Both may appear in other 
localities. Spider Bites 
</P>
<P>
 All spiders inject venom when they bite, but only the black widow and brown 
recluse produce it in sufficient strength to injure a person. There is an 
anti-venom for the black widow's bite, but none for a brown recluse's. The 
recluse's bite may, however, be treated by large amounts of antihistamines, 
cortisone and antibiotics. The tarantula's bite, while not in itself serious, 
may introduce harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most spiders look similar to the untrained eye, it's better to treat 
the bite than to try to identify the biter. If the bite is very painful, red or 
swollen, assume that it is dangerous; don't wait for evidence of poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Get medical help promptly if sweating, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, joint 
pains, chills, fever or breathing difficulties develop. If you think you have 
been bitten by a poisonous spider, contact your poison control center 
immediately. (Look in the front of the telephone directory.) These bites are 
particularly dangerous to children age 5 and under. Keep the bite site lower 
than the heart and apply ice or a cold compress to it. A paste of baking soda 
and water will help soothe the pain. Spider Webs 
</P>
<P>
 Clean debris around your house and in the basement or crawl space to rid your 
home of many spider breeding places. Sweep webs away with a brush or mop head 
covered with a clean rag, or use the dusting brush attachment on the vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't stand directly under a spider web when sweeping it from the ceiling. If 
a spider falls on you, prevent a bite by quickly brushing it off instead of 
swatting it. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiders are among a gardener's best friends. When possible, capture the 
creature and release it in your garden to feast on crickets, sow bugs and other 
insect pests.

GARDENING; WATER: GIVER AND TAKER OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES WALTERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watering probably tops the list of cultural practices harmful to plants, 
particularly new ones. However, a few basics smooth the problems. The main goal 
should be to keep plants from the stress stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime gardeners constantly look at a plant for signs of stress and what may 
be causing it. Being a good observer requires monitoring not only the plants 
but also soil and weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also will help to group plants according to water requirements. Place 
together trees, shrubs and flowers that have high or low requirements, which 
helps to keep them from being over- or under-watered. While not always 
possible, such grouping should be a leading objective. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is a need to understand why watering requirements change as plants 
grow, and to water accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of wilting are bad news. Oddly, it can be caused by too much water or 
too little. 
</P>
<P>
 Established plants can tolerate some wilting and probably won't die from lack 
of water; they just won't grow very fast or look as good. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, new plants and seedlings need watering before they reach the 
stress stage. They become established through root growth and a good 
top-to-root balance. Some species take one to two years, or even more. Until 
you are sure they are established, give them close attention. Don't try to 
water on a fixed schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 With a newly purchased plant, the original advice is usually to water every 
couple of days after planting. The plant may look happy for months. But if such 
watering continues, it begins to wilt and drop leaves despite the attention 
lavished upon it. Actually it is drowning from lack of soil oxygen. More water 
finishes it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A better starting point usually is to water every other day for the first 
couple of weeks and then reduce this to once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Light but daily watering tends to establish shallow root systems subject to 
quick drying. Because a plant wilts if the roots don't have sufficient 
moisture, the deeper the roots go, the less vulnerable the plant is to 
fluctuations at the soil surface and sudden drying. Deep watering is good 
insurance. This means applying the water slowly so that it soaks in instead of 
running off. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions vary, of course, but start by assuming that one to two hours of 
slow soaking will wet the average soil to a depth of two feet and six to eight 
hours will reach four to five feet. In general, flowers root at least one-foot 
deep, established shrubs three to four feet deep and most mature trees as much 
as five feet or more. Determine the moisture depth by how easily a long 
screwdriver or narrow rod goes into the ground. It is hard to push into dry 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep watering also flushes soil salts from the root zone, which is 
particularly good insurance in arid regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulching is another good technique. Apply organic material to the soil surface 
to prevent drying, hold down weeds and keep temperatures cooler. 
</P>
<P>
 The most convenient and time-saving method of watering a landscape is likely 
to be an automatic irrigation system, eliminating the need to drag hoses to 
various locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Most gardeners find the convenience is worth the installation cost. But 
observe the system frequently while it is running to catch problems before they 
become serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Another point to remember: Roots don't seek water, they follow it. So they are 
reluctant to grow into dry soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Many flowers are low-water users. Where possible, it makes sense to opt for 
those that don't require regular watering.

COMPUTERS; HOMETIME PUTS PROS' ADVICE AT YOUR FINGERTIPS

 Some people are born convinced they know how to use hand tools around the 
house -- which must be what keeps so many home repair firms and insurance 
estimators in business. 
</P>
<P>
 My own untutored adventures have included water spouting from steam radiators 
triggered by a wrong furnace valve, electrifying dishwasher controls caused by 
a wrong wire and collapsible door frames due to choosing the wrong design. Most 
of these episodes began with my wife observing that I didn't know what I was 
doing and ended with results confirming her opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a better way if you have a multimedia-ready PC. It's called Hometime 
Weekend Home Projects (IVI Publishing, $45). 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend Home Projects features home improvement expert Dean Johnson, who 
appears on public television's "Hometime." Using a point-and-click interface 
running under Windows enables you to call up more than 60 minutes of how-to 
videos, as well as written materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The videos are the soul of the program -- it's easier to observe someone doing 
the program than it is to decipher a written explanation. You can freeze, 
fast-forward or reverse the frame. But there's a lot more that may save a 
project (and a marriage). 
</P>
<P>
 Where appropriate, the software will allow you to generate shopping lists and 
time frames from dimensions you've entered. That should greatly ease two of the 
most common woes of the fledgling do-it-yourselfer: wrong or insufficient 
materials and wildly optimistic time estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a notebook that allows a user to enter text and print or save 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Areas covered in the program include plumbing, ceramic tile, electricity, 
framing, drywall, building a deck, paints and stains, windows, doors and trim, 
wallpaper and flooring. 
</P>
<P>
 The software also walks you through a list of basic hand and power tools and 
steers you to suppliers for materials of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although thorough, there's a lighthearted tone to the advice.  
</P>
<P>
 Installation and use are easy, but Weekend Home Projects wants to see some 
serious multimedia PC muscle: a 486SX running at 25 megahertz or better PC, 
eight megabytes of RAM, double-speed CD-ROM drive, 256-color VGA monitor, 
Windows 3.1 or later, MS-DOS 5.0 or later, a 100% Sound Blaster compatible 
16-bit audio card and an accelerated right-bit video card. It includes 
QuickTime 1.1 Windows video viewer with the software. 
</P>
<P>
 Hometime Weekend Home Projects is available in software outlets.

DECOR; INSTALLMENT PLANS CAN PAY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Instant gratification is a kick sometimes, but decorating a little at a time 
on the installment plan is often the more realistic approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides spreading the cost over a longer period of time, the slow and easy 
method can minimize errors that occur when decisions are made hurriedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the temptation is to focus on decorating only when money and time 
become available, this approach often leads to a poor result. According to 
several decorators, a savvy way to proceed is to start with a detailed master 
plan and follow it through, step by step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, even if years will go by before the project is finished, there 
should be a written program for the entire space," says designer Gordon Micunis 
of Stamford, Conn. "Don't worry too much about where the items will be 
purchased or exactly what they will look like. The important thing at first is 
to know where everything will be placed." 
</P>
<P>
 If any alterations to the rooms are being contemplated, Micunis says that it 
is worthwhile to note them on paper early on. 
</P>
<P>
 New York decorator Joan Halperin also stresses the importance of jotting down 
the details of a decorating project. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a furniture layout and a budget for each room," Halperin says. "The 
budget should cover structural changes, painting, window coverings and 
lighting, as well as the specific items of furniture and accessories to be 
purchased." 
</P>
<P>
 Plan and budget. Set ballpark figures on expenses and what sizes to look for, 
Halperin says. These prevent easy mistakes of buying something that looks good 
in the store, but won't fit into the room, and exceeding the budget on 
something that temporarily captures a person's fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a plan and sticking to it is all in a day's work for professionals. 
The same tasks aren't so easy for the non-professional. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing a realistic budget and plan requires some knowledge of what items 
and services cost and a good sense of personal tastes. Comparison shopping will 
add to a person's knowledge of costs and preferences. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good master plan is a great deal of work," Micunis says. "But the same 
basic plan will work over a very long period and can even be used for 
renovations so long as there are no lifestyle changes." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes time to redecorate, quite often only reupholstery and repainting 
are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a master plan is in, the designers say, it is best to first focus on 
getting the room shell together. Doing repairs, making structural changes, 
refinishing the floor, painting and wallpapering are messy jobs that are most 
easily accomplished in an empty room. 
</P>
<P>
 Micunis says that about half of his clients decorate in installments mostly 
because of financial reasons. Others who are decorating with antiques may have 
to search for years to find the exact piece they are looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for the perfect item to turn up, it's still possible to make a 
room comfortable and attractive on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 To quickly fix up a Manhattan living room on a budget of $5,000, including 
labor, Halperin camouflaged the family's 15-year-old brown velvet sectional by 
slipcovering the pieces with an inexpensive striped fabric. She had window 
shades made up of heavyweight gauze that sells for about $10 per yard, and 
found a stylish, large sisal rug for about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 She also upgraded an $800 ready-made home entertainment cabinet by having it 
painted in two different colors. She then added lamps, potted plants and throw 
pillows to the room at very little expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing Halperin says she would do to refine the room would be to add 
full-length side panels to the window treatment. Then she would reupholster the 
slipcovered sofas or buy new seating. Additional upgrades would include a finer 
rug and a bigger coffee table.

IT'S BEEN 70 YEARS SINCE ANAHEIM BOOTED KLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the city's three new council members are sworn in on Tuesday, they will 
be a part of the biggest turnover on the panel since 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 But the current revamping is taking place under vastly different circumstances 
than 70 years ago, when Anaheim experienced the worst political turmoil in its 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during that time that four members of the Ku Klux Klan were forced off 
of the City Council (then known as the Board of Trustees) in a recall election. 
The four men had been elected in 1924 as part of a slate secretly sponsored by 
the Klan and had served for 11 months, according to newspaper accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was a rough time in the city's history," said 82-year-old Anaheim 
resident Elizabeth Schultz, whose uncle was head of the city's water department 
during that era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember my uncle telling me that his employees had to carry shotguns in 
the streets for protection because the city was so divided over the klan," 
Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 After they were elected to the panel, the klavern's presence in city 
government was quickly evident. The letters KIGY -- for Klansman I Greet You -- 
were painted on major streets entering town to assure visiting KKK members that 
they were on friendly turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim klavern concentrated much of its efforts into politics. Since 
there were few minorities living in Anaheim at that time, the klan was limited 
to opposing Catholicism and bootlegging, both of which were plentiful in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more of a religious thing," said 82-year-old Lecil Slaback of 
Silverado Canyon, whose uncle, Aaron A. Slaback, was among the klansmen ousted 
from the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not a racist," Slaback said of his uncle, who ran a grocery store 
downtown. "He was a kindly, pleasant man and very soft-spoken. All of this was 
just part of politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Slaback was among the local residents who apparently were influenced by 
the Rev. Leon C. Myers, who arrived in the city in 1922 to lead the First 
Christian Church of Anaheim, which provided a major boost for the klan. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers formed a men's Bible study group, which became the foundation for the 
klan in the city, and he used his pulpit to push membership. 
</P>
<P>
 During the height of their power, the Ku Klux Klan had an estimated 300 
members in Anaheim out of a population of about 10,000. They patrolled city 
streets in their robes and masks, stopping and interrogating citizens, and once 
burned a large cross in front of St. Boniface Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim was being advertised as a model klan city and was selected as the 
sight of a huge KKK rally that attracted about 20,000 people from all over 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at this point that opponents became more determined than ever to rid 
the city of the klan, and hostility between the two forces reached a new high. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-klan residents had formed a group called USA Club -- for "Unison, 
Service, Americanism" -- and backed a slate of successful candidates in the 
statewide primaries of 1924. This would be the first of several major blows 
dealt to the klan by the USA Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council then went under attack for ordering the removal of a flag and 
flagpole from the main intersection in town. This furor escalated when a leader 
of the anti-klan forces bought a membership list of the local klavern. 
</P>
<P>
 The list, which was distributed throughout the town, included the names of the 
four councilmen, nine of the 10 members of the Police Department and several 
other city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, recall petitions against the four councilmen were circulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter battle pitted Anaheim's leading newspaper, the Plain Dealer, which 
supported the Klan's candidates, against the Anaheim Bulletin and the Anaheim 
Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the recall election in February, 1925, 95% of the city's 
registered voters turned out at the polls, which were guarded by city police, 
sheriff's deputies and district attorney inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The klan suffered a resounding defeat with each councilman losing by more than 
500 votes. At the same time, the klan's attempt to recall the lone anti-klan 
councilman failed.

SHARING PRECIOUS DOMAIN; RUSTIC RILEY WILDERNESS PARK WILL OPEN TO PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll get cabin fever here," county ranger Ginny McVickar said 
as she watched a red-tailed hawk circling over the rolling hills and oak-filled 
canyons of Gen. Thomas F. Riley Wilderness Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a cold, clear afternoon and McVickar was admiring the panoramic view 
from Skink Vista Point -- one of two lookout spots in this minimally developed 
recreational area that will open to the public Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Mountain dominates the view to the north, and to the east one can 
see the Cleveland National Forest and portions of Riverside County. San Juan 
Capistrano lies to the south, and the rugged ridge above Oak Canyon is to the 
west. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is heaven for me," said McVickar, who has been a county ranger for four 
years and previously worked as a wilderness guide in New Mexico. "I used to do 
this for fun. Now I have a job doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The sign at the entrance had to be altered when the 475-acre Wagon Wheel 
Canyon Regional Park was renamed in honor of the retiring county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that change, there aren't many improvements at this park, which is 
intentional. Trails have been cut for hikers, equestrians and mountain bikers, 
and there will be some nature exhibits, corrals, portable toilets and a few 
picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's about it," McVickar said, explaining that the park's mission is to 
protect the natural environment while providing educational opportunities and 
low-impact forms of recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the plants growing in the park are stately oak trees up to 200 years 
old, sycamores, coastal sage, prickly pear cacti and a profusion of wildflowers 
in the springtime. Animals include mule deer, gray foxes, coyotes, birds of 
prey, bobcats and an occasional mountain lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen tracks, but not the lions," McVickar said. "But they're here." 
</P>
<P>
 The park is also home to endangered California gnatcatchers -- which sound 
like kittens -- and cactus wrens, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For being a little spot, it's full of all kinds of things," she said. 
"There's a family of native deer that I see every single day. They used to run 
away, now they just stop and look at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley Park is east of Mission Viejo and next to the residential community 
being developed by Coto de Caza Corp. The parkland, which had historically been 
used for cattle grazing, was donated to Orange County by Coto de Caza Corp. in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 To give visitors a sense of the park's agricultural heritage, McVickar is 
bringing in an antique buckboard -- a horse-drawn wagon -- for permanent 
display. She is also looking for some "really old, old photos" from that 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will kind of bring it alive for people," she said, "so they can imagine 
what it was like back then." 
</P>
<P>
 McVickar plans to offer free guided tours every Saturday morning, and will 
conduct specialized tours for a small charge. There will not be an entrance fee 
at the park, which will be open from 7 a.m. to sunset, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the celebration Dec. 10, McVickar has scheduled a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony, hay rides, tours, environmental exhibits, food and refreshments from 
10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a real great experience for me to open this park," she said. "How 
many people get a chance to do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Riley Park is at the east end of Oso Parkway off Interstate 5. Additional 
information is available from the County Environmental Management Agency at 
(714) 728-0235 or (714) 728-3420. Wildnerness Park

FAMILY ARRANGES FUNERAL, CITES PROP. 187 FEARS; AFTERMATH: JULIO CANO WILL BE 
BURIED IN MEXICO. HIS PARENTS HOPE ATTENTION TO STORY ALLEVIATES MISINFORMATION 
ABOUT INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of Julio Cano was making plans Friday to send their son's body to 
Mexico for burial and seeking to cope with their loss just days after being 
thrust into the center of Proposition 187's political storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is important right now are our personal problems, to get our son's body 
to Acapulco," said the 12-year-old's father. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's parents, who are illegal immigrants, say they delayed getting care 
for their ill son for several days last week because they feared their status 
would be questioned. A day after he was finally examined by a doctor, his 
condition suddenly deteriorated and he died. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents said Friday the political attention their son's death is receiving 
is important because it highlights the misinformation among many immigrants 
about Proposition 187, which would cut off government services and all but 
emergency medical care for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that there is a lot of fear, that the law is not that clear," the 
boy's mother said. "I don't want what happened to us to happen to more 
families. I want people who approved this law, who created it, to think very 
closely about it. It has hurt us very much and can hurt others as well. Before 
applying this law, please, think about it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio died Nov. 19 and preliminary autopsy results indicate he had acute 
leukemia and a secondary infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Although medical experts say acute leukemia often can be successfully treated, 
it remains unclear whether earlier medical intervention would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 supporters say the family's tragedy is being manipulated for 
political gain. Some said responsibility for the boy's death lies with the 
parents, for bringing him to this country illegally in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still goes back to parental responsibility," said Ron Prince, who 
co-chaired the group that proposed the new law, which is on hold because of 
legal challenges. "When people come here illegally, they place those children 
at risk. And, if they are bringing children here, they should provide for them 
or be capable of doing so." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 opponents have pointed to Julio's death as a sign of 
casualties to come if the measure is implemented, and an indication that 
efforts to urge the illegal immigrant community to continue seeking care for 
now have fallen short. 
</P>
<P>
 "If only we and others had been more effective in getting the word out about 
the fact that a temporary restraining order had been issued, this wouldn't have 
happened," said Peter Schey, head of the Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law in Los Angeles and the attorney who filed suit against the 
measure in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are hundreds of other cases out there like this on the verge of 
happening. There are certainly tens of thousands of people in the community who 
don't know that there's a temporary restraining order enjoining 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio's family has received an outpouring of support from firefighters, church 
members and school officials, who are collecting donations on the family's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitation for the Sycamore Junior High School seventh-grader will take place 
Monday from 3 to 8 p.m. at the Hilgenfeld Mortuary in Anaheim, and his body 
will then be transported to the airport for an early Tuesday flight to Mexico, 
his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 The father said that the Anaheim Firefighters Assn. has agreed to pay half of 
the estimated $3,000 it will cost to fly the boy's body home to Acapulco, where 
his grandparents will arrange for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to say to all the people who have helped us that it is noble what 
they are doing," the father said. "We want to thank everyone who has helped us 
in this. It's a help that we really did need." 
</P>
<P>
 Julio had been ill since Nov. 14, but his parents said they were afraid to 
take him to a hospital because they had been denied non-emergency care before 
and thought that, with the passage of Proposition 187, their legal status would 
be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 18, the parents said they took the boy to a private doctor after 
gathering $60 to pay for the visit. Julio died the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 The father said he didn't think his son's condition would have been considered 
an emergency by hospital staff because he did not appear to be gravely ill, but 
"one day he was walking and the next day he was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 The family has spoken to attorneys for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, which has filed a lawsuit challenging the measure. While the 
father said he made "no concrete plans" with MALDEF, an Orange County spokesman 
for the organization said earlier this week that the family's declarations will 
be added to the amended lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The father said Friday that he hopes the family's tragedy will help inform 
other undocumented immigrants that they can still seek care at a publicly 
funded hospital or community clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has to know what measures have been taken -- to understand, to 
realize that problems like this can escalate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family will not be accompanying the body to Mexico Tuesday, he said, 
because he does not want to lose his job or take his other children out of 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to go, but it's not possible. The body will go alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he thanked members of the Latino community for support in recent days, 
the father said he and his family have received a handful of hostile calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying that, if we didn't want this to happen, why don't we leave," 
he said. "These are people without scruples or feelings."

THEY'RE SET FOR BATTLE, BUT IT WON'T BEE SOON; PUBLIC SAFETY: SPECIAL COUNTY 
UNIT IS KEEPING AN EYE OUT -- AND WEAPONS READY -- FOR ARRIVAL OF FEARED 
INSECTS.

 They call themselves the "B" team. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Orange County's first line of defense against the dreaded and 
much-ballyhooed Africanized honeybee. But the specially equipped swat team from 
the Orange County Vector Control District has encountered one major problem 
since it was formed eight months ago: no killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
 After undergoing special training to combat the ferocious pests, the original 
five-person team has dwindled to three, with two of the remaining trio often 
pulling rat and mosquito extermination duty. Two of the team's five new trucks 
designed to annihilate the bees have been put in mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
 But as much as the squad would like to think the feared swarms are afraid to 
set their hairy legs in Orange County, the fact is the Africanized honeybees 
are just moving slower than anticipated, experts say. Originally, the bees were 
supposed to arrive last spring; now local experts say it will be more like next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I'm disappointed they aren't here yet," said Danny McCarty, a 
reassigned "B" teamer who will return as a substitute once the killer bees show 
up. "I think the public is happy they aren't here yet. But we are waiting for 
the real thing." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the county unit has been training on swarms of the more 
docile European bee. Last week, two members attacked a colony of some 40,000 
bees that had nested near the Orange Freeway and Yorba Linda Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. But it didn't come without cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I got stung a few times," said Dennis Loughner, supervisor of the 
county's Africanized honeybee program. "Sometimes they sting through the veil." 
</P>
<P>
 Bees also can sting through the team's cotton suits. But when the killer bees 
begin buzzing by, the team probably will start wearing two protective suits at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 A key to victory, team members realize, is to study their enemy. Accordingly, 
they have immersed themselves in killer bee literature, which chronicles the 
hybrid insects' slow migration from Brazil since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 The research has shown that while although killer bees are nothing to ignore, 
they aren't exactly the lethal menace once thought to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the public hears is the horror stories," Loughner said. "And that all the 
bees are going to be killers and such." The sting of the Africanized honeybee 
really isn't any more venomous than that of his European cousin, but the 
newcomers attack in far greater numbers. Besides, he said, "we still need them 
to pollinate the trees and flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "And you can take protective measures." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's first weapon is a pack they carry on their backs that's powered by 
a hand pump and sprays a bee-suffocating soapy solution. If that doesn't work, 
they go to "the power sprayer." 
</P>
<P>
 A hose-like device bolted onto their trucks, the sprayer holds 50 gallons of 
the solution and can fire 45 feet vertically and 65 feet horizontally. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get them stirred up and they start getting out of control," Loughner 
said, "we can knock them down with this." 
</P>
<P>
 But the team has developed a healthy respect for their foe. After all, a swarm 
of killer bees has been known to sting a victim up to 4,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little apprehensive," Loughner said. "If it's a swarm, I just hope we 
handle it efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't be too long before they discover how they will perform in combat. 
The bees crossed into Riverside County earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he is only a substitute, McCarty is eager to be the first to bag a 
killer bee. McCarty's co-workers say if his track record is any indication, the 
Vietnam War veteran probably will do it. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has created its own competitions, and McCarty keeps coming out on 
top. The squad recently honored the Garden Grove resident as its first "ace" 
for killing 10 bee swarms. No less a distinction, however, is McCarty's 
certificate for being the first team member to get stung. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, it definitely hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Africanized and European bees look so much alike, it's very possible 
the "B" team won't know it has slain its nemesis for a week or so. After they 
wipe out a swarm, a sampling is sent to the lab for weeklong tests to identify 
the species. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually might be shocked to find out they're Africanized," Loughner said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FUR SALON ATTRACTS PROTESTERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Animal rights activists staged a peaceful but noisy demonstration Friday 
inside a department store and elsewhere in the county as part of an annual 
protest against the sale of furs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 members of the Orange County People for Animals denounced the sales 
and purchase of furs, passing out pamphlets and blocking shoppers from entering 
the fur salon at Neiman Marcus in the Fashion Island shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to close down all fur salons," said activist Jorge Belloso. 
"There are alternatives to fur. There is no reason to inflict pain and cruelty 
to animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Another demonstration was held outside South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators at Neiman Marcus began by sitting in front of the fur salon's 
cash register with poster-size photos of a skinless fox caught in a trap. While 
a tape of a squealing fox was played, other protesters milled through the store 
disseminating pamphlets. Others chanted, "Compassion is the fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers passed by, grimacing at the pictures. Several customers scolded 
the chanting protesters that they were infringing upon shoppers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys are the biggest idiots," said Earl Welliver, 59, a shopper from 
Texas. "You don't have any right to be here. If I want to buy fur, that's my 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Squabbles between some shoppers and protesters forced store employees to block 
off the boisterous crowd with clothes racks. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters dispersed after about 30 minutes when police arrived. No 
arrests were made. TINA NGUYEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BARBER'S RETURN IS SHEAR PLEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his 35 years as a barber in the city, Amador Corona says he has cut as many 
heads of hair as there are "hairs on a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was no surprise that he was missed when cancer forced him to take a 
nearly yearlong hiatus from his shop. Earlier this month, he returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm delighted," said Harold Beibin, a client of Corona's for the past 20 
years. "Who else is going to cut my hair?" 
</P>
<P>
 Corona, 64, owns a traditional barbershop on 18th Street with his wife, Ethel, 
who is also a barber. He has been giving haircuts there since 1970, and for 
more than a decade before that, he worked at another shop in town. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, his lymphoma forced him to stop working, and until three weeks ago 
he had been too weak to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The week before Father's Day, doctors told my wife to make the (funeral) 
arrangements," Corona said. "I was bleeding internally and I was getting 
transfusions, but here I am, thank God." 
</P>
<P>
 In August, as a tribute and to encourage him in his fight against cancer, the 
City Council granted Ethel Corona's request for permission to place a 
seven-inch brass star with Amador Corona's name on it in the sidewalk in front 
of the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody has been here for that long and as an active contributing member 
of the community, it's nice to recognize them," said Mayor Sandra L. Genis, who 
also gave him a certificate of recognition. "While they're there, you take them 
for granted. It's the people who work day to day that are the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Amador Corona is back at the shop eight hours a day. "Right now, I feel 
great," he said. The cancer has been in remission for two months and he is 
gaining weight, but no one knows how long his improved health will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he is back at the shop though, his customers are spreading the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never stopped coming here," said Beibin, who had Ethel Corona cut his 
hair during the past 11 months and recommends the shop to friends. "It's 
comfortable, friendly and you hear the latest jokes. You leave here looking 
good and feeling better than when you came in." NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS UNEXPECTED GOOD FORTUNE: $3 
MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District has an extra $3 million to spend, thanks to 
an unexpected enrollment increase and a review of the budget by the new 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 new students have enrolled in district schools this year, Supt. 
Robert L. French told the board of education at a meeting Wednesday. That 
increase, and a raise in state lottery funds, gave the district an extra $2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A budget review ordered by French, who was hired in September, also turned up 
a "recalculation" of income from interest that will bring about $1 million, 
according to the budget report. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will spend about $500,000 in extra costs brought on by the new 
students, acting Assistant Supt. Harvey Grimshaw said. But officials will be 
able to submit a new budget to the state that includes the 3% reserve required 
for the district's $108-million budget. The reserve had been short about 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will provide the opportunity for the district to unquestionably certify 
(with the state) as opposed to the qualified certification which would lead us 
down the road to greater scrutiny by the state and county," Grimshaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees said they were glad the earlier budget projections had been off-base. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a tough two to three years for the district to try and get some 
stability," Trustee Robert Viviano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's unions were also interested in the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Mayers, president of the local chapter of the California School 
Employees Assn., said her union will ask the district to share the wealth. The 
non-teaching employees took a 2.5% pay cut last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will be negotiating their contract Friday and union president David 
Reger said he anticipates good news. The teachers took a pay cut three years 
ago and have not had a raise since, although some have had bonuses. LESLEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; CITY COUNCIL GIVES BUSINESS HIGH SIGN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on a promise to be more business-friendly, the City Council has readily 
granted an auto dealer's request to construct business signs more visible from 
the Garden Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 With little discussion, council members allowed Showcase Auto Mall to erect a 
taller and wider sign at 5400 Garden Grove Blvd., overturning a Planning 
Commission ruling earlier this month that set the sign's height at 30 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-foot-tall pylon sign -- supported by two poles -- is one of two signs 
Showcase Auto Mall plans to install in a three-building complex now is under 
construction. The other is a 677-square-foot sign, more than three times larger 
than the code limit, which the council also approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said approval of the huge sign was justified because it will be part 
of the architectural feature of the building where it will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need all the help they can get in that area," said Councilman Tony Lam. 
City officials have pledged to cut red tape whenever possible to help local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto mall will house one of the biggest Chevrolet dealerships in Orange 
County, and will feature the Chevrolet Image 2000 program, which is being 
promoted nationwide. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL PICKS PATCHIN TO SERVE AS MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Patchin, a retired aerospace executive and a scrupulous reader of the fine 
print, is the city's new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading all documents carefully is something I learned to do in my years in 
the aerospace industry," Patchin said."While on the City Council, I've been 
careful to read all the documents, especially the ones about the JPA," a 
reference to the Joint Powers Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin was a leading opponent on the council to the suggestion that Villa 
Park join the proposed countywide fire authority governing board of the 18 
cities now served by the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin said the JPA's original documents were poorly worded and could have 
led to tax increases and chaos for Villa Park. Although outgoing Mayor Barry L. 
Denes successfully negotiated new terms in the document's wording, Patchin cast 
the only opposing vote when Villa Park's City Council finally agreed to join 
the authority on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin, 67, was elected by his fellow council members to the mayoral post at 
the City Council's Tuesday night meeting. The council chose Councilman Joseph 
S. Barsa as mayor pro tem. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin was elected to the City Council two years ago in his first bid for 
public office. He and his wife, Dot, have lived in Villa Park since 1966 and 
have three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchin says his goal as mayor is to try to keep the city, which has a 
population of 6,400, as a "semirural, very friendly" community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here since the town had 800 people in it, so I've seen tremendous 
change," he said. "We recognize that there is going to be tremendous 
construction when the (economic) boom comes back, and I want to try to preserve 
what we can of our old ambience, in spite of the onslaught." BILL BILLITER

 A truck driver unloading food behind a supermarket was shot and wounded Friday 
by a youth who escaped, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name was withheld by police, suffered a gunshot wound to his 
side when a youth walked up to him behind the Stater Bros.Market at Lincoln and 
Knott avenues and inexplicably fired one shot about 11:30 a.m., according to 
Jim Osbourne, a security guard hired by the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not reveal the name of the hospital where the victim was taken, 
but said his injuries were minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, last seen fleeing east on Lincoln Avenue, remained at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stuff like this has never happened here before," Osbourne said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, an employee at Pacific Bell, which is next door, said many 
workers were scared to walk out to the parking lot, which is separated from the 
crime scene by a five-foot brick wall. THAO HUA

<P>
 Sheriff's deputies on Friday arrested an Aliso Viejo man who shot at a fellow 
gang member and missed outside a Laguna Niguel restaurant, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thadeus Smith, 32, was booked into Orange County Jail on suspicion of assault 
with a deadly weapon in connection with the shooting, which took place after a 
fistfight with the victim, said Sheriff's Lt. William Francis.He was being held 
on $50,000 bail, according to jail officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, described by authorities as gang members, were fighting over the 
suspect's wife, Francis said, but details were unclear. There were no injuries 
in the shooting outside the restaurant on Cabot Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies made the arrest after stopping Smith in a car on the San Diego 
Freeway. Investigators later were searching beside the freeway for a 
.25-caliber handgun they believe he threw out of the car. KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; STUDENTS HONOR THEIR FAMILY TIES

 Grandparents came from as far away as Egypt and the Philippines, and some from 
as close as across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a special day at Isojiro Oka Elementary School this week as students 
welcomed their grandparents or a special guest, including aunts, uncles and 
friends.The guests visited classrooms and shared stories of their own school 
years and childhoods. They were also treated to a Thanksgiving presentation in 
their honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember always being late for school -- and I only lived two blocks away," 
recalled Anne Shriver, 77, of Huntington Beach, who visited the classroom of 
her grandson, Joseph Dutra, 8. "I'd wait for the last bell to ring and get in 
just under the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 Mac and Ann Rosenhaft of Laguna Hills, married nearly 55 years, told students 
in grandson Joshua Gitsham's class about their childhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have the freedom children have today," Ann Rosenhaft said about her 
school days in Brooklyn, N.Y. "We sat in rows with our hands folded and waited 
for orders from the teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Third-grade teacher Maggi Brummett said the annual event, which always takes 
place during Thanksgiving week, helps give students a sense of identity, of who 
they are and where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also shows the children that what they're doing (in school) is special, 
worthwhile and important," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, including 8-year-old Joshua Gitsham, were especially proud of their 
classroom visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joshua, who showed his grandparents his desk: "They're very special to me 
because they do nice stuff for me. I love them a lot." DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; ORDINANCE LIMITS SITES OF ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously approved an emergency ordinance 
limiting adult businesses such as strip bars and adult bookstores to commercial 
properties close to the Laguna Hills Mall, near freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous zoning ordinance had allowed such businesses in three additional 
small areas, including lots zoned for local-oriented businesses, said City 
Planning Director Mike Thiele. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinance we inherited from the county had some problems with it," Thiele 
said. "So we want to take a look at it and come up with a revised plan that 
protects First Amendment rights while also protecting the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills does not have any adult businesses that would be affected by the 
ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the emergency ordinance, an adult business may not locate within 500 
feet of houses or within 1,000 feet of churches, schools, parks, and other 
adult-oriented businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will be in place until Jan. 6, when the council may decide to 
extend it another 10 months. The young city expects to have a new comprehensive 
and permanent zoning code in place by next June that would cover all 
development in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Other South County cities have taken similar preemptive measures to limit 
openings of adult businesses while not banning them outright. Courts have 
deemed a total ban to be an infringement on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms wishing to open an adult business here must obtain a conditional-use 
permit and a special city license that lists the names and addresses of all the 
business partners. The company must not have had an adult business license 
revoked in the last two years. LYNN FRANEY

 Harry Noonan runs one of the oldest Christmas Tree lots in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1944, Noonan has been selling trees during the holiday season at 
locations around Costa Mesa. He and his son now run the business out of a lot 
in the 2100 block of Newport Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 When he started out, Noonan sold trees for 25 cents. Many of his customers 
then were farmers in the agricultural area known as Goat Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, trees sell anywhere from $19 to $2,000, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan has been forced to move his business several times as Costa Mesa's open 
spaces were developed.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; COMMISSIONERS OK PLANS FOR REI STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission this week approved a 35,000-square-foot retail store 
at the Freeway Center shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 4-0 vote, commissioners granted a request from the Mission Viejo Co. to 
cancel plans for a restaurant in the mall and add the square footage to another 
commercial space to make way for a larger retail store. 
</P>
<P>
 REI Inc., a chain of stores selling rock-climbing equipment and other outdoors 
goods, will be moving into the new building. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners were so enthused about having REI in the city that they asked 
company representatives if they wanted more sign space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are usually stingy about handing out sign space," Commissioner Sunnie 
Castner said. "But we thought people driving south (on El Paseo) needed the 
sign to recognize the building." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it hopes to have the store open by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The only objection to the sporting goods store came from the city of Laguna 
Hills, which asked for shorter store hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission declined the request. "The current hours set in the list of 
conditions (for the proposed REI store) are fine," Castner said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to selling goods for mountaineers, REI will also build a climbing 
wall where customers can try out their equipment. FRANK MESSINA

CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL PLAY IS EXPECTING; PAGEANT: THE ANNUAL 'GLORY OF CHRISTMAS' 
PRODUCTION CELEBRATES A BIRTH BY FEATURING MANY NEWBORN ANIMAL ACTORS. IT'S ALL 
PART OF THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the traditional story remains the same, the "Glory of Christmas" 
performance at the Crystal Cathedral each year includes some four-legged 
newcomers, to the stage and to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As the show premiered for its 14th year Friday, its producers said audiences 
will see more newborn animals than ever, including camels, lambs, kids, calves 
and a 2-week-old donkey named Glory. 
</P>
<P>
 An extraordinary number of pregnant animals on the set promised that more 
offspring will arrive before the curtain falls on yet another Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the births is no accident, said John Vint, handler of the 
approximately 30 animals who are helping to re-enact the story of the birth of 
Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want newborns on the stage," Voit said. "The animals are bred so they will 
pop at this time." Between shows the animals are stabled next to the church 
parking lot, in an area that becomes a children's petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children can come and see the animals from now until Dec. 30," said Cindi 
Palomarez, spokeswoman for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals, both the young just getting accustomed to the lights and noise and 
the seasoned veterans, are vital to the show that is expected to attract up to 
170,000 spectators this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Horses carry the Roman soldiers, camels transport the Three Wise Men, a donkey 
carries Mary into Bethlehem and a veritable menagerie of animals appears in a 
market scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul David Dunn, who has produced and directed "The Glory of Christmas" for 
the last decade, said the cost of renting and maintaining the animals, which 
come from a ranch in Riverside, accounts for $100,000 of the show's $2-million 
annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals pose a unique challenge to some of the actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until four years ago I had never ridden a camel," said Eric King, a 
56-year-old accountant from Anaheim who for the fifth year has volunteered to 
play the role of a wise man. 
</P>
<P>
 King rides a dromedary down the length of the cathedral. He said he soon got 
the hang of it, learning to brace himself to avoid taking a nosedive when the 
animal kneels to lower itself to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the show it is amazing the response I get from the children and 
adults," King said. "I have to sign autographs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbie Candler, a 34-year-old professional actress from Encino, said she is 
"thrilled" to be playing the part of Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the role, Candler rides a gray donkey named Hercules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ride horses, but this is sidesaddle, she said, with balancing made more 
difficult by the pillow tucked under her costume to give the illusion of 
pregnancy. "Poor donkey," she said, "I hold onto the scruff of its mane." 
</P>
<P>
 Candler said it is her first year in the role and it helps that Hercules has 
played his role for the last seven Christmases and knows where to go. "The 
donkey knows the cues better than I do," she said with a laugh.

GIRL IGNITES APARTMENT WITH BUTANE LIGHTER; FIRES: FOUR CHILDREN AND TWO ADULTS 
ARE EVACUATED. CHILD SAYS SHE WAS TRYING TO KEEP HER TEDDY BEAR WARM. 
</P>

<P>
 A 5-year-old girl using a lighter to keep her teddy bear warm ignited a fire 
early Friday that caused $25,000 in damage to an apartment building, fire 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which broke out about 1:30 a.m., could have been kept to a much 
smaller scale had there been batteries in the smoke alarm, said Dennis Shell, 
an Orange County Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carelessness almost took the life of a little girl," he said. "This could 
have been a devastating holiday tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The child, Robin, whose last name was not known by fire officials, was playing 
with a butane lighter in her apartment complex in the 10200 block of Fern 
Avenue. The lighter ignited Robin's teddy bear, which she said she was trying 
to keep warm, then spread to the bedsheets and the mattress, Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once she saw that her bed was on fire, she went to middle of the room and 
just sat on the floor," Shell said. "She was scared that she was going to get 
in trouble, so she didn't tell anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 An adult in the apartment, Ruben Torres, 34, "just sensed that something was 
wrong and went to check it out," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres evacuated Robin, three other children ages from 5 to 11 who were 
sleeping in the next room, and a 31-year-old woman. Investigators did not know 
if the children are related to Torres or the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying three hand-held fire extinguishers, Torres went back to the bedroom 
and tried to control the fire until help arrived. About two dozen firefighters 
extinguished the fire in 10 minutes, Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the blackened blankets, clothes and toys were presented to the 
children as a way to counsel them on fire safety. The American Red Cross 
provided replacement clothes and blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were devastated," Shell said.

ARCADE SHOOTING VICTIM IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man who was shot several times at an arcade remained in critical 
condition Friday, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers found Huy Nguyen about 8 p.m. Thursday in a pool of blood with 
gunshots to the head, torso and leg at the Mission Control Amusement Center in 
the 14300 block of Brookhurst Street.Police said they know of no motive for the 
shooting or if it was gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to state what hospital the victim was at. They described his 
condition as "extremely critical." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a nearby market said she was not surprised by the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew something like this was bound to happen," said Oanh Mai, owner of Nam 
Hoa Market, which is in the same strip mall as the arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Mai said she was scheduled to close at 8 p.m. Thursday, but locked up just 
after 7 p.m. because she feared violence would erupt among the scores of rowdy 
teen-agers gathered at the arcade and adjoining parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually meet on weekends, but also on a weekday when it's a holiday," 
Mai said. "They play the music very loud and fights would break out. I don't 
feel very safe when they're here." 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, Mai said, more than 30 area shopkeepers signed a petition 
and submitted it to the shopping center's management in an effort to stop 
teen-agers from loitering around the arcade. But Mai said the problems 
continued at the arcade, which opened more than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Managers of the shopping center and the arcade could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been arrested in the shooting, police said.

FOR THE HOMELESS, SOME UNORTHODOX SUCCESS; SHELTERS: PASADENA'S PILOT PROGRAM 
DISCARDS TOUGH LOVE APPROACH, BLENDING INTENSIVE MANAGEMENT WITH GREATER 
AUTONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, 26-year-old Francoise Parker and nine other homeless people had 
slept under a rickety, tent-like encampment at Pasadena's Memorial Park, eking 
out a sorry living recycling cans and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day in April they were persuaded to leave the park for a converted 
church hall -- and a surprisingly dramatic transformation began for most of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 45 days, three of the 10 had found housing. Within six months, seven 
had moved into an apartment, rental house or were staying with a friend. (The 
remaining three went back to the streets). Six had applied for work or found 
jobs. Four had enrolled in -- and later completed -- residential drug 
rehabilitation programs. Each had obtained valid California identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lifeline was a $15,000, city-funded pilot program aimed at quickly 
turning around the lives of the chronically homeless by giving them a 
remarkable degree of personal autonomy in a group shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena program turned the traditional homeless shelter notion of tough 
love on its head. It left it up to the individual to show up for counseling 
sessions, go to bed at a reasonable hour and stop drinking or using drugs. Rule 
breakers -- who in most shelters are kicked out or lose privileges such as 
telephone use -- were left to deal with their own conscience and asked to focus 
on individual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson, sponsors say, is that flexibility makes it easier to attract the 
hard-core homeless to shelter programs, and grooms them to carry on their own 
lives once they leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Other programs) really don't treat you like adults," Francoise Parker said. 
"They treat you like kids, like you don't have a mind or opinion of your own, 
that you're really not capable of doing anything by yourself, that you always 
have to be guided by the hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers of people who succeeded in the pilot program "are some of the best 
I've heard," said USC geography professor Michael Dear, author of "Malign 
Neglect," a book on homelessness in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the gains came at a high price. 
</P>
<P>
 In many bigger programs, homeless advocates say, one case manager might have 
to juggle 15 clients or more. By contrast, Pasadena had six case managers for 
the 10 homeless people. In addition, one social services agency agreed to pay 
the first and last month's rent for those who found housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything -- in this region at least -- so intense, with the 
hand-holding aspect of it," said Ruth Schwartz, executive director of Shelter 
Partnership, a countywide nonprofit organization that works with groups that 
serve the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena city officials began their plan to move the homeless people from 
Memorial Park in response to numerous complaints and a local theater group's 
request to use the stage for rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
 First, social service providers had to persuade park regulars to clear out for 
good and move into the church hall. In exchange, they offered a promise: This 
program would be different from all the others that the participants had turned 
their backs on. 
</P>
<P>
 The targets were people who had been on the streets for four years or more and 
could not abide by the simplest of rules in a traditional shelter, said Joseph 
Colletti, director of Lutheran Social Services in Pasadena, which coordinated 
the project with three other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was helped not just by the high number of case managers, but by 
the fact that the park group had already lived together like a family. 
</P>
<P>
 They had stuck together through the worst of times, sleeping under the 
graceful arc of Memorial Park's Art Deco band shell in the heart of the city, 
their encampment strung together with overturned shopping carts, rope and 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, the only woman in the group, had started running away at age 12 after 
endless fights with her mother. She started to use drugs and alcohol regularly, 
and was on and off the streets for years. She got married, but her husband was 
jailed on a parole violation and she did not want to stay in his grandmother's 
house anymore. So in December, 1993, she started sleeping at Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she whiled away the days drunk -- on beer or vodka -- or high on crack 
cocaine. She tried to ignore the way passersby averted their eyes. Parker, who 
is 6-foot-1, countered by dressing defiantly, in tight bike shorts and crop 
tops that clung to her bony body. She cursed up a storm, spitting out angry 
words. And she carried a hammer to protect her self-esteem more than anything 
else, ready to strike at the smallest of slights. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker scoffed when social workers came to the park, promising a quick program 
to get her off the streets. She had tried four other longer recovery programs 
and either quit or got kicked out. But everyone else was packing it up for the 
park relocation program, so she went too. 
</P>
<P>
 Case managers asked participants to set the rules; no one told them what to 
do. The group decided to set an 11 p.m. curfew -- but latecomers would not be 
punished -- and share cleaning chores. Everything else was up to the 
individual. Nobody nagged them to go to 12-step meetings, nobody reminded them 
that they should use the free phone to check on job openings. 
</P>
<P>
 In other programs, Parker's schedule was dictated minute by minute, from 5:45 
a.m. to 5 p.m. In one program, she could not have a radio, and her telephone 
privileges were restricted. In another, she could not talk to male 
participants. In still another, she was not allowed to leave the building for 
14 days. And in all the programs, any major rule violation -- such as falling 
off the wagon -- meant that she was shown the door. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, Parker rolled into the Pasadena shelter at 2 a.m. after a night of 
drinking beer and smoking marijuana. The next morning, she confessed to a case 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you feeling?" the case manager joked. There was no lecture, only: 
"Are you sure that's something you want to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 That marked a turning point for Parker, whose guard came down. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I want to (make progress), let me do it at my pace," Parker said. "Just 
don't steadily keep cramming me with (lectures), because the more you cram me 
with it . . . I'm going to look the other way, and I'm going to do what I want 
to do. . . . Let me gradually get it a little at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's husband, 32-year-old Samuel McWhorter, joined the Memorial Park 
program when he got out of jail, replacing one person who had dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, the couple had rented a room in a house with four roommates. 
Parker had completed a three-month substance abuse recovery program. She got a 
maintenance job with the city of Pasadena's parks department, adding income to 
her husband's job as a construction worker. She gained 50 pounds and sometimes 
wears dresses or skirts. Now her speech is measured and if she slips up and 
swears, she says: "Pardon my French." 
</P>
<P>
 The no-rules concept is rare but picking up speed in social services circles, 
said Dear of USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena program is the first that Dear knows of in the nation to use the 
maximum flexibility concept. The city of Los Angeles is planning to open a 
$4-million drop-in center in the industrial zone east of Downtown using the 
same policy; it could be running in about two years. According to the city's 
proposal, the center would have only minimum health and safety rules in a 
setting "that respects human dignity and does not feel oppressive or 
institutional." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters and recovery programs have to impose rules and structure in order to 
manage huge groups of people and keep them on track, said USC religion 
professor Donald Miller, author of "Homeless Families: The Struggle for 
Dignity." But too many rules can backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It strikes me that what Pasadena was able to do is put an enormous amount of 
resources in intervening in the lives of a small number of individuals," Miller 
said. "Having the freedom to do that allowed them to relate to people in much 
more adult ways, and in honoring the people that they were dealing with, they 
empowered them to be responsible adults." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Memorial Park program, case managers were crucial. Parker's managers 
helped her track down her birth certificate from Frankfurt, Germany, and clear 
a couple of warrants for drinking in public. In addition, a case manager used 
contacts to help get the city maintenance job and find her the room to rent. 
Another took her shopping for basics, such as an alarm clock. Even now, almost 
six months after the program ended, Parker calls one of her case managers 
almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each thing represented another breakthrough," Colletti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, besides Parker and her husband, three people found work -- two in 
the delivery department of a local newspaper, and one as a restaurant janitor. 
Six others receive disability income or are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Case managers are happy enough with their numbers to plan another project, 
tentatively set to begin in February. The new project will target chronically 
homeless women. Longtime homeless women, who are commonly assaulted on the 
street, tend to shy away from traditional social service programs, Colletti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker started off that way. Now, she lives in a drafty room, with old sheets 
covering the windows and an empty dresser drawer spilling over with bread, 
peanut butter and boxes of macaroni and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's privacy," she said. "It's mine."

FOR THE HOMELESS, SOME UNORTHODOX SUCCESS; GENESIS I: DESPITE A ROCKY FIRST 
YEAR, DOWNTOWN'S DOME VILLAGE HAS BECOME A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE MORE RIGID 
SHELTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before a throng of well-wishers and skeptics at the opening of his Genesis I 
dome village 12 months ago, homeless activist Ted Hayes relished the end of an 
eight-year struggle to build his experimental homeless community, and in the 
same breath cautioned that there would be rough roads ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 They were rougher than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year the cluster of 18 geodesic domes has operated in the shadow of 
Downtown Los Angeles, it has been riddled with crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Money and donated clothes were stolen. Some residents were ejected. 
Organizational problems arose, along with criticisms of Hayes' autocratic 
style. The most jarring incident came in January with the arrest of two 
residents on kidnaping and rape charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these stumblings, Genesis I has managed to stay afloat, receiving 
worldwide recognition as a transitional housing development for chronically 
homeless people who had been living in street encampments. It has become a 
viable alternative to the more rigid shelters and missions, a place where 
residents set their own rules and divvy up the chores, aided by a few resident 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea seems to have caught on. Other groups are making proposals to build 
two more domed communities in South-Central Los Angeles and a third in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple fact that the village of fiberglass, igloo-like spheres has lasted 
a year "is a testimony of Ted's leadership, of the sense of community it's 
created and most of all to the idea of the domes," said Mike Neely, executive 
director of the Homeless Outreach Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Genesis I is not out of the woods. It has been operating on a 
financial tightrope since the summer, always one month away from closure, and 
bailed out on several occasions by supporters in government and the 
entertainment industry. Hayes says he is not even sure he can scrounge up next 
month's $2,500 rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnover of residents has been high. About 50 homeless people have passed 
through Genesis since it started. None of the original 24 who moved into the 
village amid the hoopla last year remain. Several of the 19 current residents 
have lived in the village for only two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes, 43, began promoting the dome village concept in 1985 when he set up the 
first urban campground, dubbed Justiceville. A $250,000 grant from Arco enabled 
him to open the dome village. 
</P>
<P>
 The intention was to give the formerly homeless control of their lives. They 
would then graduate to run future dome villages in other parts of the city and 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The village created a sense of community for the homeless that is not 
available in shelters or missions, homeless advocates and residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you live here you're not made to feel like you're less of a person or 
that you don't have the common sense to take care of your own life," said one 
resident, asking to be identified only as Angela, who has lived in the village 
since September after coming from a West Hollywood shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the shelters they talk down to you," Angela said. "Here, Ted'll tell you 
that he's no better than anybody else. It's like we're all in this together." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the year, residents have cleaned up the surrounding 
neighborhood and received support and praise from local businesses, including 
Holiday Inn and United Parcel Service, both of which operate next door to the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 Discipline has been a problem. The resident-run Council of Justice, which was 
supposed to govern the village while Hayes served solely as an adviser, grew so 
weak it was temporarily dissolved. It took months to deal with some residents' 
drug problems by getting them enrolled in treatment programs offered by 
organizations that visited the village. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes -- who hopes to open another dome village within a few months that will 
include a health center and AIDS hospice -- does not apologize for the high 
turnover or the problems that arose in the early months. He opened the village 
as a laboratory, he said, and it has run that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The structure and intention of the Genesis I program was not the problem, 
Hayes said. The people were. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were dealing with was straight-up wild-bunch people," he said of the 
first group of 24 residents who moved into the village from a neighboring 
encampment and other projects Hayes had run in the past as part of 
Justiceville. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it has changed somewhat," Hayes said. "It still may take some pushing to 
keep these people on their toes, but they're on a better track." 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, the village has implemented an in-depth application process 
that includes a two-week trial, a review of candidates by the Council of 
Justice and a requirement that people volunteer at the village before moving 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes is also pushing to get more non-homeless volunteers to live in the 
village as part of what he calls the community's Domestic Peace Force, which 
now has three members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize that homeless are not going to empower themselves without the 
assistance of the partnership of non-homeless people," he said. "That's why we 
created the Domestic Peace Force. Unless you amalgamate some kind of equal 
proportion of non-homeless people with homeless people, things will not get 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The village stayed afloat with $22,500 in emergency government funding a few 
months ago from the offices of City Councilwoman Rita Walters and County 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, in whose districts the village is located. 
An anonymous $10,000 donation has kept it afloat this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents chip in, paying $50 a month with food stamps or money from their 
welfare checks. Most of that money goes to buying food for the village or 
incidentals. Despite the financial difficulties, Hayes is looking to create a 
dome village project that will become financially self-sustaining in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Eisan, a resident of the village who has been involved with Hayes' 
Justiceville since the 1980s, said the fact that residents are chipping in 
financially and taking on more responsibility points to better possibilities 
for the village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes patience," said Eisan, 56. "People expected everything to work as 
smoothly as it was to build these domes, but we're not dealing with materials 
here, we're dealing with people. And all people have their own problems," he 
said.

 Ernie Gutierrez crafts ornate custom billiard cues with gold, jewels and rare 
and exotic woods. Several of them -- valued at as much as $10,000 apiece -- 
have slid between the fingers of pool greats Willie Mosconi and Minnesota Fats. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the pros, pool-playing celebrities -- including Frank Sinatra, Dean 
Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. in their "Rat Pack" prime -- trod a path to his 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his reputation as an unparalleled artist, Gutierrez is haunted by 
the frustration of competing with a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghost's name is George Balabushka. He died nearly 20 years ago, yet 
remains to billiard cues what Antonio Stradivari is to violins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balabushka is still, probably, more famous than me because he's dead and a 
lot of his cues have become collectibles," said Gutierrez, 53, of North 
Hollywood, who made his first cue in 1961. "But I've been more innovative. He 
was a very good machinist and he did some good work. But as far as art is 
concerned . . . I've got the six ball over him." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken like the pool hustler Gutierrez once aspired to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez may have to settle for the title of world's greatest living cue 
maker. That assessment was all but confirmed in July, when he became the first 
living member inducted into the American Cuemakers Assn. Hall of Fame in 
Houston. Balabushka, of course, was the first to be enshrined. 
</P>
<P>
 But whose cues reign supreme? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to make comparisons between the two," said Victor Stein, 
co-author of the recently released "The Billiard Encyclopedia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Balabushka's work was never very elaborate or fancy. He made a different kind 
of cue that played very well and many pro players used," Stein said. "Ernie 
Gutierrez is a true artist and a craftsman. Today, now that we have collectible 
cues, the way a cue looks is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The craft of cue making can be traced to 17th-Century Europe, where the game 
of billiards was a passion among nobility. Marie Antoinette is said to have 
cherished her solid-ivory queue de billard. Since 1850, cue making has 
flourished in the United States, where most of the world's cues are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Only within the last several years, however, has cue collecting joined the 
sports memorabilia craze. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Balabushka's estimated 1,200 cues have been sold and resold for 
thousands of dollars. Within the last year, a Balabushka original reportedly 
changed hands for $45,000 in New York. Lofty prices also have been paid for 
custom cues made by the late Harvey Martin, Herman Rambow and Gus Szamboti. 
</P>
<P>
 Cues from Gutierrez's assemblage of about 2,500 are among the most expensive 
and sought-after items, partly because of the construction materials, partly 
because of his computer-assisted lathes. In April, an ivory and silver 
Gutierrez cue sold in Japan for $32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez has refused offers of up to $65,000 for the 1966 cue he considers 
his masterpiece. Made with ivory, ebony, silver and maple, it features two 
interchangeable shafts, as well as a matching case with the same engraving 
found on the cue's silver inlays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very attached to it because I know how hard I worked on it and I know how 
primitive my shop was when I built it," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez also has worked as an automotive and aerospace designer over the 
years. But his first love has remained making cues. He was trained in 
woodworking as a youth in his native Colombia before moving to the San Fernando 
Valley in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 He also liked to play pool, especially for money. Shortly after his arrival in 
Southern California, Gutierrez began hanging out in pool halls, playing for 
pocket change with cues he had begun to make for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, that movie came out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1961 when "The Hustler," starring Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason, was 
released. It caused interest in pocket billiards to skyrocket. Gutierrez 
figured to cash in by selling his cues. Six days after the birth of his 
daughter, Gina, Gutierrez launched his cue making company: Ginacue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginacues, made at a rate of about 100 a year, have become among the most 
widely copied cues in the billiard industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every cue maker in the world has at least one thing in their designs 
that originated with Ernie," said James Buss, president of the American 
Cuemakers' Assn. and a cue maker. "There's a joke in the pool industry that 
Ernie invented ivory and he invented silver." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Balabushka, by a general consensus of pool buffs, remains the master -- 
although much of his legend can be chalked up to mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 Balabushka, a Russian immigrant who worked in New York City his entire career, 
owned only one lathe, which he used to produce every cue he made. When a 
visitor entered his shop, Balabushka would reportedly stop working, fearing 
that his techniques would be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Balabushka's woodworking skills are said to have been unparalleled. In fact, 
few friends were aware that he had made his own wooden finger after losing his 
middle finger in a band saw accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, a mecca of the pocket billiard world in the 1950s and '60s, 
Balabushka frequently rubbed shoulders with the game's top professionals, and 
many used his cues. His immortality was heightened with the 1986 film, "The 
Color of Money," in which a young pool hustler portrayed by Tom Cruise proudly 
unveils his cherished Balabushka cue before a poolroom full of awed observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, working his entire career on the West Coast, made his mark by 
taking his flashiest cues to major tournaments and unveiling them before top 
pros. Most players were impressed, but not all preferred Ginacues. Mosconi, 
considered the game's greatest player, tried his hand with a Ginacue, only to 
return to the cherished Rambow cue said to have been his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 But as photographs of Gutierrez's ivory-laden works began appearing in 
publications throughout the world, he became sought after by players with a 
taste for classy cues. That included Minnesota Fats, who has owned three 
Ginacues. Many of Hollywood's pocket billiard crowd flocked to Gutierrez after 
seeing the 18-karat-gold cue Gutierrez made for Martin in 1968. Profiled in 
Sports Illustrated along with its maker, the cue featured four diamonds, an 
emerald, a ruby and a sapphire. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overnight, Gutierrez was receiving more orders from movie stars than he 
could shake a stick at. His customers have included Peter Lawford, Peter Falk 
and Jerry Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all started to come by word of mouth," Gutierrez said. "It's 
flattering." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, are comparisons to Balabushka. The two men never met, although they 
spoke by telephone on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret that I never met him," Gutierrez said. "He didn't know my equipment, 
I didn't know his. He didn't know my techniques, I didn't know his. He did his 
work his way, I did mine my way. There was mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, who spent six years researching his book, said comparing Balabushka to 
Gutierrez is like comparing Babe Ruth to a great modern-day ballplayer. "Their 
styles are so different," Stein said. "They're both artists. When you do 
something like (make cues) for so long, you almost have to be judged after you 
die."

TREMORS OF LOVE; COUPLE, BROUGHT TOGETHER BY QUAKE, PLANS WEDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 It was an unusual way to find a husband, Patricia Silden concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 She was catching the last, precious hours of sleep before going to her job as 
a law firm's office manager in January when her Northridge Meadows apartment 
started bucking like a rodeo bull. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shaking subsided, Silden stumbled to her third-floor balcony. She 
heard muffled screams and men's urgent voices nearby in the darkness. "Is 
anyone out there?" she called out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, who's there?" came a steady reply. It was Mike Kubeisy, the free-lance 
photographer from Apartment 336 who had said hello to her in the parking garage 
a few days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Patricia. Patricia Silden. I'm OK, but I can't get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Kubeisy promised to come back after helping a few injured tenants and making 
sure that the building's gas line was shut off. Twenty minutes later he 
returned with an emergency ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never crossed my mind that he might forget me," Silden, 38, recalls. "He 
was someone I felt I could trust right away." 
</P>
<P>
 In the emotional months since the tragedy at the Northridge Meadows complex, 
Silden has learned that her first impulse about Kubeisy was right. Theirs is a 
tale of love among the ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As daylight on Jan. 17 revealed the destruction wrought by the earthquake, 
Silden was among the horrified tenants watching rescue crews pull the maimed 
and the 16 dead from the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under control," Silden said. "I didn't cry. But I was shaking inside." 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour later, Kubeisy, 35, emerged from the building, where he had been 
leading older residents to safety. Silden introduced her sister, who had come 
to the building, to "the man who had rescued me." Then Silden did something 
untypical of her. She asked Kubeisy for his phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, Silden called Kubeisy at his mother's home to thank him. The 
two had a short, pleasant conversation both describe as "unremarkable," and 
their friendship might have ended there. But chance intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 They both showed up at a meeting for earthquake victims organized by a local 
Methodist church, and afterward walked to a mini-mart together to buy a soda. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days after the earthquake, they met again while searching for valuables 
amid the rubble of their apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not my usual self," Silden says. "I had just run into a family whose 
father had died. They were looking for his things, and it made me wonder why I 
was even there." 
</P>
<P>
 When Kubeisy saw Silden standing forlornly in her apartment, his protective 
instinct took hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look like you need a hug," he said, walking in. She looked him over, then 
accepted. "You know," he added softly, "if you ever just want to talk, call 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, he asked for her phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few weeks, they reminisced about their neighbors who had died 
and shared their nightmares from the morning the top two floors of their 
apartment building flattened the one below. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both started to open up and talk about the pain," Kubeisy said. "I had 
felt through this whole thing that I had to play the strong man. But with her I 
could let my vulnerability show." 
</P>
<P>
 They discussed her divorce from the owner of a computer software business, and 
his breakup with his girlfriend in 1993. Silden took her in-line skating with 
his friends. "Every one of them told me, 'Man, she's perfect for you,' " he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kubeisy proposed at Disneyland on July 25, Silden's first reaction was to 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Is this for real?' " she recalled. "But then I said, 'Yes! Yes!' " 
The wedding is set for Dec. 10 in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on plastic chairs in the unfurnished Simi Valley home they recently 
bought together, Kubeisy and Silden recall the moment they crossed the 
threshold of romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in February. . . ." Kubeisy said vaguely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feb. 4," Silden interjected. "You took me to an ice skating rink. After about 
100 laps, you put out your hand toward me. I thought, 'Is he trying to keep his 
balance, or is he trying to hold my hand?' So I just took it, and after that we 
didn't let go."

SALVATION ARMY BELLS WON'T RING OUT AT SOME SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As they dusted off their bells and kettles, local Salvation Army officials 
faced tough challenges for their annual holiday fund-raising appeal starting 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard/Port Hueneme corps has been deluged with applicants, some of whom 
may be turning to the charity because the passage of Proposition 187 has 
steered them away from public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 And officials throughout the county reported trouble securing permission to 
ring bells at their trademark red kettles or to set up fund-raising stands 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 East county workers suffered the biggest shock when the Janss Marketplace in 
Thousand Oaks, which had allowed a red kettle display for 20 years, decided not 
to this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Ramsdale, regional director for the Salvation Army's office in Simi 
Valley, said the kettle was probably the biggest in Ventura County, bringing in 
$10,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketplace officials declined to comment on their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a prime fund-raising spot in Oxnard, the Price Club, has curtailed the 
hours and banned use of the bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Salvation Army spokesman Randy Paton said the organization relies on the 
traditional holiday appeal -- including about 47 kettles countywide this year 
-- for a substantial portion of its annual operating budgets, which may face 
greater demands with the passage of Proposition 187. Altogether, the three 
offices serving Ventura County hope to raise nearly $200,000 to help 1,750 
needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 Paton said more malls are choosing not to allow any charity solicitors. "Even 
though we've been doing it over 100 years, though we do it right and do it 
best, we also pay the price for those who don't do it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Fred Morasky of the Oxnard/Port Hueneme corps estimates that full 
implementation of Proposition 187 could increase his caseload 30% as illegal 
immigrants seek private help. 
</P>
<P>
 Morasky said some Latino applicants for Christmas assistance have been telling 
the bilingual workers at his office that they're anxious to get help "before 
anything hits." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're afraid," Morasky said. "The army asks very few questions. We try to 
protect the identity of the individuals who come to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Paton said the Salvation Army will not discriminate against people who are 
afraid to go through official channels because army personnel don't want to 
risk letting a child go hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do you say no?" he said. "We don't like to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard/Port Hueneme corps hopes to raise about $60,000 this year -- up 
from $47,000 last year -- part of which will be used to give Christmas 
assistance to at least 500 families. He said the corps has already received 800 
applications for help and the phone calls keep mounting. 
</P>
<P>
 The army will assist the neediest families and put the others on a waiting 
list. Officials will also give gift packs to about 1,200 nursing home 
residents. The packs contain items such as handkerchiefs, toothbrushes and 
combs. 
</P>
<P>
 Morasky said cash-collecting efforts have been hampered slightly by a new 
national Price Club policy prohibiting bell-ringing and restricting hours of 
fund-raising. Local store officials have attempted to soften the impact by 
allowing the Oxnard corps to set up two kettles instead of one starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Morasky said his assistants would get around the bell-ringing ban by holding 
up signs that read "Ding Dong." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsdale said the Janss Marketplace decision not to allow a kettle is a big 
blow to her efforts to raise about $70,000 this season. The Salvation Army's 
Ventura County Service Extension office, which serves the east county and many 
other communities, raised about $64,000 last season, some of which went to 
assist families devastated by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is really a deficit in our budget for Christmas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsdale said she can't assess Proposition 187's impact on her office because 
officials will not start taking holiday aid applications until early December. 
She said there are many underprivileged migrant workers in Piru and Fillmore 
who may be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 As it now stands, officials would like to help about 550 families in the Simi 
Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks area this holiday season. They are also 
planning to deliver gift baskets to 500 patients at Camarillo State Hospital 
and to 3,400 convalescent home patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura corps -- which also serves Saticoy, Oak View and Casitas Springs 
-- hopes to raise $70,000 this year, part of which will help deliver holiday 
cheer to 700 families, 150 more than last year, Lt. Rene Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchamp said the corps also needs about 2,000 toys and a major store where 
she can set up an Angel Tree. Under that program, a Christmas tree is festooned 
with paper angels listing the first names, ages and sexes of needy children. 
Shoppers pick an angel and donate one or more gift items. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Salvation Army offices said they need volunteers and in some cases 
will be willing to pay for help. Beauchamp said she has had little luck getting 
bell ringers even though she has offered to pay minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 To help in the Oxnard/Port Hueneme area, call 483-9235. In the Ventura area, 
call 648-5031. For other areas, call 527-1070.

AFTER-SCHOOL MUSIC CLASS STRIKES CHORD WITH STUDENTS; EDUCATION: CHILDREN AT 
CESAR CHAVEZ SCHOOL IN OXNARD LEARN A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS THANKS TO THE 
EFFORTS OF A FIFTH-GRADE TEACHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Alvaro Romero was sure he couldn't learn to play the jarana -- 
a small string instrument similar to a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 But his teacher, Vicente Barron, believed otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, you can," Barron said. "You just have to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron then moved Alvaro's small fingers across the instrument's frets, 
reminding the boy to press his fingers tightly against the strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Alvaro produced an A major chord. His tightly pressed lips 
broke into a smile as he repeated the sound fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvaro, a third-grade student at Oxnard's Cesar Chavez School, is one of 20 
children who are learning to play the guitar, jarana , tambourine, mandolin or 
maraca in an after-school class taught by Barron. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, a music aficionado and a fifth-grade teacher at Cesar Chavez, said he 
decided to volunteer his time to teach the children because of their enthusiasm 
and willingness to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to learn so badly that I find it unfair not to give them that 
opportunity," said Barron, 47. "Their eyes light up when they learn something, 
and that thrills me." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron said he hopes that by February the group will be able to perform at 
school events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to feel proud of themselves. To feel that they are doing 
something good," Barron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron, who has played guitar since he was 12, said the children have a 
natural curiosity about music, but the district can no longer afford to provide 
music classes. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Oxnard native invited students from third to fifth grade to audition 
for the prospective band. Then he asked the school to provide the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Anthony Zubia, also a musician who occasionally pops into the class 
to help Barron, decided to use $1,000 from school funds to buy the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not pass up the opportunity," Zubia said. "Mr. Barron is not only 
committed to the children, but he also has the knowledge to share with them. He 
has enriched our school with the music program." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Tuesday from 2:15 to 3:30 p.m., whether school is in session or not, 
Barron and the students gather at his classroom. They shove chairs and desks to 
the sides, pull the instruments from their boxes and practice. 
</P>
<P>
 As they create musical notes, many of the youngsters dream of a brighter 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a star when I grow up," fifth-grader Jeniffer Arana said. "I 
sing at the church choir, and one day I'll be a famous singer." 
</P>
<P>
 But others just want to play for the fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like to learn," 10-year-old Liliana Rivera said. "When I am home and 
have nothing to do, I get the guitar and just play it." 
</P>
<P>
 The children are not the only ones pleased with the band. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's practice, the father of one of the students stopped by. Jesus 
Maldonado was so delighted with the program that he saved $60 from his farm 
labor to buy his 10-year-old son a used guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my son to become a gang member. There are so many bad forces out 
there influencing children that a program like this can be a life saver," said 
Maldonado, who had brought the guitar for Barron to tune. "I'm really 
thankful."

HOUSING PLAN FOR FARMLAND PROTESTED IN OXNARD; DEVELOPMENT: SITE IS WANTED FOR 
A PROJECT THAT WOULD INCLUDE LOW-COST RESIDENCES. BUT NEIGHBORS SAY AREA IS FOR 
GREENBELT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Residents and landowners in east Oxnard are banding together to protest a 
proposal to build 716 houses on farmland that the city has exempted from 
development until the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordable Homebuilders Inc. of Ventura is pushing for its Channel Islands 
Estates project, arguing that it would provide what Oxnard needs most: 159 
low-cost residences for financially struggling families. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council in September allowed the developer to move forward 
with a preliminary plan to build the housing, which would be built near Channel 
Islands Boulevard and Rice Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 132-acre site is outside the city's boundaries in an area that Oxnard, 
Camarillo and Ventura set aside as a greenbelt, and critics of the plan say it 
typifies Oxnard's hypocrisy regarding the preservation of open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city vows to keep the land in a greenbelt," said Fred Rosenmund, whose 
family owns the 150-acre Rosenmund Ranch adjacent to the proposed site. "But as 
soon as one developer comes up, offering to build some affordable housing, they 
cave in and break their own promise." 
</P>
<P>
 For the housing project to break ground, the land would have to be placed 
within Oxnard's jurisdiction by the Local Agency Formation Commission, a state 
agency that handles matters of city boundaries and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo and the county would also have to approve the deal. And an 
environmental report must be completed before the Oxnard City Council could 
give the project final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire process is expected to take at least two years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, leaders of Oxnard's Lemonwood and Diamond Bar neighborhoods are 
considering mounting a letter-writing campaign and rallying their neighbors to 
oppose the project. They said they want to fight the development because it 
would add to traffic congestion and bring unwanted low-income neighbors to the 
area in addition to cutting into the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been striving to reduce our crime, and we feel that this will 
increase crime in the area," said Chris Schweinhard, chairman of the Lemonwood 
neighborhood group, which represents about 10,000 residents. "All of the 
neighborhoods are getting older, and we want to maintain what we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood leaders will consider the petition drive during separate meetings 
in coming weeks. They are also trying to lobby officials from Ventura County, 
Camarillo and Oxnard to oppose the housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we moved out here there were lemon trees and strawberry fields," 
Schweinhard said. "It was almost a little paradise. But the city since that 
point in time has put in all these roads and developments, and the tract has 
begun to deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Foy, chairman of the Diamond Bar neighborhood group, said he and many of 
the neighborhood's 500 homeowners moved to the area because they thought they 
would be at the boundary of Oxnard's development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was supposed to be the edge of the greenbelt," said Ronald D. Brown, a 
30-year resident of Diamond Bar. "But they've made it into an asphalt jungle. 
It's discouraging to see what's happening to this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Foy said there are plenty of places within the city to place affordable 
housing projects, and that coastal neighborhoods should bear the burden along 
with the inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we're opposed to affordable housing," Foy said. "We just feel 
that out in this end of town, we have our share." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Jacobs, president of Affordable Homebuilders Inc., said she has talked 
with representatives of the Diamond Bar neighborhood and plans to meet with 
them once they have a detailed development plan together, which should be in a 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always try and work with the residents to try and get their input on a 
project," Jacobs said. "It's just a little early at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 For Brown, a retired Navy worker, and his wife Lola, the project is the most 
recent example of a losing battle to preserve local agricultural land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that you came over the Conejo Grade and you could see all this 
fertile farmland," Brown said. "Now it's all a blaze of lights and asphalt, and 
you can never go back to what it was."

CONEJO PANEL TO CONSIDER EXPANDING CHILD CARE; SCHOOLS: ENROLLMENT BOOM PUTS 
SOME THOUSAND OAKS FAMILIES ON WAITING LIST. DISTRICT WILL VOTE ON FUNDS FOR 
MORE HOURLY PROVIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years after scaling back its child-care programs, the Conejo Valley school 
district is considering expanding services to meet the needs of more Thousand 
Oaks families. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment in child-care programs has boomed this year, forcing some parents 
onto waiting lists and sending school officials scrambling to fill positions 
for child-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the board of the Conejo Valley Unified School District will 
decide Monday whether to spend about $17,400 to increase those hourly positions 
at six elementary schools for the remainder of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Enrollment) has been increasing steadily, but this year is the highest it 
has ever been," said Barbara Ryan, director of elementary education. 
</P>
<P>
 The boom reflected a districtwide enrollment increase this year, mostly due to 
new home sales, Ryan said. Enrollment in child-care programs has peaked at 613 
students at 11 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, enrollment increased significantly in morning child-care 
sessions, which were offered free this year to parents whose child was enrolled 
in an after-school session. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents welcomed the extended service, which allowed working mothers and 
fathers to drop their children off at school as early as 7 a.m. But finding 
child-care workers to work for just one hour in the morning was difficult and 
the turnover rate for the part-time position has been high. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the school year, 11 of the 12 morning positions were vacant, a 
district report says. Six of those positions are still open. The other six have 
been filled temporarily by after-school staff doing double duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took our (employees) who worked later in the day and made them substitutes 
in the morning," Ryan said. "We had to, we had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for board consideration Monday would extend and restructure the 
hourly schedule to provide more stable staffing, school officials said. The 
$17,400 would come out of the child-care program's $850,000 operating budget, 
Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the school board cut child-care hours and supervisor positions to 
balance the program's budget. Since then, however, the number of families 
seeking services has grown and profits have increased -- parents pay anywhere 
from $60 to $300 for child-care services, depending on the services provided. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ladera School, which has the largest child-care program in the district, 
the demand for services was so high this year that the school opened a second 
building to house 81 children. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has two kindergarten child-care sessions, and Principal Kristine 
White said the school could easily fill a third session from its waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a large number of parents who both work so our child-care (program) 
is always full," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent feedback on the programs has largely been positive, school officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear this is the Club Med of child care," Ryan said. "Parents feel very 
confident -- their children never have to go to another site and we hire 
quality personnel." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks parent Stuart Medal has two children enrolled in Ladera's 
program. As a single working father, he relies on the school to provide a safe 
environment for his 11-year-old son, Andrew, and his 9-year-old daughter, 
Aubrey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's on campus, it's familiar," he said. "And they have friends here." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Elaine Kingsley said the school-run program is reasonably priced and an 
asset, given her job schedule. She starts work at a medical lab at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works really well and the price is good," she said. Kingsley, who is 
single, drops off her 5-year-old son, Jonathan, about 7 a.m. every weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kingsley: "I don't know how else I would do it."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; 2 GIRLS 
DIE IN SEPARATE FIRES AT DUPLEX, HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two young girls were killed in separate fires that gutted residences in 
South-Central Los Angeles, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chelsea Lewis, 6, died and her mother, Gail, was critically injured when a 
fire engulfed their unit in a duplex in the 4200 block of West 25th Street in 
the West Adams neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The young girl was pronounced dead at Brotman Medical Center about 30 minutes 
after the fire, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, 35, was in critical condition at Sherman Oaks Hospital and 
Health Center, where she was being treated for first- and second-degree burns 
and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said the fire began Friday afternoon when 
combustibles were placed too close to a floor furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, authorities said firefighters who put out a Thanksgiving night 
fire in the 600 block of West 49th Place found the body of 13-year-old 
Shannelle Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 When firefighters arrived at the residence, they found it engulfed in flames, 
according to fire spokesman Brian Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people -- three adults and six children -- were in the house when the 
blaze broke out, he said. Eight were able to escape, Humphrey said.

 A man was killed when he ran into the path of a southbound Blue Line train 
Friday night at Santa Fe Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard in southeast Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, believed to be about 30, "ignored warnings and just ran across the 
tracks and was hit by the train" said Steve Chesser, a Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic on the route was closed after the 6:48 p.m. accident, Chesser said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 3 KILLED, 
SEVERAL INJURED IN 2 HOLIDAY ACCIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men were killed and several people were injured in two accidents 
apparently involving drunk drivers Thursday night and early Friday. Two drivers 
were in custody, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:45 a.m. Friday, a collision between two cars on Sunset Boulevard at 
McCadden Place in Hollywood left one driver dead, the other driver in custody 
suspected of drunk driving and a passenger in the suspect's car critically 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Marcial, 23, was booked for "vehicular manslaughter while driving under 
the influence of alcohol," said Los Angeles Police Officer P. Bartlett of the 
West Traffic Division. Marcial suffered a minor injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The other driver, a 22-year-old man, died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center three 
hours after the crash, Bartlett said. His name was being withheld pending 
notification of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger in Marcial's car was in critical condition at the same hospital, 
being treated for "massive head and body trauma," Bartlett said. The name of 
the man was not released. Marcial and the fatally injured driver apparently had 
been involved in a traffic dispute, Bartlett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 11 p.m. Thursday, two cars crashed head-on on Sunset Boulevard 
near Edgecliffe Drive in Silver Lake when one car crossed the center line. 
</P>
<P>
 A car carrying three people, heading east on Sunset with its headlights off, 
crossed onto the wrong side of the street and hit a westbound car occupied by 
two people, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A passenger in the second car, Jack Zinder, 33, of Los Angeles died at the 
scene. An unidentified 24-year-old man riding in the first car died at a 
hospital, police said. Zinder was a music critic for the L.A. Weekly newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The others, including both drivers, were critically injured. The driver of the 
first car faces a possible drunk driving charge, police said. His name has not 
been released.

 Turkey and undressing: Three L.A.-area striptease joints, the Oddball Cabaret, 
Bare Elegance and the Jet Strip, peeled off more than $3,000 of their receipts 
to feed the homeless on Thanksgiving Day. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't their first such donation to local charities, either. Van Nuys' 
Oddball Cabaret even received a plaque from Peter Ueberroth in 1992 after 
raising funds for victims of the L.A. riots. The Oddball, you may recall, held 
a dance contest that year, with the winner being crowned Miss Rebuild L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 No such contest was held this time. Who would compete for the title of Miss 
Turkey?

 Culture and Cucamonga: The arts seem to be bursting out all over in Rancho 
Cucamonga. "Simpatico," the new play by Pulitzer Prize-winner Sam Shepard, is 
partly set in Cucamonga, the boyhood home of two of the drama's principal 
characters. And the fact that they're involved in a racetrack scandal takes 
none of the luster off the city's involvement, as far as we're concerned. (In 
real life, Shepard attended Mt. San Antonio College, a few miles to the west in 
Walnut.) 
</P>
<P>
 The city already boasts a sculptural landmark -- a statue of comedian Jack 
Benny in recognition of the joking references that Benny used to make about the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's "Di and I," the recent novel by Peter Lefcourt, which 
recounts how Princess Diana runs off to Cucamonga with a middle-aged Hollywood 
writer to open a McDonald's franchise. At least, we think it's a novel.

 Tribute to the Unknown Pedestrian? Speaking of art, David Ross of Long Beach 
points out that the designer of the pedestrian zone at Long Beach's Memorial 
Medical Center "could have selected an icon that didn't approximate a 
policeman's chalk outline of a dead body." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross adds: "The inadvertent impression is further enhanced by random oil drops 
that could be mistaken for bloodstains."

 Freeway flicks: We're ashamed that our recent list of freeway movies omitted 
"Falling Down," in which Michael Douglas acts out the fantasy of every commuter 
who's ever been trapped in a sea of red brake lights. He ditches his car on the 
Hollywood Freeway near the four-level and decides to hoof it the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 We also left out the slightly less immortal "Smash Up on Interstate 5," in 
which Robert Conrad and Buddy Ebsen have some serious driving problems near San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 But we can be excused for failing to include Steve Martin's "L.A. Story," even 
though the star is a freeway message board that dispenses advice to the 
lovelorn. In truth, the freeway scenes were shot on Burbank Boulevard between 
Sepulveda and Balboa boulevards.

 And the electronic message board was a mock-up. You can tell because it didn't

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MORE RAINFALL EXPECTED FROM WINTER STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The tail of a winter storm moving south from the Gulf of Alaska is expected to 
continue its brush across Ventura County today, bringing cold weather and light 
rain, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first touches of rain and thick cloud cover hit the county Friday, 
prompting Thanksgiving vacationers to bypass the beach for the warmth of 
crowded malls. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Ventura auto parts store, a salesperson reported long lines for 
windshield wipers as customers prepared for the prospect of a wet winter. State 
lifeguards reported empty beaches despite the holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered showers dropped less than a quarter of an inch of rain on the county 
Friday, and forecasters reported a 40% chance of similar precipitation today. 
</P>
<P>
 "This storm is covering a huge area all the way down from Oregon, but in our 
area we can expect to see mostly cold air, some light showers and wind," said 
Bill Hoffer, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, snow is expected in the county's mountain areas as low as 3,500 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 For those planning a drive into the mountains, National Park officials 
recommended travelers carry chains because of icy road conditions, and they 
suggested warm clothing because of the chilly overnight lows. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures tonight are expected to drop into the 30s, Hoffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the county's farmers, the cold front could require protection from 
potentially freezing temperatures in higher elevations, according to a report 
by Terry Schaeffer, a National Weather Service agricultural specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm system is expected to dissipate by late tonight. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; CABIN FIRE AT CLUB DESTROYS 1930S-ERA 
ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Fire gutted part of a small cabin at a private duck-hunting club near Point 
Mugu Friday morning, destroying several rooms full of wooden furniture and 
pottery from the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The faded green cabin, built by character actor Eugene Pallette, is owned by 
Los Angeles resident Brad Freeman who last used it about a year ago, said Ed 
Freil, general manager of the Pt. Magu Game Preserve at 3912 Hueneme Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a shame. . . . It was full of Fiestaware in the kitchen. All the old, 
colored dishes," said Freil's wife, Janice, as she watched firefighters haul 
out a charred couch still burning at one end. 
</P>
<P>
 The 350-acre reserve is a private club with 34 members that was founded in 
1929. Freeman's cabin is one of eight on the property, in addition to several 
trailers and a main clubhouse where hundreds of decoys are stored. During 
duck-hunting season, the decoys are placed on several small ponds to lure 
waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Freil reported the fire about 10:45 a.m. after spotting flames and smoke as he 
drove toward the club on Hueneme Road. When he reached the cabin at the end of 
a mile-long dirt road, flames had engulfed a bedroom on the left side. The fire 
quickly spread to the kitchen and an open-beamed living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight minutes later, when firefighters arrived, the cabin's windows had blown 
out from the heat and shotgun shells in a box were popping one by one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was black from the smoke. You couldn't see much of anything," said Robin 
Harville, a captain with the Point Mugu Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It took firefighters from five engine companies about 30 minutes to extinguish 
the blaze, although embers continued to flare into spot fires for another hour. 
One-third of the structure was destroyed, with smoke blackening the rest of the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
 A permanent caretaker, Todd Brohammer, and his wife, Sheila, live at the club 
but were not home when the fire started because they had spent the Thanksgiving 
holiday with relatives in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the blaze had not been determined on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Investigator Dave Chovanec said burn patterns showed that the 
flames started near the floor of the bedroom, then leaped to the ceiling and 
spread to other rooms. The cabin's electricity was on at the time. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY PROPERTY TAX DEADLINE EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadline for filing the first installment of Ventura County property taxes 
has been extended to Dec. 12 because the original deadline falls on a Saturday, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Tax Collector Harold Pittman said the new deadline means that the first 
installment of property taxes must be postmarked Dec. 12 or submitted in person 
by 6 p.m. that day to avoid penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax collector recommends paying by check through the mail, so taxpayers 
can avoid waiting in line at county offices. Taxpayers can use either Visa or 
Discover credit cards to pay the county, but the county is required to collect 
for fees charged by credit card companies. Visa charges a $45 fee for every 
$1,000 charged, and Discover charges a fee of $1 to $5 depending on the size of 
the bill, Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The address for sending payments by mail is Tax Collector, 800 S. Victoria 
Ave., Ventura, Calif. 93009. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; COUNCIL BACKS CURBS ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fillmore City Council members have tentatively adopted a strict law 
prohibiting adult-oriented businesses from locating in most parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the ordinance approved this week, adult businesses such as 
movie theaters and topless clubs could locate only in areas zoned for heavy 
industry, Mayor Linda Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any real good guidelines if one of these businesses wants to 
come in," Brewster said. "We're trying to develop as stringent a policy as we 
can that's legal and still not be challenged in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the land zoned for industrial use is located in north Fillmore, 
Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
 City attorneys want to make small changes to the law before it comes before 
the City Council again on Dec. 13, the mayor said. But the proposed ordinance 
received unanimous council support. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult-oriented businesses "draw a bad element," Brewster said. "There are 
secondary effects. Lots of times there's vandalism, drunkenness, prostitution. 
It'll lower your property values if you live near one." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster said city staff modeled the law after a similar ordinance adopted by 
Oxnard last year. She said she expects the council to approve the amended law 
next month. If that happens, the ordinance would go into effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there are no adult-oriented businesses in Fillmore. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CITY EMPLOYEES TO GET 2.5% PAY RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 180 Santa Paula city employees will receive a 2.5% pay raise under an 
agreement approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of negotiations, the City Council approved the salary package for 
most of its full- and part-time employees retroactive to Oct. 21, City 
Administrator Arnold Dowdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly a good deal for the city and for the employees," Dowdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably across the board, Santa Paula employees are paid less than the 
employees of every other city in the county," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement covers virtually every city employee except police and fire 
personnel, who are in the midst of separate negotiations, Dowdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement reached this week runs through September, at which time new 
negotiations will begin, the city administrator said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the city faced a budget deficit of about $400,000. But 
officials were able to save about $470,000 by following the recommendations of 
a citizens' committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the $90,000 annual cost of the raises approved this week will come 
from those savings, Dowdy said. JEFF McDONALD

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY PAID 
$45,000 TOO MUCH FOR ELECTIONS, AUDIT FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles paid at least $45,000 too much to conduct its 
municipal elections in April and June, 1993, according to an audit by the city 
controller's office. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle blamed most of the waste on the fact that 320 city 
employees -- about one-quarter of election workers -- were paid at 1 1/2 times 
their city salaries rather than the lower hourly rate paid to others.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PANORAMA CITY; MAN 
SLAIN BY ROBBER IN APARTMENT PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old Panorama City man died after he was shot twice by a robber in 
the parking lot of his apartment building, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Torres had driven his family into the lot of their apartment building 
about 8:30 p.m. Monday. As Torres was leaving his car, the robber grabbed him 
by the neck, Sgt. Joseph Brazas said. Torres was carrying his baby and managed 
to hand the child to his wife, who fled inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber took Torres' wallet, which contained no money, Brazas said. Torres 
died Tuesday at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman was still being sought Friday night.

BURBANK AIRPORT HAVING TROUBLE GETTING EXPANSION OFF THE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every morning, the sound of airplanes departing Burbank Airport jolts 
homeowner Lori Dinkin out of bed as well as any alarm clock. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins at 7 a.m. and continues intermittently throughout the day, ending as 
late as 2 a.m. and intruding on her life like a boisterous next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to sleep and God help you if you're sick in bed," said the 
75-year-old president of Burbank's Valley Village Homeowners Assn. "It's bad 
enough when you're well. . . . Your peace has been totally disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Worried about the potential for more noise as the airport gains popularity, 
Dinkin's association has joined three other San Fernando Valley homeowners 
groups and the city of Los Angeles in a lawsuit seeking to halt construction of 
an airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility's operating board, the Airport Authority, wants to quadruple the 
size of the 163,000-square-foot terminal to accommodate the 10 million 
passengers expected to fly in and out of Burbank by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration has also pressured airport officials to 
replace the 64-year-old building because it is too close to the east-west 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new terminal will lead to noise pollution problems that were not 
acknowledged in an environmental impact report completed by airport officials 
last year, neighbors and Los Angeles officials have alleged in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien ordered the Airport 
Authority in January to redo the report, which is required under state law for 
building projects with the potential to significantly affect the environment. 
He will hear oral arguments from both sides Monday. If he finds the new report 
sufficient, the authority could begin design work immediately on the new 
terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter who wins, the losing side can appeal, a move that could delay 
progress on the multimillion-dollar project for up to two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This legal stuff is getting ridiculous," said Brian Bowman, president of the 
Airport Authority, which is made up of nine commissioners representing Burbank, 
Glendale and Pasadena. "What the city of L.A. is doing is primarily trying to 
harass us." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third lawsuit filed by Los Angeles city officials, acting on behalf 
of residents in the southeast Valley, against the Airport Authority since 1977. 
In each instance, Los Angeles has disputed the adequacy of the airport's 
environmental reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first lawsuit, the Los Angeles City Council sought to block the 
authority's purchase of the airport site. The case was settled in 1977. The 
deal allowed the authority to buy the land from Lockheed Air Terminal, while 
airport officials agreed to take "all feasible and necessary" steps to comply 
with state noise standards, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Los Angeles again took Burbank to court, seeking to head off 
plans for doubling the size of the airport. That expansion was canceled when 
the authority could not arrange for purchase of the needed land. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the latest dispute is the proposed 670,000-square-foot 
terminal, with nearly twice as many aircraft gates as now. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Pritsker, a deputy city attorney for Los Angeles, contends that a larger 
terminal would invite more travelers to use Burbank Airport than might 
otherwise come. 
</P>
<P>
 But airport officials say the number of passengers will continue to grow, 
partly because of Burbank's convenient location and because of crowded 
conditions at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it responsible public policy to knowingly build a terminal building that 
is vastly under-designed for the number of passengers we know will come through 
the door?" asked airport spokesman Victor Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport's operating revenues for the 1994-95 fiscal year are projected 
to be $56.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About 56,000 flights by commercial aircraft were made at Burbank Airport last 
year. The vast majority take off to the south and circle west over 
neighborhoods such as North Hollywood, Valley Village, Studio City and Sherman 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners groups in those areas joined the city's lawsuit last year. For 
years, they have asked airport officials to divert more planes to the east, 
over Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But the FAA has banned aircraft weighing over 12,500 pounds from taking off to 
the east because the airport's present terminal lies just 312 feet from the 
runway and must be 750 feet away to comply with federal safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn. has taken a similar position of avoiding commercial 
flights in that direction for a number of safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of physics," said the group's former spokesman, Richard 
Russell. "If the pilot is using good sense, he will take off over the longer 
(north-south) runway." 
</P>
<P>
 Another point of contention is the complicated method by which airport noise 
is measured under California law, known as the community noise equivalent 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounding Burbank Airport are 15 noise-monitoring stations with microphones 
that record aircraft noise over a 24-hour period and feed the data into a 
centralized computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Imaginary lines are then drawn around the airport, indicating areas where the 
readings reach an average level in a given year. A 65 noise equivalent contour, 
for example, encompasses the area in which all average readings are 65 decibels 
or above. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, airports are required to reduce the number of homes, schools 
and hospitals affected by aircraft noise with soundproofing programs, easements 
and acquisitions, among other things -- as long as they are within the 65 noise 
equivalent contour. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the goal is difficult to achieve, Burbank Airport and most other 
airports in California operate under special variances, according to the state 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials have spent thousands of dollars to insulate nearby Luther 
Burbank Middle School against sound, a program that Principal Donna Coffey says 
has worked well. Three other schools -- Glenwood Elementary, St. Patrick's and 
Mingay Adult School -- will be next. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar work has not yet begun on the 1,764 homes within the 65 noise contour, 
but is expected to soon. 
</P>
<P>
 After a new terminal is built, airport officials contend, the 65 noise contour 
is not likely to grow very much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't have sympathy for people near the airport," said the Airport 
Authority's attorney, Richard Simon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bought their homes cheaply," he added. "They realized -- they knew in 
their hearts -- they got a bit of a bargain and they took advantage of the 
opportunity that the proximity to the airport afforded them, and they've 
forgotten that."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; FIREFIGHTERS FILL THE BOOT TO FIGHT 
DISEASE 
</P>

<P>
 Fire Capt. Jim Ackerman, his red helmet bobbing against a current of cars and 
arms that were waiving dollars, worked the Simi Valley intersection Friday 
morning like a carnival barker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take cash. We'll take checks. We don't care. We'll take credit cards," 
Ackerman called out, challenging motorists to drop $1, $5 or $10 into his black 
rubber boot for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. at Sycamore Drive and Cochran 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fifth time since 1989, several off-duty Ventura County firefighters 
staked out the corners and concrete dividers at the busy intersection to help 
fight 40 neuromuscular diseases. About two dozen volunteers were expected to 
participate in the "Fill the Boot" fund-raiser Friday and today. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-month-old Ian McAlevey, held in his aunt's arms, giggled as he dropped 
a dollar into the boot held by Firefighter Chad Cook, who coordinated the 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, bub," Cook said. He showed his appreciation by flicking on the red 
lights of an adjacent fire engine for the toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments earlier, a yellow pickup truck drifted by at about 15 m.p.h. as 
Ackerman reached out from the center divider and snapped up a $1 donation from 
the driver's outstretched arm. "Thank you, thank you," he cried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedestrians, tradesmen in vans, teen-age girls, people of all stripes and ages 
answered the firefighters' appeals for donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Beasley, 22, of Simi Valley gave $5, 63-year-old Jack Slaughter about 
$10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley is a very giving community, despite its hardships," said Muscular 
Dystrophy Assn. district director Liz Kelleher, referring to local victims of 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they love the firefighters," she added. "They're the heroes, the good 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 County firefighters did not hold their annual muscular dystrophy fund-raiser 
in Simi Valley last fall due to the rash of wildfires. Donations for the 
charity slipped accordingly, Kelleher said. Firefighters collected $7,000 at 
the intersection in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties last year, volunteers 
raised $240,000 compared to $310,000 collected the previous year, Kelleher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. raised $106 million last year, 
including $46 million from entertainer Jerry Lewis' telethon, she added. GREG

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; A YEAR WITHOUT HOT DOGS IS ENDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year of closed concession stands at Simi Valley parks, residents will 
once again be able to purchase hot dogs and sodas at softball games, park 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District recently signed a five-year 
contract with Nizar Patel, owner of Shakey's Pizza in Mountaingate Plaza, to 
operate and improve two snack bars on park district property. 
</P>
<P>
 The stands are near softball diamonds at Rancho Simi Community Park and Rancho 
Santa Susana Community Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor sales prompted the previous operator to close last year, district board 
member James Meredith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good deal, I think," Meredith said. "It's convenient for people in 
the park to be able to get hot drinks on a cold night or cold drinks on a hot 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Patel's contract begins Jan. 1. After he makes some improvements, the stands 
will be open on a regular basis during evening sports league games and on the 
weekends. Patel said he will sell hot dogs, cold sandwiches, chips, sodas, 
pretzels and ice cream. MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; EX-DEPUTY MANAGER IS REHIRED BY CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former deputy city manager in Simi Valley who left to take a job elsewhere 
has been permanently rehired, City Manager Lin Koester has announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Penman, who worked for Simi Valley from 1975 to 1982, will fill an open 
assistant city manager position. 
</P>
<P>
 Penman, 43, will be in charge of the city's economic development programs, 
including efforts to attract a regional mall developer to the city. He will 
receive an annual salary of $87,156, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Penman left Simi Valley to take a job as city manager of the small city of San 
Fernando in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he was hired as city manager for Baldwin Park, which later did away 
with the position. Penman returned to Simi Valley earlier this year as interim 
director of general services. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing Penman's hiring, Koester praised his ability to quickly reorient 
himself to the needs of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "After watching Don again work with the city these past three months, I know 
that he has the ability and expertise to serve our city and our community 
well," Koester said. "He has quickly earned the trust and respect of city staff 
and elected officials." SARA CATANIA

HOLIDAY A BLEND OF NATIONALISM AND SPIRITUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hanukkah, which Jews begin observing Sunday night, might have remained solely 
a celebration of a military victory except for the disillusionment of Judaism's 
early rabbis with religious nationalism, says a Jewish scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day festival still inspires sermons about religious liberty, but 
Hanukkah also has spiritual elements that balance militancy as the key to 
Jewish survival with reliance on God, said Zev Garber, professor of Jewish 
studies at Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as militancy and spirituality were in tension in antiquity, so they are 
today, says Garber, author of a recent book on the Holocaust, "Shoah: The 
Paradigmatic Genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably need both," Garber said in an interview, expanding upon an 
article on Hanukkah in the journal Jewish Spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah recalls the overthrow of Hellenistic Syrian forces occupying 
Jerusalem in 164 B.C. by Jewish troops led by Judas Maccabaeus. The Maccabees 
rededicated the originally Jewish temple where idol worship had been 
introduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maccabees, as Garber noted, "relied on the alliance of a foreign power, 
Rome, to bring victory, and ensured internal power by perpetuating a holiday 
for their accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But about two centuries later, after the disastrous Jewish War with Rome from 
A.D. 66 to 70 -- when Roman troops destroyed the Jerusalem Temple and set off a 
massive exile of Jews from their homeland -- the new movement of rabbis, who 
supplanted the dispossessed temple priests, took stock of "what Maccabeean 
religio-nationalism did to a nation," Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 When deciding which books would be included in the Hebrew Bible, the rabbis 
left out 14 books, including those bearing the name Maccabees. (The so-called 
Apocrypha, including Ruth, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach and the Maccabees 
nevertheless were preserved by the early churches and are found in ecumenical 
Christian Bibles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Garber said the rabbis' exclusion of the two Maccabee portions was quite 
purposeful given their religious significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 14 books, only those two deal with the preservation or celebration of 
an established holiday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was retained, but the rabbis gave it a more spiritual cast, 
Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first Sabbath of Hanukkah, a verse from the Chapter 4 of Zechariah is 
read in the synagogue: "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the 
Lord of hosts." 
</P>
<P>
 The pointed use of this verse, noted the Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion, 
was an example of the pronounced tendency on the rabbis' part "to diminish the 
military aspect of the festival and concentrate instead on the aspect of the 
survival of religious values in the face of pagan and idolatrous opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 As is well known in Judaic studies, Rabbinic writings collectively known as 
the Talmud said that the festival was held for eight days because pure oil 
found in the temple by the Maccabees -- though sufficient only for one day -- 
miraculously burned for eight days until new supplies could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The main feature of Hanukkah today is the progressive kindling of eight 
candles on the Hanukkah menorah, one each night, from the light on a ninth 
socket. The story of the miraculous oil is not told, however, in the books of 
the Maccabees but was added by the rabbis later as part of a move to minimize 
the importance of the military actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber said that the pious harmonizing of the story by the rabbis was 
reflected in a later, 9th-Century Palestinian commentary. Explaining why 
menorahs are lit on Hanukkah, the rabbinical commentary said that when the 
Maccabees re-entered the temple they hollowed out eight rods of iron and poured 
lighted oil into them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, for the rabbis, weapons of the spirit and not war are the way for 
the Jewish people," Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in recent centuries, anti-Semitic pogroms and the Holocaust have 
raised questions about making Jewish survival overly dependent on piety and 
passivity, Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews need both -- strength in physical terms and in spiritual ways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Harvey Fields, senior rabbi at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, said Garber's 
interpretation of Hanukkah's history may have underplayed the broader struggle 
between the rabbis of the Pharisee movement and the Sadducees, who inherited 
the Maccabeean tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pharisees basically did not want the Maccabeeans or the Sadducees to get 
any credit for their victory," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Fields said that Hanukkah as observed today has gone beyond an argument 
over militarism versus pacifism to become primarily a "celebration of human 
liberation and ultimately a victory to retain religious freedom."

HANUKKAH CANDLES SERVE AS METAPHOR FOR RELIGIOUS LIFE; HOLIDAY: THEY 
COMMEMORATE THE MIRACLE OF THE OIL IN THE TEMPLE LASTING EIGHT DAYS. THEIR 
LIGHTING ALSO IS ABOUT THE SLOW UNFOLDING OF SPIRITUAL INSIGHT.

 For Hasidic Jews, lighting Hanukkah candles is not enough. One should also 
strain to hear the flickering of the flames, for it is said they tell the 
stories of a people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our custom," explained Shlomo Schwartz, a Lubavitch Hasid from Los Angeles, 
"is for 30 minutes after the candles are lit, the entire family stays in the 
room with the candles. We bend close to the light and concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Children crowd around the menorah, the eight-branched candelabrum that holds 
the Hanukkah candles, as adults are moved to recall the teachings of renowned 
rabbis and the heroism and faith of Jews subjected to religious persecution 
over the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family may eat latkes (fried potato pancakes) and the children may even 
get a little gift," Schwartz said. "But no one does any kind of work. The point 
is to be together and just hang out with the light." 
</P>
<P>
 For American Jews, lighting Hanukkah candles is among the most celebrated of 
religious rituals, second only to attending a Passover Seder. The eight-day 
holiday begins Sunday evening, when the first Hanukkah candle is lighted after 
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Hanukkah celebrated a military victory -- the 2nd-Century triumph 
of the forces of Judas Maccabaeus over the Syrian Greeks who were seeking to 
force the cultural assimilation of the Jews of Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later did Judaism's Rabbinic authorities append to the celebration the 
story of the miracle of the oil. They did so, religion historians say, to 
impart a spiritual tone to the holiday's nationalistic theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The miracle, according to tradition, is that beyond all rational explanation, 
a small stock of oil managed to burn for eight days in the central menorah of 
the newly restored Jerusalem Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, at one time, a Rabbinic debate over the order in which Hanukkah 
candles should be lighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Followers of the Talmudic sage Hillel said one candle should be lighted on 
Hanukkah's first night, with one candle being added each subsequent night. 
Followers of the sage Shammai said all eight candles should be lighted the 
first night, decreasing by one on each subsequent night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillel's followers eventually won out. Their argument that holiness should 
only be increased carried the day and became set in tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a metaphor for religious life," said Rabbi David Cooper, who runs a 
spiritual retreat center in Jamestown, Colo. "Do we plunge into it all at once, 
or do we gradually build our level of observance and understanding? This is one 
experience of building up from day to day to higher levels of insight." 
</P>
<P>
 In religious iconography, light represents the many faces of the divine -- 
wisdom, eternity, consciousness, hope and the possibility of transformation. 
The light of the Hanukkah candles is, in short, a powerful symbol made more so 
because Hanukkah falls at the time of year when the days are getting shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 For writer Blu Greenberg, the Rabbinic addition of the candles was a stroke of 
religious genius. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone yearns for the light," said Greenberg, who lives in New York. "It 
represents the triumph of goodness over the forces of darkness. . . . Lighting 
candles is something very tangible that has stirred the hearts of millions of 
Jewish children and adults over the centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rabbi Marc Angel turns to the Zohar, the 13th-Century book that is 
the major text of Jewish mysticism, to better understand the spiritual lesson 
of the Hanukkah candles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zohar, Angel pointed out, sees candlelight as a metaphor for the human 
condition. The solid candle represents the earth and our connection to it. The 
blue flame close to the wick represents a transitional space between the 
material and spirit worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Above that rests the orange flame that becomes transparent as it ascends, and 
the point at which the flame is no longer visible is said to represent the pure 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting the Hanukkah candles connects the Jew of today with the miracle of 
the oil and, beyond that, to the very mystery of miracles. "The menorah reminds 
us of the miracle that no matter how dark life may be, there remains a source 
of light deep within us," writes Rabbi Michael Strassfeld in his book "The 
Jewish Holidays: A Guide and Commentary." 
</P>
<P>
 The opening lines of the Book of Genesis speak of how God said "let there be 
light" and how the light was then pronounced to be good. Focusing on the light 
of the Hanukkah candles, and recalling Genesis, is a religious act that recalls 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, noted Massachusetts Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, is especially true if 
one thinks of organized religion "as the things you do to remind you that there 
is a primordial brightness greater than the brightness of everyday life today."

 Hanukkah, the 2,000-year-old Jewish festival of lights, begins at sundown 
Sunday and lasts eight days. The holiday celebrates the survival of the Jewish 
people, according to Rabbi Ruth Sohn of the Stephen Wise Jewish Community High 
School. "It commemorates a military victory and, more importantly, spiritual 
triumph," she said. "The lighting of Hanukkah candles affirms our belief in 
God's presence in the world, even at the darkest time of the year and the 
darkest moments of our lives," Sohn said.

'REJECTION DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am very pleased, rather I should say very happy, that the elections are 
over.I'm sure there are millions of others that agree with me and for the same 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 These so-called candidates running for office hardly ever tell you what they 
can do or what they will try to do for us. All they do is smear each other. 
Truthfully, it's sickening. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know, maybe it's me. Maybe it's the way I think. Why can't they speak 
about themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we should call it Rejection Day instead of Election Day and vote to 
reject the one with the worse reputation.

CAMPAIGN MANNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a resident of Simi Valley, I read with great interest how Thousand Oaks 
Councilwoman Elois Zeanah wants to discuss campaign reforms to stem the tide of 
negative campaigning in Thousand Oaks (Nov. 12). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm amazed that the characters of the candidates -- and some of the voters -- 
participating in the mudslinging are being overlooked. Instead, we are once 
again told how spending caps on campaigns rather than just a return to good 
manners will improve campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 Less campaign spending may prevent someone from spewing hate on a massive 
scale, but it also prevents the dissemination of important information about 
candidates and their positions. Spending limitations can only limit the medium 
of the message, not its content. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley also had an election campaign this fall, though you'd hardly know 
it since it was so politely conducted. Even though we too spent gobs of money 
on our campaigns, we had many examples of candidates repairing their opponents' 
signs. Our candidate forums -- though boring by Thousand Oaks' standards -- 
dealt with issues important to the community, rather than with character 
assassinations. Is it possible to have clean campaigns without "campaign 
reforms?" I hope the answer is obvious. Will "campaign reforms" make people 
more neighborly? Not one bit. 
</P>
<P>
 To those of us in Simi Valley, the next time that someone from Thousand Oaks 
snootily talks down to you about the lack of culture and proper upbringing in 
Simi Valley -- they have a mall, a mammoth performing arts center, higher per 
capita incomes, more college graduates, ad nauseum -- I recommend the following 
response: Smile politely, wish them a nice day, and resist the urge to kick 
their teeth in. Why jeopardize your own etiquette and values on those not 
worthy of such a compromise? 
</P>
<P>
 And always remember, money, or lack thereof, doesn't determine how civil your 
behavior.

BUT WHAT IS IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My problem with the new Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza is its lack of 
definiteness. Is it fish or fowl? Is it vegetable or mineral? Is it a city hall 
or a theater(s)? One entrance (a chute-like entrance) leads to all.Surely, a 
main stage theater deserves a more grand entrance than an alleyway entry 
leading to a city hall lobby which leads to another corridor to the main lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The coloration of the main stage theater gives me the effect of being in a 
grotto. Gray slate walls with jagged stone flower pot fixtures, exuding 
indirect lighting, create the grotto-like effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The seats in the balcony do not allow much leg room for late comers to squeeze 
through. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's restroom off the main lobby could use more urinals. During 
intermission at a Forum event recently, there was a line-up in front of the 
men's room. This is a problem I've seen at the Chandler Pavilion and the 
Hollywood Bowl. I hoped this would be avoided with the new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 I was intrigued by the telescope-like peep holes in the balcony walls. The 
peep holes are focused on the Yukon Belle saloon across the street. The Belle 
is a friendly reminder of the days of Thousand Oaks before redevelopment 
knocked on the city's door. 
</P>
<P>
 And pray tell, what are the wine racks still doing on top of the plaza's roof 
weeks after the gala opening?

GIVING AND SHARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we contemplate the season of giving, I would like to remind people about an 
extraordinary organization right here in Ventura County that is all about 
giving and sharing. That organization is the Big Brother/Big Sister Program. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been a "big sister" for over 2 1/2 years and it is one of the most 
rewarding experiences of my life. Like many of you, I have been fortunate in my 
life to have a safe living environment filled with love and opportunity. Now I 
have the chance to share the things in my life that I am thankful for with 
another person. And it isn't a one-way street; my life is enriched by the time 
my "little sister" and I spend together. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the Big Brother/Big Sister Program is recruiting new big brothers 
and sisters. There are over 100 children waiting for a big brother or sister 
here in Ventura County.

WHY LOBBYISTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me see if I got this right. Ventura County is spending 300,000 of its 
taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to send some lobbyists to Washington, D.C. Their 
mission is to lobby the commission charged with the closure of military bases 
to leave Point Mugu and Port Hueneme off the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, but isn't that the reason we have elected representatives? I mean, 
Elton Gallegly surely must be aware that these military bases are on the list. 
And one would assume that the reason he was elected in the first place is to 
act as ombudsman for Ventura County and to represent Ventura County's best 
interests. Why do we need lobbyists if we have Elton? Or why do we need Elton 
if we have lobbyists? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely Elton Gallegly and his staff are not so overburdened with legislative 
activities that they are unable to represent the best interests of the 
constituency. I seem to remember when Bob Lagomarsino represented this district 
prior to the gerrymander, that he argued successfully against the base 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
 My message to county supervisors is this: Quit wasting taxpayers' money on 
items that we already pay for through the nose. And the message to Elton is: 
Quit playing partisan politics and get on with the job of representing the 
citizens of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The military bases in Ventura County are not insignificant to the economic 
structure of this county and if they are closed during Elton Gallegly's watch, 
the voters will not soon forget.

THE POLICE RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was shocked and outraged when I read the Oct. 20 comment made by Santa Paula 
City Council candidate Les Maland. Maland was quoted as saying that youth 
programs are "less expensive than adding a few more headbusters in the Police 
Department." 
</P>
<P>
 While I might agree that it is important that the city provide programs for 
our youth to keep them off the streets, it is hardly appropriate to take such a 
jab at the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 16 years that I have been employed by the Santa Paula Police 
Department, there has not been a single lawsuit where the officer has been 
found guilty of improper conduct. As far as "adding a few more headbusters," I 
should point out that the Santa Paula Police Department is nearly the same size 
it was when I was hired, having added only one more officer position. 
</P>
<P>
 This is during a period when our city's population has risen by over 10,000 
people and our officers handle more calls for service per officer than any 
other Ventura County department. In short, our officers have been working hard 
to keep Santa Paula safe, and hardly deserve to have such a derogatory comment 
made about them by a council candidate.

 Taxpayers beware. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to build a minor league baseball stadium is probably going to 
cost you lots of money. How much is anyone's guess.The economic fact of life is 
that minor league clubs don't generate much income and therefore expect their 
rent and much of their stadium operating expenses to be subsidized. It seems 
most folks won't pay much to watch the minors when they can watch the majors 
free on television. 
</P>
<P>
 From the news reports it appears that certain politicians and groups 
supporting the stadium have kept the potential financial impact to the 
taxpayers well hidden from public view or have not done their homework on the 
subject. After the councils OKd the study some months ago, the next thing we 
hear is that the study is completed and the councils, with only a few weeks' 
notice, were hastily being urged to approve a joint powers agreement and 
financial plan for the proposed ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 I urge every member of the Ventura, Oxnard and Camarillo city councils not to 
get "in bed" with this special interest until the public has been informed and 
has had the opportunity to consider and debate whether this is a wise use of 
scarce public funds.

MORE TAX MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the best concealed efforts to redistribute our money hides behind a 
bill introduced by state Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) and signed into law 
by the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 This bill establishes Ventura and San Diego counties for a pilot program to 
reduce air pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 The target pollution miles per vehicle will be determined and the figure must 
be reduced by 5% per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the prescribed mileage be exceeded, a smog test is required after one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 SB 2050 also indicates that low-income drivers may be forced by economic 
circumstances to rely on older high-emission motor vehicles. Therefore, 
programs to help low-income drivers acquire cleaner vehicles are appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the process of collecting seed money begins. Should you buy a new car you 
may receive an invitation from the Department of Consumer Affairs to pay $39 
and then you do not need a smog check for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cover letter states, "The $39 will become seed money to purchase the worse 
polluting vehicles on the road for scrap and help fund repairs of other dirty 
air cars." 
</P>
<P>
 You will be pleased to help pay for someone else's auto repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 This is but one method devised by bureaucrats to wring money out of the 
taxpayer. Our elected officials, forgetting whom they represent, too often seem 
to readily agree with such suggestions on the basis that the money can be 
raised and some bureaucrat thinks it is a good cause. 
</P>
<P>
 It is high time that our elected officials stop meeting every problem by 
spending more of our money.

FOR SECOND CHANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can understand the frustration and fear that the teachers are feeling about 
students carrying weapons on campus in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Having taught school for 25 years for the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
I did not experience the violent encounters they have had.I retired in 1985, 
having taught in Woodland Hills among, for the most part, well-mannered pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe everyone, especially youngsters, should be given a second chance. I 
am not condoning their carrying a weapon on campus, but I feel that expulsion 
is too drastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I would strongly recommend a one-year suspension, with the 
understanding that the youngster stay out of trouble during that time and then 
be reinstated in school. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe giving the child a second chance would give him (or her) time to 
contemplate and feel the loss of not being with his friends.

LAKERS WAKE UP JUST IN TIME; PRO BASKETBALL: AFTER SLOW START, THEY SHOOT 70.6% 
IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO RALLY PAST ATLANTA, 92-87. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For three quarters, the Lakers weren't worth a nickel, shooting 34.8% while 
committing 13 turnovers against 16 assists and thankful, a day late, to be 
playing the Atlanta Hawks. So how could the fourth quarter be money in the 
bank? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe because it has already been so many times this season. Friday night, 
they found the life preserver again, recovering from a sluggish showing to 
shoot 70.6% those final 12 minutes and put together a 19-7 run over the last 
6:26 and beat the Hawks, 92-87, before 14,239 at the Omni. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means we are an excellent team," said Vlade Divac, who had a season-high 
16 rebounds along with 15 points. "Even if we don't play well, we still win the 
game. It gives us a lot of confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 An excellent team? No. A good-enough team? Yes.  
</P>
<P>
 Good enough to improve to 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Good enough to win for the fourth time in five games and the third time in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 Good enough to win when leading scorer Cedric Ceballos got only 29 minutes and 
eight shots, two of which were baskets that helped spark the 10-0 rally that 
turned the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of win that can help bring a team together," Coach Del 
Harris said. "It was the kind of night in which not a whole lot was going well. 
We weren't getting the ball to go in the basket. We just weren't real alert the 
first three quarters. Loose balls eluded us and we were breaking down. Then in 
the fourth quarter, we got a spark." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Peeler made another cameo and scored six points in 85 seconds late in 
the third quarter to help keep the Lakers close. Antonio Harvey made his second 
consecutive strong showing, following up the 16 points and six rebounds 
Wednesday against Dallas at the Forum with 13 and five, respectively. 
Ultimately, though, their stars came out. 
</P>
<P>
 It began as the Hawks (4-8) held an 80-73 advantage. Divac tipped in Harvey's 
miss with 6:26 to go, and when Ceballos made two baskets in a row the Lakers 
were down only a point. Nick Van Exel hit a short bank from the right side, 
then, after Steve Smith missed a jumper for Atlanta, grabbed the loose ball and 
delivered a long lead pass that Tony Smith turned into a fast-break layup. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-0 surge put the Lakers ahead, 83-80. When Van Exel hit a three-pointer 
on their next possession, the cushion was suddenly four, 86-82, with 3 1/2 
minutes left. Another drive by Ceballos, this one culminated as he flipped the 
ball up while slicing across the lane, was worth an 88-84 lead and provided the 
winning points with 3:02 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me the ball in the fourth quarter," said Ceballos, who finished 
with 12 points. "That was the key." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody on the Atlanta Hawks can guard me," he said. "It was just the point of 
getting me the ball and letting me play. Two minutes and come out. Two minutes 
and come out. That's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The final minute wasn't much easier for the Lakers, not while watching the 
Hawks scrape for offensive rebounds and more scoring chances, futile as those 
were while making four of 16 shots in the fourth quarter. Atlanta had four 
shots on one possession, three of which were three-pointers by Mookie Blaylock, 
then came back the next time downcourt with two more from behind the 
three-point line, the last with about 12 seconds to go. None went in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time the ball would go up in the air, I'd see 50 fingers scratching for 
the ball," Harris said. "And we never came down with one. Finally, we got one." 
</P>
<P>
 That and a victory. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell was back in the starting lineup at power forward after missing 
the previous game to attend an uncle's funeral, but with the game on the line 
Antonio Harvey got all the time there. Harvey played 33 minutes to Campbell's 
25. "He keeps our other big people honest," Coach Del Harris said. "Our other 
big people, as good Laker fans know, have a tendency to relax. When I see that 
happen, I figure a good place to relax is on the bench. I feel Antonio can give 
us some zip." Said Harvey, when asked about not starting but playing in crunch 
time: "What it says is that he feels like I'm playing well right now. That's 
enough for me." . . . Atlanta's Mookie Blaylock led all scorers with 18 points, 
but made only seven of 21 shots, including two of 13 three-pointers. The other 
starting guard, Steve Smith, was five of 14. Lakers On-Line

CLIPPERS' SHOT AT VICTORY ENDS UP OUT OF BOUNDS; PRO BASKETBALL: TEAM FALLS TO 
0-12 AFTER ELLIS' 19-POINT FOURTH QUARTER TRIGGERS BIG RALLY BEFORE COSTLY 
MISSTEP IN 107-102 LOSS TO NETS.

<P>
 One foot. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how close the Clippers came to winning their first game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing the New Jersey Nets, 105-102, with 11.2 seconds left, Clipper forward 
Harold Ellis made an apparent game-tying three-pointer.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the shot was nullified because Ellis' left foot was out of bounds 
when he took the pass from guard Pooh Richardson and the Nets held on for a 
107-102 victory before an announced crowd of 7,160 Friday at the Sports Arena 
to extend the Clippers' season-opening losing streak to 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to get behind the (three-point) line for the three and I guess I 
stepped out of bounds," Ellis said. "Coach said I had both feet out of bounds 
(replays showed that he had his left foot on the line) and it was an excellent 
call if I stepped out of bounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clipper Coach Bill Fitch: "That was a good call. He had both feet out of 
bounds. If the official misses that call with what we've been through and if he 
and I don't agree, I'd probably get the gun out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played 12 games and I think we've covered the waterfront just about 
every which way there is to (lose). No two games have been the same. You can't 
say we're boring. There are a lot of teams with better records that don't bring 
as much excitement to the ballpark as these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 But you can say they're the NBA's only winless team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are five losses from tying the record for the worst start in 
league history, established when the expansion Miami Heat dropped their first 
17 games in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is tough because I've never been a loser," said Ellis, who scored a 
season-high 24 points, including 19 in the final quarter as the Clippers almost 
overcame a 20-point deficit. "Losing a lot of games in a row is tough because 
it's something you can't get used to. We all just want to get that one win. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd made that shot at least we would have had a chance to win it because 
the game would have gone to overtime. It's frustrating because it takes a lot 
of out of you. But we're still going to put it together and win. We're getting 
closer and closer and hopefully we'll get that win." 
</P>
<P>
 Net guard Sleepy Floyd said a loss to the Clippers, who lost by only one point 
at New Jersey last Sunday, would have been embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first team to lose to the Clippers is going to be embarrassed," Floyd 
said. "Who is it going to be? There's pressure playing them in this kind of 
situation. You can't be the first one to lose to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by as much as 20 points in the third quarter, didn't 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 104-94, with 2:20 remaining, Ellis scored eight points in a 
57-second span to cut the deficit to 104-102. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who scored the Clippers' final 10 points, got so excited during the 
rally that he intentionally high-fived reserve forward Sean Higgins of the Nets 
after he made a layup and was fouled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who shot 59% in the fourth quarter, had a chance to tie it after 
All-Star guard Kenny Anderson, who had 22 points and 14 assists, threw the ball 
away while trying to pass to Derrick Coleman underneath the basket with 49 
seconds left, but Clipper forward Tony Massenburg missed a short jumper with 37 
seconds left and Ellis fouled Net forward Armon Gilliam as they fought for the 
rebound. Gilliam made one of two free throws with 36 seconds left to give the 
Nets a 105-102 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called time to set up a play and Richardson hit center Matt Fish 
with a pass underneath the basket. But Fish lost control of the ball when he 
put it on the floor and was tied up by Gilliam. Fish, who twisted his right 
ankle in the scramble for the loose ball, controlled the tip, getting the ball 
to rookie forward Eric Piatkowski with 24.6 seconds left. After getting a pass 
from Piatkowski, Richardson passed to Ellis, who was out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got one of the youngest teams in the league and the oldest coach (60) 
and I'm getting (older) by the day," Fitch said.

USC STEWING OVER IRISH DOMINATION; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TROJANS HOPE TO END 
11-GAME LOSING STREAK IN SERIES AGAINST INCONSISTENT NOTRE DAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jeff Kopp, a USC senior linebacker, says he has had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven years of enough. Enough of Notre Dame's winning streak.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous," he said, talking about both the heartbreak of last 
week's loss to UCLA and today's 66th Notre Dame-USC game at the Coliseum. "This 
has to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try not to think of Notre Dame's win streak over us, but like Coach 
Robinson told us, 11 is enough. That's not supposed to happen, losing to anyone 
11 times in a row." 
</P>
<P>
 USC seniors, though, have been saying much the same thing since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominance. No other word characterizes Notre Dame's recent record in the 
series.  
</P>
<P>
 USC hasn't beaten the Irish in college football's oldest intersectional 
rivalry -- the first game was played in 1926 -- since the last team of John 
Robinson's first USC term did it, 17-13, in 1982.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was a Gerry Faust Notre Dame team. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's record against Notre Dame is far better than that of his seniors. 
He was 5-1 against the Fighting Irish until last season's 31-13 loss at South 
Bend. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers suggest that the Trojans' chances this evening are better than 
they were last season, on a day when Notre Dame gained 305 yards rushing, got a 
70-yard touchdown run from Lee Becton on the second play of the game and ran 
off to a 28-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was an 11-1 Notre Dame team, one that sent virtually its entire 
offensive line into the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Notre Dame is 6-4, loser of three of its last five, and 
injury-troubled. And this is a 7-3 USC team, winner of five of its last six, 
playing before a sold-out Coliseum crowd. Both teams have bowl aspirations, 
although Irish Coach Lou Holtz wouldn't say this week if the Irish would accept 
a bowl bid if they lost to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not my decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC could wind up in the Sugar Bowl game with a victory over Notre Dame, and 
if Florida beats Alabama on Dec. 3 in the Southeastern Conference title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those two things happen, USC becomes our top priority team to meet Florida 
in our game," the Sugar Bowl's Chuck Zatarain, in Los Angeles to see tonight's 
game, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans also are on short lists for the Cotton, Sun and Fiesta bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Notre Dame, not bowls, is the Trojans' energy-builder this week.  
</P>
<P>
 And Kopp has become the top cop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This week, this is when all the seniors have to step up and demand that every 
player on this team gives everything he has," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be certain everyone is emotionally prepared to play." 
</P>
<P>
 "That 1992 Notre Dame team (which finished 10-1-1) was by far the best one 
I've played, when I was a sophomore," Kopp said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They had Rick Mirer and Jerome Bettis. But we hung in there and played them 
even (USC lost, 31-23). So I know we can beat this team." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some talk this week of emotional fatigue after the 31-19 loss 
to UCLA. That occurred after victories over Washington State and Arizona. 
Robinson wondered if a five-game winning streak had extracted a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his players, there was some disagreement on this.  
</P>
<P>
 Kopp said no, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson said yes.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're standing in that tunnel, looking at 93,000 people and Notre Dame is 
out there waiting for you, and you're emotionally drained -- well, something is 
wrong with you," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has caught 52 passes for 1,026 yards, said he was emotionally 
spent in the UCLA game. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly didn't play that way, catching 11 passes for 175 yards, his most 
productive game yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt emotionally tired (against UCLA)," he said. "We'd played so good 
against Washington State and Arizona. . . . It's hard to play your best against 
those tough teams back to back. You just don't have a lot of energy left. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think our energies will be back for Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Rob Johnson said he feels the weight of a losing streak 
against Notre Dame, but for him it's a two-gamer, not 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the weight of the losing streak in the games I played in," he said. 
"Those were the '93 and '92 games, and I really want to beat Notre Dame while 
I'm here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we played fairly well back there last year. We just couldn't get 
the ball in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 On the fatigue issue, Johnson said a certain numbness might have settled in 
the week of the UCLA game.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great opportunity," he said. "We want to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz dismisses the winning streak, calling this a coin-flip game.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you flip a coin and it comes up heads 15 straight times, it's still only a 
50-50 chance it'll come up heads on the 16th flip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's challenge today is Ron Powlus, Notre Dame's sophomore quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 He already has tied the Irish one-season record for touchdown passes with 18. 
Some Holtz teams at Notre Dame never reached double digits in touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Said USC defensive coordinator Don Lindsey, "Sometimes (Powlus) looks like a 
million-dollar quarterback, and sometimes he struggles. What you have there is 
a guy who's on his way to being a great player who's going through normal 
development." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz will patch together his 11th different offensive 
lineup tonight. Guards Jeremy Akers and Mark Zataveski are out with injuries, 
as is linebacker Justin Goheen. Questionable are defensive end Renaldo Wynn, 
safety LaRon Moore and cornerbacks Shawn Wooden and Tracy Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson reports a relatively injury-free lineup, including 
starting tailback Shawn Walters, who has been slowed by a cracked thumb for two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Delon Washington, the freshman tailback who was a sensation in the opening 
victory over Washington and who later was withheld for eight games while he 
prepared for and retook an entrance exam, was cleared to play Monday. 
Washington has looked sharp in practice this week but his conditioning is 
suspect. Robinson said he might play Washington in "a series or two." The 
Series

GLORY DAYS AGAIN?; NEVADA LAS VEGAS IS COUNTING ON TIM GRGURICH TO RECLAIM 
SUCCESS OF TARKANIAN ERA WHILE LEAVING ITS PROBLEMS BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unopened bottle of slivovitz sits among the stacks of scouting tapes and 
phone messages covering Tim Grgurich's modest little desk in his modest little 
office. There are two school-issued chairs, a TV, a VCR and, if you like 
concrete, a gorgeous window view of the Thomas & Mack Center parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich could have had Rollie Massimino's old place down the hall, but the 
new Nevada Las Vegas coach won't set foot in the room. Too strange, too soon 
and too much cherry wood. In fact, the joke going around the Runnin' Rebel 
staff is that Grgurich wouldn't mind sitting in the reception area and letting 
his secretary sit inside the Massimino museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to talk to the people who donated all the money for the offices and 
see what they want to do with everything," Grgurich said. "There's enough area 
for a library for the players, enough area for a nice lounge for the players, 
the former players and former coaches. With their permission I'd like to do 
something in there." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he would like to purge the memory of Massimino's ill-fated 
two-year reign at UNLV and return it to the glory days -- but with a Grgurich 
spin. Already he has 
</P>
<P>
 organized a search party to find the missing photos and trophies from the 
Jerry Tarkanian era -- his era as a UNLV assistant -- and start putting them on 
walls and in prominently placed glass cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great tradition here," said Grgurich, who spent 12 years on the 
Rebel staff before joining the Seattle SuperSonics after Tarkanian resigned in 
March 1992. "And the tradition should be continued." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the slivovitz, plum brandy that goes down as easy as paint 
thinner. One of Grgurich's buddies from the old neighborhood in Pittsburgh gave 
him the bottle as a present and custom dictates that it be opened on a special 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was younger and the stomach stronger, Grgurich, 50, took a pop of the 
stuff every Christmas, or maybe toasted the birth of a child, or saluted a 
loved one at a wedding. Now he has a bottle of his own, but when to pour? After 
his first game, Monday night against Marquette in Milwaukee? After his first 
victory? His first good night's sleep? 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, it won't be opened," he said. "That's pretty hard stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty hard job, too. Hired in the aftermath of the Massimino mess, where a 
secret supplemental contract blew up in the faces of everyone involved -- 
Massimino, former UNLV President Robert Maxson and soon-to-be-former UNLV 
Athletic Director Jim Weaver -- Grgurich is here to restore order to the 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, Grgurich has had only about five weeks to prepare for a season 
that will test his reputation, to say nothing of his patience. Here, hire a 
staff. Introduce yourself to those strangers on your roster. Recruit. Install 
your offense and defense. Conduct practices. Appease a community. Coordinate 
the academics. And by the way, win games, sell tickets and reach the NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day feels like a week," Grgurich said. "I mean, I still wake up 
sometimes and I'm not sure if I'm in Seattle or UNLV. It's a big transition and 
probably one of the hardest things we'll have to do in our lives. It's trial 
and error almost every day in our coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV knows all about trials and errors. The school leads the league in 
lawsuits, litigation and knucklehead mistakes. There have been NCAA 
investigations, in-house investigations, suits and countersuits, NCAA 
sanctions, secret contracts, secret videotapes, lost games, lost fans, 
administrative mismanagement and a general public relations apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino was hired to create a new image, but instead he left his muddy 
footprints all over an already dirty carpet. In no time at all, Massimino, who 
was probably doomed from Day 1, managed to alienate an entire cross-section of 
UNLV supporters, staff and media. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed the secret supplemental deal. He battled the press. He made a series 
of amazing statements. He argued with fans. He vowed no player would embarrass 
the university and then found himself explaining alleged grade scandals and 
questionable player plane ticket purchases during his watch. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were little things, too. According to a source close to the team, 
Massimino, thinking he was talking to a simple staff member, once asked the 
wife of UNLV team trainer Jerry Koloskie if she would fetch his car in the 
pouring rain. Massimino didn't want to ruin his alligator shoes. Koloskie's 
wife did as asked, but the story soon became legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino's demise wasn't all his doing. He had plenty of help from Maxson, 
now the president at Long Beach State, from Weaver and from the Tarkanian 
loyalists who did everything in their power to undermine him. But when details 
of a $1.8-million supplemental deal became public, UNLV interim President Kenny 
Guinn decided the program couldn't survive with Massimino . . . or without 
Grgurich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think he's the right man at this time," said Guinn, who had 
never met Grgurich until the initial interview. "(UNLV basketball) is something 
very important overall to this community. We've had our problems. Now it's just 
time to set the stage for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich, who signed a three-year deal worth about $900,000, is all for the 
future, but he isn't much for stages or spotlights. When he was on Tarkanian's 
staff, Grgurich always seemed to miss the annual team picture. And team 
banquets. Tarkanian, at the lectern, would turn to introduce his No. 1 
assistant and there would be no Grgurich. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew I was going to say something nice about him," said Tarkanian, who 
credits Grgurich for extending his coaching career by years. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich hasn't changed a bit. He instructed the UNLV sports information 
department to keep his picture off the cover of the media guide. And although 
he is cordial and friendly enough during interviews, he also glances at his 
watch a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got a staff meeting to go to and then . . . " he said.  
</P>
<P>
 His workday starts at 7 a.m. and ends at 11 p.m. -- if he and his staff are 
lucky. There have been nights when Grgurich has slept on the office couch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, all the coaches have done the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Told of the all-nighters by his former assistant, Tarkanian shook his head in 
amusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Tim," said Tarkanian, who has attended a few UNLV practices at 
Grgurich's invitation. "You watch, they'll be back in the top 10 in no time, 
and all because of Tim. Tim is the only guy who could have done this. All he 
does is work, work, work. He has zero ego." 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich is no Tarkanian clone. He doesn't carry the cellular phone around, 
doesn't camp out at his favorite Italian restaurant and shoot the bull with 
boosters, doesn't hand out his home number, doesn't own a sideline hand towel. 
His idea of a gourmet dinner is chicken wings. 
</P>
<P>
 But they made a great pair, Tarkanian and Grgurich. Together they helped UNLV 
win a national championship, perfected the art of pressure defense and 
fast-break basketball and put the Runnin' Rebels on everyone's must-see map, 
including those of NCAA investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 When Tarkanian suffered heart problems several years ago, Grgurich was the 
first to check on his condition. And when Tarkanian resigned in 1992, the first 
and only person he recommended for the job was Grgurich. Two years and one 
coach later, UNLV took Tarkanian's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim is his own man," Tarkanian said. "He'll be successful here because they 
all know all the good he's done. They know what kind of guy he is. They can 
relate to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody can. All of the suites at the Thomas & Mack are sold and, according 
to Craig Breuer, the school's coordinator of the scholarship donor program, the 
number of quality seats is dwindling fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who are coming in big," Breuer said of the seating 
donations, which range from $600 to $10,000. "The people who are coming in now 
are former donors who are happy with the coaching change. They couldn't be 
happier that (Grgurich is) back." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy enough that Breuer estimates -- and this is on the safe side, he said -- 
Grgurich's hiring could result in an additional $500,000 worth of donations, 
maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're buying for the future," Breuer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, too, since UNLV will play only nine regular-season home games in 
1994-95, all against Big West Conference teams. Next year, when NCAA sanctions 
expire, the Rebels will face, among others, nonconference opponents Florida, 
UCLA, Seton Hall and Michigan at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of this matters to Grgurich. Suite rentals . . . ticket sales . . 
. T-shirts that read "Happy Days Are Here Again" -- it's nice, but Grgurich has 
a team to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of enthusiasm here, but I think everybody else is enjoying it," 
he said. "I don't think I'm going to be able to enjoy it until the season ends, 
really. I don't think there's time to. There's just too much to do." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so circle April 4, 1995, the day after the college season ends with the 
Final Four championship game. Maybe then Grgurich can allow himself a moment to 
celebrate and to do the unthinkable. He can open that bottle of slivovitz and 
toast the old days. And the new ones, too.

IT'S ALL OR NOTHING AT SKINS GAME; GOLF: WHOEVER WINS THE HOLE WINS THE MONEY. 
WATSON, COUPLES, AZINGER AND STEWART WILL RELY ON THEIR PUTTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's about golf, it's about money, it's about television. It's the Skins Game, 
a made-for-television 18-hole excursion that's strictly funds and games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Watson, Fred Couples, Paul Azinger and Payne Stewart play nine holes today 
and nine more Sunday at Bighorn Golf Club, where $540,000 will be won by the 
players who can make putts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at Bighorn, Stewart took most of the money, $280,000 on nine skins. 
Couples also had nine skins and won $260,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be $180,000 on the line today, $20,000 the first six holes, $30,000 
the next three. And $360,000 will be at stake Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Skins rules are simple. Whoever wins a hole outright wins the money. If no 
one wins the hole outright, the money carries over to the next hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, there's nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relaxing format in which you are not concerned about your score," 
Stewart said. "You play nine holes each day. They don't total it up at the end 
of the day with the low score winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a go-for-broke format and have a little fun at it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, Azinger and Watson were selected to play by a special panel, but 
Stewart got in because he is the defending champion. Stewart also won in 1991 
and 1992 and his $760,000 in three Skins Games is a record. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said his motivation is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely is income related," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's income wasn't up to its usual plateau this year. He won $145,687, 
which was 123rd on the PGA Tour money list, his lowest finish since his rookie 
year in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart changed clubs this year and never seemed at ease. He had only two 
top-10 finishes in 23 events. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brief summary of 1994?" Stewart said. "It stunk. That's it in a nutshell. 
</P>
<P>
 "My play hasn't merited being invited to the Skins Game. Being a made-for-TV 
event and always inviting back the champion, I figured I could get in one golf 
tournament every year if I kept winning the Skins Game." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger played Bighorn last year, knowing he would have a biopsy on his aching 
right shoulder two days later. When he did, his problem was diagnosed as 
lymphoma and he underwent chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger returned for the Buick Open in Michigan and played the PGA as the 
defending champion, then played the Southern Open and the Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he felt he was "on display" in his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be different at the Skins Game," he said. "Being on display was 
something I had to get kind of out of the way. I was there to be seen -- 'Hey, 
I'm back, I look OK.' I do think I have that behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples probably is the favorite, mainly because he has won $580,000 in 
special events in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who hasn't played in the Skins Game since 1985, said he he has a new 
putting style. "I'm not going to miss any putts anymore," he said. "These guys 
are going to be very surprised this week."

MORNING BRIEFING: THE 'BEST DEAL' AT NOTRE DAME NOT TOO GOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
 When USC played Notre Dame in 1967 at South Bend, Ind., Trojan Coach John 
McKay was determined that his team would stay in the locker room and wouldn't 
take the field until Notre Dame did so, hoping to avoid abuse from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the referee informed McKay that USC should be on the field in five 
minutes, or he would call the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "What does that mean?" McKay asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The referee said Notre Dame would win on a forfeit, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied McKay: "That would be the best deal we've ever gotten in this 
stadium." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Add 1967: USC won, 24-7, for its first victory in South Bend since 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Update: McKay and John Robinson are the only USC coaches with winning records 
against Notre Dame. McKay was 8-6-2 from 1960 to 1975. Robinson is 6-2 from 
1976 to 1982 and 1993.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; TOMCZAK GETS NOD FROM COWHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Settling the biggest debate in Pittsburgh, Coach Bill Cowher said Friday that 
Mike Tomczak will start at quarterback against the Raiders on Sunday at the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil O'Donnell started the first 10 games and completed 158 of 280 passes for 
1,906 yards with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions. Last week, however, 
O'Donnell did not play because of hip and ankle injuries, and Tomczak threw for 
a career-high 343 yards in a 16-13 overtime victory over Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowher maintained that his choice would be based strictly on O'Donnell's 
health. O'Donnell won't start, but he could still play. "Neil is ready to play 
if something were to happen to Mike," Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the quarterback matter to the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it doesn't matter because they beat you with the things that they do and 
not with their quarterback," Coach Art Shell said. "They beat you by running 
the ball, bootleg passes and gadget plays." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Wes Bender signed as a free agent during the off-season from Kansas City, 
the chances for him to get much playing time were slim. The former USC 
fullback, however, has defeated the odds and is the Raiders' backup fullback 
behind Tom Rathman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, who started the season on the practice squad, played two series in the 
Raiders' victory over New Orleans last week and made a good impression.  
</P>
<P>
 "One thing Wes can do is block, but he is not just a blocker for us," Shell 
said. "He'll get a chance to carry the ball and also catch some passes out of 
the backfield." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Bates will start in place of Derrick Hoskins at strong safety for the 
third consecutive game Sunday. Hoskins, who suffered an ankle injury at Kansas 
City Nov. 6, will play a little. . . . Cornerback Lionel Washington is out with 
a lower leg injury but Albert Lewis is expected to return to the lineup. . . . 
Tim Brown needs 73 yards receiving to record his second consecutive 1,000-yard 
season. . . . Punter Jeff Gossett leads the AFC with a 44.6-yard average.

 Kevin Williams hears the voices when he is running off the field after running 
the ball up some poor kicker's jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the corner of your helmet you can hear everybody saying, 'Yeah, yeah, 
that's it, that's just what we needed,' " said Williams, the Dallas Cowboys' 
kick returner. "You can sense that sigh of relief. You can feel the whole game 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby April, the Pittsburgh Steelers' special teams coach, hears the voices in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two different people came up to me the other night and said, 'Great game 
Sunday, coach, great game,' " April said. "Then they said, 'Yeah, our special 
teams really whipped their special teams.' They were talking specifically about 
me and my guys. It was unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Abramowicz, special teams coach of the Chicago Bears, hears the voices 
in his head. Late at night. When the only sound in his closet-sized office is 
the whirring of his VCR.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, you just get a feeling about something," he said. "You're sitting 
there thinking about trying a different kind of fake, and all of a sudden 
something tells you, 'Hey, this could work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The special teams used to be called suicide squads. Now they are a 
life-support system. 
</P>
<P>
 They used to be manned by flunkies and guys too dumb to be afraid. Now they 
are filled with Pro Bowl players. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when nobody remembered blocked kicks or long punt returns. 
Now nobody can forget them. Just ask the Rams' Robert Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest changes in this new NFL is that football's special teams 
are suddenly, well, special. 
</P>
<P>
 Players such as Mel Gray of the Detroit Lions, who has returned kicks for more 
yardage than any man in NFL history, are becoming as famous as running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches such as the Cowboys' Joe Avezzano have their own radio shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches such as the Raiders' Steve Ortmayer are being lauded for having some 
of the league's sharpest minds. 
</P>
<P>
 And April, whose sideline sprints and exhortations have become a favorite of 
network camera men, is a regular Pittsburgh celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 The good teams do it well. The poor teams barely do it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place Dallas Cowboys and Cleveland Browns are two of the top three 
ranked kickoff receiving teams in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place Bears have already won one game with a fake field goal, 
clinched another victory with a stunning onside kick, and lead the league with 
three blocked field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the last-place Houston Oilers. They haven't blocked a punt or a 
field goal. Al Del Greco has managed only one touchback on his kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 And Houston's kick return team ranks last in the AFC with an average start at 
the 26-yard-line, seven yards behind the conference-leading Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the important special teams statistics -- such as blocked field goals 
-- are still not kept by the league, but by special team junkie Rick Gosselin 
of the Dallas Morning News, who hears from coaches regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 But finally, the rest of the football world is starting to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become a new frontier," said April, a former USC assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two reasons: The rules and the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 With kickoffs being moved back to the 30-yard line this year, the kick return 
has become as much a weapon as the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The average team has returned the ball to the 29-yard line, five yards farther 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of touchbacks has been reduced by more than two-thirds, from 390 
last year to 110 this year, even though there have been 25 more kickoffs this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been fewer field- goal attempts because of the rule that 
returns missed kicks to the spot of the kick, as opposed to the line of 
scrimmage. So every pooch punt that is attempted instead of a field goal is far 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played, it was like, 'OK, boys, we're gonna punt the ball, so get down 
there and cover it,' " said Abramowicz, a former star receiver for the New 
Orleans Saints. "Today, with the shorter field, special teams play is truly 
one-third of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Steelers were Exhibit A of the importance of special teams. 
They lost their first-round playoff game to the Kansas City Chiefs last year 
when they allowed a punt to be blocked late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers would not have had to play that game on the road if they had not 
allowed Eric Metcalf to return two punts for touchdowns in a loss to the Browns 
earlier in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 John Guy, the Steelers' special teams coach, was fired. Amid much hoopla, 
April was hired away from the Atlanta Falcons to replace him.  
</P>
<P>
 This year the Steelers have yet to suffer a blocked punt while their punter, 
Mark Royals, leads the league in putting the ball inside the 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We impress upon the guys that special teams is not just something that 
happens a couple of times a week on Sunday," April said. "Special teams is 
something that you live every day." 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude is not only one of aggressiveness, but of deception. The hardest 
thing for a special teams players or coach is to remain outwardly calm moments 
before a trick play. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because from the press box or sidelines, somebody on the other team is 
always watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams will watch you for any sort of smile, any sort of motion that shows you 
are excited about what's about to happen," said the Bears' Abramowicz, whose 
fake field goal against the Miami Dolphins on Nov. 13 became a bizarre 
touchdown that fooled even Don Shula. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most important assets for a coach is a poker face," Abramowicz 
said. "Before that fake against the Dolphins, I walked over to Coach (Dave) 
Wannstedt, kept looking at the field, and said, 'Let's try it.' If I'm talking 
to him any longer, or looking funny, they would have figured something was up." 
</P>
<P>
 Check out midfield after a game. Two sets of coaches seek each other out. The 
head coaches . . . and the special teams coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We compete directly against each other, we understand each other," said 
Abramowicz. 
</P>
<P>
 They hear the same voices. THE BEST 
</P>
<P>
 This season's five best special teams plays, in ascending order. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Vernon Turner's 80-yard punt return for a touchdown for the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers against the Detroit Lions. No big deal, it was only the Buccaneers' 
first return of a kick for a touchdown in the franchise's 281-game history. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Randall Cunningham's 80-yard surprise punt for the Philadelphia Eagles 
against the Dallas Cowboys. Wouldn't you know that the league's longest punt in 
two years would belong to a quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 3. Tom Tupa's three two-point conversions for the Cleveland Browns. That is 
more two-point conversions than all but four other teams . 
</P>
<P>
 2. The fake field goal by the Bears against the Dolphins that resulted in a 
23-yard touchdown pass from receiver Curtis Conway to receiver Keith Jennings 
off a deflection from offensive lineman Jerry Fontenot. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula still doesn't know what happened. Neither, we suspect, does Conway. 
</P>
<P>
 1. What else? Bailey's 103-yard punt return for a touchdown for the Rams 
against the Saints. We'll forget that there were about a dozen rule violations 
on the play if you will. WE'RE NOT MAKING THIS UP 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the Astrodome after their Monday night victory over the Oilers, the 
New York Giants' three team buses got stuck in traffic around 1 a.m. on their 
way to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't move an inch for 20 minutes," Giant Coach Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they had not eaten since 4 p.m., Reeves, three assistant coaches and a 
team security official left the bus and walked nearly a mile up the road to a 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 When they got there, they were told it would take 15 minutes to fill their 
order. They were waiting for the food when traffic started to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves panicked, and climbed up an embankment to a freeway overpass to locate 
his buses. He didn't see them, but he did see a transient who said, "I ain't 
never seen nobody under this bridge with a coat and tie before." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves returned to McDonald's, grabbed 10 hamburgers and hailed a cab with the 
others. But when the cab got to the airport, only two of the buses were there. 
</P>
<P>
 The third had stopped by McDonald's to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'This may be the worst play I called all night,' " Reeves said. HEY 
BUDDY, ONE WORD -- DISGRACEFUL 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Sharpe, former UCLA star and one of the classiest athletes in pro sports, 
suffered what may have been a career-ending injury last week when he tore a 
major ligament in his right knee while playing tackle for Buddy Ryan's Arizona 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe has started at tackle for the Cardinals since 1982, and was the only 
remaining player on the Arizona roster who played in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 So what did Buddy say when asked later about injuries during the game? 
</P>
<P>
 "We ain't got anyone hurt that counts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe, a three-time Pro Bowl player, was furious afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stance on that is, basically, when idiots make idiotic statements, it's 
best not to comment," Sharpe said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he then commented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you are seriously injured, you are out there busting your butt, trying 
to win football games and you wake up Monday morning and read that," Sharpe 
said. "That adds insult to injury." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe added that no member of the team's front office or coaching staff had 
even called him since the injury. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * THE LEGEND LIVES: During Coach Barry Switzer's news conference after the 
Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving victory, a reporter with a foreign accent 
haltingly asked a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir," Switzer interrupted, "have you been drinking?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the press conference, several photographers asked Switzer for one last 
photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only if I can pose with a girl," he said, promptly grabbing a female reporter 
and draping his arm over her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 * OR, AS MANY AS THE RAMS GO THROUGH IN ONE SEASON: In his NFL career, Reggie 
White of the Green Bay Packers has sacked 55 different quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * BLOOD BATH: The last time the Pittsburgh Steelers visited the Raiders at the 
Coliseum, in 1990, a Steeler fan was beaten into a coma by Raider fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Steelers met the Raiders in Pittsburgh, last summer, Steeler 
Rod Woodson and Raider Jerry Ball were thrown out for fighting, and Steeler 
tackle Leon Searcy pulled the helmet off Raider defensive end Aundray Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 Said Searcy: "I'm pretty sure tempers will flare." 
</P>
<P>
 Said cornerback Deon Figures: "The (Raiders') mystique is not like it used to 
be. But I think the Raiders are trying to uphold the image. The preseason game 
was heated. I think this one will be even more heated." 
</P>
<P>
 * TOUGH ROAD: Before conceding AFC home-field advantage to the Steelers, note 
that they must play at the Coliseum and in San Diego in the final five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, the Steelers have won two of 13 games at West Coast sites and in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 * ON SECOND THOUGHT, THE STEELERS SHOULDN'T FEEL SO BAD: Forgive the Chicago 
Bears for being a tad worried about earning a playoff spot while playing their 
next three games on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 They haven't won a road game after Thanksgiving since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * BLESSING IN DISGUISE: Jeff Fisher, new coach of the Houston Oilers, was born 
with a birth defect that left him deaf in his right ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being deaf in one ear was beneficial in Philadelphia," Fisher said. "I'd make 
sure Buddy (Ryan) was standing on my right. I'd cover my left ear so I wouldn't 
have to listen to him." 
</P>
<P>
 * MORE FISHER: If you don't believe Fisher is facing an uphill climb with an 
undisciplined team, check this out: 
</P>
<P>
 In Fisher's debut against the New York Giants last week, receiver Webster 
Slaughter was so angry about being benched in the new two-receiver offense that 
he sneaked into the game without Fisher's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Slaughter said, but he could not stand there and watch an $898,000 
playing-time bonus disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm being brutalized," Slaughter said. "I had to insert myself a 
couple of times. Haywood (Jeffires) just came off the field. He shouldn't have 
been surprised because I told him what I was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fisher, "It sounds to me like Webster's more concerned with Webster than 
the team. I won't tolerate a player going into a game on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 * KNOCK IT OFF, GEEKS: During the first 20 minutes of business hours on a 
Wednesday, the Seattle Seahawk switchboard fielded 32 calls from fantasy 
football fans wondering if tailback Chris Warren was going to play that Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * TOUCHE: The Cowboys, fined $10,000 by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue for 
failing to list Troy Aikman's sore thumb on the injury report two weeks ago, 
submitted 26 names on the list this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one of those players played on Thanksgiving against the Packers, 
including three of the four who scored Cowboy touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * PRAYER OF THE WEEK: This was recited by the Chicago Bears' Chris Zorich to 
volunteers preparing to deliver 197 boxes of food to families in Chicago's poor 
south side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lord, let them be safe while driving in the 'hood." 
</P>
<P>
 * AND HE'S RIGHT: The Cowboys' Nate Newton, when asked if he thought they 
could continue winning with Rodney Peete or Jason Garrett at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey man," he said, pointing to a reporter, "we could win with you. "

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; BETTIS TO FACE TOUGH DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Charger defense has given up a league-low 3.2 yards a rush and stands 
second in the league, giving up 82 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not good news for Ram running back Jerome Bettis, who has hit the wall 
the last two weeks, having gained 42 yards in 25 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at this defense, I don't think we're going to get a lot of yards, but 
I think we can get the important yardage," Bettis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram running game will receive a boost with the return of guard Leo Goeas, 
who has been sidelined with an abdominal muscle strain. Darryl Ashmore had 
replaced Goeas, moving from tackle to guard in a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough defense to run on, but we've been working on it all week and 
we just have to keep linebacker Junior Seau from jumping into the gaps and 
getting into the backfield," Goeas said. "You don't want to let Seau get going 
and excite the crowd with that dance of his." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury update: Coach Chuck Knox said center Bern Brostek, who has had a leg 
problem, will be available for emergency duty, and cornerback Darryl Henley's 
sore hip will get a long look Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson sat out practice most of the week, but he said 
he's in better shape than at this time last week, when he went on to catch five 
passes for 99 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox said he will also wait until just before the game to determine if Chris 
Chandler's sprained ankle will let him work as No. 2 quarterback behind starter 
Chris Miller. T.J. SIMERS

COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; VIRGINIA'S LOSS CLOUDS ACC'S BOWL PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No. 13-ranked Virginia's top-rated rushing defense had given up only 56 yards 
a game, but North Carolina State freshman Tremayne Stephens rushed for 133 
yards, including 84 on a touchdown run that rallied the Wolfpack to a 30-27 
victory Friday at Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-quarter touchdown by Stephens, the first rusher this year to gain 
100 yards against Virginia, capped a wild game that further clouded the 
Atlantic Coast Conference's confusing bowl picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in front of scouts from the Sugar, Fiesta, Peach and Independence 
bowls, the Wolfpack, 8-3 overall and 6-2 in the ACC, clinched second place in 
the league behind Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all would have been easy, so easy," said Tom Fridena, a member of the 
Fiesta Bowl selection committee. "This really throws everything up in the air. 
It's very dusky and dusty now." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia (8-3, 5-3) was a two-touchdown favorite to defeat the Wolfpack, wrap 
up second place in the league and go to the Sugar, Fiesta or Cotton bowls. 
Instead, the Cavaliers had four turnovers and their defense gave up 
uncharacteristic big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia wound up in a third-place tie in the ACC with Duke and North Carolina 
and probably played itself out of the major bowl picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this team had a heck of a year," Virginia Coach George Welsh said. 
"If you had asked me in August would 8-3 have been a good season, I'd have said 
yes. Because we had a chance for a major bowl and didn't get it is no reason to 
be demoralized." 
</P>
<P>
 N.C. State trailed 6-0, 13-7, 19-7 and 25-24, but kept coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never be prouder of a group of men," N.C. State Coach Mike O'Cain 
said. "Very few people gave us a chance of beating them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia 48, Georgia Tech 10 -- The big story of this nonconference game at 
Athens, Ga., was that Bulldog quarterback Eric Zeier suffered a strained 
ligament in his right knee during the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia (6-4-1) qualified for a bowl and also handed Georgia Tech (1-10) its 
ninth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be ready for a bowl game," Zeier said. "I thought it was hurt a 
lot worse than it was. It's going to be fine. I'll be back in a couple of 
weeks. It's not that serious. It's not that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier passed for 115 yards and two touchdowns before he went down with 7:34 
left in the second quarter. He had completed a short pass when Tech's Elliott 
Fortune rolled into his right knee. He was helped from the field and later 
rolled to the locker room on a cart. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I was thinking probably wouldn't be printable," Georgia Coach Ray Goff 
said when he saw Zeier on the ground. "It was a big, big concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeier completed his regular-season career No. 3 on the NCAA pass yardage list 
with 11,153.

NEBRASKA WINS IT WITH DEFENSE; BIG EIGHT: OKLAHOMA OFFENSE UNABLE TO DO MUCH 
AND TOP-RANKED CORNHUSKERS IMPROVE TO 12-0 WITH 13-3 VICTORY. FRAZIER SITS IT 
OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oklahoma's defense played well enough to defeat No. 1 Nebraska and send Coach 
Gary Gibbs out a winner in his last regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sooners' offense had to go against an even better defense. The 
Cornhuskers dominated Oklahoma in the second half Friday and won, 13-3, setting 
them up for another shot at the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 There was talk before the game that, if needed, Nebraska quarterback Tommie 
Frazier could play for the first time since Sept. 24. But Brook Berringer 
played just well enough and the defense made sure Frazier could keep his jacket 
on, making 10 second-half points seem like twice that many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real proud of our defense, I thought they really carried the day," 
Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne said. "I looked at Tommie a few times. It was nice 
insurance to have him on the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
 In winning its fourth consecutive Big Eight title, Nebraska, 12-0 overall and 
7-0 in the conference, held Oklahoma to 47 yards in the second half and no 
first downs in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers' next game is Jan. 1 in the Orange Bowl, where they lost the 
national title to Florida State last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma (6-5, 4-3) played its best defensive game of the year in Gibbs' 
regular-season finale, holding Nebraska to its lowest point total of the 
season. The Sooners are expected to play in the Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was going to be low scoring," said Gibbs, who announced his 
resignation Monday. "You have to credit Nebraska because they controlled the 
ball so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "A game like this comes down to a few good plays and Nebraska is the one who 
made those plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest one came late in the third quarter. With the Cornhuskers facing 
third-and-10 at their 43, Berringer passed to Abdul Muhammad for a 44-yard gain 
to the Sooner 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Berringer scored on a one-yard sneak to make the score 
13-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "We caught 'em in man-to-man coverage," said Berringer, who completed 13 of 23 
for 166 yards. "I threw it where I was hoping he was going to be, and that's 
where he ended up." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska gave up 132 yards but only the one field goal in the first half, then 
contained Oklahoma in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nebraska's powerful offense didn't exactly have a field day, either. The 
Cornhuskers, who average 358 yards rushing and 494 overall per game, wound up 
with 136 on the ground and 302 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska gained only 63 yards in the first half and didn't make a first down 
in the second quarter. The Cornhuskers failed on a fake field goal early in the 
game and were hurt by inconsistent passing by Berringer, who also was sacked 
three times in the first half.

 Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair, nursing a pulled hamstring, hobbled 
into the NCAA I-AA playoffs Friday and saw his Heisman Trophy hopes crippled by 
a 63-20 first-round loss to No. 1-ranked and defending national champion 
Youngstown State. 
</P>

 McNair still set I-AA records with 52 completions in 82 attempts.But 514 
passing yards and three touchdowns weren't near enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I'm still in the hunt," McNair said of his Heisman chances. "A lot 
of things have been held against me all year. I can't worry about it. I have to 
go on and hope that everything works out for the best. I did all I could do 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngstown State forced seven turnovers as its defense scored or set up four 
touchdowns. The biggest were a 94-yard interception return by Leon Jones for a 
touchdown and a 95-yard fumble return by Randy Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a great defense. They're very aggressive," McNair said. "We just 
made too many mistakes. They put up the points they needed to put up." 
</P>
<P>
 McNair broke the I-AA records of 47 completions by Jamie Martin of Weber State 
in 1991 and 77 attempts by Neil Lomax of Portland State in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngstown State (11-0-1) set school records with its 63 points and nine 
touchdowns. Next Saturday, the Penguins will play host to the winner of today's 
Boston University-Eastern Kentucky game.

TECHNICALLY SPEAKING, TECH BACKS INTO THE COTTON BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas Tech formally accepted an invitation as the Southwest Conference's 
representative in the Cotton Bowl on Friday, a bittersweet reward after a 24-17 
loss to Texas Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 "A team with a 6-5 record shouldn't go to the Cotton Bowl," Tech defensive end 
Tony Daniels grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Tech clinched its first Cotton Bowl appearance since 1939 when Texas 
beat Baylor on Thursday, 63-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech, TCU, Baylor and Texas all have 4-3 SWC records and Rice (4-6, 3-3) can 
make it an unprecedented five-way tie with a victory today over Houston.  
</P>
<P>
 TCU, Baylor and Texas are all 7-4 overall, but Tech gets the Cotton Bowl bid 
because the other schools have all gone since Tech's last appearance. TCU might 
go to the Independence Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Knake led TCU over the Red Raiders with two touchdown passes to Jimmy 
Oliver. With TCU trailing, 17-16, Andre Davis ran nine yards for the winning 
score with 3:52 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, the SWC rushing champion, contributed 63 yards on the pivotal 69-yard 
scoring drive. He also bulled over for the two-point conversion.

ARIZONA RALLIES, THEN HOLDS OFF ARIZONA STATE; PACIFIC 10: SUN DEVILS' BAKER 
MISSES FIELD GOAL IN FINAL MINUTE AFTER WILDCATS' CARTER SUFFERS NECK INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, a field goal ruined Arizona State's season-ending quest against 
archrival Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Sun Devils fell a yard short of victory, the distance by which 
Jon Baker's 47-yard field goal was wide right with 28 seconds remaining, 
allowing No. 16 Arizona to eke out a 28-27 comeback victory Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice before since 1983, Arizona beat ASU with late field goals and another 
time a late kick pulled the Wildcats back to a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan White engineered two late scoring drives to overcome Arizona's 12-point, 
27-15 fourth-quarter deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, 8-3 overall and 6-2 in the Pacific 10, tied USC for second place 
in the conference. Arizona State (3-8, 2-6) finished its worst season since 
going 2-7-2 in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 A neck injury to Arizona's career rushing leader, Ontiwaun Carter, seemed to 
inspire his teammates -- especially backup Gary Taylor and tight end Lamar 
Harris. Both scored fourth-quarter touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter injured his neck in the third quarter and the game was delayed for 
about 15 minutes as he lay immobilized. Officials at University Medical Center, 
where he was taken by ambulance, said X-rays proved negative and that Carter 
had a sprained neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter rushed 12 times for 25 yards before his injury, finishing the regular 
season with 1,163 yards. He has 3,457 career rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Twan has meant so much to us," Harris said. "If we all had the heart he 
has, we'd be going to the Rose Bowl this year. But we showed ourselves that we 
have a lot of heart too. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' four-yard touchdown reception with 3:54 left provided Arizona with the 
winning margin.

<P>
 Stanford will hold a news conference Monday or Tuesday, announcing whether 
Bill Walsh will remain as football coach or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors and press accounts have swirled in the Bay Area this week, some friends 
of Walsh having said he'll resign. Some of his players have met with Stanford 
Athletic Director Ted Leland.  
</P>
<P>
 In Walsh's first year back at Stanford in 1992, the Cardinal was 10-3, but he 
has had two losing seasons since, this year's team having gone 3-7-1. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one rumor, Walsh will resign if his offensive coordinator, Terry 
Shea, is named to replace him. EARL GUSTKEY

MATER DEI DEFEATS LOYOLA, 31-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei posted a decisive 31-7 victory over Los Angeles Loyola in a Southern 
Section Division I quarterfinal football game Friday night at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3-ranked Mater Dei (12-0) advanced to the semifinals to play No. 2 Los 
Alamitos, a 7-0 winner over Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Monarchs started slowly, a crowd of 7,500 watched Mater Dei dominate 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei running back Steve Bodnar rushed for 102 yards in 20 carries, and 
also scored a touchdown. Fullback Joey Trampush scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei quarterback John Flynn completed 12 of 19 passes for 228 yards with 
a touchdown and an interception. Wide receiver Rod Perry caught three passes 
for 107 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Monarchs limited the Cubs (8-3) to 73 yards in the first half 
as they built a 17-0 lead. Cornerback Kevin Braga intercepted two passes for 
Mater Dei, which held Loyola to three second-half first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's longest play from scrimmage came late in the fourth quarter when 
guard Robert Quigley ran for 47 yards on a "fumblerooski" play. But for the 
most part, the Monarchs kept Loyola in check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mater Dei is a physical team," Loyola Coach Steve Grady said. "They have the 
size up front, and the talent at the skill positions . . . that combination is 
tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn cashed in Braga's first interception, moving the Monarchs 84 yards in 
five plays for a score with less than five minutes remaining in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A 49-yard bomb from Flynn to Perry moved Mater Dei deep into Loyola territory, 
and Perry capped the drive when he split two Loyola defenders on a post pattern 
and Flynn found him for a 21-yard touchdown pass play with 1:43 left in the 
half and a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our pass defense was one of our strengths," Grady said. "But 
(Flynn) kept making the big pass play against us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Vanis tried to help the Cubs bounce back in the second half. After 
quarterback Kyle Spielbuehler connected with Dan Farmer for a 39-yard pass 
play, Vanis scored on a three-yard touchdown run one play later to make it 17-7 
with 5:17 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monarchs responded with a 12-play drive covering 75 yards, with 
Trampush scoring on a one-yard run with one second remaining in the third 
quarter to make it 24-7.

COLLEGE HOCKEY; GOALTENDER CARRIES MAINE PAST UPSTART IRISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Maine Black Bears used tight defensive play and 28 saves from goaltender 
Blair Allison to overcome Notre Dame, 4-1, Friday in the opening game of the 
sixth annual Great Western Freeze-Out at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish (3-9), who finished eighth in the Central Collegiate Hockey Assn. 
last season, caught undefeated Maine (9-0-3) off guard early with hustling 
defense and aggressive checking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They outplayed us and outworked us and our goaltender won the game for us," 
said Maine Coach Shawn Walsh, whose team will face Boston University in the 
championship game Sunday afternoon. "We had no focus at the beginning and Notre 
Dame jumped us early." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Boston University (7-1-2) rolled to 6-2 victory against 
overmatched Princeton (2-5) after taking a quick 3-0 first-quarter lead in a 
penalty-filled contest. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the Irish grit on display, Notre Dame never led and could only tie the 
game briefly in the third period before the Black Bears' Shawn Wansborough gave 
Maine the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a couple of slick goal-scorers on our side the game would have been 
ours," Notre Dame Coach Ric Schafer said. "Scoring is a problem that continues 
to plague us."

DIAMOND BAR OUSTS WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even highly regarded wide receiver Billy Miller could have completed the 
connection that knocked Westlake High out of the Southern Section Division III 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors led by three points when a bad snap sailed over the head of 
punter Brian Shubin early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays after Shubin covered the ball for a 21-yard loss, tailback Lathian 
Tyler scored on a seven-yard run for the go-ahead touchdown that helped Diamond 
Bar stun top-seeded Westlake, 25-16, Friday night at Walnut High. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler scored again on a three-yard run with just over one minute remaining to 
cap a six-minute drive that clinched it for the Brahmas. He finished with 59 
yards in 20 carries. The Diamond Bar option attack accounted for 195 rushing 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave us fits," Westlake coach Jim Benkert said. "We don't see a lot of it 
but missed some responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar (9-3) also controlled a Warrior (10-2) offense that averaged 
nearly 400 yards a game. Quarterback Scott Spruill completed 11 of 22 passes 
for 150 yards, but Miller was held to 58 yards in his five receptions. MICHAEL

COMMENTARY; REEVES WAS WRONG ABOUT SIMMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in his life, Dan Reeves won't shut up. He won't shut up 
about the quarterbacks he still has with the New York Giants, neither of whom 
is a sure thing to last, and he won't shut up about Phil Simms, the quarterback 
he fired.  
</P>
<P>
 Reeves was in the newspaper the other day, talking about the decision he and 
George Young, the Giants' general manager, made to cut Simms in June. Reeves 
talked about how Simms -- coming off winter surgery on his right shoulder -- 
couldn't throw the ball to anybody except running backs in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any question it was the right decision, given what I 
had to base the decision on," Reeves was quoted as saying. "Because nobody 
could tell me right now -- and Phil can sit there and tell you, 'Yeah, I can 
play' -- but Phil hadn't thrown passes any day in practice or thrown it 40 or 
50 yards downfield or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves tells us that Simms, coming off one of the great seasons of his life, 
was too much of a physical risk, even though Simms is a horse who had come back 
from everything in his Giant career. The Giants also saw him as a financial 
risk because he had a $2.5-million salary, and the NFL's salary cap was 
squeezing.  
</P>
<P>
 Reeves and Young made a terrible decision with Simms. They got away with it at 
the time only because they were coming off a terrific season, and because Simms 
was willing to play the role of Good Giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Simms is no longer so inclined.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would have been 100% by training camp," he said. "I have absolutely no 
doubt about that. Was I throwing the ball to running backs? Sure I was. But 
each day, I was feeling better than I did the day before. I could feel myself 
getting stronger, the way you do when you're rehabbing something. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I felt like I was ready to throw the ball in some drills, I told 
(Reeves) that. He said, 'No, no, no.' And I thought, boy, they're really being 
careful, they're really treating me nice. Well, that wasn't the case at all. I 
never got another chance to play and they released me." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves was coach of the year in the NFL last season, and deserved the award. 
Nobody would have called him a genius if Simms had not been one of the most 
effective quarterbacks in the sport. Did Simms turn 38 during the season? He 
sure did. He also was still standing at the finish. The Giants played 18 games 
and Simms started all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Reeves says it was unusual for Simms to make it through a whole season in 
one piece. Well, if Simms' condition was such a concern to the Giants, they 
should have let Simms go and signed Jeff Hostetler. Hostetler is younger, and 
Reeves wouldn't be in the fix he is now, offering so many explanations about 
his quarterbacks past and present.  
</P>
<P>
 Simms threw a lot of touchdown passes, for Reeves and everybody else who 
coached him. He put the Giants back in the playoffs last season. He helped 
Reeves become coach of the year. Reeves now acts as if the team had no choice 
but to shove Simms out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget how far Simms could throw the ball in June. Forget training camp. If 
Simms couldn't have shown up until a month ago, it would be a better season for 
the Giants.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; PRESEASON NO.1 ARKANSAS LOSES OPENER TO 
MASSACHUSETTS, 104-80 
</P>

<P>
 As decisively as Arkansas was the preseason choice for No. 1, so were the 
Razorbacks handled by third-ranked Massachusetts on Friday night in the Tipoff 
Classic at Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts beat the defending national champions every way possible -- up 
and down the floor, on the boards, in the halfcourt offense and especially on 
the scoreboard, 104-80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very proud the way my team responded," Minutemen Coach John Calipari 
said. "They showed no fear. I never want to play Arkansas again, ever. Today we 
were better. Today. Today." 
</P>
<P>
 The marquee individual matchup at forward also went Massachusetts' way in 
convincing fashion. Lou Roe finished with 34 points and 13 rebounds while 
Corliss Williamson, the leading vote-getter on the AP preseason All-America 
team, had a lackluster performance, scoring 15 points on four-of-11 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Arizona 107, Alaska Anchorage 88 -- Joseph Blair worked inside for 23 
points and Damon Stoudamire added 20 from the perimeter as Arizona overpowered 
Alaska Anchorage in the Great Alaska Shootout's consolation round at Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats led by 12 at the half, then blew the game open on Blair's work 
inside. Arizona got its advantage up to 29 points midway through the second 
half before Coach Lute Olson emptied his bench. Jarvis Kelley scored 18 points 
and Ray Owes had 14 for Arizona (1-1), which lost to Minnesota, 72-70, on 
Thursday in a first-round game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Duke 80, Brown 38 -- Duke's three freshmen helped ignite a 17-point 
second-half run as the Blue Devils recorded their 89th consecutive 
nonconference victory in Cameron Indoor Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's NCAA runner-ups won their 13th consecutive season opener, forcing 
15 first-half turnovers and then wearing down Brown in the first 10 minutes of 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Florida 73, Stetson 64 -- With center Dametri Hill on the bench for the 
final night of a two-game suspension, Florida struggled against Stetson at 
Gainesville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Cross scored 27 points and helped the Gators come back from an 11-point 
first-half deficit.  
</P>
<P>
 No. 16 Connecticut 110, Lafayette 48 -- Ray Allen scored 23 points and Brian 
Fair had 21 as Connecticut went out to a big early lead and cruised over 
Lafayette in a season opener at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, expected to pick up the slack because last year's leader, Donyell 
Marshall, opted to go into the NBA, had 13 points in the first half. Point 
guard Kevin Ollie finished with 14 points and Donny Marshall had 13 as UConn 
shot 47% in the first half to open a 59-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Oklahoma State 75, Jackson State 57 -- Bryant Reeves scored 23 points 
to lead Oklahoma State in a Great Alaska Shootout consolation-round game. 
Reeves, a 7-foot center, scored his team's first nine points and 13 of its 
first 16 en route to 19 points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nelson had 12 points and nine rebounds and Randy Rutherford added 11 
points for the Cowboys (1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 23 Ohio 84, New Mexico State 80 -- MVP Gary Trent, who led all scorers 
with 33 points, made up for a blunder in the last half-minute of regulation, 
dominating the overtime in the championship game of the Preseason NIT at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, George Washington defeated Memphis, 69-60, in the consolation game. 
AROUND THE NATION 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Lopez, one of the most highly regarded freshmen in the country, had 12 
points, eight rebounds, five assists and four steals to help St. John's beat 
Dartmouth, 93-63, in the first round of the Lapchick Tournament at New York. . 
. . Danya Abrams scored six of his game-high 20 points during a 22-0 first-half 
run as Boston College had its 21st consecutive season-opening victory with a 
97-60 rout of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at Newton, Mass. The loss spoiled the 
Mustangs' inaugural game in Division I. . . . Bryant Boston scored 19 points as 
the Washington easily defeated Eastern Washington, 64-48, at Seattle. . . . 
Robbie Reid scored 17 points and Russell Larson added 14 to pace a balanced 
Brigham Young attack as the Cougars beat Louisville, 75-60, in the semifinals 
of the Great Alaska Shootout. The Cardinals whittled an 11-point lead to three, 
60-57, with about three minutes left. But the Louisville offense stalled as the 
Cougars scored 15 of the game's final 18 points.

NBA ROUNDUP; MAVERICKS LEARN WHILE WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The young, improving Dallas Mavericks won another game and learned another 
lesson in the process Friday night at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 After wasting most of a 25-point lead, the Mavericks survived a furious 
fourth-quarter rally by the Portland Trail Blazers to win, 101-91. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't slack off in this league, no matter what kind of a lead you have," 
said Jim Jackson, who scored 19 of his 31 points in the third quarter as the 
Mavericks built an 85-60 advantage early in the fourth quarter. "It's good for 
us to learn that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn added 27 points. The Mavericks (5-4) didn't win their fifth 
game last season until Feb. 24, their 54th game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 96, Washington 94 -- Tyrone Hill said his inspiration had nothing to 
do with his matchup against Chris Webber. Cleveland Coach Mike Fratello thought 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Hill's numbers were impressive: 25 points, 16 rebounds, two 
assists and a blocked shot in the Cavaliers' victory at Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber had 13 points and a team-high eight rebounds in 31 minutes. It was his 
second game and first start with the Bullets since being traded from Golden 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 124, Boston 118 -- Shaquille O'Neal scored 36 points, Anfernee 
Hardaway scored 35 and the Magic used a third-quarter surge to win their sixth 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal triggered the Magic's comeback in Boston from a 10-point deficit with 
just over six minutes remaining in the third period. He then went to the bench 
and watched his teammates go on a 29-8 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 124, Chicago 94 -- Karl Malone scored 27 points and Felton Spencer added 
19 points and 11 rebounds at Salt Lake City as the Jazz handed the Bulls their 
worst loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago was led by Scottie Pippen with 15 points in 28 minutes. Greg Foster, 
starting in place of the injured Will Perdue, scored 13, as did Dickey 
Simpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 111, Milwaukee 106 -- Rik Smits scored 11 of his season-high 30 points 
in the fourth quarter as the Pacers rallied to beat the Bucks at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave Indiana a 7-3 record, its best start since opening the 
1980-81 season by winning eight of its first 11 games. Todd Day scored a 
career-high 31 points to lead Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 109, Minnesota 71 -- The 76ers set a club record for fewest 
points allowed in defeating the Timberwolves at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in franchise history that the 76ers had held an opponent 
below 75 points. Only a tip-in by Donyell Marshall with less than a second to 
play kept the Timberwolves from surpassing their low-point total of 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 111, Detroit 97 -- The Heat broke a five-game road losing streak and won 
for the third time this season as Kevin Willis scored a season-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive victory for the Heat, which has also won its 
last four games at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 114, San Antonio 94 -- Gary Payton scored 21 points and Detlef 
Schrempf added 20 as the SuperSonics rolled over the Spurs. Seattle took a 25-4 
lead to begin the game at San Antonio, and the Spurs could get no closer than 
eight points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 108, Denver 105 -- Mitch Richmond scored seven of his 33 points in 
overtime as the Kings rallied from a 16-point third-quarter deficit at 
Sacramento.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; WHITTINGHAM'S MASTERY ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Whittingham has "owned" a lot of races in his brilliant career, and, 
at 81, he retains his firm grip on the Matriarch. 
</P>
<P>
 A fixture on the Hollywood Park fall stakes schedule since 1981, Sunday's 
$400,000 race is the final major turf event of the year for fillies and mares. 
Only once in this decade has Whittingham not won the Matriarch. His Royal Touch 
finished eighth and her stablemate Petalia was 10th in 1990, behind longshot 
winner Countus In. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the Grade I has belonged to Whittingham and he also closed out the 
'80s successfully when Claire Marine clicked. All told, he has won the race 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Hall of Fame trainer is to keep his hot streak going, however, he will 
have to do so with a different weapon from the one he has wielded the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time Eclipse Award champion Flawlessly is gone, having been retired a 
month ago. The Affirmed mare started her roll with a victory over Fire The 
Groom in 1991, beat Super Staff in a stakes record 1:46 the following year, 
then in 1993 out-battled Toussaud by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittingham will be trying this time around with Aube Indienne, a 4-year-old, 
French-bred daughter of Bluebird. 
</P>
<P>
 She certainly is no Flawlessly, but Aube Indienne hasn't lost since joining 
Whittingham's barn. She upset Corrazona in the Las Palmas Handicap, then 
followed that with a half-length victory in the $400,000 Yellow Ribbon during 
the Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita.  
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne doesn't have anyone recalling some of the great female grass 
champions of the past, but a solid case could be made for her regarding the 
Eclipse Award were she to win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 That would give her two Grade I successes to close the year, one more than 
Hatoof, the leading candidate. However, Hatoof has run against better 
competition. Among her victims in the Beverly D. was Flawlessly and she was 
also second to Tikkanen in the Breeders' Cup Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight fillies and mares will oppose Aube Indienne, who drew the rail.  
</P>
<P>
 Alywow will make her Hollywood Park debut in the Matriarch and the 3-year-old 
Alysheba filly has had a productive year. 
</P>
<P>
 She has won three of eight starts and most recently was second to Raintrap in 
the Rothmans International. Mike Smith, the leading money-winner in the 
country, will be in to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange will make her first start on the turf since finishing last in the 
Gamely Handicap on May 30, 1993 and will also try to go over $1 million in 
earnings. Claimed for $50,000 by trainer Bill Spawr for owners Sid and Jenny 
Craig, Exchange has 13 victories in 27 starts and $929,950 in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The other stakes on the card and the final event in Hollywood Park's 
$1.8-million Autumn Turf Festival is the inaugural Hollywood Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150,000 race drew a field of six and will mark the return of Hollywood 
Gold Cup winner Slew Of Damascus. The Slewacide gelding has been idle since 
finishing a distant fourth in the Pacific Classic Aug. 13 at Del Mar. Chris 
McCarron will ride Slew Of Damascus, who has five victories in nine starts on 
the turf. His opponents are Inner City, Firm Pledge, Rapan Boy, 
Ventiquattrofogli and Romarin. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 All starters in the Matriarch will carry 123 pounds except for the 
3-year-olds, Alywow, Wandesta and Las Meninas, who will carry 120. . . . The 
race will be televised nationally by ESPN. It will be run as the seventh on the 
card and post time is 3:45 p.m. . . . In today's $250,000 Generous Stakes, 
Perfect, the 2-year-old brother of Flawlessly, is a 4-1 choice. . . . Jockey 
Pat Valenzuela, who returned to action Thursday after having been sidelined 
since Oct. 6, didn't ride Friday night and isn't expected to ride today or 
Sunday after suffering a deep bruise on his right thigh when unseated by Ataboy 
Chad in Thursday's ninth race.

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I; MATER DEI GIVES FANS WHAT 
THEY WANT BY ROUTING LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei helped to give Orange County its dream semifinal matchup by posting 
a 31-7 victory over Los Angeles Loyola in a Southern Section Division I 
quarterfinal football game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Mater Dei (12-0) advanced to play Los Alamitos, a 7-0 winner 
over Long Beach Poly. Los Alamitos and Mater Dei have been ranked Nos. 1 and 2 
in Orange County for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mater Dei started slowly, a crowd of 7,500 at Cerritos College watched 
the third-seeded Monarchs dissect Loyola, piece by piece. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground, Mater Dei running back Steve Bodnar rushed for 102 yards and a 
touchdown in 20 carries. Fullback Joey Trampush scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the air, Mater Dei quarterback John Flynn completed 12 of 19 passes 
for 228 yards and a touchdown with one interception. Wide receiver Rod Perry 
caught three passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Monarchs limited the Cubs (8-3) to 73 yards in the first half 
as they built a 17-0 lead. Cornerback Kevin Braga intercepted two passes for 
Mater Dei, which held Loyola to three second-half first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's longest play from scrimmage came late in the fourth quarter when 
guard Robert Quigley ran for 47 yards on a fumblerooski play. But for the most 
part, the Monarchs kept Loyola in check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mater Dei is a physical football team," Loyola Coach Steve Grady said. "They 
have the size up front, and the talent at the skill positions. . . . That 
combination is tough to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn cashed in Braga's first interception, moving the Monarchs 84 yards in 
five plays for a score with less than five minutes remaining in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A 49-yard pass from Flynn to Perry moved Mater Dei deep into Loyola territory. 
Perry capped the drive when he split two Loyola defenders on a post pattern and 
Flynn found him for a 21-yard touchdown pass with 1 minutes 43 seconds 
remaining in the half and a 17-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our pass defense was one of our strengths," Grady said. "But 
(Flynn) kept making the big pass play against us, consistently, and big play 
after big play finally got to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Vanis, who gained 40 yards in 12 carries, tried to help the Cubs bounce 
back in the second half. After quarterback Kyle Spielbuehler connected with Dan 
Farmer for a 39-yard pass play, Vanis scored on a three-yard touchdown run one 
play later to make it 17-7 with 5:17 remaining in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Monarchs responded with a 12-play drive covering 75 yards, with 
Trampush scoring from one yard with one second remaining in the third quarter 
to make it 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as balanced as we've been," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "The 
offense will get all of the accolades tonight, but I thought our defense did a 
great job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs intercepted three passes and forced Loyola to turn the ball over 
on downs twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei also dominated in time of possession, keeping the ball for 29:34. 
Mater Dei's second-half time of possession edge over Loyola was nearly two to 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 With Flynn keeping the Cubs honest through the air, Bodnar did the majority of 
the pounding. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran through Loyola tacklers all night. On Bodnar's final carry of the game, 
on fourth and goal at the three, he stiff-armed Steve Dunne, a second-team 
All-Del Rey League defensive back, and bounced outside for the game's final 
touchdown, making it 31-7 with 8:24 remaining.

NCAA WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIPS; BRUINS WIN, FACE NO. 1 STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Guy Baker savored this victory for, oh, about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his UCLA water polo team defeated Pepperdine, 8-7, in an 
overtime game at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach, Baker was reminded whom he plays 
today -- No. 1 Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great. That's our prize," Baker said. Then he added with a laugh: "Maybe 
they'll be overconfident." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford -- which is 25-1 and dominated Air Force, 20-4, in its first-round 
game -- has beaten UCLA four times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifth-seeded UCLA knew it was not getting any easy games. But the first one 
was hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, 15-9 and seeded fourth, had a 6-5 lead late in the fourth quarter. 
But UCLA tied the score with nine seconds left when Adam Krikorian found Corbin 
Graham open near the goal for a tip-in score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first overtime -- in water polo there are two three-minute overtimes 
and then a sudden-death period if needed -- UCLA took a 7-6 lead. However, 
Pepperdine tied the score early in the second overtime when Pepperdine's Alan 
Herrman beat two defenders at the two-meter position and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Luther Weidner tried to do the same two possessions later. His 
back-hand shot drifted weakly toward the goal, but it was enough to break the 
plane and count, and UCLA led with 36 seconds left. Pepperdine turned the ball 
over in the ensuing possession and UCLA (17-12) advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games, second-seeded USC beat seventh-seeded Navy, 15-5, and 
third-seeded California defeated sixth-seeded Massachusetts, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (18-6) jumped out to a 7-0 lead early in the second quarter and was not 
seriously threatened. Uzi Hadar and Hrovje Cizmic each scored goals for the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 For California, Mike Sparling and Brent Albright each had three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's semifinals, Stanford will play UCLA at 6:30 p.m. and USC will play 
California at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation semifinals, Air Force (18-10) will play Pepperdine at 2:30 
p.m. and Massachusetts will play Navy (25-6) at 4 p.m.

BOXING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; FIGHTERS WILL LOSE OUT ON PROP. 187 REACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It came as quite a shock last week when a boxing organization, of all 
institutions, tried to take the moral high ground on an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember boxing. The sport of back-room deals and cutthroat rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 You wanted to believe the World Boxing Council had its heart in the right 
place when its president, Jose Sulaiman, ordered from Mexico City headquarters 
a ban on WBC title fights in California through March 30 to protest the passage 
of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 That measure, if implemented, will cut off education, welfare and 
non-emergency health care to the state's estimated 1.7 million illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The WBC also promised a two-year suspension for any Mexican national fighting 
in California in that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulaiman equated the passage of Prop. 187 with apartheid in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 However well intended, the WBC sanctions smack of political posturing, a 
public play to stoke the emotions of an already red-hot issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Bob Arum called the WBC's declarations "demagoguery." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the sanctions are toothless. First, there probably will not be any WBC 
title bouts in California before March 30. The state has staged only eight WBC 
title fights in the last three years, four involving Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the WBC left a window of opportunity, a Nov. 22 deadline, for 
promoters to pre-book matches for the WBC's boycott period. 
</P>
<P>
 The WBC, in conjunction with the Mexican Boxing Commission, obviously wanted 
to make a point about its disgust for California politics. 
</P>
<P>
 It has that right. 
</P>
<P>
 But who, ultimately, do WBC sanctions hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican nationals and the venues that promote them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand why the WBC would want to call attention to its position on 187, 
to get their opinion voiced," John Jackson, vice president of Forum Boxing, 
said. "I disagree with the WBC and the Mexican commission that Mexican fighters 
should boycott fights in California. So much of their revenues comes through 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Forum Boxing, which conducts twice-monthly cards, has been a springboard for 
many Mexican fighters or those of Mexican heritage, including current champions 
Gonzalez and Genaro Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard DeCuir, executive officer with the California State Athletic 
Commission, said the WBC's salvo hit the wrong target. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kids that get hurt the most," DeCuir said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCuir said Mexicans who cross the border to fight do so for good reason. 
Whereas a fighter might earn as little as $5 a round in Mexico, the minimum in 
California is $100. Plus, the promoters pay travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be curious to see how many Mexican fighters, the majority of whom are 
not stars, defy the WBC boycott in pursuit of larger paychecks. Privately, some 
worry that if Prop. 187 is upheld in court, Mexican fighters will be scared off 
and boxing in the state will dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is divided.  
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Ruelas, WBC junior lightweight champion, was born in Mexico and moved 
to California when he was 7. He supports the sanctions that prohibit him from 
fighting in his home state because of his personal disgust for the passage of 
Prop. 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, it affects me," Ruelas said of the boycott. "I'm the WBC champ. But 
it affects the people more than me. I'd rather it affects me. If I had the 
power, like Sulaiman, to make the decision, I would have to make that 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas has his green card but worries about a younger brother who does not -- 
a brother other than Rafael, the IBF lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 DeCuir suggests everyone take a deep breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187, even if upheld in court, would not affect the way Mexican fighters 
do business in California. 
</P>
<P>
 No taxpayer dollars are spent on fighters who need medical attention in 
California. DeCuir said promoters are required to provide medical insurance for 
their boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, boxers do not need to show proof of citizenship to get licenses to fight 
legally in the state. The state commission recently sent Sulaiman a letter 
expressing its displeasure concerning the WBC's stance. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, commission Chairman W. E. Eastman said, "I understand your 
desire to make a political statement. It has been made and it has been reported 
in the media. However, it has not been particularly well received. This is 
primarily because Californians would not presume to tell Mexico's government or 
citizens how their taxes should be spent." 
</P>
<P>
 DeCuir followed up with a phone call to Sulaiman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, until the courts can determine if 187 is constitutional, 
anything the WBC does or the commission does is premature," DeCuir said. 
"That's what I discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 There are indications that Sulaiman might be willing to tone down his original 
comments and at least wait until the 187 dust clears. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a welcome proposition. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 James Toney, the aftermath: 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Kallen, Toney's manager, had feared the day her fighter would lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "James is the type of guy who would rather die than lose," she once said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Toney lost a unanimous decision to Roy Jones Jr. on Nov. 18 in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, Toney was on a police blotter in suburban Detroit for 
allegedly wielding a gun and threatening to kill Kallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, he only fired Kallen, and no charges were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone surprised by the incident does not understand Toney's volatile nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum, Toney's promoter, thinks the rift will blow over and blames it mostly on 
Toney's weight problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney had to lose 40 pounds to make the fight's 168-pound limit. Why would 
someone poised for the biggest fight of his life allow his weight to get so out 
of control? 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an eating disorder," Arum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum said Toney took diuretics to lose weight and after the weigh-in required 
an injection to rehydrate his body. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Toney (44-1-2) vows never to fight at 168 again. Apparently, Kallen 
incensed Toney by suggesting he stay at 168 because they could make more money 
in the division. Toney had a rematch clause with Jones in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Toney's super-middleweight days are over. Arum said the goal is to 
get Toney a few cable television fights and set him up for a light-heavyweight 
title bout down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum said Kallen and Toney will honor their contract with Top Rank, but it 
remains to be seen whether Kallen will return to Toney's corner. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Levin, Roy Jones Jr.'s adviser, said the new International Boxing 
Federation super-middleweight champion will return to the gym in mid-January 
and possibly fight in February or March, possibly against Nigel Benn of 
Britain, the World Boxing Council champion, or the winner of the Vinny 
Pazienza-Roberto Duran bout. Jones also has threatened to return to the 
middleweight division to reclaim the IBF belt he vacated to fight Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect Jones and promoter Bob Arum to be doing business again soon. 
Jones took some parting shots at the Top Rank boss after the Toney fight. 
Levin, who said the Toney-Jones card Arum promoted was "a nightmare," said 
Jones will never sign a long-term deal with any promoter. Levin said of Arum, 
"I despise the man." 
</P>
<P>
 The WBC rejected Terry Norris' appeal for his Nov. 12 loss in Mexico City to 
Luis Santana to be ruled no contest. Norris was stripped of his 
super-welterweight crown for throwing a punch to the back of Santana's head in 
the fifth round. Santana, a 34-year-old Dominican, was taken away on a 
stretcher. Joe Sayatovich, Norris' manager, maintains Santana was faking. The 
appeal denied, Norris has now petitioned the WBC for a mandatory rematch with 
Santana.

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I; MUSTANGS DOMINATE JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confronted with one of those uncomfortable situations that test one's mettle, 
Chad Collins listened attentively to the impromptu sideline lecture Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, Trabuco Hills senior quarterback, was visibly dejected after his 
miscues led to turnovers in the Mustangs' first two possessions against Long 
Beach Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Jim Barnett didn't have time to lament the situation -- and he 
wasn't going to let his signal-caller, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me to get my head in the game," Collins said. "He told me to have 
faith in myself and my teammates, and everything would be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Give the kid credit for being a quick study. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins rebounded in a big way, throwing three touchdown passes in leading the 
Mustangs to an impressive 35-8 victory over Jordan in the second round of the 
Southern Section Division I playoffs in front of approximately 700 at Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals, the Mustangs (10-2) will play Bishop Amat (12-0), which 
defeated Fontana, 20-0, in another second-round game. Bishop Amat is ranked 
first in the state by Cal-Hi Sports and No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to enjoy this one for a little bit," Barnett said. "I'm not going 
to think about Bishop Amat, at least not until (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins is the key reason Barnett has such things to ponder at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally one-half of the Mustangs' two-pronged quarterback attack that also 
features fellow senior J.C. Pintsak, Collins had to play the entire game 
because Pintsak is suffering from a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins threw an interception in the game's opening possession and fumbled a 
snap from center, which the Panthers recovered, the second time Trabuco Hills 
had the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Collins' problems ended there. He completed 13 of 15 passes for 250 
yards and three touchdowns with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the advantages of having two good quarterbacks," Barnett said. 
"One of the negatives is that you have to try to play them both, but a positive 
is that you always have someone who can get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 10 of 11 passes for 165 yards in the first half. Running back De 
Sha Runnels helped give the Mustangs a 7-0 lead with a three-yard touchdown run 
with 10 minutes 20 seconds remaining before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins then teamed with Runnels on a six-yard touchdown pass to help Trabuco 
Hills take a 14-0 lead into halftime. Collins was equally solid in the second 
half, connecting on three of his four attempts for 85 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 His 58-yard touchdown pass to junior tight end Ben Triman helped give Trabuco 
Hills a 21-0 lead with 1:37 remaining in the third quarter. After senior 
tailback Bobby Johnson (eight carries, 100 yards) helped put the Mustangs 
ahead, 28-0, with a 60-yard touchdown run, Collins threw 10 yards to senior 
wide receiver Bryan Flournoy (four catches, 110 yards) to help Trabuco Hills 
take a 35-0 lead with 8:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (8-4) lost three fumbles and failed to score three times from 
inside the Mustangs' 10-yard line. Junior quarterback Ortege Jenkins' 43-yard 
pass to Joe Hughes put the Panthers on the scoreboard with 4:27 remaining. They 
also combined to cap the scoring with a two-point conversion pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmad Jackson led the Moore League-champion Panthers (8-4) in rushing with 100 
yards in 14 carries. LeJuan Gibbons had 91 yards in nine carries.

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; BAD SNAP ON PUNT HELPS DIAMOND BAR KNOCK 
OFF TOP-SEEDED WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even Billy Miller would have been able to complete the connection that 
knocked Westlake out of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors led by three points, when a bad snap sailed two feet over the 
head of punter Brian Shubin early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays after Shubin covered the ball for a 21-yard loss, tailback Lathian 
Tyler scored on a seven-yard run for the go-ahead touchdown as Diamond Bar 
stunned top-seeded Westlake, 25-16, Friday night at Walnut High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler scored on a three-yard run with about one minute remaining to cap a 
six-minute drive and seal the victory for the Brahmas. He finished with 59 
yards in 20 carries. The Diamond Bar option attack accounted for 195 rushing 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave us fits," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said. "We don't see a lot of it 
but we missed some responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar (9-3) also controlled a Warrior offense that averaged nearly 400 
yards a game. Quarterback Scott Spruill completed 11 of 22 passes for 150 
yards, but Miller was held to 58 yards on his five receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake rushing attack was held to 129 yards, 36 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar quarterback Erik Stidham completed nine of 20 passes for 142 yards 
and ran for 83 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a lot of film on Westlake and we thought they weren't going to be able 
to handle the option well," Stidham said. "After the bad snap we knew we would 
put points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Warriors (10-2) came into game with a balanced attack, Westlake 
depended mostly on the run to build its early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jamal Harris' 39-yard run on the opening play of the game set up 
Spruill's one-yard sneak.  
</P>
<P>
 Junior Steve Alysworth returned a punt 47 yards to the Diamond Bar 27-yard 
line to set up the second score. Fullback Craig Wallendy scored on a one-yard 
dive five plays later for a 13-0 lead late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors missed the extra point after being penalized 15 yards for 
celebrating the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas came back on the passing and running of Stidham. Diamond Bar drove 
72 yards in nine plays, scoring on a two-yard run by Stidham. MICHAEL LAZARUS

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION VII; LOMPOC SHUTS DOWN SUNNY 
HILLS, 28-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sunny Hills was unable to stop Lompoc's potent running game and lost, 28-0, in 
the second round of the Division VII playoffs Friday night at Buena Park High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (5-7) were dominated on both sides of the ball. They had had zero 
yards rushing, only 110 yards passing and three first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lompoc is a very physical team," Sunny Hills Coach Tim Devaney said. "We 
haven't played a team any better than them all year." 
</P>
<P>
 The third-seeded Braves (11-1) took the lead on their first possession of the 
game. Senior running back Ed Wynn ran 54 yards on the Braves' sixth play from 
scrimmage to make it 7-0 with 9 minutes 32 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc's defense then buckled down, and didn't allow Sunny Hills past midfield 
the entire first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Braves quarterback Nick Terrones made his only mistake of the first half on 
the first play of the second quarter when his pass was intercepted by senior 
Eric Hernandez at the Lancers' 44-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrones rebounded late in the quarter, connecting on a nine-yard touchdown 
pass to Wynn for a 13-0 lead with 1:53 left. Lompoc got the ball back before 
halftime, but Ray Hirzel missed on a 31-yard field goal attempt as time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc scored again on its first possession of the second half when Terrance 
Davis ran in from four yards out for a 20-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills continued to struggle on offense, managing only two first downs 
through the first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their rush gave (quarterback) Greg (Garand) some problems," Devaney said. 
"Obviously, when you base your offense around the pass, you have to protect for 
it. Their pass rush threw a big wrench in our game plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc capped the scoring when running back Peter Sousa scored on a 35-yard 
run with 5:12 left in the game.

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; VALENCIA'S MISTAKES OPEN THE 
DOOR FOR FOOTHILL

<P>
 Turnovers terminated Valencia from the Division V playoffs Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Four turnovers, three of them coming on the Tigers' final three drives, gave 
Foothill a 14-7 victory in the second round at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory sets up a rematch between No. 4 Foothill and top-seeded Newport 
Harbor, which eliminated Brea-Olinda, next Friday night at a site to be 
determined. Newport Harbor beat Foothill, 28-7, in the third game of the 
regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Three interceptions -- two by Nick Sveslosky and one by sophomore Lawrence 
Mariner -- of passes by Valencia quarterback Joe Secoda allowed Foothill, which 
won its seventh in a row, to eliminate the Tigers, who's four-game winning 
streak ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Sveslosky's two interceptions ended scoring drives by Valencia late in the 
third quarter and early in the fourth. Mariner's interception came with 2:35 
left as Foothill (8-4) ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to make the plays but we weren't able to," Valencia Coach Mike 
Marrujo said. "Joe's played well for us the entire year, but it was just one of 
those things. We tried to go deep, but it got away from us. (Foothill) made one 
more play than we did and ended up winning the ball game." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariner's 18-yard run with 4:26 remaining in the third quarter was the 
difference. It came after Valencia had tied the score on its first possession 
of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A turnover led to Foothill's first touchdown late in the first half. Running 
back Aaron Carbajal fumbled and Travis Freeman recovered, giving the Knights 
possession on the Valencia 39 with 1:07 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Foothill quarterback Tyler Lang hit wide receiver Cody 
Clemmons at the 25. Clemmons then lateraled to a streaking Tramel Robinson, who 
ran in untouched down the sidelines for a 25-yard scoring run and a 7-0 
Foothill lead with 37 seconds remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia scored on its first play of the third quarter. Secoda hit Jermaine 
Gray over the middle and the 6-foot, 200-pound senior broke two tackles and ran 
83 yards into the end zone, tying the score with only 2:37 off the clock. Gray 
was a big part of of Valencia's offense, catching four passes for 125 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foothill answered, driving 77 yards in eight plays, as Mariner, who had 63 
yards rushing in eight carries, scored on a counter for the game-winner. 
Foothill Coach Tom Meiss had predicted a defensive contest before the game. And 
though he wasn't surprised by the outcome, he wasn't too pleased with his 
team's play either. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about what I expected, a dog fight," he said. "But I thought, 'boy we 
made some stupid mistakes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill finished with 333 yards on offense. Robinson rushed for 80 yards in 
10 carries. Secoda completed seven of 20 passes for 165 yards and a touchdown.

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; EL TORO TOO MUCH FOR LOARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no doubt a longshot would advance to the Division V semifinals, it 
was just a matter of which team it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro proved to be the answer by defeating Loara, 21-3, in the second round 
Friday night at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro will play Servite, a 7-0 winner over Villa Park, in the semifinals 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (7-4-1) sneaked into the playoffs by virtue of a favorable coin 
flip, but their big-play offense has kept them there. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara, meanwhile, was still playing after El Dorado was disqualified for using 
an ineligible player and the Saxons upset Canyon in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring a combined 17 touchdowns in its previous four games, El Toro 
scored three more Friday night against a Loara defense that had given up an 
average of eight points in its last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came up with some big plays tonight," Charger Coach Mike Milner said. "We 
probably could have scored more but we missed some opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro did have a touchdown called back and missed two field goals, but the 
Chargers dominated the game on both sides of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense recorded five sacks and two interceptions, and the special teams 
blocked one punt and snuffed a fake on another. 
</P>
<P>
 On its second possession, El Toro moved the ball 64 yards in seven plays and 
scored on a 21-yard pass from Brian Wilson to a wide-open Murle Sango. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Sango had teamed up on a 27-yard screen pass two plays earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons (6-6) made it 7-3 in the second quarter on a 35-yard field goal by 
Sean Vickers. 
</P>
<P>
 But El Toro put together a seven-play drive and took a 14-3 lead when Wilson 
rolled out and threw eight yards to Joe Ader for a touchdown with 7:53 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ader put the game away in the third quarter when he took his only carry of the 
game 59 yards up the middle for a touchdown, giving El Toro a 21-3 lead.

 Carlos Glade recovered a fumble on the Phelan Serrano 17-yard line with 55 
seconds left to preserve a 22-19 Orange Lutheran victory in the quarterfinals 
of the Southern Section Division X football playoffs Friday night at Irvine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano had first and goal on the seven, but Jimmy Brown sacked Serrano 
quarterback Russell Anderson and forced the fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Orange Lutheran (10-2) will play San Pedro Mary Star of Sea, a 27-7 
winner over Ontario Christian, in the semifinals on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers surprised the visiting Diamondbacks on the third play of the game 
when quarterback Joe Juliano broke over left tackle and ran 75 yards for a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 minutes and 25 seconds left in the second quarter, Serrano's Bryan 
Elder caught a 21-yard touchdown pass from Anderson. The extra-point attempt 
was wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diamondbacks took a 13-7 lead with 5:19 left in the first half, when 
Anderson hit Hobie Jarrard with a nine-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano gave Orange Lutheran a 14-13 lead, when he found Che Holloway open for 
a 39-yard scoring pass with 48 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano (9-2-1) regained the lead when Michael Carmona broke through for a 
62-yard touchdown on the second play of the second half but the extra-point 
attempt again failed and the Diamondbacks led, 19-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran's final scoring drive began late in the third quarter and was 
preserved on a seven-yard run by Juliano on fourth down. Holloway scored from 
the one with 9:54 left, and Juliano hit Mike Crawford with a two-point 
conversion pass for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers lost defensive captain Chris Amato with 1:54 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "He popped his ankle and I doubt if he will be back this season," Lancer Coach 
Jim Kunau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano rushed for 140 yards and Holloway rushed for 100. Juliano also had 67 
yards passing and Holloway completed one pass for 39 yards. Crawford caught 
four passes for 71 yards.

1994-95 BOYS' BASKETBALL: PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE; PIVAROFF IS GLAD HE'S BACK ON 
THE COURT; BASKETBALL: AFTER YEAR OFF TO RECOVER FROM KNEE INJURY, LAGUNA BEACH 
POINT GUARD IS EAGER TO SHOW HE'S ONE OF THE GANG.

<P>
 Sure, Nate Pivaroff takes his lumps playing for the Laguna Beach High football 
team. In his three years on the team, the Artists have won only two league 
games, but Pivaroff still has fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he's got the best revenge: basketball. Laguna Beach, a school of 545, 
about 200 fewer students than the next smallest school in the Pacific Coast 
League, is no small fry when it comes to hoops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like playing bigger schools in basketball and I love beating them," 
Pivaroff said. He remembers fondly upsetting eventual league champion Trabuco 
Hills when he was a sophomore. "They were so shocked," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Pivaroff didn't get the chance for payback and Laguna Beach 
suffered because of it. Pivaroff, expected to be the Artists' starting point 
guard, instead was sidelined by a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened in the second-to-last football game of the season, an otherwise 
typical 31-0 loss to Century. Pivaroff, playing running back, dived on a bad 
pitch from quarterback Pat Wood. Pivaroff got to the ball first, then a Century 
player landed on his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff didn't even know he was injured, playing the rest of the game. Even 
when the knee stiffened the next day, Pivaroff still expected that after the 
knee was drained of fluid, he would be ready to play in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 But the news wasn't good; it was a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Instead of 
preparing for the final game, he got to prepare for reconstructive surgery that 
would force him to miss his junior basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult for him to take, especially when the season started without 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I walked into the gym my eyes got all teary," Pivaroff said. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon gained control of his emotions, but what he witnessed wasn't pleasant 
to watch. The Artists finished 7-17 and 3-7 in the Pacific Coast League, 
missing the playoffs for the first time since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough watching your team out there and not being able to be a part of 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff said his teammates stuck with him, cheering him up in the first weeks 
after the surgery when he was stuck at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's like he never left the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have forgotten about my knee surgery," Pivaroff said. "They've 
accepted me back as one of the players again. That means a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff says he hasn't fully recovered. The knee is sound but the muscles 
that atrophied haven't regained their strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel that I'm not the way I used to be," he said. "The year off has 
hurt me but eventually I think I'll get back into the swing of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pivaroff has lost some of his quickness, Laguna Beach Coach Bret 
Fleming said having him back is important to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have some other kids who are stepping up," Fleming said, "but as these 
kids have grown up they have always looked to Nate for leadership and I don't 
think that's going to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the ability to take over in crucial spots. Not as a scorer, but as 
somebody who settles the kids down and makes sure we get the ball where it's 
supposed to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff also delivered the ball for the football team this season. Moving to 
quarterback, he passed for 1,530 yards and led the Artists to a 2-8 record, 
including a 22-20 victory over Estancia in the season finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Pivaroff, 6 feet 2 and 195 pounds, eventually wants to play quarterback in 
college, but right now he's got giants to take care of on the basketball court.

<P>
 Trabuco Hills and Century split their league series and were headed for a tie 
for the title before Estancia cliched a playoff spot with a 55-52 overtime 
victory over Century in the second-to-last game of the league season. Co-most 
valuable players Ryan Karnoff of Trabuco Hills and Thomas Harmon of Century led 
their teams into the second round of the Southern Section playoffs. Trabuco 
Hills lost to Huntington Beach, 81-69, in Division II-AA and Century lost to 
eventual finalist Edison in Division I-A after beating University, 63-61, for 
its first playoff victory ever. Estancia, led by first-team all-league player 
Clay Frenz and second-team players Chris Candlish and Zack Richardson, lost to 
eventual State Division III finalist Pacifica, 94-72, in the Division III-A 
first round. Laguna Hills' Coach Dave Brown won his 400th game in a 25-year 
coaching career that started with 20 seasons at Fountain Valley. The Hawks were 
led by all-league players Jesse McDonald (first-team) and Mike Scaglione 
(second). Laguna Beach missed the playoffs for the first time since 1988, but 
salvaged some pride by upsetting Estancia in the Artists' final game of the 
season, 56-55, when Brandon Bloch made a free throw with four seconds left. Ian 
McDonald was a first-team all-league pick for the Artists. Costa Mesa again had 
a rough time, despite a promising start, losing only 46-42 to Estancia in the 
league opener when Ryan Steck had 16 points, 16 rebounds and seven assists.

STEINBERG SAYS RAM GROUP TO FOCUS ON STADIUM DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The co-chairman of Orange County's Save the Rams task force said Friday there 
is still a "viable chance" of keeping the football team in Southern California 
and expressed his frustration over recent reports that the team will be moving 
to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an unremitting daily stream of false rumors and authoritative 
sources all testifying of an imminent Rams move to St. Louis," said Leigh 
Steinberg, co-chairman of Save the Rams, after meeting with the group's 
executive committee Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems almost designed to make people in Orange County lose hope and to 
weaken the will of business and political leaders who continue to fight for the 
Rams and to create a sense of inevitability within the league." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams denied on Wednesday that they have agreed to sell a minority interest 
in the team to Columbia, Mo., businessman Stan Kroenke, paving the way for a 
move to St. Louis. Kroenke's lawyer, Alan Bornstein, said Thursday that the 
report was "premature." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, a prominent sports agent, said his group's executive committee also 
discussed on Friday the concept of building a football stadium -- which would 
be a departure from their current proposal that includes a $60 million 
renovation of Anaheim Stadium, converting it from multi-purpose to a 
football-only facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the reasoning runs that if Orange County were to lose the Rams and 
the Angels were to get a new stadium, Anaheim Stadium becomes a white 
elephant," Steinberg said. "What would be required to get a new football team? 
If the answer to that is a new stadium, it's better to confront that issue now 
while the Rams are here, than later." 
</P>
<P>
 During a Nov. 15 meeting with Steinberg, Ram President John Shaw emphasized 
the team's desire for a new stadium, although the team has never presented the 
group with any specific demands, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Rams were to say that a new stadium would ensure that the team would 
stay, we certainly would endeavor to see if that is possible," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said a new stadium might be more attractive to potential investors 
now that Anaheim officials are seriously studying the possibility of building a 
lavish sports complex in the area around the existing stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all makes more sense in light of what is being conceptualized now as one 
of the biggest entertainment zones in Southern California," he said. "That 
starts to attract private enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 A new football stadium would cost between $160 million and $200 million. 
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly has said the city would consider building one as long as 
the project would not require ongoing public funding.  
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said groups or individuals who have offered to purchase a minority 
interest in the team have expressed interest in financing a new stadium, which 
probably would be built on the same spot as the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are currently negotiating with the Angels to extend the team's 
lease and build them a baseball-only stadium that would most likely be built in 
the parking lot of the current stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Save the Rams members are trying to set up a meeting with NFL 
officials in New York to discuss the league's possible investment in a new 
stadium, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL in October floated the idea of a new Los Angeles-area stadium that 
would serve as a Super Bowl site on a rotating basis and a possible home for 
the Rams and Raiders, who are unhappy with the Coliseum. The project would 
ideally be a joint venture, with league, private and public financing. Part of 
the construction costs also would be paid for with Super Bowl revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park and Long Beach have been mentioned as possible sites, but 
Steinberg has been pushing Anaheim Stadium and the Save the Rams' planned 
entertainment corridor as another option for the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Goodell, the NFL's vice president of business development, said he has 
had several discussions with Steinberg and that "it's fair to say we're 
serious" about the stadium issue in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're currently analyzing the financial details and other aspects (of the 
project)," Goodell said. "We're not talking about the NFL building a stadium. 
This would be a public-private partnership, a concept designed around the idea 
of having a periodic number of Super Bowls and the possibility of having two 
franchises in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodell, however, could not say whether the league could act on such a 
proposal soon enough to keep the Rams in Southern California, and would not say 
what sites are being explored. The Rams are expected to decide in December 
whether to move to St. Louis or Baltimore or remain in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our standpoint, this is a long-term project with respect to renovating 
and building new facilities for our league," Goodell said. "The commissioner 
has a priority of keeping the NFL strong in Los Angeles and addressing the 
issue of new facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Save the Rams group's current offer stands. This includes the 
stadium renovation, a $50 million infusion of cash through the purchase of a 
minority interest in the team, a new $12 million practice facility, sales of 
45,000 season tickets and income from approximately 100 luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary focus will be on reiterating the firmness and viability on each 
part of our original package," Steinberg said. "I honestly believe that Orange 
County has a viable chance to keep the Rams."

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I; DEFENSE COMES THROUGH AS LOS 
ALAMITOS ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They were all pointing fingers at Los Alamitos defense back Damon Houston. He 
was the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 A somewhat unsure Houston shrugged and took the credit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Houston, teammates said, who stripped the ball from Long Beach Poly's 
Arild Faramio to preserve a 7-0 victory in front of 10,000 at Orange Coast 
College. Brandon Hart recovered the fumble on Los Alamitos' 18-yard line with 
two minutes left to extend the Griffins' unbeaten streak to a Southern Section 
record 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was me," Houston said. "I don't really know, but I hit him." 
</P>
<P>
 So with all that stop-us-if-you-can offense, the fleet of receivers and the 
quarterback who doesn't crack under pressure, it was a simple defensive play 
that put the Griffins in the Southern Section Division I semifinals. And the 
culprit couldn't even remember the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I saw was (Faramio's) face," Houston said. "It just lit up, like, "What's 
up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Houston had an answer to that, as did the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
 They, not Long Beach Poly, were going to play Mater Dei in the semifinals 
Saturday in a matchup of Orange County's top-ranked teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Griffins (12-0) were also left alone in the Southern Section 
record book by extending their unbeaten streak. The Jackrabbits were not going 
to be the ones to boast and brag about snapping that string. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for once, it all came down to defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were big and mean," Hart said. "We knew we just had to be 
tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 They were toughest when they were backpedaling in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins were inches from clinching the game in the fourth quarter. 
Quarterback Kevin Feterik reached for the goal line on a second and goal play, 
only to have the ball knocked out of his hands. Daniel Ho-Ching recovered the 
ball and the Jackrabbits were alive. 
</P>
<P>
 They moved from their 20 to the Griffin 27 with 2 minutes 9 seconds left. 
Quarterback Robert Toler hit Faramio on the sideline. He was fighting for extra 
yards, then was scrambling for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Damon," defensive back Ife Ohalefe said. "I saw it. He laid one on 
that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defensive tackle Dax Houston: "We were nervous that whole drive. Then 
Brandon got the ball and we exploded." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the biggest play for a defense that has not had to win a game this 
season. The Griffin offense came in averaging 36.3 points, but turned 
desperately to its defense for support. They committed four turnovers, three 
inside the five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffin offense ran-and-shot itself in the foot. Feterik was 19 of 29 for 
285 yards, including a seven-yard touchdown pass to Stan Guyness in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feterik made mistakes. Besides fumbling on the one, he had two passes 
intercepted. Running back Ryan Gragnano fumbled on the goal line. Ben Hughes 
also missed a 35-yard field goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins were ripe to be taken. But the defense wouldn't allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits' offensive line averaged 254 pounds, but their backs found 
little room to run. Faramio was their most consistent offensive threat, gaining 
67 yards. Toler completed nine of 18 passes, but for only 108 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were huge, so we had to be quicker," said Los Alamitos' Dax Houston, who 
is 5 feet 9 and 173 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston was quicker, as he beat players 100 pounds heavier. He had one sack 
and three tackles for a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackrabbits (10-2) gained 212 yards and the closest they came to scoring 
was when Jerry Reynoso's 44-yard field goal attempt bounced off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is young and undersized," Coach John Barnes said. "All it did was 
shut that team out."

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; NEWPORT HARBOR GETS SERIOUS, 
WHIPS BREA-OLINDA, 24-8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They were two teams almost identical in nature, driven by no-name defenses to 
match their no-name offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have shown an ability to win, but only one has shown the capacity for 
perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Newport Harbor won its 12th consecutive game, scoring a 24-8 
Division V quarterfinal victory over Brea-Olinda Friday in front of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (12-0) set a school record for victories in the process, 
surpassing the previous mark of 11 set by the 1992 team that lost to Irvine in 
the Southern Section final. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the only other time in Newport Harbor's 64-year history the team has 
reached the finals. The only team that stands in the Sailors' way of a second 
championship appearance is fourth-seeded Foothill. The Knights beat Valencia, 
14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea finished 8-3-1; the Wildcats were hoping to make their first title 
appearance since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley said his team took this game much more 
seriously than its first-round victory over Century. He could tell in the way 
his players practiced this week. And he could tell the way they played against 
the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were going to beat us, they were going to have to physically whip 
us," Brinkley said. "The way they prepared this week, I knew they were ready to 
play this ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor defense allowed only 12 yards rushing and 102 passing -- 
most of which came after the Sailors were ahead, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in thinking this was the toughest team we had played to date," 
quarterback John Giordani said. "In the first half, we played our most complete 
game of the year, and in the second half we got conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani was mostly brilliant, completing 14 of 22 passes for 158 yards and 
two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the coaches, 'We've got to open it up again,' " Brinkley said. "We 
were conservative last week (in a 28-14 victory over Saddleback), but (Brea's 
defense) plays the run tough." 
</P>
<P>
 So Giordani threw and the Sailors took off, set up by big plays that led to 
three first-half scores. The first, a 25-yard field goal by Jeff Pardy, came 
about only after Giordani completed a second-and-24 pass to Jon Benzinger for 
48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brea turnover set up Newport Harbor's next score. Wildcats quarterback Matt 
Kalcevich pitched the ball behind tailback Jerome Owens and Newport Harbor's 
Dan McDonough recovered 20 yards downfield, at the Brea 19. Four plays later, 
Giordani threw three yards to Jeremy Mason to make it 10-0 with 5:57 left in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 That might have been enough the way the Sailor defense was playing, but 
Newport Harbor scored with 10 seconds left in the half to make it 17-0 when 
Giordani passed nine yards to Danny Pulido, completing an eight-play, 55-yard 
drive. The offense got the ball because the Sailor defense stopped Brea on 
fourth and two at the Newport Harbor 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know when it hit us -- I think it was over the summer -- that we had 
a chance (to win a title) if we just lay it on the line for 48 minutes every 
Friday," Giordani said. "Tonight, we didn't leave anything on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor made it 24-0 on the first drive of the second half when four 
Giordani passes set up Brian Johnson's 25-yard scoring run.

PREP EXTRA: SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; FIRST-HALF TOUCHDOWN STANDS AS SERVITE 
BLANKS VILLA PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Servite was looking for a good test to determine its playoff worthiness, 
Friday's game against Villa Park provided the blue book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars, in particular their defense, aced the exam. Servite scored the 
game's only touchdown in the first quarter on a two-yard run by David Bedard 
and made it stand for a 7-0 victory before an estimated 1,600 at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 By posting their second shutout in as many weeks, the Friars (10-2) advance to 
play El Toro, which beat Loara, 21-3, Friday night, in the Southern Section 
Division V semifinals. The Spartans finish the season 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had told me at the beginning of the week we would only score one 
touchdown and win, I would not have believed it," Servite Coach Larry Toner 
said. "Villa Park is such an explosive team. And the fact we only scored one 
touchdown was my fault; too often I had people in the wrong formations or the 
wrong situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The questions -- could the Friars contain Sean McMahon and the Spartans' 
passing game? Would Servite's backfield of Bedard and Frank Patti buckle under 
the Villa Park defense? -- took all 48 minutes to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Servite defense that spoke the loudest; it harassed McMahon, 
who completed only five of 22 passes for 85 yards (of which 52 yards came on 
the Spartans' last drive), and held Villa Park to 154 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dropped some passes and didn't do a real good job, especially in the first 
half," Villa Park Coach Pat Mahoney said. "But they also did a good job of 
keeping us out of second down-and-short situations. I knew their defense was 
tough; we just couldn't get anything going." 
</P>
<P>
 They almost did at the end. With two minutes left to play, Villa Park moved 
the ball from its 35 to the Servite 19. Then came the biggest play; with 20 
seconds to play, McMahon avoided the Friars' rush and appeared to hit a leaping 
Sam Stremick in the end zone for a touchdown. But Stremick could not hold the 
ball when he came down. 
</P>
<P>
 At first it appeared as if Stremick had his vision blocked momentarily by 
Servite defender Joe LeVecke, but Stremick denied it. "He managed to hit me 
just as I was getting the ball and I couldn't hold it," Stremick said. "It was 
a great defensive play." 
</P>
<P>
 On offense, the Friars went to their running trio of Bedard (72 yards), Patti 
(85 yards) and Marvin Smith (27 yards). Frank Martin had another quiet night 
passing, three of seven for 33 yards with one interception, but it did not hurt 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park's defense kept Servite out of the end zone in the first half, but 
it was not able to overcome the one key mistake that cost them the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars had just concluded their first possession at the Spartans' 38, and 
had to punt. But Villa Park fumbled the punt, and Smith recovered at the 10. 
Five plays later, Bedard burrowed into the end zone from two yards.

GIVE 'EM A HAND; STUDENTS GET A LESSON IN THE ENVIRONMENT BY PICKING UP TRASH 
IN BIG TUJUNGA CANYON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The boys and girls in Doug Copeland's fourth- and fifth-grade class took a 
couple hours off from school Tuesday to clean up their back yard -- the 
litter-strewn Big Tujunga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 With their sleeves rolled up and hands protected by rubber gloves, the 
youngsters from Plainview Elementary School in Tujunga picked up trash left by 
picnickers along a stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is gross," said Tony Orozco, 9, peering at his collection of cups, old 
clothing and part of a mattress he stuffed into a garbage bag. But he saw the 
social significance of his toils. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you clean up, the more nicer it is, and the animals don't have to 
eat (the garbage)," Tony explained. 
</P>
<P>
 That was part of the message Copeland was hoping to get across. "The kids live 
right on the other side of the hills," said the teacher, who asked the 
California Environmental Project to sponsor a two-day workshop for his students 
to teach them about the impact humans have on the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Families come to picnic by the stream every weekend, according to Scott 
Mathes, executive director of the environmental group, and often leave their 
trash -- from plastic foam cups to diapers -- along the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, people also dam parts of the stream to make deeper pools for 
swimming, Mathes said, and this allows bacteria to build up in the stagnant 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before their trek out to the canyon, the children saw a play by the 
California Environmental Project about the "Impact Monster," a horrible 
creature that litters and doesn't recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, we learned how to help the wildlife by telling your parents about 
putting their beer cans in the trash," said 11-year-old Crystal Valenzuela, who 
took from the play and trash pickup an apocalyptic vision of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people don't stop littering, all the fish and toads and frogs are going to 
die," Crystal said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COUNCIL RACE STARTS WITH MAYOR ENTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens this week became the first candidate to 
officially enter the fray for next April's City Council elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Givens, who was first elected to the council in 1991, said she is seeking a 
second four-year term to complete several goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is going through a lot of changes at this time, and I think I have 
the experience and proven leadership that's needed," Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 During her first council term, Givens helped create the City Hall in Your 
Neighborhood program, a series of town hall meetings where council and other 
city officials meet with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 During her tenure as mayor, which expires in April, the city's Greater 
Downtown Strategic Plan was completed and the council decided to begin having 
its weekly meetings televised. 
</P>
<P>
 The other council seat on the ballot is currently held by three-term 
Councilman Larry Zarian, who was first elected in 1983. Zarian said Wednesday 
he will announce within a week whether or not he will seek a fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 To run for public office, candidates must pick up nomination papers from the 
city clerk on or after Dec. 12, collect the signatures of 500 registered voters 
and turn them in with a $25 fee by Jan. 6. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; ARSON WATCH STARTS FUND-RAISING DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A volunteer organization that patrols wildfire-prone areas to prevent arson 
and fires caused by carelessness has launched a fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Emerson, president of Arson Watch and Disaster Services Inc., says his 
group spends about $2,500 each year for expenses such as renting communication 
equipment for its six arson watch teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, working under the supervision of the Sheriff's Department, use 
their own vehicles to patrol wilderness areas, on the lookout for people who 
are acting suspicious or carelessly discarding items like cigarettes or 
matches. Using two-way radios, the volunteers report trouble to the 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson, who lives in Monte Nido, has sent a letter to residents in fire-prone 
areas served by the group, asking residents to make tax-deductible 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Arson Watch makes the difference between a minor incident and a 
major conflagration," the letter says. "It can make a difference between safety 
and disaster -- between life and death -- for you, your family, your pets and 
your friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams operate in Topanga, Calabasas, Agoura Hills, Seminole Hot Springs, 
Malibu and Chatsworth, Emerson said. The organization has also participated in 
earthquake relief drills and is working on a plan to provide public safety 
officials with reports on road conditions and structural damage during 
earthquakes and other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six arson watch teams, Topanga has the largest contingent of 
volunteers, Emerson said. It has 70, while the Malibu and Cornell-Seminole Hot 
Springs teams have about 25 members. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GALLERIA LAUDED FOR CRIME PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale City Council honored the Glendale Galleria this week for crime 
prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall, its private security force and the Glendale Police Department were 
honored with a proclamation by the City Council for maintaining a low crime 
rate at the mall and for sponsoring such crime prevention efforts as a child 
fingerprinting program, the Glendale Youth Boxing Program and police 
recruitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime prevention at the Galleria has long been a joint effort with the 
Glendale Police Department," said Cindy Chong, the mall's general manager. "We 
have had a substation since the mall opened. It was one of the first police 
substations to be included in a shopping mall." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the mall's security force operates 24 hours a day and its employees, 
including members of the bike patrol, receive three months' training. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's proclamation also honored the mall's contribution to the local 
economy. The mall has traditionally been the city's No. 1 or No. 2 generator of 
sales tax revenue, rivaled only by the combined sales of local automobile 
dealers. STEVE RYFLE

<P>
 The Pacoima Youth Culture Center received a $10,000 grant this week to create 
a computer learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds came from the United Parcel Service Foundation, the charity branch 
of the packaging and delivery service. The youth center, established in 1977, 
provides comprehensive social services to the communities of the northeast San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer learning center will feature a jobs databank, an information 
referral network and computer training courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is part of a nationwide program begun by UPS in 1984, which reported 
giving last year a total of $2.5 million to community organizations for 
education, human welfare, adult literacy and food distribution. TIM MAY

<P>
 Three forums to discuss the legal status of Proposition 187 are scheduled at 
Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The forums, moderated by university President Blenda Wilson, will specifically 
address how the proposition affects the university community.Wilson recently 
released a statement saying that CSUN would not take any steps toward enforcing 
the proposition while it is being challenged in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Two forums will be held Tuesday, from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and from 12:30 to 
2 p.m., in the Shoshone Room of the school's satellite student union. The third 
will be Wednesday from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. Wednesday in the Sala de Osa in the 
satellite student union. 
</P>
<P>
 In other CSUN news, the school was recently recognized for a program in 
teacher education by the American Assn. of State Colleges and Universities. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only four public universities to be honored by the association, CSUN 
was awarded for its work with the Los Angeles Unified School District in 
developing a program that prepares teachers for urban and multicultural 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual award is named for Christa McAuliffe, the teacher who died in the 
1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. MAKI BECKER

responsibilities has grown into a bustling adult education facility that 
enrolls 7,000 men and women in classes ranging from power blackjack to tai chi. 
</P>
<P>
 The Village, as it is now popularly known, had humble beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was first put in motion by Chris Edwards, Diane Rosner and Lynn 
Selwyn, three women in their 30s with similar lifestyles -- they were all 
married, all mothers and all searching for a strong dose of intellectual 
stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go to college, but aspiring to be a homemaker was the thing in 
those days," said Edwards, the last living founder. "Then I thought, wouldn't 
it be great if housewives could continue learning without competing in a 
typical classroom environment, without grades or tests?" 
</P>
<P>
 So the trio took action. 
</P>
<P>
 With some financial help from their husbands, the three leased a half-acre lot 
in Van Nuys where a handful of small houses sat vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our husbands wanted to make us happy, so they helped us get the property," 
said Edwards. "But I don't think they thought we could pull it off." 
</P>
<P>
 The men were in for a big surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with scrub brushes, paintbrushes and hammers, the women enthusiastically 
transformed the five buildings with adjacent garages into 13 classrooms and 
workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 They recruited professionals and experts to teach fine arts, music and 
physical fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 And their grand opening drew instant response. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 women enrolled during the first week, with hundreds more to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the first enrollment call they discovered that men, too, wanted to 
learn in a non-competitive environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received tons of calls from men who asked if they could also take 
classes," said Laura Selwyn, executive director for Everywoman's Village and 
daughter of one of the founders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name Everywoman's was appropriate when we opened, but it confused 
people," she said. "So we became the Village." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sign still reads Everywoman's Village, word of mouth and a new 
name on class catalogues ensured that the center welcomed everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Village operates mostly on class fees and some donations. Prices 
vary from $49 for an acupressure class to $162 for a course in WordPerfect. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-hour class on how to dance sensually for your man was recently added to 
the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're open to suggestions by students, as long as they're in good taste," 
said Anita Mathews, program director. "We look for trends and topics in 
demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Johns, a Van Nuys resident who leads a mountain hiking group and teaches 
garden design, said the Village is an environment equally friendly for men and 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men who want to be in a creative environment like it here," he said.

<P>
 A power outage Friday night blacked out about 1,600 Department of Water and 
Power customers in the west San Fernando Valley, DWP officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage first cut off power at 6:25 p.m. Service was restored, but the 
power failed again soon afterward and stayed off for several hours, said DWP 
spokeswoman Dorothy Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
 She said DWP workers were trying to determine the cause of the outage Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 No hospitals or other large public facilities were affected, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage was centered in two areas of Northridge and Chatsworth: near the 
intersection of Tulsa Street and Baton Rouge Avenue, and around the corner of 
Devonshire Street and Corbin Avenue, Jensen said. JOSH MEYER

RATES FOR MOST OFFENSES STAY LEVEL; ANTELOPE VALLEY: FIGURES FOR THIRD QUARTER 
SHOW 1% DROP IN THE REGION, THOUGH HOMICIDES ROSE 33% FROM 18 TO 24. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crime statistics have remained almost level in the Antelope Valley this year 
compared to 1993, according to third-quarter statistics released by the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The percent of change did rise or drop dramatically for some crimes, but only 
those where the raw numbers were small. For example, homicides in the Antelope 
Valley were up 33% from last year, but that represents an increase from 18 to 
24. And arsons were down 17%, from 167 to 139. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third-quarter crime stats for 1994 reflect very little change from last 
year's overall rate," sheriff's deputies said in a prepared statement on the 
report, which covers Lancaster, Palmdale and unincorporated areas of the 
valley. "The greater Antelope Valley area had a 1% decrease, with the 
unincorporated area and Lancaster remaining about the same (as last year). 
Palmdale experienced a 3% decrease." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Antelope Valley's population increased about 8% over the past 
year, deputies also looked at the number of crimes committed per 10,000 
residents. Using this measurement, there was again little change: 341 crimes 
per 10,000 residents this year, compared to 374 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined total for eight major crime categories in the Antelope Valley was 
10,209 compared to 10,096 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the numbers in specific categories registered enough of a increase to 
cause concerns. Automobile thefts were up from 550 to 651 in Palmdale compared 
to last year. The largest number of auto thefts so far this year -- 741 -- 
occurred in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Burglaries were up from 935 to 1,065 in Lancaster, but remained nearly at the 
same level in Palmdale and the unincorporated areas. Crime Watch 
</P>
<P>
 The overall number of serious crimes in the Antelope Valley has changed 
little, decreasing by 1%, compared to last year. A few crime categories are 
shown below, as of September.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; RABBIS REPLACED STRENGTH WITH SPIRIT IN HANUKKAH 
TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hanukkah, which Jews begin observing Sunday night, might have remained solely 
a celebration of a military victory except for the disillusionment of Judaism's 
early rabbis with religious nationalism, says a Jewish scholar. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day festival still inspires sermons about religious liberty, but 
Hanukkah also has spiritual elements that balance militancy as the key to 
Jewish survival with reliance on God, said Zev Garber, a Jewish studies 
instructor at Valley College in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as militancy and spirituality were in tension in antiquity, so they are 
today, said Garber, author of a recent book on the Holocaust, "Shoah: The 
Paradigmatic Genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably need both," Garber said in an interview, expanding upon an 
article on Hanukkah in the journal Jewish Spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanukkah recalls the overthrow of Hellenistic Syrian forces occupying 
Jerusalem in 164 B.C. by Jewish troops led by Judas Maccabaeus. The Maccabees 
rededicated the originally Jewish temple where idol worship had recently been 
introduced. According to 2 Maccabees 10:3, the rebels purified the sanctuary 
and, striking flint to get fire, again offered burnt animal sacrifices at the 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maccabees, as Garber noted, "relied on the alliance of a foreign power, 
Rome, to bring victory, and ensured internal power by perpetuating a holiday 
for their accomplishment and usurping the high priesthood to their family 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 But about two centuries later, after the disastrous Jewish War with Rome from 
66 to 70 A.D. when Roman troops destroyed the Jerusalem Temple and set off a 
massive exile of Jews from their homeland, the new movement of rabbis, who 
supplanted the dispossessed temple priests, reassessed "what Maccabean 
religio-nationalism did to a nation," Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 When deciding which books would be included in the Hebrew Bible, the rabbis 
left out 14 books, including those bearing the name Maccabeans. (The so-called 
Apocrypha, including Ruth, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach and the Maccabeans, 
nevertheless were preserved by the early churches and are found in ecumenical 
Christian Bibles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Garber said he believes that the rabbis' exclusion of 1 and 2 Maccabees was 
quite purposeful, given their religious significance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 14 books, only those two deal with the preservation or celebration of 
an established holiday," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was retained, but the rabbis gave it a more spiritual cast, 
Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first Sabbath of Hanukkah, a verse from the 4th chapter of Zechariah is 
read in the synagogue: "Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, says the 
Lord of hosts." 
</P>
<P>
 The pointed use of this verse, noted the Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion, 
was an example of the pronounced tendency on the rabbis' part "to diminish the 
military aspect of the festival and concentrate instead on the aspect of the 
survival of religious values in the face of pagan and idolatrous opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 As is well known in Judaic studies, Rabbinic writings collectively known as 
the Talmud said the festival was held for eight days because pure oil found in 
the temple by the Maccabeans, although sufficient only for one day, 
miraculously burned for eight days until new supplies could be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The main feature of Hanukkah today is the progressive kindling of eight 
candles on the Hanukkah menorah, one each night, from the light on a ninth 
socket. The story of the miraculous oil is not told, however, in the books of 
the Maccabees, but was added by the rabbis later as part of a move to minimize 
the importance of the military actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Garber said the pious harmonizing of the story by the rabbis was reflected in 
a later, 9th-Century Palestinian commentary. Explaining why menorahs are lit on 
Hanukkah, the rabbinical commentary said that when the Maccabeans re-entered 
the temple, they hollowed out eight rods of iron and poured lighted oil into 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, for the rabbis, weapons of the spirit and not war are the way for 
the Jewish people," Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in recent centuries, anti-Semitic pogroms and the Holocaust have 
raised questions about making Jewish survival overly dependent on piety and 
passivity, Garber said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jews need both -- strength in physical terms and in spiritual ways," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Fields, senior rabbi at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, said Garber's 
interpretation of Hanukkah's history may have underplayed the broader struggle 
between the rabbis of the Pharisee movement and the Sadducees, who inherited 
the Maccabean tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pharisees basically did not want the Maccabeans or the Sadducees to get 
any credit for their victory," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Fields indicated that Hanukkah as observed today has gone beyond an 
argument over militarism versus pacifism to become primarily a "celebration of 
human liberation and ultimately a victory to retain religious freedom."

HART DELIVERS PUNCH LINE, 51-0; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: INDIANS DEFEAT LEUZINGER 
IN A REAL LAUGHER IN DIVISION II QUARTERFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hart High was playing on the road against a big, tough opponent in the 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section Division II football playoffs and the 
outcome was a joke: 
</P>
<P>
 Hart 51, Leuzinger 0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of surprised," said Domenic DeLillio, who caught two touchdown 
passes. "We expected a good game, because they were apparently a good team. 
They did something to get here." 
</P>
<P>
 That something was a mystery Friday night, as the Indians (12-0) scored on 
seven of 11 possessions and added another score on a turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart will play Quartz Hill in the semifinals next Saturday night at College of 
the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard to say which Hart unit was more impressive -- the offense or 
defense. Both played angry and aggressive, like they missed Thanksgiving 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big surprise, because we thought they were a tough team -- and a 
big team," said Hart linebacker Marc Zimmerman, whose third-quarter fumble 
recovery set up a DeLillio touchdown that made it 37-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we were very intense in practice. This might have been the best week of 
practice all year for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympians (9-2-1) were held to 139 yards, 25 in the first half, while Hart 
piled up 265 of its 385 yards by intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Rob Frederickson pitched to an invisible running back at his 17 
with 1:07 left in the half. Hart's Todd Renfro fell on the ball in the end zone 
to cap a 30-0 two-period onslaught. 
</P>
<P>
 On third and 15 in Hart's first series, quarterback Steve McKeon connected 
with DeLillio on a 72-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 "In practice, we weren't saying we were going to throw," DeLillio said. "But 
everything was wide open." 
</P>
<P>
 Two series later, with receiver Jeremy Seipel at the tackle position, Hart 
called a tackle-eligible. Left unguarded, Seipel scored on a 45-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kevin McLaughlin's first field goal of the season, a 32-yarder, made it 
17-0, Ted Iacenda dragged two tacklers into the end zone on a seven-yard 
scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Renfro's fumble recovery to make it 30-0. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Iacenda's 34-yard run set up McKeon's 19-yard touchdown 
pass to DeLillio. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the second-stringers and a 58-yard touchdown run by Tim Waddell and 
a one-yarder by Erick Negri. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed seven of 16 passes for 182 yards. Iacenda rushed 13 times for 
122 yards and scored his 36th touchdown.

SERVITE SHUTS OUT VILLA PARK, 7-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE TERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Servite was looking for a good test to determine its playoff worthiness, 
Friday's game against Villa Park provided the blue book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars, in particular their defense, aced the exam.Servite scored the 
game's only touchdown in the first quarter on a two-yard run by David Bedard 
and made it stand for a 7-0 victory before an estimated 1,600 at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 By posting their second shutout in as many weeks, the Friars (10-2) advance to 
play El Toro, which beat Loara, 21-3, Friday night, in the Southern Section 
Division V semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had told me at the beginning of the week we would only score one 
touchdown and win, I would not have believed it," Servite Coach Larry Toner 
said. "Villa Park is such an explosive team. And the fact we only scored one 
touchdown was my fault; too often I had people in the wrong formations or the 
wrong situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The questions -- could the Friars contain Sean McMahon and the Spartans' 
passing game? Would Servite's backfield of Bedard and Frank Patti buckle under 
the Villa Park defense? -- took all 48 minutes to answer. MIKE TERRY

 How quickly things sour. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute, Saugus High was driving for a possible score that could have cut 
Antelope Valley's lead to three points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, the Centurions trailed by 18 points, their tailback was 
injured, and playing quarterback was a backup whose name could be found only in 
the junior varsity portion of the team roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Murphy intercepted a fourth-quarter pass by Saugus starter Kevin Carrasco 
and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown to seal Antelope Valley's 30-12 
victory in a Southern Section Division II quarterfinal at College of the 
Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley (9-2) will play Peninsula, a 17-0 winner over Arcadia, in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just in the right place," Murphy said. "I think our speed wears a lot 
of teams down." 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays before Murphy's interception, Saugus tailback Jeremy Mushinski was 
injured and left the game after gaining 101 yards in 15 carries. After 
Carrasco's interception, Coach Jack Bowman replaced him with sophomore Chris 
Kobe to finish out the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus (6-4-1) hung in for three-and-a-half quarters, but couldn't stop 
Antelope Valley's big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Antelopes' four touchdowns came on plays 28 yards or longer. The 
fourth was set up by a 32-yard run by quarterback Trymon Redick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've got size and we've got speed," Antelope Valley Coach Brent 
Newcomb said of the difference between the two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome never seemed in doubt. Antelope Valley led at halftime, 16-6, 
despite being outgained. 
</P>
<P>
 Redick set up the game's first touchdown with a 32-yard option keeper to the 
Saugus one-yard line. Fullback Justin Reinier scored on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus running back Mark Pecaro fumbled early in the second quarter at the 
Centurions' 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley running back Jermaine Lewis took a handoff on the next play, 
ran over left tackle, cut to the left sideline and outran the Saugus defense to 
the end zone. Antelope Valley led, 16-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus drove to the Antelopes' seven-yard line on the next possession, but 
turned the ball over on downs when Carrasco was sacked by Caleb Smith and Chad 
Shrout. 
</P>
<P>
 But on its next possession, Saugus mounted an impressive 67-yard drive and 
scored on Carrasco's one-yard sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis gained 87 yards and scored a touchdown in 12 carries for Antelope 
Valley. Redick added 85 yards and one touchdown in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinier rushed for 47 yards and a touchdown in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrasco completed 11 of 21 passes for 162 yards. Two of his passes were 
intercepted.

TOP-SEEDED WESTLAKE SEES ITS HOPES SAIL AWAY, 25-16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even All-American receiver Billy Miller would have been able to catch the 
ball that helped knock Westlake High out of the Southern Section Division III 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors led by four points when a bad snap sailed two feet over the head 
of punter Brian Shubin early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays after Shubin covered the ball for a 21-yard loss, Lathian Tyler 
scored the go-ahead touchdown on a seven-yard run to help Diamond Bar upset 
top-seeded Westlake, 25-16, Friday night at Walnut High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler scored on a three-yard run with just over one minute remaining to cap a 
six-minute drive and seal the victory. He finished with 59 yards in 20 carries. 
The Diamond Bar option attack accounted for 195 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave us fits," Westlake Coach Jim Benkert said. "We don't see a lot of it 
but missed some responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar (9-3) also slowed a Warrior offense that averaged nearly 400 yards 
a game. Scott Spruill completed 11 of 22 passes for 150 yards and Miller was 
held to 58 yards on five receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake rushed for 129 yards, 36 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar quarterback Erik Stidham completed nine of 20 passes for 142 yards 
and ran for 83 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a lot of film on Westlake and we thought they weren't going to be able 
to handle the option well," Stidham said. "After the bad snap we knew we would 
put points on the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Harris' 39-yard run on the first play of the game set up a one-yard 
sneak by Spruill to give Westlake (10-2) the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Alysworth's 47-yard punt return set up Craig Walendy's one-yard run that 
made it 13-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar drove 72 yards in nine plays, scoring on a two-yard run by Stidham 
to make it 13-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't worried even when they went up by 13," Stidham said. "We still had 
to show them what we were capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar scored again after an interception by Scott Williams. A 42-yard 
pass play from Stidham to Spencer Obord set up a one-yard sneak by Stidham. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas failed on the two-point conversion and trailed, 13-12.

NOTRE DAME STILL ALIVE AND KICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kicker Chris Sailer entered the state record book as Notre Dame High advanced 
to the Southern Section Division III semifinals with a 21-14 victory over Royal 
on Friday night at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer, among the nation's most-recruited kickers, booted field goals of 42 
and 54 yards in the rain to give him 18 for the season, eclipsing the existing 
state record of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Notre Dame (11-1), with a tenacious-as-usual defense, forced a 
pair of key turnovers to rally from a 14-3 first-half deficit and advance to 
the semifinals for the second year in a row and the third time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame will play Serra, a 19-10 winner over Rowland, in the semifinals at 
a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a gutsy, gutsy performance," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said to 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame, which defeated Royal, 21-3, early in the season, trailed, 14-3, 
midway through the second quarter, but slammed the door on the Highlanders 
(8-4) thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal quarterback Wes Lagatta, who passed for 39 yards in the first half, was 
0 for 6 in the second half and was stripped of the ball by linebacker David 
Dupetit in the final three minutes at the Notre Dame 31. 
</P>
<P>
 A more crucial turning point came midway through the second quarter, when 
defensive back Neil Schwary intercepted a Lagatta pass and raced 43 yards to 
the Royal 12. One play later, quarterback Ryan Bowne connected with tight end 
John Genova for a touchdown pass. A two-point conversion cut Royal's lead to 
14-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame took the lead for good late in the first half when Bowne connected 
with Robbie Brewster for a 19-yard touchdown-pass play and an 18-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In a tug-of-war second half played on an increasingly muddy field, Sailer's 
54-yard field goal provided all the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain held the ball up a little bit tonight, but not much," said Sailer, 
who also missed a 49-yard attempt. "It feels great to get the record and get it 
out of the way. But the win is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal received a break on the game's opening kickoff, when Notre Dame's Corey 
Franzini mishandled a squib kick and Mike Weyandt recovered for the Highlanders 
at the 17-yard line. A four-play drive followed, with fullback Mike Reddington 
slamming two yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's offense struggled early, but the Kinghts penetrated to the Royal 
19 late in the first quarter before the drive stalled. Sailer trotted out and 
booted a 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal marched 67 yards on its next drive to take a 14-3 lead. The drive 
stalled and Matt Pitstick's 29-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide right. But 
Notre Dame was whistled for roughing the kicker and Royal was awarded a first 
down at the six. Reddington, who had 110 yards in 18 carries, ran for the 
touchdown on the next play.

HARVARD TURNS TO LEMKIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES TEMMEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Harvard-Westlake High lost standout running back Abed Abusaleh to a 
shoulder injury in the first quarter, quarterback Derek Lemkin took control of 
the offense and led the Wolverines into the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemkin completed seven of 10 passes for 154 yards and three touchdowns as 
Harvard (10-1-1) defeated host St. Joseph in a Southern Section Division IX 
quarterfinal game Friday night.In the semifinals next Friday, Harvard will play 
Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put two or three passes right on the money," Harvard Coach Dave Bennett 
said of Lemkin. "He's all heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemkin connected with receiver Kadar Lewis on scoring pass plays of 69 and 17 
yards. Lewis finished with four receptions for 114 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemkin also threw a 15-yard scoring pass to Lew Roberts. Running back Merlin 
De Martinis had 56 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemkin helped Harvard build a 23-7 lead, but St. Joseph cut the lead to 23-21 
when fullback Steve Kapphahn scored on a one-yard run with 6 minutes 15 seconds 
left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines recovered the onside kick, then took more than four minutes off 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph (8-4) took over at its 23-yard line with 1:47 left, but threw four 
consecutive incomplete passes.

HAWKINS ROMPS FOR NORDHOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER YOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before his team's Southern Section Division IX quarterfinal Friday night 
against St. Anthony High, Nordhoff Coach Cliff Farrar had anticipated a close 
game based on the films he had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 He must have seen the wrong films.Senior running back Josh Hawkins, one of the 
area's leading rushers, romped for 256 yards in 15 carries and scored three 
touchdowns as the Rangers (9-3) beat the Saints (9-3) at Clark Field, 35-6. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals next Saturday, Nordhoff will face Santa Ynez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins scored on runs of 12, 97 and 62 yards. Running back Dallan Rigby added 
88 yards in 11 carries, including a 47-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins also had an interception. Quarterback Mike Gardia completed four of 
nine passes for 49 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ranger defense intercepted two of quarterback Josh Zak's passes and sacked 
him six times. Zak, who also lost a fumble, completed 16 of 24 for 264 yards 
and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins scored two touchdowns in the first half as Nordhoff had a 21-0 lead at 
intermission. He then added a 62-yard romp in the third quarter for a 28-0 
lead. The Rangers racked up 417 yards in offense, including 368 on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really excited about our defensive performance," Farrar said. "We made 
big plays at the right times."

WHEN HILL'S TIME COMES FOR NORTHRIDGE, IT'S PRIME TIME; BASKETBALL: HE TAKES 
OVER FOR CHEVALIER AT POINT GUARD IN OPENER TODAY AT UCLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Changing of the guard at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hill steps in for Andre Chevalier as point guard and floor leader of 
the men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the task of replacing Northridge's career scoring leader not daunting 
enough, Hill's coming out is against Tyus Edney and sixth-ranked UCLA at 2 
today at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10 Edney last season averaged 15.4 points and was an All-Pacific 10 
Conference selection. A senior, Edney is quick, flashy and regarded among the 
nation's best players at his position. Hill, workmanlike and relatively 
unpolished, is a junior making his second college start. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has every reason to be uptight, nervous, even a tad scared. At game time, 
he might be all of those. But more than anything else, he says he feels 
prepared. "When I came out of high school my coach would tell me, 'Don't expect 
to be the star player. Just wait, always practice hard and when your time 
comes, be there to deliver,' " Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later, when I'd see him, he'd ask how things were going and I'd say, 'My time 
hasn't come yet, Coach. But I know it will.' I always looked at my junior year 
as my time to shine." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he took the advice to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Averaging not quite 10 minutes of playing time in 54 games as Chevalier's 
understudy, Hill made the most of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He accepted his role and yet at the same time was not resigned to it," 
Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "He continued to work to be better, feeling 
that his day would come." 
</P>
<P>
 Matched against Chevalier during drills, Hill learned through hard knocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My freshman year I was frustrated a lot," Hill recalled. "(Chevalier) was 
always stealing the ball from me. But at the end of each practice he'd pull me 
aside and we'd talk. He'd say, 'Look here, Rob, when you do your spin move, you 
have to keep the ball out in front of you.' . . . That's how I learned." 
</P>
<P>
 By the middle of last season, Hill was holding his own and occasionally 
getting the best of his mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob is a workaholic and he's going to do whatever it takes to get the job 
done," Chevalier said. "Whether he needs to read a book or put in five or six 
hours after practice, he's going to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's work ethic, graciousness and team-oriented approach have endeared him 
to Cassidy, who admits being "a bit partial" to the 6-foot-1 former North 
Hollywood High standout. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof positive is Cassidy's claim that he "would be interested to hear" Hill 
perform rap music. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, as most every Northridge player will tell you, despises rap and 
forbids it to be played around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, whose father runs a recording studio, writes rap music and used to 
perform in a two-man group called "Snoop and Reality." Hill and partner Marcus 
Nash cut one single, entitled "Mary Had a Little Lamb," a song about teen-age 
pregnancy. "At the time, in high school, a lot of our friends were having 
babies at a young age," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were always talking about the mistakes they made, so we wrote about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is inspired to write by activities around him, the experiences of 
friends, or stories he sees on television newscasts. He has never penned about 
what happens on the basketball floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier said Hill's intensity during practice is legendary -- and 
occasionally comical. "He'd miss a jump shot and all of a sudden you'd hear, 
'Make a shot, Rob!' He'd just yell at himself. We'd all be like, 'Man, 
everybody misses a shot.' But that's Rob -- he wants to be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Matadors, steady would suffice. Last season, Hill committed more 
turnovers than he had assists, and at times he appeared to lack confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is anyone who is tough on Robert, it's Robert," said forward Peter 
Micelli, Northridge's top returning scorer. "He always demands the most from 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill acknowledges his tendency to press and says he knows that has to change. 
"At times I hurt myself because I get down and that makes my game go down," he 
said. "I know as point guard I can't show any negativity. The team would catch 
on to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is looking forward to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a great team and (Edney is) a great player," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if he comes in underestimating me, he'll get a surprise."

KILPATRICK AVENGES LOSS TO VALLEY CHRISTIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior tailback Mario Qualls rushed for 134 yards and three touchdowns in 17 
carries Friday as Kilpatrick avenged an early-season loss to Cerritos Valley 
Christian with a 33-14 victory in a Southern Section Division X quarterfinal at 
Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls scored on runs of two, 19 and nine yards, the last giving Kilpatrick 
(10-2) a 26-0 lead in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick will face Montclair Prep in a semifinal next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Christian (9-3) played without sophomore starting quarterback Kirk 
Saarloos, who suffered a possible broken leg while playing defensive back 
during the Mustangs' opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Saarloos' replacement, senior Jon Lee, completed 12 of 24 passes for 135 yards 
and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee hit Trevor Hesner with a three-yard scoring pass to cut the deficit to 
26-7 midway through the fourth quarter, but Edward Lyde followed up with an 
82-yard return for a score on the ensuing kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick fullback Gildardo Hernandez gained 94 yards in 13 carries.

ANDERSON'S 424 YARDS PROPEL MOUNTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Montclair Prep's Akil Anderson certainly isn't feeling any effects from the 
knee injury or concussions that slowed him this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After posting a 231-yard rushing performance last week, the junior tailback 
exploded for 424 yards and four touchdowns to lead Montclair Prep's 50-8 rout 
of Big Bear in a Division X quarterfinal Friday night at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep (9-1) will play Kilpatrick in a semifinal Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who had 125 yards and a touchdown in nine carries by the end of the 
first quarter, had runs of 11, 12, 14 and 52 yards nullified by penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "After tonight's performance, I'm sure I'm 100%," said Anderson, who had 41 
carries and scored on runs of one, two, two and three yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetris Green (one-yard run), Siggy Jackson (six-yard run) and Rashawn Jones 
(40-yard interception return) also scored for the Mounties. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep limited Big Bear (8-3-1) to 112 yards.

 Quartz Hill High Coach John Albee told his team to make each opponent work for 
every yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just what the Rebels did, posting a convincing 21-3 victory over 
Paramount in a Southern Section Division II quarterfinal on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In next Saturday's semifinals, Quartz Hill will play Hart at College of the 
Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jeremiah Harris rushed for 197 yards and two touchdowns in 15 
carries, including a 20-yard scoring run that put Quartz Hill (7-3-2) ahead, 
14-0, in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With no score in the first quarter, quarterback Michael Fletcher of Paramount 
(9-3) threw into the end zone for wide receiver David Trotter, but his pass hit 
Rebel cornerback Monte Reed in the back of the helmet. No face-guarding penalty 
was called. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Harris ran 82 yards to the Pirate four-yard line, setting up 
a five-yard run by quarterback Damein Kendrid. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris closed out the scoring with a 29-yard run late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendrid rushed for 68 yards and completed three of six passes for 29 yards.

 7 Long Beach Poly 0 MAJOR SEMIFINALS 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills, last season's Division VIII champion, protested its move to 
Division I this season. But somebody knew it was the right move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs will play host to Bishop Amat, the nation's No. 1-ranked team, in 
the semifinals of the Division I playoffs next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Division I semifinal, scheduled Saturday, is the much-anticipated 
matchup between Los Alamitos and Mater Dei, the county's No. 1 and No. 2 teams. 
CATCHING UP TO ANOTHER RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Melsby of Los Alamitos set the Orange County career reception record on a 
seven-yard pass from Kevin Feterik with 3 minutes 4 seconds remaining in the 
first half of Friday's game against Long Beach Poly in the quarterfinals of the 
Division I playoffs at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Melsby's second catch of the game, giving him 178 career receptions -- 
one more than the previous record set by George Sagen, who played at Los 
Alamitos from 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into Friday's game, Melsby already held the county career yards 
receiving mark with 2,811, surpassing Rick Parma's record of 2,767 set at 
Kennedy High from 1973-75. THEY PLAY TO THEIR STRENGTH 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout its Division I quarterfinal against L.A. Loyola, when Mater Dei 
needed crucial yardage, the Monarchs went to Steve Bodnar, running behind 
tackle Matt Motherway and guard Kevin Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to go with the guys that brought you here," Mater Dei Coach Bruce 
Rollinson said. "Bodnar played defense, too, and made some key tackles. He 
played about one of the finest games in school history tonight." SETTING GOALS 
</P>
<P>
 Preparation won't be Newport Harbor's downfall. Said Sailor Coach Jeff 
Brinkley: "We've talked about this since before last spring; our goal is to 
play 14 weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Brinkley said balance has been the key to Newport Harbor's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one area of our team falters, another picks it up," he said. "Last week, 
our offense and special teams picked up our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, it was the defense's turn to shine in a 24-8 victory over Brea-Olinda 
in a Division V quarterfinal. The Sailors, in setting a school record for 
victories (12) in a season, allowed only 12 yards rushing and 102 yards 
passing. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no egos. We've got a great, healthy team attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jon Looney, Brea-Olinda coach, on why the Wildcats (8-3-1) were able to get 
as far as they did this season without being star-driven. IT'S ALL IN A NIGHT'S 
WORK 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Roman made his 52nd career start for Laguna Hills Friday against Temple 
City in a Division VIII quarterfinal. The diminutive (5-7) but deceptively 
strong all-purpose player accounted for 170 total yards (87 receiving, 46 
rushing and 37 on punt returns) scored two touchdowns and made five tackles at 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Adam makes plays like that," said teammate Brendan McGraw, the county's 
second-leading rusher, "it takes a lot of pressure off (me)." ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll enjoy this one for about a half-hour then start preparing for who we get 
next. If it's Los Al, that will be a great football game. It will be great for 
the Southern Section and for Orange County. We did our part, so we'll see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruce Rollinson, Mater Dei coach, after the second-seeded Monarchs defeated 
Loyola, 31-7, to reach the Division I semifinals against Los Alamitos. Friday's 
Best

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: FRESHMAN WILLIAMS EXPERIENCED SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shaun Williams would like to say thanks for the memories -- some of them, 
anyway -- and he hopes the next three years bring many more. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi High, where he played tailback as a senior last season, seems like a 
distant memory now that Williams spent most of the 1994 season playing for 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many freshmen know what it's like playing against USC before a 
near-capacity crowd in the Rose Bowl -- let alone making a big play in the 
game. But Williams, who turned 18 in October, made a touchdown-saving tackle in 
the Bruins' 31-19 upset of the Trojans last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing safety in UCLA's nickel package, Williams dragged down Trojan receiver 
Keyshawn Johnson after a 29-yard gain. Four plays later, USC had to settle for 
a field goal and a 6-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried about him cutting back, because he had an angle," Williams 
said. "He was fast. I had to dive-tackle him. I didn't realize until afterward 
that I was the last man. We stopped them after that play." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams made his first college start at free safety at Arizona State the 
previous week, and broke up a would-be touchdown pass in the end zone in a 
59-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Also a strong performer on special teams, Williams made 23 tackles, 15 solo. 
But in a season in which the Bruins finished 5-6, the former Del Rey League 
Most Valuable Player has had to celebrate his progress quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty exciting, having a chance to play," he said. "I needed the 
experience. It's a lot different from high school. And I just want to go out 
and get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of arriving for his first practices last August, Williams 
impressed Coach Terry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, Donahue pondered a move to tailback for Williams while Sharmon 
Shah, Skip Hicks and Deron Washington nursed injuries. Williams, who rushed for 
1,835 yards at Crespi in 1993, had four carries for a net five yards for the 
Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 But down the stretch Williams, 6 feet 2, 185 pounds, became a valuable asset 
in a secondary that featured only one player as tall as 6-0. Coincidentally, 
UCLA won its final three games after losing six in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt pretty good to win," Williams said. "The last two games were really 
exciting. They took away some of the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of depressing that our season's over. I really don't think we were 
a 5-6 team. Hopefully, next season we'll be going to a bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toughing it out: Arizona offensive tackle Joe Smigiel has earned a reputation 
for his toughness as much as his technique during his two years as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past week, he's lived up to that reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was preparing for Friday's showdown against rival Arizona State, with 
a Freedom Bowl bid on the line for Smigiel's Wildcats, the senior from Newbury 
Park endured the wrath of bitter fans and two aching feet. 
</P>
<P>
 He had played sparingly since a fourth-quarter mishap against UCLA on Oct. 22 
produced a compound injury in his lower left leg: a torn muscle behind his 
Achilles' tendon, a sprained ligament at the top of the ankle and a sprained 
ligament between the tibia and fibula. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury was the result of a botched blocking assignment by someone else. 
Smigiel was pinned at the line while running back Gary Taylor plowed into his 
legs from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Smigiel aggravated a joint in his right foot where he had suffered 
a broken bone last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing on the offensive line you've got to worry about are your 
feet," he said. "They're begging me to quit right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The affable Smigiel, a regular guest on a Tucson sports talk show hosted by 
Mike Gabrielson, has pacified dissatisfied callers the past two weeks. 
Criticism over Arizona's failure to win the Pacific 10 Conference championship 
and a Rose Bowl berth is wearing thin on the big lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lady called in screaming and yelling, and I made some derogatory 
comments," Smigiel said. "How could she know that much about football? I don't 
care if they're bitter. It's our football team; it's our season. It takes hard 
work and talent to win it. It also takes a lot of luck." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, picked No. 1 by Sports Illustrated in its preseason poll, were 
4-0 in Pac-10 play until they ran into Rose Bowl-bound Oregon and saw a 9-0 
halftime lead dissolve into a 10-9 loss. Smigiel, injured the week before, 
watched from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Arizona lost, 45-28, at USC. Smigiel played in only three 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 Smigiel hopes to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting looks because I'm 6-5, 290," he said. "It hasn't helped that I'm 
getting hurt. But I'll be somewhere next year, whether it's here, Europe or 
Canada." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Around the Country: Utah senior Curtis Marsh (Simi Valley/Moorpark College) 
ranks second in the Western Athletic Conference in receiving yards per game 
(78.1). He is third in receptions (61) and is tied for first in touchdown 
catches (11). . . . San Diego State sophomore kicker Peter Holt (Antelope 
Valley High), with 136 points, is 10 points from tying Chris O'Brien for second 
place on the Aztecs' all-time kick scoring list. . . . Fresno State senior 
safety Lance Thomas (Crespi) ranks 11th in the WAC in tackles (101). Texas El 
Paso senior safety Brian Vellmure (Camarillo/Moorpark College) is 16th with 91.

WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL PREVIEW / CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE; MATADORS YOUNGER, 
HOPEFULLY BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In three years as Cal State Northridge women's basketball coach, Kim Chandler 
hasn't come close to having a winning season. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 11-58 record with the Matadors includes a 3-22 finish in 1993-94, which 
she attributes to player injuries and the disruption caused by the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to put that behind us," Chandler said. "We need to move on and look 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler promises that barring major injuries, or natural disasters for that 
matter, the 1994-95 campaign will be a good one. She believes key changes will 
contribute to the team's success. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest is the addition of nine freshmen, considered by the coach to be 
the best recruiting class in the program's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is superior athletically to any team we've placed on the floor," 
she said. "More work can be done but we're starting out at a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors also have two new assistants (Jeanette Armentano and Susan 
Malisch) with solid college experience and a new-and-improved conditioning 
program created by Chandler and CSUN assistant track coach Tony Veney. 
</P>
<P>
 Another positive change, Chandler says, is that the Matadors will compete in a 
conference for the first time since moving up from Division II to Division I 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play in the American West Conference along with Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo, Southern Utah and Cal State Sacramento. The league's postseason 
tournament will be held in Cedar City, Utah, March 9-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "A conference makes you feel like you have a home," Chandler said. "It 
establishes rivalries and it's better for players because there's something at 
stake. We're very excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors have three returning starters. Shannon Crouse, who led the team 
with 11.5 points per game and 6.9 rebounds per game as a forward, will start at 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Crouse, a 5-foot-10 junior, played both positions in high school, but was 
recruited as a guard. She was forced to play inside because the team lacked 
frontcourt players. Crouse had a 23 points in a 59-53 victory over Nevada, the 
team the Matadors play today at Reno in their season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really prefer to play (forward)," Crouse said. "I'm not as comfortable at 
guard as I am at (forward), but I'm adjusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Carrie Dormire and Maureen Batiste are the other returning starters. 
Dormire, a 5-11 guard, led the team with 28 three-point baskets as a sophomore 
and is expected to break the school career mark of 51 before she graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 Batiste, a 6-foot center, averaged 7.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maureen is going to be much-more physical with her play," Chandler said. "She 
will control the boards better." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Hagman (Crescenta Valley High), a 5-9 freshman, will start at point 
guard, with two more freshmen -- Pam Karbowski (Santa Rosa Ursuline High) and 
Lisa Vaillancourt (Novato High) -- as her backups. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman averaged 24.4 points per game for Crescenta Valley and set a Southern 
Section record by sinking 13 three-point shots in one game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see improvement in her every day," Chandler said. "The key for her 
will be experience at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Kanika Means, who saw limited playing time last season, is battling for 
the other starting forward position with a pair of freshmen -- Sarah Bell 
(Oakland Holy Names High) and Holly Babcock (Grass Valley Nevada Union High). 
</P>
<P>
 Means, 5-10, averaged 1.6 points and 2.0 rebounds. Bell, 6-1, who received 
honorable mention on Street & Smith's high school All-American team, averaged 
10 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot Babcock, an All-Central Athletic League pick, led her high school 
team to a 27-7 record and the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think talent-wise we were just as good last year," Crouse said. "The 
difference is that we work well together. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a positive outlook, which we haven't had before. We have better 
people overall, on and off the court." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors play their home opener against Northern Arizona on Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's nonconference schedule includes home games against Pepperdine, 
Fresno State and San Diego and road games against UC Santa Barbara and Cal 
State Long Beach.

THOUSAND OAKS TRIES TO DOUBLE UP FOR SECOND WEEK IN A ROW; CROSS-COUNTRY: AFTER 
WINNING BOYS' AND GIRLS' SOUTHERN SECTION TITLES, LANCERS SET SIGHTS ON STATE 
CROWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With last week's results in the record books, the Thousand Oaks High boys' and 
girls' cross-country teams will shoot for their second historic double in 
today's State championships at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers won the Division I boys' and girls' titles in last Saturday's 
Southern Section championships at Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut to become 
the first program to sweep the major-division titles in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, they're favored to become the first program to sweep the 
Division I titles in the State meet, although Coach Jack Farrell is taking a 
low-key approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would probably be important to me after the fact if we win both races," 
Farrell said. "But I'm not thinking about that right now. I'm more concerned 
with the boys and girls as separate teams since they have to run separate 
races." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks boys, the No. 3-ranked team in The Harrier magazine's 
national poll, are heavy favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, paced by the 3-4-5 finish of seniors Keith O'Doherty, Jeff 
Fischer and Kevin Marsden, posted a 29-111 victory over runner-up Peninsula in 
the section championships last weekend. Thousand Oaks' team time of 77 minutes 
9 seconds wiped out the course record of 77:56 the Lancers set in winning last 
year's section title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to believe that (we're) not the best team in the country," 
Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Kingwood (Tex.) defeated Thousand Oaks, 37-44, in the Southwestern 
University Invitational on Oct. 1, but the Lancers were not 100%. Fischer and 
Marsden were running in only their second meet of the season after missing the 
first two races because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Fischer and Marsden have returned to the form that propelled them 
to third- and fifth-place finishes in last year's State championships. Juniors 
Todd Disney and Josh Carolan also have improved. There was only a 26-second gap 
among the Lancers' top five runners last week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' race, San Diego Section champion Vista, Peninsula and defending 
State champion Irvine are expected to give Thousand Oaks its toughest 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, led by runner-up Kim Mortensen, totaled 54 points to turn back 
Peninsula (79) for the Southern Section title last week, but third-place Irvine 
(99) is still considered a threat. The Vaqueros finished fourth in last year's 
section finals before winning the State title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers are not the only local program shooting for a team-title sweep in 
today's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff, led by senior Javier Ramirez and freshman Elaine Canchola, will 
attempt to post upset victories in the Division III boys' and girls' races. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore defeated Nordhoff, 86-140, in the boys' Division III sweepstakes 
race at last month's Mt. San Antonio College Invitational, but the Rangers have 
improved dramatically since. 
</P>
<P>
 They recorded a school-record team time of 79:44 in winning last week's 
section championships, and Ramirez won the individual title with a time of 
15:10 over the three-mile course. In comparison, Nordhoff's team time was 83:42 
in the Mt. SAC Invitational and Ramirez finished third in 15:40. 
</P>
<P>
 Concord Clayton Valley, which posted a faster team time than Thousand Oaks in 
the Mt. SAC Invitational, is an overwhelming favorite in the Division III 
girls' race. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nordhoff Coach Ken Reeves is optimistic about his team's chances. The 
Ranger girls have cut more than seven minutes off their team time since the Mt. 
SAC Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Clayton Valley) has improved, they're awfully scary," Reeves said. "But 
our kids think they can challenge them and I'm not going to tell them anything 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Ramirez and Canchola, several area performers are expected to 
contend for individual titles. Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo and Adalberto 
Sanchez of Capistrano Valley, who finished 1-2 in the Southern Section 
championships, are expected to fight it out for the Division I boys' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez led most of last week's race, but Hernandez was able to catch him in 
the final 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Arce of Palmdale is favored in the Division II boys' race, but Mike 
Stember of team favorite Carmichael Jesuit and John Greene of Agoura also 
appear capable of winning. Greene finished second to Arce in last week's 
section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stember outkicked Brett Strahan of Hart and Arce in the Stanford Invitational 
on Oct. 1, but Arce has defeated Stember twice since. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura, the defending Division I champion, is favored to win 
the Division II girls' race. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz placed fifth, second and first at the Division I level from 1991- 93, 
but Agoura has dropped to Division II this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaluinn Fullove of Louisville, the Southern Section Division IV girls' 
champion, could contend for a top-five finish today. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet begins with the Division IV boys' race at 9 a.m.

FAITH BAPTIST DRAWS REMATCH FOR 8-MAN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The regular season and playoffs apparently served as nothing more than a 
formality for the eight-man football teams at Faith Baptist and Brentwood 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, the Delphic League foes will meet for the 
Southern Section championship, playing today at 1 p.m. at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Baptist (9-1) would love to hand Brentwood (10-0) its first defeat of 
the season and avenge two consecutive losses to the Eagles, including a defeat 
in last year's title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Brentwood beat Faith Baptist, 34-18, after leading, 34-0. 
</P>
<P>
 But quarterback Judd Granzow has Faith Baptist's offense rolling. Faith 
Baptist beat Lone Pine, 52-0, in a semifinal last week with Granzow throwing 
three touchdown passes and running for two more in just one-half of play. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was called because one team led by more than 45 points at halftime.

VENTURA COLLEGE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT; MOORPARK KEEPS HEAD ABOVE WATER, 57-50 
</P>

<P>
 On a night when one of the Twin Towers wobbled, the other stood firm and 
helped Moorpark College defeat Kings River, 57-50, Friday night in a 
first-round game of the Ventura men's basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Foster scored 15 points and grabbed 14 rebounds for Moorpark (3-1) but 
his twin brother, Paul, managed only two points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8 forwards each scored in double figures in the Raiders' previous 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard David Fennel picked up the slack and scored 19 points for 
Moorpark, sinking three three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kings River) really packed it in (defensively)," said Al Nordquist, Moorpark 
coach. "They weren't going to give up anything inside. . . . (Fennel) hit those 
threes when we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark led, 25-10, in the first half but had to hang on for the victory when 
Kings River (1-3) scored six consecutive points to pull to within 53-49 with 1 
minute 12 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Jaime Jaquez had 10 points for Moorpark, which will play Antelope 
Valley in the semifinals tonight at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Blanding had nine points for Kings River. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 132, Compton 58 -- The Pirates (4-0) opened defense of their 
tournament with a blowout victory.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, ranked sixth in the state, has scored 100 or more points in every 
game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates toyed with Compton (0-3) and dazzled the crowd with no-look 
passes, dunks and behind-the-back passes. Eight Pirates scored in double 
digits, including Gerald Zimmerman who had a game-high 17 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Woodard had 16 points for Ventura and Hakeen Ward added 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Reese led Compton with 12 points and teammate Marquis Slemmons had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura will face Santa Barbara in the semifinals tonight at 8. The Vaqueros 
defeated Contra Costa, 79-61. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley 86, Hancock 74 -- The Marauders (3-3) rallied behind guards 
Orville Turner and Brandon McIntire. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner scored 29 points and McIntire had 18. Turner also had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marauders shot 57% from the field (28 of 49) and 71% from the free-throw 
line (20 of 28). 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Kenny Evans scored 19 points for Hancock (2-2).

DIRECTOR MAKES TREK INTO NEW MEDIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The phone is ringing off the hook and scripts from studios are flooding the 
Sherman Oaks home office of "Star Trek: Generations" director David Carson, but 
at the moment, the British-born director is more interested in studying an 
enormous antique wall clock in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 He crouches down on the ground to show a visitor the very bottom of the 
impressive timepiece, built in England in 1720. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that," he says, as though looking at the clock for the first time. 
"See the little piece of mahogany? No doubt it was replaced decades ago because 
in the old houses, the floor would rot upward and then the furniture would need 
to be rebuilt." He stands up and takes a step back admiring the antique. 
"Remarkable piece, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Not unlike the 18th-Century clock, the "Star Trek" film series had in recent 
years begun to show signs of creakiness. But Paramount nonetheless bet on 
Carson, a first-time feature director, who had directed the pilot and two 
episodes of "Deep Space Nine" as well as several episodes of "Star Trek: The 
Next Generation," over several big-name Hollywood directors. 
</P>
<P>
 And like the antique, the film franchise has gained a new appreciation in its 
resilience. Carson has helped infuse the comfy old premise with a head of 
steam, not the least of which was last weekend's opening gross of $26 million. 
The film's debut has turned the 43-year-old director into a hot commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the industry have said to me, 'Why would you want to direct 'Star 
Trek'? Well, the amazing thing about 'Star Trek' is that you have the 
opportunity to tell stories that actually say something about the human 
condition." 
</P>
<P>
 "David is incredibly tenacious," observes "Star Trek: Generations" star 
Patrick Stewart, who plays Capt. Jean-Luc Picard. "I know of no other director 
that has the kind of determination and energy for work that he has. He's 
utterly tireless." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson confesses a passion for the stage and screen that has existed virtually 
his entire life. Raised in Southeast England, Carson remembers the precise 
moment he fell in love with the big screen. "I was taken to see 'Ivanhoe' (with 
Elizabeth Taylor) when I was 4. From then on, I would play knights and damsels 
and stage plays for whoever would listen." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a private all-male English school, he became enamored with the 
theater. After rugby practice one afternoon, he and a mate crashed a play 
audition for the school's production of Moliere's "Tartuffe." Much to their 
surprise, they landed walk-ons, and he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 He continued to act and direct plays while attending Cambridge, earning an 
arts degree in 1972, and not long after founded the London Theatre Company and 
then the Direct Current Theatre Company. He has directed more than 50 plays 
throughout Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980 he moved into television work, earning acclaim for his productions of 
"Sherlock Holmes," "Souvenirs" and the short film "Waiting for Godot." He 
became disillusioned with the paralyzed British film industry and came to Los 
Angeles five years ago without a job or representation in the states. Directing 
gigs on "Star Trek," "L.A. Law," "Northern Exposure," "Homefront" and "Beverly 
Hills, 90210" soon followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson says he prefers living in Los Angeles to England, and would rather 
raise his family here. "People say to me, 'Oh, how can you raise your children 
in L.A. with all that smog and gridlock?' I say, 'Have you driven in Rome or 
London? Have you ever stood on the street and smelled the exhaust fumes from 
leaded petrol?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Carson is married to former British actress Kim Braden; their children are 
Matthew, 12, and Mimi, 6. Braden and the two children appear in "Generations" 
as part of Capt. Picard's imaginary family. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Carson is keeping mum about his next project, it's clear his debut has 
given him a lot of options. His longtime friend Stewart says: "The erroneous 
assumption that those who work in television are somehow less talented than 
those who work in film is the most monstrous snobbery and very unfair to those 
who do extraordinary work in television. I had no doubt very early on in 
production that with David, this was a major film career in the making."

POP BEAT: MC 900 FT JESUS FINDS MORE CONVERTS FOR HIS TALL TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MC 900 Ft Jesus is entering the 11th minute of his surreal monologue "New 
Moon." With squinting eyes and a wide grin, the large, skinheaded performer 
stands on the stage of the Viper Room and strikes a smooth vocal cadence while 
his band contributes minimalist breaths of jazz. The audience is transfixed, 
waiting for the next turn of events in this quirky tale of a speed-demon 
heroine. 
</P>
<P>
 MC 900 Ft Jesus, whose real name is Mark Griffin, has been drawing this kind 
of attention since the release last summer of his album "One Step Ahead of the 
Spider," which marks the Dallas-based Griffin's move from the deep 
industrial/hip-hop underground into the broader alternative-rock world. 
</P>
<P>
 The album reached the Top 5 of the college radio airplay chart, and, after a 
tour in which he headlined the Palace, Griffin is back on the road as the 
opening act for the high-profile Cranberries -- including shows on Tuesday and 
Wednesday at the Wiltern Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin has made his move with a peculiar blend of words and music that falls 
somewhere between rap and the trendy spoken-word style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally I was trying to do something more rap-like, more metered and 
rhymed, but I kept running up against this brick wall of corniness," says 
Griffin, sitting in a Hollywood diner. "It was just hokey. It had a bad, fake, 
beatnik vibe, and I just couldn't make it any better than that. Eventually I 
thought, 'Just tell the story and stop trying to be so clever.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Storytelling is one of the many strengths of "Spider," his third album and 
major-label debut. The 38-year-old Griffin, who looks more like a fresh-faced 
25-year-old, ranges from smoky, seedy drawl to sharp, cynical hiss while 
spinning tales of cranky couch potatoes and car rides into the abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 The music, which is played by up to nine musicians, is cool and laid-back, 
encompassing hip-hop beats, Eastern exotica and Miles Davis-like melodies. 
Griffin, a trained trumpeter, even does Davis' "Stare and Stare" on the album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late-'60s/early-'70s jazz fusion and funk is probably the strongest influence 
in there, then whatever else springs to mind," says Griffin, who also plays 
guitar and keyboards. "That's how I write songs. The more weird, left-field 
ideas I can throw into it, the happier I am. I just dump a whole bunch of stuff 
into the soup and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Cincinnati, Griffin started out playing clarinet, but switched 
to trumpet in sixth grade after listening to his parents' Tijuana Brass albums. 
He got a music scholarship to Kentucky's Morehead State University and, after 
graduating, did his straight time playing commercial jingles, backing Engelbert 
Humperdinck when he appeared in town, and playing at an amusement park in 
Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the season you're playing your part while reading a copy of 
Time magazine," he says of his show-tune gig at King's Island. "You literally 
become a robot, just vaguely aware of the part you're playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated it and had a mini nervous breakdown and moved from Cincinnati to 
Dallas with a friend. I started playing guitar and trying to be conceptual 
artist doing these incredible, obtuse performances that no one would get. They 
were pointless exercises in showing myself how clever I am. That's how I spent 
the '80s, embarrassing myself." 
</P>
<P>
 He then started MC 900 Ft Jesus (the name was inspired by a vision evangelist 
Oral Roberts reported seeing), playing a mechanized, straight-ahead dance sound 
inspired by the many underground singles that came through the record shop 
where he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 He saved enough money to buy a sampler and press 2,000 copies of his own EP. 
The release created a fanzine buzz, and Vancouver-based independent label 
Nettwerk signed him in 1990. He put out two albums for Nettwerk, along the way 
adding real musicians and edging toward the sound that attracted the interest 
of American Recordings, which signed him last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's the oddball appeal of Griffin's music that has elevated him from 
record-store clerk to major-label artist, he strives to keep his work from 
becoming exclusive and obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could make a record of just my esoteric jokes and all the (obscure) things 
I throw in, then say, 'If you don't get it you obviously aren't intelligent 
enough.' But to me that's not the point. I want something that has a groove you 
can get into without even necessarily listening to the words." 
</P>

Wednesday at the Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., 8 p.m. Sold out. (213)

'HOW TO SUCCEED' IN HIGH-TECH; LA JOLLA PLAYHOUSE'S REVIVAL OF THE 1961 HIT IS 
A COMPUTERIZED TECHNO WONDER THAT'S HEADING FOR BROADWAY. THE GIZMOS HAVE 
PROVIDED THE DESIGNERS WITH THE CHALLENGE OF THEIR CAREERS.

 Backstage, it's a jungle of cable and wire, a profusion of panels and tracks, 
props and set-pieces. But the nerve center sits quietly in the corner: a bank 
of five computers that drives the nonstop, high-tech action of the 
Broadway-bound La Jolla Playhouse revival of "How to Succeed in Business 
Without Really Trying." 
</P>
<P>
 With music by Frank Loesser and book by Abe Burrows, Jack Weinstock and Willie 
Gilbert, the 1961 Broadway production of "How to Succeed" won seven Tonys and a 
Pulitzer and today is considered a classic. Robert Morse was catapulted to 
stardom in his portrayal of J. Pierrepont Finch, the conniving corporate 
climber, a role he re-created on film in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Des McAnuff, riding the crest of his enormous success with "The Who's 
Tommy" (which garnered five Tony Awards), has reconvened his "Tommy" creative 
team to dazzle new audiences with their technical brilliance. By all accounts, 
this is a true collaboration of theater artists who genuinely respect each 
other and their chief, McAnuff. 
</P>
<P>
 It was McAnuff's idea to have a "living cyclorama" (the curved blank wall at 
the back of the stage) that could "burst into life." McAnuff wanted to 
re-create a 1961 glass-and-steel office skyscraper. "It struck me that this 
tower was a metaphor for upward mobility, the stratification of the corporate 
class system. . . . I wanted to be able to see the skyline of Manhattan beyond 
the tower, as a context for it, a world beyond the windows. What I got is 
beyond my wildest dreams. It's magical," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he got, courtesy of scenic designer John Arnone, video designers Batwin + 
Robin (Linda Batwin and Robin Silvestri) and lighting designer Howell Binkley, 
was a 26-foot-high video wall, comprising 32 custom-made projection cubes, each 
30 inches high and 40 inches wide. Projected onto these are high-definition 
videos, film, computer graphics and 3-D animation. Special visual effects are 
recorded on eight laser disks, each 26 minutes long. There are 182 automation 
cues (which trigger 1,200 separate scenery moves), 600-700 lighting cues and 
about 40 people backstage engineering the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot larger and much more complex than 'Tommy,' " says Linda Batwin. 
"In my 21 Broadway productions," admits veteran stage manager Frank 
Hartenstein, "this show is the most difficult. Hands down." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after star Matthew Broderick's opening number, the entire video wall 
comes to life: 65 cues for Hartenstein to call in three to four minutes, what 
McAnuff calls the "Through the Looking Glass moment." We see clouds float by 
(later a blimp -- from afar and close up) and, of course, the Manhattan 
skyline. Every time an office floor changes, or an elevator goes up or down, 
the scene outside moves accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most spectacular computer animation, as Megan Mullally gamely sings a 
decidedly retro, housewife-wanna-be number, "Happy to Keep His Dinner Warm," we 
are whisked away, over the bridge and above the rooftops, ultimately swooping 
down on a little suburban dream-cottage. It's breathtaking. But is it, as one 
critic lamented, upstaging the action? 
</P>
<P>
 On and off the record, everyone involved with the production concedes that 
overpowering the action was a major concern. "There's a tendency," says video 
designer Batwin, "whenever you do something that looks great, to do more of it. 
We really worked against that. . . . It's a huge animation scene, but, from 
takeoff to house-landing, it's only 19 seconds, and another 12 seconds around 
the house. We were careful that the big move happened at the very beginning of 
the song. We really feel we accomplished the feat of not overwhelming the song. 
It's very important how you integrate and incorporate the different tools of 
our media." 
</P>
<P>
 This concern is being closely examined as the production prepares to move 
East. The current $1.3-million price tag may balloon to $5 million by the time 
the show hits Broadway. But no one is talking about major changes. Mostly it's, 
as McAnuff puts it, "taking the car back into the shop to tinker with it so 
you'll get another 10 miles per hour out of it." Some of the additional money 
will go into the pit; there were 11 musicians in La Jolla, but there will be 24 
in New York. Also required: New York-scale union contracts, more "swings" to 
cover ensemble actors and a backup for every computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The cinematic techno-wizardry raises another question: Are the boundaries 
between television, video, film and theater being obliterated? "Fact is," 
shrugs McAnuff, "the lines have already been blurred in our everyday lives." 
McAnuff insists that every scene be storyboarded. Scenic designer Arnone 
employed many cinema effects: cross-cutting, fades, close-ups, foregrounding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theater is so dynamic," he says, "it encompasses a lot from its sister art. 
And it's the same in film. We often see theatrical touches. . . . Most shows on 
Broadway are visually oriented; you've got to compete. What's innovative here 
is the creative imagination beautifully integrated with the score. No one 
element stands out. Ultimately, we're all serving the play and the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Says costume designer Susan Hilferty, 'In today's world of MTV, a lot of 
people only listen to music in conjunction with video work. This is one of the 
tools we have at hand. Do we ignore it? . . . Theater can never compete with 
movies or TV. The real thrill of theater is live performers. But the technology 
is fascinating. It could overwhelm, but it can really enhance a live 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting designer Howell Binkley puts it more simply: "I've never seen 
anything like this in the theater before. It's a groundbreaking event, and 
audiences love it." 
</P>
<P>
 * The sellout production closes Dec . 4 at the La Jolla Playhouse, then moves 
on to a January-February run at the Kennedy Center in Washington. A March 
opening is set for New York's Richard Rodgers Theatre, formerly the 46th Street 
Theatre, where the original musical opened in 1961.

 Holiday Cheers and Jeers: The five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend is far 
from over, but Universal Pictures may have reason for indigestion. Its new 
comedy, "Junior," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito and Emma 
Thompson, appears to have stumbled out of the starting gate. After two days of 
release (Wednesday and Thursday), the Ivan Reitman-directed film about a man 
who becomes pregnant is running in fourth place behind films that have been 
playing for weeks. In first place so far is Disney's Tim Allen holiday comedy, 
"The Santa Clause," which had two-day grosses approaching $7 million. In second 
place is Paramount's "Star Trek: Generations," followed by Warner Bros.' 
"Interview With the Vampire." Industry sources say that "Junior," which is 
playing on fewer screens than the top three, still could climb higher as 
moviegoers finish off their leftovers and venture out for the long holiday. 
Still, they note, the film will likely not be a blockbuster as some had 
predicted, perhaps because Schwarzenegger is not playing his usual 
action-filled role. The total five-day weekend gross could beat out the biggest 
Thanksgiving holiday weekend take ever, 1992's $134 million. Last year, movies 
brought in $106 million for the period. CLASSICAL MUSIC

 Vatican Recordings: Previously unknown solo recordings by famed Polish pianist 
Mieczyslaw Horszowski, who died in 1993 at the age of 100, have been released 
in a two-CD anthology by the label Pearl Gemm. The selections, including an 
hourlong 1940 recital from the Vatican, coupled with live American recitals 
from 1957-1979, represent some of the virtuoso's earliest known recorded 
performances. The recordings, miraculously saved from a Vatican trash heap, 
were discovered after Horszowski's death, when his wife, Bice, 61, uncovered a 
diary dating back to 1940 and detailing the pianist's Vatican recital for Pope 
Pius XII. The diary also revealed that Horszowski had made recordings for 
Vatican Radio. The Vatican later acknowledged that it had the recording, and 
that the tape had been saved from a trash heap a year earlier when a visiting 
musician happened to notice it and pleaded that it be saved. TV & VIDEO

SHUTTERBUG PUTS CELEBRITY PHOTOGRAPHY IN FOCUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've always been a bit baffled and bemused by the lionization of celebrity 
photographers who, like all of us weekend shutterbugs, dumbly (OK, smartly) 
point that little mechanical eye at their subject and push the button. With all 
the hoopla, you'd think they had hand-painted those stark, shadowy images 
instead of merely adjusting the exposure on their high-tech Brownies, pointing 
and clicking. So, when I see a high-toned review of photographer doyenne Annie 
Leibovitz's current show at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art 
("Retrospective Examines a Photojournalist's Art," Nov. 21) and her anointment 
as a major chronicler of pop culture during the last two decades, I say -- hey, 
so am I. 
</P>
<P>
 You should see the snapshots of my Uncle Izzie and Aunt Clara slurping tomato 
soup at their kitchen table back in 1971. And 10 years later, there's the shot 
of my little second cousin, Zack, banging his pudgy fingers on my 1980 
communications icon, the IBM Selectric. But the piece de resistance came in 
1992 when I managed to capture a shot of my infant daughter Kelsey drooling a 
breast-milk epaulet on the shoulder of my wife's black sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll grant you, Leibovitz has snapped off a few good ones herself. That 
well-known shot of Whoopi Goldberg in a bathtub full of moo juice was pretty 
riveting. And the one with John Lennon scrunched in fetal nudity next to Yoko 
-- which, I gather, was his idea -- got a lot of attention. The photographer 
also knows how to do those imperfection-glorifying, dermatological close-ups of 
famous faces -- but my skin specialist could do as well. And, honestly, if you 
put me in the same room with the Rolling Stones, I could manage to capture a 
pout or sneer with the best of them. 
</P>
<P>
 So what, in fact, makes Leibovitz so special? According to the review, "she 
pushes the envelope just far enough to achieve density." Whatever that means. 
To me, it's more that she's had incredible access all her professional life and 
made the most of it. 
</P>
<P>
 I know, I know. Leibovitz and other celebrity Nikonmeisters are masters of 
lighting, masters of mood. But isn't that kinda what happens in those photo 
booths at the mall? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it's not unusual for a professional photographer to use up a dozen 
rolls of film in a single shooting -- that's 432 shots of 36-exposure film! -- 
to get one good photo. Think of it, 432 chances to get one of them to come out 
right. Is there anyone out there who doesn't think he or she, with a little 
practice and some decent sunshine, could do as well?

THE BALLAD OF DIANE WARREN, SONGWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diane Warren, a hugely successful songwriter who's had 25 Top 10 singles, is 
convinced there's something almost supernatural about her career choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't a choice, actually," says Warren, whose compositions have been 
recorded by everyone from Barbra Streisand to Michael Bolton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I willed myself into being a songwriter. I was in love with the idea 
of being a songwriter when I was 11 -- drawn to it in some way I really don't 
understand, before I really knew what it meant. Maybe it's some weird mystical 
thing -- who knows? Anyway, I got serious about songwriting when I was 14 -- 
writing three songs a day. Unfortunately, they all sucked." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then she's honed her skills just a bit. The 38-year-old Valley Girl, who 
writes both lyrics and music, has an impressive list of credits dating back to 
her first hit, Laura Branigan's "Solitaire" in 1982 -- her big break after 
years of rejections. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hit-list highlights include Michael Bolton's "Time Love and Tenderness," 
El DeBarge's "Rhythm of the Night," Starship's "Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now," 
Bad English's "When I See You Smile," Celine Dion's "If You Asked Me To" and 
even Milli Vanilli's "Blame It on the Rain." Her latest single is "Dream Away," 
the theme from the new Macaulay Culkin movie "The Pagemaster," performed by 
Babyface and Lisa Stansfield and expected to be a big year-end hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what makes Warren so good? 
</P>
<P>
 Producer David Foster, who has recorded several Warren compositions, including 
"Dream Away," explains: "She takes everyday situations and turns them into hit 
songs. She takes the stuff we all relate to on a daily basis and puts it to 
music and creates a very good song. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I've recorded her songs, there's always some little magical turn that 
really heightens the song for me. Part of what makes her so good is sheer hard 
work. Without a doubt she's the hardest working songwriter I've ever met." 
</P>
<P>
 Most days, the prolific Warren can be found at her office in the Valley, 
working on songs -- ballads mostly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not that into up-tempo stuff," she explains one night during dinner in 
West Hollywood. "I like those big, dramatic ballads with the pretty melodies -- 
ballads that give you a really soaring, uplifting feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's written in different genres, like pop and rock, she has a 
distinct favorite. "I love R&B more than anything," gushes Warren. "I write a 
lot of R&B-styled music because I think that kind of music is filled with more 
feeling than any kind of pop music." 
</P>
<P>
 That passion for R&B -- classic Motown music in particular -- is traceable to 
her early addiction to Top 40 radio, which she cites as her major songwriting 
influence. "As a kid I didn't have a lot of friends," she recalls. "The radio 
-- Top 40 radio -- was my main friend. I'd lose myself in those songs. They had 
such incredible power over me that they made me want to write songs with that 
kind of power to move people." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, songwriting is more than just a job for Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm possessed, obsessed about songwriting," says Warren, clenching her fists 
for effect. "I never really wanted to be a singer -- like so many other 
songwriters. I'm strictly a songwriter. And if I couldn't write songs I'd 
probably jump off a bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that obsession, Warren, who grew up in the Northridge/Van Nuys 
area, regards her days at Birmingham High and her tenures at Pierce College and 
Cal State Northridge largely as a waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't learn much," she says. "I was consumed with trying to be a better 
songwriter. People ask me about my life goals, and the answer is simple -- I 
just want to be a better songwriter. I'm striving to do that all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And she prefers to do it alone. Although she's done some collaboration -- with 
Michael Bolton in particular -- Warren doesn't like it that much. "I like the 
writing process -- even though it's painful and torturous at times," she 
explains. "When I write with other people the experience is different. You have 
to compromise, which I have problems with. I'd rather listen to my own mind." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as she loves songwriting, Warren admits it's not all fun. There are 
some headaches -- like rejection for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really sucks ," she says, spitting out the words. "When I was starting 
out, my songs were getting rejected all time before I got the break with 
writing for Laura Branigan. Even now everything I write doesn't work. Rejection 
hurt then and hurts now." 
</P>
<P>
 Songwriters get lyrics changed all the time, but Warren still isn't accustomed 
to it. "I'm so fussy, so meticulous about every line," Warren explains. "If 
somebody indiscriminately changes my lyrics and melody, it drives me crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although her obsessive approach to composing has made Warren rich, it does 
have one particular drawback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have much of a life outside of writing," she admits rather ruefully. 
"I go to work everyday and write and write and write. I've never been married 
because I'm not good at relationships. Whoever I'm with is always going to be 
second to what I love -- which is songwriting." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she seems gregarious and perfectly at ease, Warren insists she's not 
a "people" person and is always just one step from being a hermit. "I'm a real 
loner," she says. "A lot of the time I hate dealing with people. What I really 
love is animals. I have lots of them. I feel closer to animals than people most 
of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what keeps her from slipping into the life of a hermit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for songwriting, I might just shut people out," she admits. "But 
people provide a certain stimulus I need to write. I might be happier sitting 
around my house with cats and parrots all day, but it would hurt my songwriting 
-- and if I wasn't writing good songs I'd probably go nuts."

IMPRESSIVE BOWS FOR TLC AND SINATRA 
</P>

<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The hip-hop vocal trio TLC is back with its second album, "CrazySexyCool," 
which entered the chart impressively, at No. 15. A hit single, "Creep" (No. 8 
on the pop singles chart), is boosting album sales.The Plant/Page project "No 
Quarter" may be a flash-in-the-pan. After debuting at No. 4 last week, the 
album by the former Led Zep members slipped to No. 11. The Madonna plunge 
continues. Her "Bedtime Stories" dropped from No. 16 to No. 24. Pop singles: 
Boyz II Men's "I'll Make Love to You" was barely out of the No. 1 spot before 
another of the vocal group's singles took over. "On Bended Knee" is the new pop 
singles champ. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frank Sinatra's "Duets II" jumped on the chart at No. 16. If it goes higher 
next week, that's a good indication that the album will be a hit. Detractors 
have been saying that the first one was a big seller largely because of its 
novelty value. So far it seems as if the novelty hasn't worn off. Pop Album

JAPANESE GROUP HOPES 'SWAN' SONG WILL FLY IN AMERICA; POP MUSIC: DREAMS COME 
TRUE, DEBUTING IN THE U.S. MARKET WITH 'THE SWAN PRINCESS' THEME, IS ONE OF 
MANY BANDS TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Japanese pop group Dreams Come True debuted six years ago, its 
members thought about opening in London rather than in their own country. With 
a female lead singer and a soulful sound inspired by artists such as Marvin 
Gaye and Sarah Vaughan, the band seemed an improbable entrant into a music 
scene here that was then dominated by male bands and syrupy love songs rooted 
in enka, the traditional Japanese ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dreams shook Japan's music world with its distinctive sound and went on to 
become hugely popular -- producing three of the nation's top five best-selling 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the trio -- lead vocalist Miwa Yoshida, bassist Masato Nakamura and 
keyboardist Takahiro Nishikawa -- is poised for another improbable challenge: a 
debut in the American market as the first Japanese pop group to compose and 
perform a theme song for a major U.S. film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our real dream is to export Japanese pop music overseas," says Nakamura, 36, 
the band's driving force who composes the music with Yoshida and arranges it. 
"Just as Americans pay attention to British (music) charts, I hope they pay 
attention to Japanese charts in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The group wrote and performed the song "Eternity," in English, as the ending 
theme for the $40-million animated feature film "The Swan Princess." The film 
by Nest Entertainment and Rich Animation Studios -- touted as an upstart new 
challenger to the Disney animation empire -- opened in 1,500 U.S. theaters a 
week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eternity" is being released as a single with "Swan's" major theme song, "Far 
Longer Than Forever," a love duet performed by Regina Belle and Jeffrey 
Osborne. Dreams has also produced a music video shot in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nest and Sony Wonder -- the family entertainment division of Sony's Epic 
Records, which is producing the soundtrack -- banking on a Japanese pop group 
virtually unknown outside Japan may seem risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Japanese instrumentalists have found international success, such 
as New Age synthesist Kitaro or saxophonist Sadao Watanabe, Japanese pop groups 
rarely have succeeded in the American market. Two of Japan's biggest pop stars, 
Seiko Matsuda in the 1980s and the female duo Pink Lady in the late 1970s, both 
tried and bombed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakamura said his generation is the first to be raised only on Western music, 
rather than the traditional enka or military songs. As a result, he said, Japan 
is only now beginning to produce musicians with international appeal, including 
a current wave of contemporary acts that is garnering success. The all-girl 
group Shonen Knife has a strong alternative rock following in the United 
States, and the pop trio Pizzicato Five is receiving critical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is every Japanese artist's dream to translate domestic success into 
success in the U.S. The reality, however, is that it just hasn't happened in 
the history of music in a serious and sustained way," said Mark Joseph, who 
works with several Japanese musicians as president of MJM Entertainment Group 
Inc. in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the global entertainment world of the 1990s, where Japan has emerged as 
an important supplier of capital, markets and distribution networks, it was 
only a matter of time before the Japanese would contribute musical talent as 
well, industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in what may be the start of a trend, another Japanese pop superstar 
group, Chage & Aska, will also debut in the U.S. market this year -- using the 
very same vehicle of an ending theme song for an American film. 
</P>
<P>
 The male duo, which claims Japan's second-biggest album sales after Dreams and 
excels in dishing up hit singles, performs the ending theme song, "Something 
There," for the $38-million action film "Street Fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the popular video game, the film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and is 
set for release by Universal Dec. 23, with Sony's TriStar handling 
international distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Chage & Aska, who wrote and perform the song in English, are almost assured of 
wide public exposure. The soundtrack, on Priority Records, features rapper 
Hammer and football star Deion Sanders teaming up for the main theme, "Straight 
to the Feet," along with other tracks by Ice Cube, Public Enemy and LL Cool J. 
The video, featuring the Japanese group and the American rappers, is set for 
release on MTV later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the initial overture came from the Japanese side. Sony's Epic, 
in negotiating for rights to the "Swan Princess" soundtrack, offered up Dreams, 
its most successful Japanese act, as a potential contributor. Chage & Aska were 
approached by Capcom Co. Ltd., the Japanese firm that created the Street 
Fighter video game and put up 100% of the film's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides stress that signing on a Japanese pop group was not a condition of 
the distribution or financing deals for either movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "This started out as a way first to have a good song to benefit the picture, 
with added marketing spin in Japan and the rest of the world," said Matt Mazer, 
Nest's executive vice president. " 'Swan Princess,' to be financially 
successful, must perform in the world market. To add an international group 
makes the picture more cosmopolitan." 
</P>
<P>
 For "Street Fighter," Capcom executive Akio Sakai said the firm wanted a 
Japanese artist because the video game itself uses characters such as sumo 
wrestler E. Honda and the karate fighter Ryu. Executives say they also wanted 
to boost the film's appeal by featuring music other than rap, which is not 
particularly popular in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Capcom approached Chage & Aska not only because of the group's popularity in 
Japan but also in Asia. In the last year, the duo has begun performing 
regionally in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong; it also licenses several songs 
to be translated and sung in the Chinese language by local Chinese groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But to venture into the American market, the most tantalizing and competitive 
pop music arena in the world, is no easy task. And Japanese music executives 
are said to have become more cautious about trying after the high-profile 
failures of Matsuda and Pink Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Piggybacking onto an American film is regarded as a safer way to enter, 
industry analysts say. "I think there is a justifiable sensitivity, a 
hypersensitivity, in the Japanese market about trying to enter the world 
entertainment market. If this were a French group or English group, no one 
would notice," one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three Dreams musicians themselves, they dream of being recognized for 
their work not as "Japanese" but simply as good music. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than Japanese artists, we'd like to be accepted by Americans as artists 
who happen to live and write their music in Japan," Nakamura said in a recent 
interview. "We'd like to become a group about whom Americans talk about us and 
say, 'What nationality are they?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dreams may come closer to that goal than any other Japanese pop group so far. 
For starters, their musical influence is decidedly American. Nakamura's 
greatest inspiration was the '70s soul of Earth Wind & Fire, Marvin Gaye and 
Barry White; even today, he says his string arrangements are still inspired by 
White. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida, 29, a pint-sized performer who packs a powerful voice, was mesmerized 
by the penetrating force and feeling of Aretha Franklin and other female soul 
vocalists. She went to high school with the band's third member, Nishikawa, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hooked up with Nakamura after Yoshida met him six years ago at a live 
band session. After signing with Sony's Epic label, they scored several major 
hits with theme songs for TV dramas and commercial product campaigns -- a 
common way bands get exposure in Japan, where radio stations and TV music shows 
are still strikingly limited. 
</P>

 As their albums soared beyond the million mark, the trio hit superstardom with 
their fifth album in 1992, "The Swinging Star," which sold 3.7 million and 
stands as Japan's all-time best-selling album. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked whether the world is ready to accept songs in the Japanese language, 
Nakamura is succinct: "No." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has stockpiled four tracks in English with an eye toward eventually 
releasing a worldwide version of its music. One of them, "Wherever You Are," 
was co-written and performed with Maurice White of Earth Wind & Fire fame, and 
hit the top of the charts after release in March.

FOCUSING ON A FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH FOR THE ON-AIR TALENT; TELEVISION: A VIDEO 
CAMERA IN USE AT MORE THAN 30 STATIONS WILL ELECTRONICALLY BREATHE NEW LIFE 
INTO THE CAREERS OF AGING NEWS ANCHORS, ACCORDING TO INVENTORS.

 Imagine looking five, 10, maybe even 15 years younger without having to use 
messy creams, painful collagen injections, plastic surgery or even makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 That day is here. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem: It only works when you appear on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 An Emmy Award-winning video camera currently in use at more than 30 stations 
across the country will electronically breathe new life into the careers of 
many aging news anchors, according to those responsible for inventing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One anchor in her 50s at a TV station in the Midwest was so amazed at the 
transformation that now she won't go on the air without it," said Greg Pine, 
marketing manager of Broadcast Television Systems, one of the largest 
manufacturers of professional broadcasting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 While age and experience give an anchor a desired credibility with his or her 
audience, viewers do not want to see their trusted news person grow old, Pine 
said. From the perspective of his customers, he added, ratings and revenue can 
be affected by such perceptions. And with the images on TV screens getting 
larger and sharper, viewers are able to see more clearly each wrinkle, spot and 
blemish on a news anchor's face. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, stations have used filters, fine mesh nets behind the camera 
lens, even Vaseline to soften the harsh effects of video on their news 
personalities. But though such gimmicks can make a person look somewhat better, 
they also fuzz up the news set. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer technology in the "fountain-of-youth camera," on the other hand, 
adjusts the skin tone and smoothes out the look of just the faces, while 
leaving the background and the set unchanged. Lines and wrinkles on the 
forehead and around the eyes and mouth are diminished, dark or blotchy spots 
and patches blend evenly into the rest of the face, even a man's 5-o'clock 
shadow becomes an unnoticeable 1-o'clock shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Kube, engineering manager at WFAA-TV, an ABC affiliate in Dallas that 
replaced 11-year-old studio cameras with six of the BTS models about a year 
ago, said that the cameras are so much better that viewers and staffers have 
commented mostly on how much better the whole picture looks. But he confirmed 
that wrinkles on the faces of the anchor people are lessened when they appear 
on camera -- and anything a station "can do to make a newscast look better will 
certainly help ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the anchors do like it," Kube said. "Before, they were prone to comment 
about how old they looked on video, and that really bothered them. Now they 
aren't complaining anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 BTS didn't invent the technology. RCA was developing a similar system 10 years 
ago, but the company left the television equipment business in 1985 before 
getting it on the market. Ikegami Electronics, one of BTS' major competitors, 
actually beat BTS by about a year with a camera that makes people appear more 
youthful. That camera is part of the reason Dan Rather looks better on the "CBS 
Evening News" set than he does when out in the field or when anchoring "48 
Hours," which is shot on a different set with a different camera. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ikegami camera works on only one person at a time and it must be 
operated manually. The BTS camera, which sells for about $100,000, can 
simultaneously adjust the appearance of two people -- two anchors sitting 
side-by-side, for example -- and it works automatically at the push of a button 
(or manually, for finer shading and contouring). 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences awarded a technical Emmy 
to both BTS and Ikegami for this camera technology. 
</P>
<P>
 No station in Los Angeles has purchased the camera, but Pine said he is in 
negotiations with a couple of them. So if your favorite elder statesman 
suddenly starts to look less like your grandfather, you'll know why -- although 
generally the hues and contours of the anchor person's face are adjusted 
gradually over a month or two so that the change comes about subtly and almost 
imperceptibly, sort of like Grecian Formula. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obviously not as extreme as Max Headroom -- the fictional, 
computer-generated TV newsman. But it is, in a sense, altering reality in a 
place where truth, not artifice, is supposed to be paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 BTS executives argue that cameras have nothing to do with editorial decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is artifice, then so is using makeup, or lighting the set in a 
certain way, or a director using a longer shot on somebody rather than getting 
in for a close-up," said Skip Ferderber, a BTS spokesman. "It's not faking 
anything. Making people look better is simply a part of the art of production." 
</P>
<P>
 KFAA's Kube agreed. "It's really nothing more than a really good makeup job," 
he said.

ART REVIEW; A GOOD MOTIVE WITH MIXED RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Achieving mediocrity may be a bureaucratic virtue, but it is not an artistic 
one. An exhibition of 13 lesser-known local artists raises the point. Called 
"Take 2," it's a collaborative effort between USC's Fisher Gallery and the 
nearby California Afro-American Museum in Exposition Park. It's also part of 
LAX/94, the second installment of a citywide biennial celebration of the visual 
and performing arts. A celebration, being like a party, induces generosity and 
inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the grip of such effusive emotion, there's a tendency to want to give a 
break to artists who are unfairly ignored. In this equation, "unfair" becomes 
equated with "ignored." The standard of selection then becomes a search for 
artists nobody else wants to show, forgetting that there may be jolly good 
reason to leave them in peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The work here isn't terrible, but it is divided both between two galleries and 
two awkward aesthetic polarities. One large fraction belongs to the tradition 
of abstract modernism. Its ideas and masters are so well established it 
virtually belongs to the past. Wringing a new insight from such a mature 
concept is very tough. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Falkenstein is certainly the best-known veteran artist on view. Justly 
admired for her metal sculpture and gates, here she paints. Her imagery 
combines modernist figuration in the tradition of Matisse, with rather timid 
borrowings from contemporary underground graffiti muralists. The graft doesn't 
take. It does, however, point to the exhibition's stated theme. It intends to 
reflect the state of the Angeltown psyche after the traumas of riot, earthquake 
and fiscal erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Abstract art leans more to universal than literal themes. Seeing this one in 
other practitioners requires pretty fancy mental contortions. Yvonne Cole Meo 
shows a series of rust-colored monoprints. The first is divided into four areas 
of contorted lines. Following sheets show these shapes consumed in agitated, 
flame-like brushwork. At a stretch the suite could represent the conflagration 
of a human brain, but that's too programmatic. The work has enough problems of 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Nicholas-Booth makes a familiar form of abstraction by juxtaposing 
rectangles of various paint and metal textures. Sue Dirksen gets a little 
dynamism into "Emergence" by carrying a spiked projectile shape across 13 
mottled tan panels. 
</P>
<P>
 All artists in the exhibition happen to be women. No great point is made of 
this, which is as it should be. There is, however, considerable emphasis on 
home, nurturing and the protection of children among those artists dealing in 
graphic themes. 
</P>
<P>
 They make up that fraction belonging to the future. The talent is raw and 
looks unschooled. It tends to recall the Social Realism of the 1920s and evoke 
artists like Ben Shahn, Philip Evergood and Romare Bearden, but without any 
sense of conscious quotation. There is no reasonable way to respond to such 
work except with patience. It has simply not arrived where it is headed. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of these artists are wedged between what is concluded and what is to 
come. Memory plays a large role in photographic prints by Dorothy Braudy. They 
concentrate on pet dogs and zoo animals, often quite touchingly. Their subtle 
melancholy is jarringly contradicted by a polemical concept piece centering 
around a big game hunter confirming that the great tusked elephant he has just 
shot is truly dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two artists are well down the path to artistic sophistication. Marina Moevs' 
paintings bring a hint of Edvard Munch's decadence to scenes of ordinary 
suburban landscape. Alysse Stepanian paints patterned domestic interiors 
overlaid with architectural plans and lettering. They are a curious combination 
of reflection and force, of forbearance and analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Others hover somewhere between Expressionism and folk art. A wonderful comic 
energy informs Cynthia White's scenes of domestic life. Franceska Schifrin 
lives part time in Haiti. Anger and mourning show in her images of dead kids 
among the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 These days nobody knows where the world or its art is headed. Clearly artists 
here have feelings about an aesthetic that confronts and shapes reality. If 
they haven't yet fashioned the visual language that makes it relevant, well, 
neither has anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participants include Toni Love, Sheila Batiste, Phoebe Beasley and 
Shirley Levine.

 As an ardent supporter of the Fund for the Feminist Majority and the important 
work it does on behalf of abortion rights, I attended their comedy fund-raiser 
at which Roseanne appeared ("A Rose Is a Rose, but Not Roseanne," Nov. 19). Her 
"act" was one of the grossest displays of egocentricity I have ever seen.Not 
only did she not bother to prepare any material -- clearly she thought her 
presence was enough to entertain the audience -- she also did not bother to 
figure out who she was addressing. 
</P>
<P>
 At an event that was subtitled "feminists do have a sense of humor," she 
presented one of the ugliest displays of male-bashing I have ever witnessed. 
And she attacked the men who have not only shown support of women's issues but 
many of whom have been on the front lines of the abortion issue defending a 
woman's right to reproductive freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been proud to call myself a feminist for more than 20 years. In doing 
so, I have fought to erase the stigma and misconception that feminists are "men 
haters." The feminists I know respect and appreciate men and value their 
support. It was clear from her vitriolic and pathetic display that Roseanne 
does not hate men. She hates herself.

 Re Kenneth Turan's characterization of William Shatner as an alumnus of the 
Klingon Academy of Dramatic Arts (" 'Star Trek': We've Gone This Way Before," 
Nov. 17): 
</P>
<P>
 In episode after episode of "Star Trek," Shatner's dramatic renditions 
captivated the Trekker audience! Consider his electrifying reading of the 
Preamble to the Constitution in "The Omega Glory," which should be required 
viewing in every classroom in America. Or his mesmerizing dual role as the good 
and evil halves of Capt. Kirk in "The Enemy Within."Or his gripping portrayal 
of a frustrated female in the body of Capt. Kirk in "Turnabout Intruder." 
</P>
<P>
 In many instances, he enhanced an already intriguing plot; in others he 
enlivened an otherwise lackluster story. But, always, his acting was a crucial 
component of the heart and soul of "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Shatner distinguished himself in a myriad of riveting roles outside 
of "Star Trek," such as a homicidal schizophrenic camp counselor on "The 
Fugitive" and a neurotic airline passenger combatting an alien gremlin on "The 
Twilight Zone."

</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa has won only three league games in three seasons, but Ferguson, at 
23 the youngest head coach in the county, is a voice of optimism. "We believe 
we are a playoff-bound team," he said. "A lot of coaches told me this is the 
worst place for a coach to be--a coach's graveyard. But I look at it the other 
way, that this is the best place for me to be. I've got great kids with a great 
work ethic." Because the Mustangs won't be very tall, Ferguson is emphasizing 
pressure defense. Freeman is the best rebounder and is a good low-post 
defender. Carmon, a transfer from Tustin, is an "unbelievable defender," 
Ferguson said. Ogo, the point guard, is also a strong defender. Ferguson 
believes Weeks, the team's best all-around player, and Montoya could be among 
the county's 10-best three-point shooters. More toughness will be added by 
Crenshaw, Chatman and Reeves, who played for the football team. Crenshaw, in 
particular, will challenge for a starting spot.

 Aliso Niguel played only seven games against varsity teams last 
season--defeating Marina and Calvary Chapel and losing the rest--but Goldstone 
believes the Wolverines will be able do well immediately in the league. Aliso 
Niguel played each team, except Estancia, in the summer and defeated them all. 
"Summer's summer, but we know we can compete with these guys," Goldstone said. 
"We match up pretty well in the league. I think this is a good place for us to 
start out." Bragassa, the Wolverines' best player, is a former point guard who 
can drive to the basket with either hand. He's also a good outside shooter and 
a strong defender. Orlando Campbell, a sophomore who might start at the point, 
and his older brother, Will, provide quickness. Mulkay and Valenti will battle 
for playing time at off-guard, Langan and Daniel at small forward and Schafer 
is the center.

Demitrius Zeigler and school assist record holder Ali Amiri. Dinneen is going 
with a young team out of necessity and he is especially excited about the two 
freshmen, Sears and Palmer, who he says might be among the best freshmen in the 
county. "They certainly look like freshmen, but they play a lot older," he 
said. Both are quick and should fit in nicely in the Trojans' pressure defense 
and get-it-up-the-floor offense. Palmer is the point guard; Sears is a wing. 
McKee, a defensive end on the football team, provides bulk inside and Scoggin

 After a rare off-year, missing the playoffs for the first time since 1988, the 
Artists expect to again cause problems in league. It's a small, deep team that 
should help Fleming's penchant for pressure defense and fast breaks. Three 
starters, Beimfohr, Orsborn and Redford, and Bloch, who was moved to the 
varsity late, are back from a team that was peaking as the season ended. 
Pivaroff, out with a knee injury last year, also returns, giving Fleming a 
reason for optimism. He'll quickly find out how good his team is. Its nonleague 
schedule could include Woodbridge, Lakewood, Servite and Santa Ana Valley. 
"It's stupid, I guess, but I would rather play a tough schedule and find out 
where we're at," Fleming said.

 After Estancia, the league race appears to be open, and along with everyone 
else, Laguna Hills is ready to stake its claim. Brown said the program has been 
boosted by an infusion of players who have played extensive youth basketball. 
Mike Scaglione, a second-team, all-league selection, is expected to be one of 
the league's top players. "It's just a matter of him deciding to go after it 
and maintain a strong work ethic all the time, which he seems to be doing," 
Brown said. Scaglione is joined by players from a junior varsity team that 
finished fourth in league but shows potential to be better, Brown said. "We 
feel we've made great strides, but we won't know that for sure until we are 
able to produce on the court," he said. Morton, who probably will start at the 
point, Gonzales, Bishopp, Tom Scaglione and Phan provide a solid nucleus. 
Makakaufaki, who is the first freshman to make a varsity in Brown's 26 seasons 
at Fountain Valley and Laguna Hills, is an exceptional passer and will push for 
a starting spot. "Everyday in practice is a treat," Brown said. "I think they 
really do feel that they are going to have a good season."

 The Eagles have the size, the skill and the depth to get mentioned as one of 
the county's top teams, so, of course, Estancia should be the class of the 
league. Six players who started at some point last season are back and are 
joined by the best from the junior varsity that won its fifth consecutive 
league title. If Parsel chooses, Estancia could start Byrne, Pierson and 
Candlish--6 feet 8, 6-7 and 6-6--on a front line that would tower over any 
league opponent. Plock, MVP of the junior varsity, Richardson, Feeney and Novak 
provide depth at guard and Foster, a transfer from Irvine by way of Newport 
Harbor, is a strong swingman. "We've got a little bit of everything," Parsel 
said. "We've got some pretty good ballhandlers and we've got some muscle 
inside. On paper there are not too many teams that stack up with us. I'd like 
to be a little more humble about it, but I want to be honest. If we play up to 
our potential, we are going to be very tough to beat."

CHINESE FEAST ON HOLIDAY DINNER; THANKSGIVING: EXCHANGE STUDENTS ARE PUZZLED BY 
CRANBERRIES, BUT ENJOY SPECIAL MEAL SERVED AT A CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The woks sizzled as cooks stir-fried corn and carrots in the parish kitchen 
Friday night. Volunteers scooped the vegetables onto paper plates with a 
generous serving of pork-fried rice and a steaming bowl of winter melon soup to 
round out the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there were turkey and cranberries. After all, this was a 
traditional Thanksgiving dinner, even if it came a day late. 
</P>
<P>
 For their first Thanksgiving meal, 74 Chinese exchange students and their 
eight teachers feasted on almost-typical holiday fare. Though many of them had 
never eaten turkey before, and the cranberries seemed to mystify them, there 
were few leftovers. Hungry junior high schoolers don't leave many scraps. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, part of the first large-scale exchange program between mainland 
China and the Los Angeles Unified School District, were the guests of the 
Chinese Christian Alliance Church in Northridge, whose members hoped the dinner 
would help the children understand the importance of Thanksgiving in the Unites 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to tell them the meaning of Thanksgiving," said pastor Fred D. Khong. 
"We come together once a year to give thanks to God. Everything we have we owe 
to the creator." 
</P>
<P>
 The meal came only four days after one of the students, Bin-Feng Zheng, 12, 
was killed after being struck by a car while crossing a street outside his 
Woodland Hills apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Khong saw the dinner as an opportunity to reach out to the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy has happened and we'll try to help them," said Khong. "They're 
all asking about life and death. We will gather in groups after dinner to help 
them see the meaning of life. But we will not focus on the tragedy. The focus 
tonight is on the meaning of Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
 After a dessert of raspberry-swirl ice cream and an Oreo cookie, the children 
watched as Khong, Esther Wong and the Rev. Andy Ching acted in a brief skit 
that explained the history of Thanksgiving celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Khong played the part of a journalist interviewing two pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did you come to this country?" Khong asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in search of religious freedom," replied Ching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did you get your food?" Khong queried. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Indians offered us roast turkey and corn," answered Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very interesting holiday," said Sun Yi Qian, who also goes by the 
nickname Marty. "There is no such holiday in China. This is the first time I've 
tasted turkey and it's quite tasty." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is a similar but more boisterous celebration during the Chinese 
New Year, when family members come together for feasts and parties. "It's an 
opportunity for family reunion and to share the happiness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the spirit of the American holiday, Yi Qian said he, too, had many 
things to be thankful for, including his parents, whom he hoped to make proud, 
and the opportunity to learn about American traditions while studying in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins Chu Ching Bing and Chu Jer Bing, who have adopted the names John and 
Fred, respectively, were busy trying to translate the names of the Thanksgiving 
dishes into Chinese on their pocket-sized electronic translator. On either side 
of the tiny device's screen, Chinese and English characters spelled out 
"cranberries." 
</P>
<P>
 At the press of a button, the computer burped out the English pronunciation, 
which the boys quickly and adroitly mimicked. 
</P>
<P>
 After games of Simon Says and Pictionary, the students gathered in the church 
to sing "A Turkey Song:" 
</P>
<P>
 "If God can love a turkey, God can love you," they sang. "You are a turkey, 
but I am one, too."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; SCHOOL DISTRICTS SEEK INPUT IN DEVELOPMENT

<P>
 A four-year overhaul of the city's general plan won bravos from the City 
Council Monday and protests from two school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Centralia School District and the Anaheim Union High School District have 
threatened legal action if they are not given more say over a 224-home 
development proposed for the site occupied by the closed-down Lincoln Drive-In 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised general plan changed the drive-in zoning from commercial to 
residential. 
</P>
<P>
 Law provides for the schools to receive $1.72 for each square foot of homes 
built and "pass-through" fees from new property taxes generated by the project. 
Senior Planner Leslie Kyle estimated that the homes in the project would be 
about 2,000 square feet each. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools anticipate having 80 new students from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the district said they want to be included in negotiations when 
the city talks with the developers, but Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune said the 
school districts are just being greedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get money on a per-square-foot basis, then they get money on each 
student, then they get pass-through money," McCune said. "That's $822,000 the 
schools get right off. This is why the developers are in Las Vegas and not here 
in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 John E. Brown, an attorney for Anaheim Union, said after the meeting that the 
schools need to have greater stability because a school bond measure was 
defeated in the June election. The real issue is having language in the general 
plan that will guarantee schools some input to the process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would invite any member of the Buena Park City Council who feels this is an 
issue of greed to tour the schools in the Anaheim Union High School District," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to give final approval to the general plan at its 5 
p.m. meeting Monday in Civic Center Plaza, 6650 Beach Blvd. LESLEY WRIGHT
