 GRADUATION BLUES: Here's one batch of Fullerton College graduates with good 
job prospects: its Police Academy graduates 60 students today. . . . Ten 
already have jobs waiting for them, including five of the six women graduates. 
Academy spokesman Frank E. Whitman says the rest should be hired soon: 
"Recruitments have been heavy. Some cities have been providing larger budgets 
to increase their forces." 
</P>

 THE REAL CARL: One downside to Carl N. Karcher's struggles last year with his 
own board of directors: He lost his job as TV pitchman for his restaurant 
chain. But now that Karcher is chairman emeritus and things are calmer, he's 
got his sales job back. . . . And this time it's not a cartoon Karcher, but the 
77-year-old fast-food mogul himself. Right now he can be seen on TV pitching 
the chain's guacamole bacon cheeseburger. But more commercials are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 POLITICAL FACE? Thom Doney finished among the also-rans in this month's 
Huntington Beach City Council race. Maybe he should have used his picture in 
his campaign. . . . Doney, a vice principal at the Liberty Christian School, is 
a dead ringer for Jay Leno. He's one of the best look-alikes in December's 
Ladies Home Journal, and he's just come off a Maury Povich TV appearance. . . . 
The bad part, he says, is people expect him to be funny: "I'm not a stand-up 
comic. I just happen to look like him." 
</P>
<P>
 PLAYING WITH FIRE: Remember when Sam Malone on TV's "Cheers" got into trouble 
playing against a team of Playboy Playmates? But Emmy Day of the county Fire 
Department says bring them on. Local firefighters today will play a team of 
playmates and minor TV stars. "There's even a woman from 'Babewatch'; I mean 
'Baywatch,' " jokes Day. . . . The men-women's game will be at 1 p.m. at 
Chapparosa Park in Laguna Niguel. Money raised will buy bikes for local foster 
children.

GAZA POLICE FIRE ON MILITANTS; 11 DEAD IN CLASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian police Friday opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators for the 
first time, killing at least 11, wounding more than 120 and fueling fears that 
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's confrontation with Islamic militants could trigger 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic militants and the police first clashed outside a mosque, then engaged 
in street battles that lasted even after police vainly imposed a curfew in 
parts of the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry followers of the militant Islamic Jihad and Hamas movements poured into 
hospitals where the wounded were taken. They denounced Arafat, who is chairman 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization and head of the Palestinian 
self-governing authority, as a traitor and a stooge of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Militants torched Gaza's single movie theater and overran and burned an 
Israeli checkpoint near the isolated settlement of Netzarim. They gathered 
outside police headquarters and clashed with soldiers there as truckloads of 
suspected militants who had been detained by police pulled into the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza City, as women wept in the stairwells and hospital rooms of Shifa 
Hospital, the sound of gunfire could be heard in the streets outside. Hundreds 
of men milled around the hospital compound. Some prayed, others wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from the hospital, a mosque broadcast the names of the dead, who were 
given the title "martyr" -- one previously reserved for Palestinians who died 
fighting Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the city, grim-faced, bearded men gathered at the homes of 
families who had lost a member in clashes with police. Hasty burials, lit only 
by the light of the full moon, were under way by 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't expect this to happen between Palestinians," said a man who 
declined to give his name. He was hovering anxiously over the bed of his 
nephew, 13-year-old Mahmoud Sakr Biltaggi, at Shifa Hospital on Friday night. 
Biltaggi was shot in the abdomen during the clash that erupted at Gaza City's 
Palestine Mosque after noon prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Biltaggi's father, the uncle said, is an activist with Islamic Jihad who was 
arrested one week ago by the Palestinian police, after a suicide bomber and 
member of Islamic Jihad blew himself up at the same Israeli checkpoint that was 
overrun Friday. In the earlier attack, the bomber, Hisham Hamad, killed three 
Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel responded to Hamad's attack by pressuring Arafat to crack down on 
Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The two organizations have carried out a string of 
bloody attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers and have vowed to torpedo 
Arafat's peace accord with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli officials have 
repeatedly warned Arafat that he must either face down Islamic militants or 
risk the collapse of the peace process. Since arriving in Gaza in July, Arafat 
has ordered the arrest of dozens of Islamic activists after each attack on 
Israelis. But those arrested have usually been released without charge within a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Arafat avoided using force against the militants. Advisers 
warned him that any use of force against Hamas in Gaza, where the organization 
is a strong, well-organized political and social force with a wide following, 
would alienate a majority of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamas' increasingly bold challenges to his authority appear to have pushed 
Arafat into Friday's confrontation. After Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants 
staged a massive rally Nov. 11 in the heart of Gaza City, chanting slogans 
against Arafat and Israel, Justice Minister Freih Abu Medeen warned that they 
had "crossed a red line." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent clash started after noon prayers Friday at the Palestine 
Mosque, where some 6,000 worshipers had gathered to observe the Muslim Sabbath. 
The white mosque is Gaza's largest, and a Hamas stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Militants interviewed at Shifa Hospital said worshipers were incited by the 
presence of about 200 armed, shielded police. The police reportedly surrounded 
a crowd of about 1,000 worshipers who had begun praying in the street when they 
couldn't squeeze inside the packed mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said that the officers took up positions around the mosque 
only after police headquarters received information that Hamas and the smaller 
Islamic Jihad group planned a violent demonstration after prayers. The police 
said they started shooting only after militants started marching toward the 
home of the suicide bomber and began throwing stones at the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The police said that they warned the demonstrators to stop, then fired in the 
air before shooting at any worshipers. But witnesses disputed that account. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the intifada (Palestinian uprising), the Israeli soldiers would first 
fire tear gas, and then fire rubber bullets and only then shoot live 
ammunition," said Mahmoud, a worshiper who returned to the Palestine Mosque for 
evening prayers. "They never shot at us without a direct order to shoot, and 
then they only shot a few bullets. But these Palestinian police started 
shooting immediately, and they shot everywhere." Mahmoud declined to give his 
last name. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Friday evening, Brig. Gen. Gazi Jibali, the Gaza police 
chief, said that worshipers were incited to riot by militants and "opened fire 
suddenly at some of our forces and burned two vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 One police officer reportedly was killed during the riot that erupted, but it 
is unclear whether he was hit by a stone or a bullet. Several other officers 
reportedly were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were praying and at the last minute of the prayers, we heard shooting 
outside," said one worshiper, a 23-year-old who identified himself only as 
Mohammad. "The police were ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad said he was standing with his closest friend, Hazzam Dalou, when the 
shooting began. Dalou, 23, was fatally shot in the chest, Mohammad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clothes are still soaked in his blood," he said. "I carried his body to 
the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could say Friday night how many were injured in the initial clash, and 
how many were hurt in the street battles that followed. Police reportedly 
opened fire on the demonstrators who gathered outside the central jail, and 
again at police headquarters. Police and demonstrators also reportedly clashed 
outside Shifa Hospital, where militants ambushed a police van carrying wounded 
police officers, stoning the officers and setting fire to the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "We warn these groups of thugs against attempts to harm the public safety," 
Jibali said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Police threw up checkpoints along many Gaza City roads, and armed plainclothes 
officers and uniformed police were out in force. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday evening, Israel Radio reported that disturbances had spread to 
Rafah in southern Gaza. Militants reportedly set fire to a cinema there. By 10 
p.m., there was still no statement from Arafat. But his Fatah faction issued a 
statement accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad of being involved in "conspiratorial 
plans . . . on behalf of foreign parties." The statement added: "We cannot make 
concessions or be lenient with regard to their insistence on harming national 
unity." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides outside Arafat's office in the early evening said that he will meet with 
leaders of both Islamic Jihad and Hamas during the night to try to calm the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hamas leader, Salah Safade, appealed for calm during a rally at a Gaza City 
mosque Friday night. "We don't want a massacre here to continue," Safade said.

MAN IS CHARGED IN SLAYINGS OF 2 PRO-DEMOCRACY HAITIAN ACTIVISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was arrested and charged with murder for hire in the slayings of two 
pro-democracy Haitian broadcasters who investigators say were killed to silence 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motive for this murder was simply the words that were spoken over the 
airwaves," Detective Ron Ilhardt said Friday in announcing the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Claude Olivier and Fritz Dor were the first of several Haitian 
pro-democracy activists attacked in Miami after Jean-Bertrand Aristide became 
Haiti's first democratically elected president in December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier was shot to death in 1991 as he left a club in Miami's Little Haiti. 
Dor was killed 3 1/2 weeks later while standing outside his office. Both were 
killed with the same gun, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Billy Alexander, a 24-year-old whose parents are Haitian, was 
arrested on charges including murder and conspiracy. He is already serving a 
life sentence for killing a man during a botched Ft. Lauderdale robbery in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Alexander was paid to kill the broadcasters, but they would 
not say who is suspected of paying him. The defendant could get the electric 
chair or life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police affidavit, the two broadcasters had urged listeners to 
boycott promotional events sponsored by record store owner Louis Thermitus. 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasters described Thermitus as a "Macoute" -- a supporter of the 
military regime that ousted Aristide. The broadcasters also accused officials 
of the regime of smuggling drugs into Little Haiti. Thermitus hasn't been 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavarice Gaudin, head of the pro-democracy group Veye Yo, said Alexander's 
arrest wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we are waiting to see the police arrest the master with the money," he 
said. "That guy should get arrested and go to the electric chair." 
</P>
<P>
 Police stopped short of calling the slayings political, but Assistant Police 
Chief John Brooks said the victims' messages "must have offended somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnie Premer, general manager of WKAT radio, said that listeners poured out 
their hearts on Dor's talk show but that Dor never advocated overthrowing the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was for Aristide all the way, but he never once mentioned on the air any 
violence or anything that was not in good taste of radio," Premer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier worked for another station, WLQY. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier and Dor were killed shortly after the inauguration of Aristide.

NO AUTHENTIC CHRISTIAN WORSHIP AT PLANETARY MASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reference to "Multimedia Missionaries" (Nov. 5), Richard C. Paddock's 
restrained review of the Planetary Mass at Grace Cathedral, Paddock notes that 
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead attended the service. As one of the 
attendees, we were beamed back to the '60s via vintage Roberta Flack, 
psychedelic lights, the distribution of flowers, and we were urged to "break 
out through," reminiscent of the Doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus was seldom heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planetary Mass represents the demise of authentic Christian worship; a mix 
of Christian mysticism, Eastern spiritualism, Native American religions, 
feminism and environmentalism resulting in witchcraft, paganism and a trendy 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rave Masses are already passe in England, where they originated. Laughing 
services are all the rage. What's next?

PRAISE FOR ARTICLE ON MORMON LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I appreciate the article that appeared on Howard W. Hunter, president of the 
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Oct. 22).Often articles on the LDS 
Church tend to focus on issues that have little concern to the average Mormon 
and blow them all out of proportion. Often there is a critical, negative tone. 
Thank you for a straightforward, informative article.

WHY THE REFERENCES TO ROMAN CATHOLICS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know how many of my fellow communicants are behind me, but as a 
committed Catholic I was deeply disturbed by the frequent reference to the 
Roman Catholic Church in the interview with Howard Hunter.I'm tired of how 
Catholics are treated by the media. To be sure, we have our problems, but we're 
not the only church that has its shares of dissentients and sexual deviants. It 
seems that the only acceptable form of discrimination left is Catholic bashing.

<P>
 As he gets his House in order, Gingrich hasn't selected a single California 
Republican to chair a committee or hold any other powerful leadership position. 
Reducing the clout of Republicans from the most populous state, with its gold 
mine of electoral votes, is unfair and shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's first slap at California took place earlier this week when he 
bypassed longstanding seniority rules that would have propelled Rep. Carlos 
Moorhead of Glendale, the dean of California's Republicans in the House, to the 
chairmanship of either the Energy and Commerce Committee or the Judiciary 
Committee, both important posts. Moorhead, the ranking minority member on both 
committees, thought he had the job in the bag. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of veteran talent in the delegation. Gingrich has asked 
the tireless David Dreier of San Dimas, elected to the House in 1980, to help 
redesign House rules, and he has named Bill Thomas of Bakersfield and Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon of Santa Clarita to the GOP transition team. That's a start. The 
popular Jerry Lewis of Redlands, elected in 1978 (the same year Georgia sent 
Gingrich to Congress), is a logical choice to chair a powerful appropriations 
subcommittee that controls the federal purse. But the Georgian stung Lewis last 
year when he engineered his ouster from the GOP leadership. Seems that Lewis 
was considered pragmatic rather than blindly loyal. Oh, what a sin! 
</P>
<P>
 There is also no quantitative shortage of California Republicans. The 
52-member House delegation will be evenly split if Republican Susan Brooks is 
determined to be the winner in the final vote count in her match-up with Jane 
Harman. Gingrich will need those Republican votes to push his agenda.  
</P>
<P>
 It's Gingrich's game, and irreverence for seniority may not itself be bad. 
But, if the Republicans want to maintain their new control of Congress, and 
possibly regain the White House in 1996, they cannot afford to slight 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, fortunately, Californians can still rely on the hard work of 
Dianne Feinstein. With most of the absentee ballots now counted, no question 
remains that the Democrat has prevailed over Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) after surviving the costliest congressional campaign in history. She 
can be counted on to find common ground with the Republican majority and to 
force California onto Washington's new agenda. The Times congratulates her on 
her hard-fought reelection.

STAFFING AUDIT BURNS FIRE DEPT.; APPALLING RECORD ON MINORITIES AND WOMEN MUST 
BE IMPROVED QUICKLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is, by now, a story that should not have to be told again. After 20 years 
of affirmative action policies in the Los Angeles Fire Department, women and 
minorities are still subjected to widespread sexual and racial harassment and 
have been all but excluded from top posts, according to a city audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Donald O. Manning disputes these charges and defends his 
department's record of hiring since the department signed a federal consent 
decree in 1974 to end a discrimination lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit is extremely disturbing. Among its findings:  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20 top department posts, 95% are held by white men and none are held by 
Asian Americans, blacks or women. Minority representation in those ranks has 
dropped since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At eight stations, women and minority firefighters reported significant 
hostility. Many said they were ostracized and given inadequate training. At 
other stations, Latino and black firefighters were subjected to racial epithets 
and women suffered physical and emotional harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder the attrition rate for minorities and women has been much 
higher than that of white males? 
</P>
<P>
 Though in recent years it has become more diverse, the department must do 
better (currently, the figures are 62% white, 23% Latino, 11% black, 4% Asian 
and 3% female). If the force is to achieve real diversity, a better job of 
fostering understanding needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning is caught in a cross fire. The addition of nonwhite and female 
firefighters has stirred up resentment in the 3,000-member firefighters union. 
A poll conducted last spring found "an overwhelming lack of confidence" in the 
chief because union members believe he has lowered hiring standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning now faces a huge challenge. He must rid his force of those individuals 
engaging in harassment and other unacceptable behavior. He says he needs $2 
million from the city to improve the department's performance. We wonder 
whether sharper scrutiny from the Fire Commission, the department's putative 
boss, might be as effective.

TROUGH WATCH; PENSIONS APLENTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress' new Republican majority promises to take a fresh look at everything 
affecting Congress. That had better include those pension and benefit plans 
that are deservedly the envy of nearly everyone who labors in the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Taxpayers Union, a watchdog group, calculates for example that 
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), defeated for reelection, can console 
himself with a lifetime pension of $123,804 a year. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who's now awaiting 
trial on a slew of felony charges, stands to collect $96,462 annually. Current 
pay for members of Congress is $133,600 a year, so the pension that Rostenkow- 
ski and other long-serving, soon-to-be-former members will collect comes to 
more than 72% of their pay. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't many private pension plans that provide a comparable level of 
financial comfort. In fact, the number of Americans who get any pension 
benefits at all is shrinking -- it's now less than 60% of workers -- and 
precious few of them are enrolled in plans that have mandatory adjustments for 
inflation, as Congress has voted itself. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Republicans are serious about cutting spending and eventually balancing 
the budget, they're going to have to cut entitlements, a word that means 
something a person has a legal right to. Congress has legislated its own legal 
right to generous compensation, both during and after congressional service. 
One guess as to which entitlement the public would be most willing to see cut 
first.

TRAIL BUILDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I totally agree with your praise for the Mountains Conservancy Foundation's 
efforts to build and complete the Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains 
("Happy Trail," editorial, Nov. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, much credit for the existence of this trail should be given to 
trail-builder and planner Ron Webster, who, with the aid of Sierra Club 
volunteers, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps and the California Conservation 
Corps, continues to build and maintain this and other trails in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand this can be dirty, back-breaking but very rewarding work. After 
all, as the saying goes, "if you build it they will come."

FIGHTING IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is the U.S. mainstream media so bashful about reporting the major 
offensive launched two weeks ago by the Croatian and Bosnian Muslim forces? 
Several aspects of this coordinated assault, directed mainly on two areas -- to 
the southeast of Bihac and at Kupres -- should provoke very harsh commentaries 
if not straightforward condemnation. What is worse, the Bihac offensive was 
generated and organized in a demilitarized "safe haven" with apparently open 
support of the U.N. peacekeeping forces (from Bangladesh) stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
 A military aggression of such magnitude is outrageous and destructive at the 
time when the world's community is (supposedly) trying to work out the solution 
for a lasting peace in Bosnia. Even more shameful is the attitude of some 
commentators to savor it as a "rightful revenge," in which thousands of Serbs 
fleeing from their homes are mentioned "matter-of-factly," without a shred of 
compassion, which is apparently (only) for the alleged "victims of Serbian 
aggression." However, the greatest irony of all is that a reversal came even 
sooner than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest news is that the Bosnian Muslim government is begging the United 
Nations for military intervention, since its "victorious" army is decimated 
(after initial successes) by the Serbian counteroffensive, reaching the city of 
Bihac as well. This Muslim scenario was seen before -- in Gorazde, for example 
-- provocations, terrorist raids of Serbian villages, gloating about "decisive 
victories," only to end up by whining and squealing for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is: When shall the world community, saturated by lies, deceptions 
and manipulations furnished by Bosnian Muslim leaders and their supporters, 
express its disgust? Unfortunately, misinterpretations, omissions and pure 
fabrications presented by the pack of journalists, reporting and commenting on 
recent events in Bosnia, protract the illusion of their veracity. Truth was the 
first victim of this war, and now it would be "politically incorrect," even 
unthinkable for some, to resurrect it.

REPUBLICAN TAKEOVER OF CONGRESS

 Re "The Party's Over, Let's Get to Work," editorial, Nov. 11:

<P>
 Boy, are you guys in a sore mood. What did Rep. Newt Gingrich say that touched 
such a nerve? What did he say that was even untrue? 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, you guys haven't come to grips with the election yet. You're 
not ready to give up power. You still want to dictate to Republicans. You want 
them to cooperate and be nice. But they don't have to. They have as much right 
to take charge as the Dems did during Reagan/Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans learned to live with a Democratic Congress, and now that the 
shoe's on the other foot, it's time to get used to it. Your resentment over 
this new turn fairly leaped off the page. If you're going to print nice words 
about reconciliation and cooperation, at least sound like you mean it.

 * This is the people's country; it doesn't belong to Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 * The people work hard to earn their money; Washington doesn't have an

 * The people value their flag; citizens and non-citizens had better respect it 
and not tread on it.

control, did they only want enough gain to launch a 1996 presidential bid? The 
Contract with America might have a balloon payment and our arithmetic is much 
better. The bright side for the Democrats is they finally lost a lot of 
unneeded congressional baggage, Clinton can put on Bush's Truman disguise and 
not have to stick his neck out so far. I am sure, however, it will be an 
award-winning performance by all.

 Contrast Clinton's approach with Ronald Reagan. And does anyone recall

DISNEY AND CALARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I like the headline on your business article (Oct. 30), "Disney's Magic 
School," because it is indeed magic that goes on at California Institute of the 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 My tenure on the board of trustees runs from 1961 (in a planning stage) to the 
present. From 1968 to 1971, I served as board chairman in times that were often 
difficult and traumatic. From 1958 to Walt Disney's death in 1966, I met with 
him privately and in groups in countless meetings on the concept and program 
for this unique educational enterprise. It is from this 36-year perspective 
that I want to comment on your article. 
</P>
<P>
 The article says that "CalArts was conceived three decades ago as a clever way 
to funnel an army of skilled animators into the Disney Studios." This is not 
so: 
</P>
<P>
 * Animation is but 14% of the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 * Animation is but one program in the film/video school, which in turn is one 
of five schools at CalArts (theater, dance, art, film/video, music). 
</P>
<P>
 * Animation graduates are spread throughout the industry (for example, Amblin, 
Film Roman, Hanna Barbera, Hyperion, Warner Bros. and 11 other studios in my 
alumni list). It is not a Disney captive supply by any measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in any of the hundreds of hours of discussion on the purpose of this 
school was "animator supply" ever mentioned as a motive. The prime objectives 
were: 1) to create a place where artists could be broadened in their cultural 
grasp and reach by exposure to an extensive inter-arts program (he called it 
the cross-fertilization of the arts), and 2) students were to be taught by 
professionals leading to professionalism and employability. We were to defeat 
the bugaboo of the artist's life described best by the adjective "starving." 
</P>
<P>
 We are delighted that CalArts alumni have become an integral part of the 
Disney Co. but we know that our alumni and their work are also an integral part 
of Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Museum of Contemporary 
Art, Whitney Museum, Guthrie Theatre, Mark Taper Forum, Bella Lewitzky Co., 
Loretta Livingston Co., Knott's Berry Farm, MCA, BRC Imagination Arts and many, 
many other thriving arts and entertainment companies. Our alumni are widely 
dispersed and thankfully this has been matched by the development of a very 
broad support structure which carries on the work launched by Walt Disney and 
Roy Disney Sr. and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 My point is that Walt's vision of this place was long-term, far-reaching and 
never parochial. He often said that it would be his most important legacy. He 
did not, however, put a personal stamp on it. It would not be named after him. 
That would have limited the perception of his quest.

MCNALL AND GOODENOW SCAMMING NHL PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, let me get this straight. Bruce McNall defrauds the banks of millions of 
dollars so that he can keep up his grandiose lifestyle.Then, when he runs out 
of bank money, he takes our hard-earned money from Senate seat sales and uses 
that to keep his scam going. Then he gets caught, thanks to the conscience of 
only one executive over there at the McNall organization (who, by the way, 
seems to have gotten a worse deal than some of his other executives, we know 
not why). And now, he is resigning in name only from the Kings, so that we fans 
will think he has some conscience of his own, when in fact he is getting paid 
$54,000 a month plus bonuses until 2001 to do nothing.  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how the players feel about dipping into their savings to live day to 
day, while McNall is cashing in on this deal he struck with (Jeffrey) Sudikoff 
and (Joe) Cohen when he knew his house of cards was coming down? Isn't there 
something wrong with this picture? How do we explain to our young hockey fans 
that crime pays?

 Mr. (Bob) Goodenow has to be the greatest salesman I have seen in 20 years as

social backgrounds and languages to agree not to accept any form of salary cap. 
Truly amazing when you realize that by not playing they have, in fact, accepted 
the ultimate salary cap.

 As the Joint Operations Commander for Policing at the World Cup games held at

SURE, IT'S NEW, BUT IT'S NO SPORTS ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After attending my first game over the weekend at The Pond of Anaheim, I would 
like to know what all the hype is about. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have to take the elevator to get to your "comparable $38 season 
ticket" from the Sports Arena, you know you're up high.When you go to see the 
players in person and end up watching the game on big-screen TV, that's sick. 
</P>
<P>
 When food items cost 10%-20% higher, and there are no parking signs coming in 
off Katella, etc. -- give me the Sports Arena.  
</P>
<P>
 Some nearby people asked us if we were scared to go to the Sports Arena, which 
is ridiculous. The problem isn't the Sports Arena -- it's a winning team, 
whether you're in L.A., Minneapolis, Philadelphia or even Inglewood.

 I noticed recently that UCLA Coach Jim Harrick has signed yet another top

player) has ever heard of Westwood and even knows that it is located out here 
in Southern California. Well, his future Bruin teammates will be able to 
straighten him out.

 Penn State's fourth-quarter comeback last Saturday not only earned it a 
victory over Illinois, it probably ensured a national championship. How? Miami 
tops undefeated Nebraska in the Orange Bowl and Florida State edges undefeated 
Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, leaving Penn State as the only remaining undefeated

 As an attorney, allow me to present the evidence in support of ranking 
Nebraska No. 2 in the nation: The Cornhuskers are 10-0, they limited 
then-undefeated Kansas State to six points, they shut out mighty Colorado for a 
half and then gave up only seven points, all of this "without a quarterback."

 Something tells me this is a losing argument.

 Is it just me, or are there others out there who are appalled at the economic 
inequity of James Worthy and Magic Johnson being paid $12 million and $14 
million, respectively, for not playing anymore? Apparently, the size of Jerry 
Buss' wallet is in inverse proportion to the size of his brain. How does he 
stay in the black while giving away such sums of money?

COLLEGE BASKETBALL; COMPETITION TO SWEET 16 IS SURE TO BE BITTER THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IVAN MAISEL, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's got blockbuster written all over it. Cross-country romance, big stars and 
as always, a happy ending. How's this for a title: Sweetness in Seattle. Can we 
get Tom Hanks? No? How about Corliss Williamson? Does he do sequels? 
</P>
<P>
 The first steps down the road toward the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball 
Championship have been taken. There are at least 30 teams convinced that this 
is Their Year. One of them is right. There will be no Cinderella, not in a 
season when the four teams that ended their season in Charlotte return 16 of 
their 20 collective starters. That means the cast is familiar. So, too, is the 
plot. As the director says, "Action!" 
</P>
<P>
 1. Arkansas: What can prevent a repeat? Injuries? Pressure? The Razorbacks 
dealt with those problems last season and won. It comes down to hunger and head 
coach Nolan Richardson feeds his players three square homilies a day. What 
players: Guard Corey Beck and swingman Scotty Thurman made the Goodwill Games 
team. Forward Corliss Williamson would have save for a broken wrist. The 
Razorbacks' bench could make the NCAAs on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 2. UCLA: The memory of the whipping UCLA received from Tulsa in the first 
round of the NCAAs should drive the Bruins over their self-raised mental 
hurdles. The tools are there: Tyus Edney at point guard and the O'Bannon 
brothers, Ed and Charles, in the frontcourt. A stellar freshman class will 
contribute. Are academics important? Chemistry is one subject Jim Harrick's 
teams annually fail. 
</P>
<P>
 3. North Carolina: Basketball gout: North Carolina consumed such a rich diet 
of talent last season that Dean Smith didn't have the minutes to satisfy 
everyone. But the senior class of Eric Montross and Co. are gone. What's left 
is sumptious. Watch forward Jerry Stackhouse and center Rasheed Wallace work. 
Guard Donald Williams, the hero of the 1993 NCAA title run, and forward Pat 
Sullivan, who voluntarily sat out last season, provide leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Kentucky: Two SEC teams made it to the Final Four last spring and neither 
one wore Kentucky blue. The Wildcats will make amends next spring. It's time 
for forward Rodrick Rhodes to live up to his press clips. Kentucky will get 
significant inside help from Washington transfer Mark Pope. Guard Tony Delk 
(37.4 percent on three-pointers) will load it up faster than a teen-ager on a 
mall shop-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Florida: Florida won't sneak up on anyone this season. It won't matter. The 
Gators return four starters from the Final Four team. Forward Andrew DeClercq 
is as tough to guard as he is to spell. The question is who will join All-SEC 
guard Dan Cross in the backcourt. Two weeks will define the Gators: They play 
at Wake Forest and at Kansas the first week in December. Alabama and Arkansas 
come to Gainesville in late February. 
</P>
<P>
 6. UMass: You've heard this before because Massachusetts has the same team as 
last year. Center Marcus Camby lived up to his billing as a freshman. Lou Roe 
is the guts of the team, a 6-feet-7 banger who spent the summer working on 
outside scoring. That's where the Minutemen must improve. Mike Williams is too 
streaky of a three-point shooter. Coach John Calipari has been campaigning for 
the spotlight. Now he has it. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Indiana: Has Alan Henderson been at Indiana as long as Bob Knight? The 
forward is on track to become the Hoosiers' all-time leading rebounder. He 
averaged a double-double (18 points, 10 boards) last season. Henderson, Brain 
Evans and seven-footer Todd Lindeman mean no one beats the Hoosiers inside. 
Guard Sherron Wilkerson broke a leg against Temple in the NCAAs. Get well soon 
-- the sophomore is the veteran in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Duke: Forwards Grant Hill and Antonio Lang are gone and how well Duke 
replaces them will determine the Blue Devils' success. Cherokee Parks will 
anchor the frontcourt. Sophomores Greg Newton and Joey Beard will have to move 
up from the far end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 9. UConn: Everyone is back for Connecticut except Donyell Marshall. Remember 
the Supremes without Diana Ross? No, no, no. The Huskies will challenge for the 
Big East championship. Sophomore Ray Allen is the next star. He broke the 
scoring record at the U.S. Olympic Festival last summer. Kevin Ollie is the 
league's best defensive guard. Seven-foot junior Travis Knight has bulked up 
and won the center's job. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Maryland: The Maryland woes have faded in the distance, thanks to 
sophomore Joe Smith. He lit up the paint and the entire state by leading the 
Terrapins to the Sweet Sixteen. The next step is possible. Forwards Exree Hipp 
and Keith Booth give coach Gary Williams a formidable frontcourt. Off-guard 
Johnny Rhodes led the ACC in steals. Depth is non-existent, which could prove 
deadly in the ACC. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Syracuse: The U.S. Goodwill Games team literally left Syracuse guard 
Lawrence Moten standing. Coach George Raveling cut him the morning the team 
left for Europe. That should motivate Moten to take the Orangemen a long way. 
He is the leader. Bet the rest of Syracuse on the come. Forwards Lucious 
Jackson and John Wallace are stars on the rise. Coach Jim Boeheim seems quietly 
confident. Arizona on Dec. 22 will be a good yardstick. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Arizona: Now that Arizona has shed its March Sadness by reaching the Final 
Four, can Damon Stoudamire take the Wildcats there again? The nation's best 
point guard will shine again, even without the departed Khalid Reeves 
alongside. Small forward Reggie Geary likely will replace Reeves at off-guard. 
Geary's quickness underneath will be missed. Look for Ben Davis to be a force 
inside once he becomes eligible in December. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Georgetown: In exhibitions, Allen Iverson has been the guard everyone said 
he would be when he went to Georgetown. Can he stand up to the abuse he will 
receive from opposing fans? Hey, this is Georgetown. The Hoyas love that stuff. 
Junior Othella Harrington is the linchpin of the typically stifling defense. 
The question, as always, is whether Georgetown can shoot. Look for Iverson and 
guard George Butler to take care of that. 
</P>
<P>
 14. Alabama: Should Arkansas stumble, Alabama will control the SEC West. 
Forward Jason Caffey, when he returns from a foot injury next month, and center 
Antonio McDyess are big and love to bang. Backup Roy Rogers, yes, triggers 
opposing shots into the stratosphere. Jamal Faulkner is a proven scorer and 
sophomore Eric Washington stunned everyone by hitting five threes against 
Kansas State Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Michigan: Michigan's Fab Five has dwindled to the Senior Two. Point guard 
Jimmy King and swingman Ray Jackson will provide leadership to a precocious 
group of freshmen (there are five of them but we aren't allowed to call them 
the you-know-what). Look for Jerod Ward and Maurice Taylor to make themselves 
known off the bench. Look for Steve Fisher to once again prove himself of the 
best coaches in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Virginia: Worried about Cory Alexander? The Virginia point guard, who 
missed last season with a broken ankle, scored a career-high 29 in the 
Cavaliers' opener Wednesday. That takes care of that. Coach Jeff Jones must 
unlock the mystery of power forward Junior Burrough, whose sum rarely adds up 
to his considerable parts. This is much the same team that went far in the 
NCAAs two years ago. Alexander should bring them back again. 
</P>

PLAYING FARE; UNITED'S SHUTTLE GAINS PASSENGERS; SOUTHWEST EXPANDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dianne Woods usually flies Southwest Airlines on her monthly business trips 
between Northern and Southern California. But last week, the 42-year-old social 
worker jumped ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Southwest, Woods flew on United Airlines' new shuttle service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to miss Southwest," Woods said as she waited at Burbank Airport 
for her return flight to Oakland on Shuttle by United. "I'd rather fly United. 
I get my frequent flier miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Since launching on Oct. 1, United's low-fare shuttle has won over many 
passengers and forced rival Southwest to expand service along the West Coast. 
But Dallas-based Southwest shows no signs of losing control of the California 
skies, and United remains quiet on whether its shuttle is generating profits in 
addition to passenger traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle, United's answer to Southwest and other low-fare, low-cost 
carriers, will also come under heavy stress in the coming weeks. The hordes of 
holiday travelers and baggage -- as well as inclement winter weather -- could 
disrupt the shuttle's frequent flights and on-time service. United said it is 
planning to deal with the crush; Southwest has more than 20 years of practice 
operating under such conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 United officials, however, are quick to crow about the shuttle's first month 
of operating statistics, which they say exceed expectations. During October, 
the average shuttle flight was 71% full, United said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Angeles International Airport, United shuttle manager Jill Sheffield 
has another way to gauge success. On a company bulletin board, United workers 
have posted many of the Southwest baggage tags they have removed from the 
luggage of passengers now flying the shuttle, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are picking up Southwest passengers," Sheffield said. "We got quite a few 
posted" she said of the tags. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle was born out of a $5-billion deal completed in July that gave most 
of United's workers majority ownership of the nation's largest carrier in 
return for wage cuts and increased productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shuttle uses United employees and planes, its operations resemble 
those of Southwest. Planes spend as little as 20 minutes on the ground between 
flights to get the most efficient use of the aircraft. In-flight meals are 
limited to a snack and a beverage, and passengers have to wait until they get 
to the airport to get seat assignments. The shuttle has even adopted some of 
Southwest's showmanship by offering a limited $9.97 one-way fare between 
Northern and Southern California for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In matching Southwest's low fares and offering credit in United's Mileage Plus 
frequent flier program, the shuttle has proved hard to resist for many United 
passengers who had been using Southwest for short trips. Mileage Plus members 
can redeem their credits for free trips to the many places United serves 
worldwide. Southwest frequent fliers can also earn free trips, but to a much 
smaller number of domestic cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll fly United if the price is the same (as Southwest) . . . and I get my 
Mileage Plus credits," said one executive who was boarding a shuttle flight to 
San Francisco from Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest has moved quickly to keep customers by adding flights and cutting 
fares, particularly within California. In late October, it introduced a special 
$39 one-way intrastate fare. On Tuesday, Southwest raised the number of round 
trips between Los Angeles and Oakland to 25 from 19. That route is now the 
busiest in the Southwest network. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest has watched its low-fare franchise come under attack from a crop of 
start-ups such as Atlanta-based Value Jet and established carriers such as 
United and Continental Airlines that are cloning Southwest strategies. 
Southwest has fought back, and this week, for example, it signed a 10-year-long 
labor contract with its pilots that freezes pay for seven years in return for 
stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 But the airline's stock price has taken a beating in the past year as 
investors have worried about Southwest wanna-bes. Last week, Southwest shares 
fell sharply after the company said its fleet flew with 65% of seats filled in 
October, contrasted with 68% for that month last year. On Friday, Southwest 
shares closed at $22.50, up 75 cents for the day but down from $39 earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest said its load factor -- the portion of seats sold -- was lower 
because traffic was abnormally high in 1993 and the airline had expanded its 
operations by more than 30% within the past year.  
</P>
<P>
 On the West Coast, United's shuttle has had no noticeable impact on 
Southwest's passenger traffic, Southwest spokeswoman Linda Burke Rutherford 
said. The airline said it is looking to continue expanding service within 
California and across the country.  
</P>
<P>
 United also plans to keep its shuttle growing by converting existing service 
and adding new flights. The shuttle now flies 130 round-trips daily and serves 
12 places, including Burbank, Los Angeles, Ontario and San Diego in Southern 
California, and Oakland, Sacramento and San Francisco in the north. By Dec. 1, 
the shuttle will account for nearly half of all United flights at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely targets for expansion are large metropolitan areas situated 
less than 750 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of areas make sense for the shuttle," said Jim Hartigan, United 
western regional vice president. "We will continue to grow throughout the first 
quarter" of next year, he said.

 Former Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has gone back to his Italian roots to

</P>
<P>
 This time, it's Olivio spread, an olive oil-based alternative to butter and 
margarine boasting of no cholesterol and 80% less saturated fat than 
butter.It's being test-marketed in Ohio and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacocca got into the food business in 1992, after he bought a home in Tuscany,

 "I'm out of the commercial business," he said. "I'm not going to come back

SOME CHARGES AGAINST COLUMBIA S&L'S SPIEGEL DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After "a hard look at the evidence," federal prosecutors dropped one set of 
criminal charges against Thomas Spiegel, the former Columbia Savings & Loan 
chief now on trial in Los Angeles for allegedly looting the failed Beverly 
Hills thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dropped charges formed only part of the government's case, they 
were among the most serious because they involved the largest amount of money 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismissed Thursday were nine felony counts related to testimony by Santa 
Barbara auto dealer Howard Schneider, the central witness in what prosecutors 
said was a scheme by Spiegel to use improper loans from Columbia to get access 
to luxury cars and a 50% stake in Schneider's Gregg Motors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Motors eventually failed, and prosecutors said Columbia lost more than 
$10 million on the loans. The government had alleged that Spiegel put through 
the loans even though he knew that the financial information Schneider filed to 
obtain them was false. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel's defense team has continually tried to impeach Schneider's 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Walsh, the chief prosecutor, would not say specifically why the 
charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a hard look at the evidence, and based on all the evidence, including 
impeachment evidence, we just felt we shouldn't go forward with that portion," 
Walsh said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh also declined to comment on the relative importance of the Gregg Motors 
charges, but the dismissal was seen as an embarrassing setback for prosecutors 
since they had plea bargained with Schneider to obtain his testimony in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider pleaded guilty to two felony fraud counts involving the 
misapplication of Columbia funds and the filing of false financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel's lawyers have contended from the outset that Schneider was "a liar" 
and "a con man" who testified against Spiegel only to gain a lighter sentence 
for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad D. Brian, one of Spiegel's lead defense attorneys, declined to comment 
Friday on the dismissal of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gregg Motors charges were the basis for one of four primary sets of 
allegations that form the case against Spiegel. He still faces 37 felony counts 
alleging that he improperly benefited from some Columbia business deals, that 
he caused Columbia to purchase and lavishly furnish a $1-million Palm Springs 
condominium for his own use, and that he had the thrift pay tens of thousands 
of dollars for his personal collection of firearms.  
</P>
<P>
 Columbia, one of the top buyers of junk bonds issued through former Drexel 
Burnham Lambert finance wizard Michael Milken, was seized by federal regulators 
in 1991 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of $1.2 billion.

MATSUSHITA MOVES TO PATCH RIFT WITH MCA; ENTERTAINMENT: JAPANESE PARENT ADMITS 
MISSTEPS AND SAYS IT WON'T SELL MCA. SONY'S TROUBLES PROVIDE A LESSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what may be an attempt to patch up a growing rift with executives at its 
MCA Inc. unit, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. confirmed on Friday that it 
will work with MCA to develop a strategy for the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita executives in Japan, in a candid admission of missteps in handling 
its MCA situation, reiterated to reporters that they do not plan to sell the 
Universal City-based entertainment conglomerate that the company bought for 
$6.6 billion in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA declined to comment publicly, but executives there privately said they 
were encouraged by the development as well as a conciliatory tone that suggests 
Matsushita wants to heal the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Several noted that working in their favor was the debacle this week at 
Matsushita's Japanese rival Sony Corp., which on Thursday disclosed a 
staggering $2.7-billion write-off on its Sony Pictures unit and a $510-million 
operating loss. On Friday, Sony executives denied reports that Sony Pictures is 
for sale or that Sony of America President Michael P. Schulhof is in danger of 
losing his job because of the losses. They insisted that Sony Corp. is 
committed to rebuilding the studio now that its balance sheet has been 
cleansed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sony news may "in a perverse way," as one MCA executive put it, make 
Matsushita more sensitive to the importance of solid management in Hollywood 
and prod the company to quickly resolve differences with MCA Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg, the industry's longest-running 
executive team. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA sources also confirmed a Wall Street Journal report that Matsushita had 
hired investment bank Allen & Co. and Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael 
S. Ovitz to draw up various strategic scenarios. Allen & Co. and Ovitz brokered 
the sale of MCA to Matsushita. Sources said Allen & Co. was hired within the 
past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between Matsushita and MCA have been heated for several years. 
Wasserman and Sheinberg have been hindered in their efforts to grow MCA through 
major acquisitions, such as a bid for CBS in conjunction with IT&T or the 
acquisition of Virgin Records, which eventually went to British conglomerate 
Thorn EMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wasserman and Sheinberg are likely to leave MCA if their differences with 
Matsushita can't be worked out. Such a move would no doubt end the company's 
longstanding and highly lucrative relationship with filmmaker Steven Spielberg, 
to whom Sheinberg has served as a mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, who is forming a studio with music mogul David Geffen and former 
Walt Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, has made such hits as "Jurassic 
Park," "Schindler's List" and "Jaws" for MCA's Universal Pictures unit. If the 
new studio proceeds as planned, MCA is hoping to distribute the trio's product 
until they establish their own distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
 Motoi Matsuda, director of accounting, finance and auditing -- effectively 
Matsushita's chief financial officer -- told reporters in Japan that Matsushita 
will come up with a "short-term and mid-term business strategy" with MCA 
executives. He blamed the dispute in part on the fact that Matsushita -- an 
industrial conglomerate that makes such electronics brands as Panasonic and 
Technics -- was unfamiliar with the film industry and lacked a medium-term 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When MCA made new proposals, Matsushita said 'no' without having a specific 
strategy. This led to conflict between the two companies," he told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA sources said a host of scenarios are likely to emerge from Allen & Co.'s 
evaluation, but the critical issue is to give MCA the flexibility to make major 
strategic moves to grow, such as acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives are said to be especially concerned that MCA is falling 
behind such giants as Viacom Inc., Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus among entertainment executives is that Matsushita, like Sony, 
overpaid when it entered Hollywood and, as a result, has not produced an 
acceptable return on its investment, despite such hits as "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 But they also believe that, unlike Sony, the value of MCA has climbed 
substantially, especially in the wake of the $10-billion sale of Paramount 
Communications earlier this year to Viacom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that MCA has a more viable theme park operation than Paramount, a 
larger film library and a major music operation, which Paramount lacked.

AMGEN TO ACQUIRE SYNERGEN IN $239-MILLION BIOTECH DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado biotechnology company Synergen Inc., once touted as "the next Amgen," 
will instead be swallowed up by Amgen Inc. in a $239.6-million deal announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks-based Amgen said it will pay $9.25 a share for Synergen, one of 
several high-profile biotech firms battered this year after once-promising 
drugs flopped in lab tests. The research disappointments have added to the 
financial woes of these companies -- forcing them to search for corporate 
partners -- and has weakened the overall investment climate in biotech. 
</P>
<P>
 Synergen's fortunes tumbled in July after the clinical failure of its drug 
Antril, which had been promoted as a potential treatment for sepsis, a deadly 
blood disease that claims 100,000 lives a year. Since then, Synergen stock has 
taken a pounding, and the firm has reported a $47-million quarterly loss and 
laid off 375 workers, or 60% of its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the deal gives Amgen, the nation's largest biotechnology firm, 
access to several promising drugs and well-regarded research scientists at 
Synergen. The Boulder, Colo. firm is developing treatments for several diseases 
that have stymied researchers for years, including rheumatoid arthritis, 
Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amgen got a very attractive price and there's a strategic fit on the programs 
they are both working on," said Linda L. Miller, a PaineWebber analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Synergen's stock, which had traded as high as $75 in 1992, fell sharply in 
1993 after Antril failed a key clinical test, and declined further in April 
after another research disappointment for Antril. On Friday, the stock jumped 
68%, or $3.66, to $9.03 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's share price slipped 19 cents to $56.875 on Nasdaq on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Abbott, Synergen's president and chief executive, said the company 
began seeking a partner after the Antril failure. "While we have lots of cash 
by biotech standards (about $100 million)," he said, "the resources need to 
develop products would be greater than the funding we had." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials also stressed the "unique strategic fit" of the companies. 
Both firms are developing genetically engineered treatments for neurobiology 
and inflammatory diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This acquisition will allow us to get to a critical mass in these areas two 
years earlier," said Gordon M. Binder, Amgen's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's growth -- the company had 1993 revenue of $1.4 billion -- is tied 
largely to the success of two blockbuster products, Epogen and Neupogen. Epogen 
is used as a treatment in kidney dialysis and to treat anemia in AIDS patients. 
Neupogen is used to stimulate white blood cell production in cancer patients 
undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen's stock has been rising in recent months, partly on speculation that the 
company might be a takeover target, but also on prospects for revenue growth 
from new uses for Epogen and Neupogen. But there is continuing concern among 
investors about the lack of any significant new products on the near horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, the PaineWebber analyst, said the Synergen deal does not appear to 
give Amgen such a major product in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand . . . there are five products here (with Synergen) and they 
didn't invest a lot in them. There is a big upside here if even one of them 
works." Amgen Inc. at a Glance

MACY TO LET I. MAGNIN PASS INTO HISTORY; RETAILING: EIGHT OF THE DEPARTMENT 
STORES WILL BE CLOSED AND FOUR CONVERTED. A GRANDSON'S OFFER FOR ALL 12 WAS NOT 
ACCEPTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 R. H. Macy & Co. went ahead Friday with plans to discontinue its financially 
troubled I. Magnin retail operations, despite an offer by a grandson of the 
chain's founder to buy the 12 remaining Magnin stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Macy announced it will phase out the tradition-rich Magnin 
retailing name while converting four existing Magnin sites -- including the 
Woodland Hills store -- into different specialty stores. Liquidation sales were 
set for the eight other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The action officially ended a bid by Beverly Hills retailer Jerry Magnin to 
buy all the Magnin stores. Magnin, who owns the Ralph Lauren Polo store on 
Rodeo Drive, said Friday he had offered Macy $40 million for the 12 stores.  
</P>
<P>
 Magnin, grandson of Mary Ann Magnin, who founded the chain in San Francisco in 
1876, said he first inquired about purchasing the stores in 1991 and resumed 
that bid three months ago. Magnin wouldn't identify the source of financing for 
the offer because his last offer wasn't accepted.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our offer was a fair one," said Magnin. "It is a naive assumption 
that liquidation will bring much more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, which also operates the Bullock's chain, declined comment on Magnin's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy said liquidation sales will commence Friday at the Magnin stores in 
Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Palos Verdes, Pasadena, San Diego, Carmel, 
Phoenix, Ariz. and at its San Francisco headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Magnin stores will be closed Monday through Wednesday to allow store 
personnel to prepare for the liquidation sales, which could continue until 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Macy will convert the Magnins in Woodland Hills, Palm Desert, Palo 
Alto and Walnut Creek into specialty men's or home stores within the Bullock's 
chain or into specialty Macy operations, such as Macy men's store. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, which will maintain the I. Magnin catalogue sales operation, said it 
will continue to explore options for the other eight Magnin stores -- including 
the possibility of further conversions to Bullock's and Macy's specialty 
formats. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the company have said it has explored the possibility of selling 
store sites to St. Louis-based May Department Stores and the Jackson, 
Mich.-based Jacobson Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy is in bankruptcy but is to emerge from bankruptcy protection when it 
merges with the Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores in late December. 
In a joint statement, Federated and Macy said Magnin operations will be phased 
out because it "is not expected to make a meaningful contribution to the 
combined company's bottom line."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MARKET TAKES WILD RIDE; DOW TRIMS LOSS TO 12.79 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks fell in volatile trading Friday as stock and index options 
expired, while the dollar rose on the government's report of an improvement in 
America's trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 41 points on interest rate 
worries, but trimmed its losses in a burst of late buying tied to expirations 
of futures contracts. The blue-chip average closed at 3,815.26, down 12.79 
points on the day, but up 13.79 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues beat advancers by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where 362.72 million shares changed hands, up from 323.21 million on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's volatility stemmed from the double expiration of 
index and individual options, but the "double witching" did not overshadow the 
sour mood of investors, who were still hounded by this week's interest rate 
hike by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has been struggling to find its bearings since the Fed tightened 
short-term interest rates on Tuesday for the sixth time this year in an effort 
to slow the economy and curb inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed increased the discount rate it charges banks for loans to 4.75% and 
boosted the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for money, to 
5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market's weak spots were interest rate-sensitive bank stocks and 
shares in companies seen as sensitive to any economic slowdown resulting from 
the higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency markets focused on the drop in the U.S. trade imbalance with Japan to 
$5.73 billion from $5.80 billion in August, even though the overall deficit 
widened to $10.13 billion from $9.68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 98.53 Japanese yen and 1.555 German marks, 
up from 98.35 yen and 1.551 marks late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yield slipped to 8.12% from Thursday's at 
8.13%. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, finished with a gain 
of 1/16 point, or around 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of other Treasury issues were unchanged to slightly lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking and financial stocks fell as analysts said higher rates would 
squeeze lending margins. On the Big Board, Citicorp fell 5/8 to 43 3/8 and 
BankAmerica lost 1 to 39 3/8. Bankers Trust lost 1 3/4 to 56 3/4, after a Wall 
Street Journal article suggested the stock could fall further on the bank's 
derivative investment problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Goodyear Tire & Rubber dropped 1 to 33 3/4 and Whirlpool Corp. gave back 7/8 
to 50 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, a Kmart Corp. unit, jumped 5 to 24 
from its offering price of 19. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shiva Corp., an off-site computer networking company, surged 16 1/2 from its 
starting price at 15. 
</P>
<P>
 * Synergen Inc. gained 3 21/32 to 9 1/32 on news that it agreed to be acquired 
by Amgen Inc. for $9.25 per share. Amgen lost 3/16 to 56 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Informix Corp. rose 1 13/16 to 29 1/16 after SoundView Financial Group 
upgraded its rating on the stock to buy from hold and raised its 1995 earnings 
estimates on the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes also retreated. The NYSE's composite index fell 1.19 
points to 252.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 2.09 points to 
461.47 and the Nasdaq composite index lost 1.17 points to 764.67. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average ended down 
34.01 points to 19,302.56. In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX 30-share average ended 
fractionally lower at 2,100.23, while London's Financial Times 100-share 
average closed up 3.5 points at 3,131.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa index plunged 36.10 points to close at 2429.11.

CHASE MANHATTAN TO ACQUIRE THREE U.S. TRUST CORP. UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan Corp. agreed Friday to acquire the securities-processing 
business of U.S. Trust Corp. for $363.5 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The move makes Chase the world's largest processor of securities transactions, 
which involves handling paperwork, settling trades, sending information to 
shareholders and other accounting and administrative tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition will give Chase, already a major processor, responsibility for 
handling $1.8 trillion inassets held by mutual funds, corporations, pension 
funds, endowments and foundations after the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, based in New York, will take over three U.S. Trust units -- one 
provides services to mutual funds, another targets 300 corporate clients and 
the third deals with unit investment trusts, which are investments that pay a 
steady stream of income. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the sale, U.S. Trust, a New York-based investment management firm 
with $32 billion in assets, will spin off its remaining businesses -- asset 
management, corporate trust services and banking for wealthy clients -- to its 
shareholders. This way, U.S. Trust can sell what's left to Chase in an exchange 
of stock only in a tax-free structure. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trust shareholders will receive stock in the new company on a 
share-for-share basis, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank expects the operations, which will be merged with Chase's by June, 
1995, to add $4 million to next year's profits, and to earn $22 million by 1996 
and $49 million a year by 2000.  
</P>
<P>
 Of U.S. Trust's 2,700 employees, 1,150 in New York and Boston will be move 
over to Chase. About 200 staffers will lose their jobs when the two companies 
consolidate operations, U.S. Trust said.

TEACHERS MANAGEMENT OWNERS ACCUSED OF MISMANAGING FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of Teachers Management & Investment Corp. in Newport Beach 
improperly transferred nearly $600,000 from one of the fund's three dozen 
partnerships, according to a report by the court-appointed manager for TMI's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis B. Schmucker said in his report, filed Thursday in Orange County 
Superior Court, that TMI "paid itself in apparent violation of the partnership 
agreement" for Parducci Winery Ltd. and that there was a "co-mingling of 
partnership funds" with other accounts.Schmucker, a veteran Southern California 
real estate trouble-shooter, also said he found a "disturbing pattern of 
apparent violations or distortion of the traditional transactions permitted 
under the terms of the partnership agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 That included evidence that an estimated $122,500 was diverted by TMI during 
the past three years as management fees in excess of the amounts disclosed to 
investors in partnership agreements, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $199,800 was taken to pay TMI staff salaries, also a violation of the 
partnership agreements, Schmucker said, citing an examination by accounting 
firm Kenneth Leventhal & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI owner Maurice B. Shuman called the report a "hatchet job" and said he will 
dispute the findings at a court hearing set for next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four investors filed a lawsuit in August alleging that TMI fraudulently lost 
$100 million of clients' funds. Most of the money in TMI's 38 real estate 
partnerships -- estimated to total nearly $1 billion -- was invested by 
California teachers for their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmucker was appointed by the court Oct. 6 to manage TMI's assets and examine 
the partnerships. He is to issue a full report to Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Francisco F. Firmat next month.

 Arco Unit, Alaska Strike Tax Deal: Arco Alaska Inc., a subsidiary of Los 
Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., has agreed to pay $269 million by Nov. 30 
to settle state tax disputes dating over several years, Alaska Gov. Walter 
Hickel said. The announcement came a day after Hickel revealed that a 
$1.4-billion settlement had been reached with British Petroleum's BP 
Exploration (Alaska) Inc. It is the largest tax settlement ever for the state, 
which has accused oil producers of understating wellhead oil prices to reduce 
state tax and royalty payments since 1977, the year oil began flowing through 
the trans-Alaska pipeline. The Arco agreement concerns oil and gas production 
taxes through 1991 and other oil and gas issues through September.

 Ford Loses Week of Production: The auto maker has suffered another setback in 
the U.S. launch of its "world cars," losing the production time on Ford Contour 
and Mercury Mystique sedans because of a strike at a seat maker's plant. A 
month ago, the company had to stop the Contour-Mystique line at its plant near 
Kansas City, Mo., for a week to deal with a recall that required replacement of 
flawed fuel tank parts in 28,500 cars. The current shutdown, which has caused 
the temporary layoff of about 2,500 Ford workers, began Nov. 10 when the 
factory ran out of seats made by Douglas & Lomason Co. at a plant in Excelsior 
Springs, 30 miles northeast of Kansas City.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MARKET TAKES WILD RIDE; DOW TRIMS LOSS TO 12.79

 Stocks closed broadly lower Friday in volatile trading as stock and index 
options expired, while the dollar gained on the government's report of an 
improvement in America's trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down as much as 41 points on continued 
interest rate worries, but trimmed its losses in a burst of late buying tied to 
expirations of options and futures contracts. The Dow ended at 3,815.26, down 
12.79 points on the day but up 13.79 points for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues beat advancers by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock Exchange 
in heavy turnover of 363 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's volatility stemmed partly from the double 
expiration of index and individual options. But many Wall Streeters noted that 
investors' mood overall remains sour in the wake of the Federal Reserve Board's 
most recent boost in short-term interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed increased its key discount rate and the overnight federal funds rate 
(what banks pay to borrow from each other) by 0.75 point last Tuesday, to 4.75% 
and 5.5% respectively. While the Fed's goal is to prolong the U.S. economic 
expansion by keeping it from overheating, the continuing rise in rates is 
spooking the bond market and increasing the allure of bank CDs and other 
short-term accounts, thereby draining money from the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market Friday yields surged early in the day, then closed mostly 
unchanged. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed at 8.12%, 
down from Thursday's 8.13% and slightly below the 8.15% of a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, showed strength after the government reported that the 
U.S. trade imbalance with Japan eased to $5.73 billion in September from $5.80 
billion in August, even though the overall deficit widened to $10.13 billion 
from $9.68 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 98.53 Japanese yen and 1.555 German marks, 
up from 98.35 yen and 1.551 marks late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many financial stocks dropped for a third straight day, responding to 
concerns that higher interest rates will squeeze profit margins. Citicorp fell 
5/8 to 43 3/8, BankAmerica lost 1 to 39 3/8, First Chicago dropped 1 to 47 1/4 
and Merrill Lynch was off 1/2 to 38 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility stocks also sank on interest rate worries. The Dow utility index 
fell 1.25 points to 174.47, a new five-year low. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some industrial issues dropped on worries about the economy in the wake of 
rising interest rates. Clark Equipment slid 2 3/4 to 62 3/4, Dow Chemical fell 
1 3/4 to 66 1/8, GM tumbled 3/4 to 37 3/4 and Emerson Electric was off 7/8 to 
61 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were a bright spot, as they have been all year. Software 
firm Autodesk surged 4 7/8 to 38 5/8 on a strong earnings report. Other winners 
included Informix, up 1 13/16 to 29 1/16; Intel, up 1 13/16 to 63 15/16; and 
Lotus, up 2 7/8 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Shiva Corp., a Burlington, Mass.-based off-site computer networking 
firm, made an initial public offering at 15 and rocketed to 31 1/2 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another new issue, sporting goods retailer Sports Authority, a K mart Corp. 
spinoff, went public at 19 and surged to 24 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hilton Hotels leaped 4 to 71 7/8, continuing its rise after the 
Southland-based company put itself up for sale on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's Nikkei 225-share average ended down 
34.01 points at 19,302.56. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the Frankfurt DAX 30-share average ended fractionally lower at 
2,100.23, while London's FTSE 100 index inched up 3.5 points to 3,131.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index took a new tumble, losing 36.10 points to close at 
2,429.11.

A ROSE IS A ROSE, BUT NOT ROSEANNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KRONKE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether mud-wrestling in the pages of Vanity Fair, grabbing her privates 
before a baseball game, declaring herself a victim of both parental and spousal 
abuse or introducing her conflicting internal personalities, Roseanne has 
demonstrated an unerring talent for turning anything she does into something 
worthy of discussion, into a certain brand of trailer-park performance art. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was appropriate Thursday night that the sitcom star, in her first 
stand-up comedy performance in four years, exploited her ability to shock and 
dismay by providing an angry attack on everything in sight, and a good many 
things not in her purview, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this benefit at the Comedy Store for the Feminist Majority Foundation, an 
abortion-rights organization, comics Carol Leifer and Wendy Liebman won big 
laughs with their sets, but Roseanne practically erased all pleasant memories 
of their jocularity with her caustic, admittedly "bitter" musings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a leopard-print top, Roseanne emerged smoking a cigarette, which she 
quickly stamped out on the stage floor. "I thought I'd smoke to (irritate) 
everybody," she announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Arnold's penis is three inches long!" she immediately bellowed to shrieks 
of delight early on, pulling no punches in her fierce battle with her 
soon-to-be former husband. Well, maybe one punch -- "OK, I'll say four, 'cause 
we're trying to settle." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she said she preferred Adolf Hitler to Arnold (Hitler at least knew 
"when it was time to go in the bunker and blow his head off; why don't they die 
when I'm through with 'em?"), her ex fared better than many of her targets. Her 
stated goal to offend appeared to be successful, as the crowd's initial delight 
deteriorated into numb, mute disappointment as her sour, bilious demeanor 
turned an evening of comedy -- with tickets at $125 and $200 -- into a seminar 
on self-loathing. (L.A. City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was among a few patrons 
who walked out mid-set.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her attacks grew so relentless that at one point, she allowed, "Maybe I should 
go back on Prozac." It scarcely seemed a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate men," she announced, launching into a profanity-strewn explanation as 
to why every member of said gender was responsible for the ills of the planet. 
"I hate women," she added, conjuring a violent scenario of female 
victimization. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment industry was a special target for her wrath: "Everything's a 
phony (expletive) piece of (expletive) designed to mess up your head. (Here 
are) the most evil (expletive) people on the face of the Earth." Denouncing 
entertainers as "sexual perverts," she said, "There's no integrity here . . . 
in this satanic hellhole." (No word on why she's still in town.) 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat redundantly, she summed up her sentiments with, "I hate every 
(expletive) living human being." Roseanne, Roseanne -- when are you going to 
get in touch with your feelings and tell us what you really think? 
</P>
<P>
 Working initially off notes, Roseanne delivered a smattering of comic 
material, but soon wearied of her jokes and chose instead to field questions 
from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not to say that she answered them. Asked why she would want to get married 
again (she plans to wed Ben Thomas on Feb. 14, 1995), she barked, "None of your 
(expletive) business." Nice ad-lib. 
</P>
<P>
 A question on the recent election revealed her to be totally clueless that one 
even occurred. She did attack Proposition 187, but admitted she hadn't voted. 
Her proclamation that "I tell the truth" rang hollow in light of her lack of 
social awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 She did say that she planned to expand her restaurant empire from the one in 
Iowa and that she hopes to have another child. After calling every sentient 
being in Hollywood a "whore," she admitted that after her notorious exploits 
with a fax machine (she sent withering messages to critics who panned Arnold's 
first sitcom), she approached various fax machine manufacturers about "hawking" 
their product but got no takers. 
</P>
<P>
 About her infamous kiss on her TV series with actress Mariel Hemingway, she 
said, "I've had better." Her basic theme of the evening was summed up when she 
told one audience member, "Hope's usually a big, fat lie." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, her pity party disintegrated into confusion, and fellow performer 
(and "Roseanne" writer) Carrie Snow convinced her to cut her losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't someone who so clearly hates what she does, and has the money to 
do so, just not bolt from this satanic hellhole? In fact, one woman even asked 
her, "Where do you want to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare moment of playfulness, she quipped, "Ben and Jerry's." 
</P>
<P>
 Godspeed. And Roseanne -- don't bother; I've already faxed myself a nasty 
note.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ASSASSINS': SONDHEIM'S KILLER MUSICAL COMEDY HITS THE MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Francisco Martin Duran, who is accused of shooting up the north side of the 
White House while President Clinton was inside, was indicted on a charge of 
attempted assassination on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened to be the same day that the mind-boggling "Assassins" opened at 
Los Angeles Theatre Center's small Theatre 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps someday composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim and playwright John Weidman 
will add Duran to their chorus line. He would join John Wilkes Booth, John 
Hinckley, McKinley assassin Leon Czolgosz, Garfield murderer Charles Guiteau, 
wanna-be F.D.R. killer Giuseppe Zangara, would-be Nixon assailant Sam Byck and 
the two women who tried to shoot Gerald Ford -- Squeaky Fromme and Sara Jane 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the top of "Assassins," this motley lineup admonishes us to hold onto our 
dreams. "Everybody's got the right to be happy," they sing. It's a free 
country, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Is this musical comedy material? A crackerjack staging by Los Angeles 
Repertory Company proves that it is. Sidesplitting and sobering in equal 
measure, this is the most provocative musical in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim and Weidman attack American solipsism with a vengeance. The notion 
that you can do anything you want -- ignoring consequences to others -- has 
been encouraged by hundreds of self-help philosophers and in plenty of musical 
theater numbers. Yet look what it leads to here. 
</P>
<P>
 The show doesn't buy any literal conspiracy theories. But it does present the 
band of President-shooters as a club whose members support each other across 
the decades whenever the going gets rough. The club encourages new applicants, 
such as Lee Harvey Oswald (ashen-faced John Allee), to join in making history. 
</P>
<P>
 The extreme individualism that the show challenges also creates ripe material 
for comedy. A variety of delusions crosses this stage: 
</P>
<P>
 * The political zealotry of Booth (dashing Tom Zemon) 
</P>
<P>
 * The lovesickness of Hinckley (morose Steve Jackson Wilde) and Fromme 
(blissed-out Bridget Hoffman) 
</P>
<P>
 * The plebeian rage of Czolgosz (fiery-voiced Sean Smith) 
</P>
<P>
 * The self-promotional careerism of Guiteau (dapper Alan Safier) 
</P>
<P>
 * The inchoate sickness of Zangara (red-faced Gary Imhoff) 
</P>
<P>
 * The mad-housewife routine of Moore (daffy Jean Kauffman) 
</P>
<P>
 * The ignored bonhomie of Byck (hilarious Paul W. Carr, appropriately dressed 
as Santa Claus). 
</P>
<P>
 This rich panorama of characters becomes even richer by bringing them face to 
face with each other and with such onlookers as Emma Goldman (Pamela 
Tomassetti) and Gerald Ford (David Holladay). 
</P>
<P>
 Sondheim's ingenious impressions of popular American music capture the 
assassins' can-do sentiments to perfection, and Kay Cole's musical staging, 
Paul Baker's musical direction and Thomas Griep's five-person band (kept in 
shadows at the rear) do justice to this audacious score. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a Balladeer (tenor Timothy Smith) periodically pops up to suggest 
that the assassins act out of crazed and isolated impulses that don't seriously 
affect the progress of the country. Not so, reply Sondheim and Weidman. They 
contend that the crackpots feed on the same American dreams that inspired the 
Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the New York critics didn't like "Assassins" in 1991. Many of the 
London critics did in 1992. This production uses a song added for London, 
"Something Just Broke." Just before the show ends, it's sung by common folk 
recalling the moment they heard a President had been shot. Presumably it's 
designed to make the show a tad less bitter; the only other song sung by 
every-day non-assassins, "How I Saved Roosevelt," presents the bystanders at 
the attempted shooting of F.D.R. as a pack of glory-seekers whose motivations 
are uncomfortably close to those of some assassins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something Just Broke" is pretty, but remembering what you were doing when a 
President was shot is a cliche. Audiences shouldn't need this kind of 
intellectual coddling. Besides, the show lasts two hours without an 
intermission, in one of the most cramped seating configurations in town. A 
brief trim would help. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ellenstein's staging also uses a different opening setting from those in 
New York and London. Here a young boy (Matthew Bartilson) picks a U.S. flag off 
the floor, exits and is followed on stage by a relatively innocent-looking 
huckster (Christopher Carroll), dressed for the Fourth of July. The man pushes 
a cart of the kind that dispenses hot dogs or ice cream in the park. But we 
quickly learn that this cart contains guns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other productions, this guy ran a carnival shooting gallery 
specifically designed as a kill-the-President game. That indeed sounds like 
overkill. Here the evil crops up in otherwise benign circumstances, which 
supports the show's theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Smith's backdrop is a blank slate -- a set of translucent sliding 
Japanese screens. Booth's silhouette descends a staircase before he actually 
appears, increasing the ominous sense of occasion at this dreadful, wonderful 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Assassins," Los Angeles Theatre Center Theatre 4, 514 S. Spring St. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 and 7 p.m. $18-$25. (213) 485-1681.

 Rush's World: Looking for someplace to spend your next vacation? Forget Disney 
World. Take a trip to Limbaugh Land. The southeast Missouri town of Cape 
Girardeau is aiming to lure tourists by pitching its connection to hometown boy 
Rush Limbaugh. Beginning early next year, excursion buses (making mostly right 
turns, no doubt) will pass the hospital where the conservative talk-show host 
was born, the house where he lived, the barbershop where he shined shoes and 
the radio station where he got his start. Postcards and souvenir magnets will 
be available.

 'Eye'ing Stability: CBS' "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" is apparently staying 
put, at least for now, in its tough Thursday 10 p.m. time slot against NBC's 
powerhouse drama "ER." Earlier this week, "Eye" executive producer Susan 
Zirinsky told a reporter that meetings have been held about either revamping or 
moving the show, and rumors have been circulating about "Eye's" future all 
week. But on Thursday, CBS News president Eric Ober said there were no 
"current" plans for changes on the show or its time period. "The only thing we 
have planned for 'Eye to Eye' right now," Ober said, "is to keep on doing 
really good, really interesting shows and spending less time on talking in 
public about it." So far this fall, "Eye" is in a tie for 69th place among 
prime-time shows.

 'Party' Time: Fox is switching the time periods for two of its low-rated

nights at 9, while "Party," about five siblings struggling to keep their family 
together after the deaths of their parents, will air after another 
teen-oriented show, "Beverly Hills, 90210," on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. Both 
"Party" and "Models" have had trouble in the ratings; "Party" ranks 97th out of 
101 prime-time shows while "Models" is in 84th place. In a vote of confidence, 
however, Fox announced Friday that it had ordered four more episodes of 
"Party," bringing the season's total to 20, and will rebroadcast its pilot 
episode on Dec. 28 at 9 p.m. MOVIES & VIDEO

 Script Turns Real: Art imitated life for French superstar Gerard Depardieu 
this week during filming in Hong Kong of his latest movie, "Guardian Angels," 
about a European gangster getting tangled up with the Chinese Triad criminal 
societies. As part of an extortion attempt, six real Triads turned up on the 
set, threatening to disrupt work on the film unless they were paid off. Police 
arrested the would-be gangsters, ages 16 to 20. Since the Chinese communist 
revolution of 1949, the British colony has been the world headquarters of the 
Triad gangs. Hong Kong police have identified 57 different Triad societies in 
the crowded territory. POP/ROCK

 Velvet Comes Above Ground: Lou Reed won't be on hand but the remaining three 
musicians of the influential 1960s rock group Velvet Underground were scheduled 
to reunite Friday night for their first U.S. concert in 25 years. However, the 
band is only playing two dates (including tonight) in a small venue -- a 
110-seat theater at Pittsburgh's Andy Warhol Museum. John Cale, Sterling 
Morrison and Moe Tucker planned to improvise 90-minute sets while images from 
Warhol's early silent films were projected upon them. In the band's early days, 
Reed and other members worked with Warhol on several of his avant-garde 
projects. It was Warhol's idea for them to record and he was listed as 
co-producer on their first album, for which he also provided the cover design.

 Tribute to Bakersfield: Buck Owens, who helped popularize country music's 
Bakersfield Sound, is creating a museum honoring the genre -- in the San 
Joaquin Valley town, of course. Construction on the museum and a restaurant, 
bar, stage and dance area should begin within a few weeks, said Owens' 
spokesman. Bakersfield has been called "Nashville West" due to the honky-tonk 
music made famous by Owens, Merle Haggard and others. Owens' hits include the 
1988 song "The Streets of Bakersfield," recorded with Dwight Yoakam. THE ARTS

ALBUM REVIEW; PRINCE'S 'BLACK ALBUM': 7-YEAR WAIT ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ah yes, another posthumous album from the late and lamented Prince -- or, as 
we prefer to think of his erstwhile persona, TASTAHA-TAFKAP (The Artist Soon to 
Acknowledge Himself as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince). 
</P>
<P>
 Since he and Warner Bros. aren't seeing eye to eye on what his output should 
be right now, he's apparently resolved for the time being to only give the 
label material recorded during his previous life. First out of the vault was 
"Come," and now -- hot on its heels and in stores on Tuesday -- comes the 
legendary "Black Album." 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is there any halfway-hardcore Prince fan in America who doesn't 
already own a copy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Black" may have sold more units as a bootleg in the seven years since it was 
recorded than "Come" has on the open market in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 When Prince scotched its planned 1987 release, rumors had it that it was too 
"dark" for the spiritually-minded one to conscientiously release without bad 
karma coming back on his "positivity." 
</P>
<P>
 These things do grow in legend, and by 1994's utterly lax post-gangsta 
standards, "Black Album" doesn't prove so extraordinarily profane. But it is 
nasty -- both in the literal and the Vanity 6 sense. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two songs are performed under the guise of unsavory characters: In 
"Dead On It," Prince does an early rap as Hellzapoppin, a ladies' man who 
sleeps in a coffin and brags he's got "a gold tooth, cost more than your 
house!" 
</P>
<P>
 In "Bob George," his weirdest number ever, he electronically alters his voice 
to do a long quasi-comedy shtick as a jealous lover who pulls a gun when he 
realizes his gal has been sleeping with Prince's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he pays homage to the future Mrs. Richard Gere in the mash note 
"Cindy C." -- sample lyric: "Where'd you get that beauty mark? Baby, you and I 
should be undressing" -- well, that's Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Any "ideas" therein are incalculably silly. The funk isn't so quickly 
dismissible. Most of the tracks are relatively unstructured jams that find 
Prince in an interesting stylistic transition phase. 
</P>
<P>
 At heart, it's a one-man-band project, the uniquely dense and compressed mix 
as well as trademark sex-addict lyrics suggesting the scraping out of a 
neurotic skull we'd never heard scraped before. (Which is why the later New 
Power Generation albums, for all their instrumental acumen, will never be as 
exciting as the pre-TAFKAP solo Prince.) 
</P>
<P>
 But some outside musicians do pop in to "open up" the sound, including a 
brilliantly arranged horn section that takes the closing "Rockhard in a Funky 
Place" into territory that can be described, without a hint of charity, as 
jazz. It's as great a party album as it is a subject of study for armchair 
psychoanalysts interested in arrested development.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; GOOD OL' BOY JACKSON IN SAME OL' SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the music industry gave awards for niceness, country singer Alan Jackson 
would have a bushelbasket full. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, that's right . . . they do -- and he does. 
</P>
<P>
 You really couldn't ask for a more congenial, from-head-to-toe likable star 
than this long, tall Georgian. Thursday at the Pond of Anaheim, Jackson oozed 
gawrsh-ma'am sincerity and a Gary Cooper-like decency. 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities, with a strong measure of all-American good looks to boot, are 
every bit as important to Jackson's remarkable commercial success as his 
singing or his songwriting, which are, at best, modestly above average.  
</P>
<P>
 Through 19 songs -- by and large the same set list he used here almost exactly 
one year ago -- Jackson steered his expert Strayhorns band smoothly around any 
and all pockets of turbulence. It's a great quality in an airline pilot, less 
desirable in a country singer. An exuberant exception was "What Kind of Man?" 
-- a traditional bluegrass-gospel roof-raiser that came mid-show. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all sense of performance was yielded to the director of Jackson's 
video-heavy production. Nearly 50 screens were scattered about the stage, 
constantly filled with images from his music videos, home movies and, 
occasionally, live shots from the stage. If he didn't seem so genuinely 
unassuming, you'd get the idea he had a big ego. 
</P>
<P>
 Opener Faith Hill let loose with more vocal power than on her thoroughly 
unremarkable debut album, "Take Me as I Am." She even mustered a couple of 
gutsy growls and leaps into falsetto range during her set. But her voice has 
little inherent character and she did little with it except belt, belt, 
belt.RANDY LEWIS

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; THEY MIGHT BE GIANTS, BUT THEN AGAIN . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's OK to be geeky. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the underlying message in everything done by They Might Be Giants, the 
Brooklyn band that's gradually built a strong cult following of fans grateful 
for the freedom to wear fezzes and pogo uninhibitedly down the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the fez look has faded into the TMBG archives, but at the Pantages 
Theatre on Thursday the essence remained the same, even as the sound has 
matured and expanded. The core duo of John Flansburgh and John Linnell now 
fronts a full-fledged, versatile band, but the two remain nerdy naifs getting a 
kick out of playing rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 The music ranged from an adenoidal, streetcorner vocal-group sound descended 
from homies Dion & the Belmonts to jerky new-wave to Beach Boys-ish pop to 
campfire kiddie tunes. Intricate vocal arrangements made unwieldy word clusters 
flow smoothly and to comic effect, and there was even some black-and-white TV 
era "sounds of the city"-type scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 But a little Giants can go a long way. Balancing the charm of "Birdhouse in 
Your Soul" and the moral affirmation of "Your Racist Friend" were musical jokes 
that went on way too long and never paid off, and a lack of coherence in their 
mix of spoofery and sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Black opened with a solo set of songs about Pong, the Ramones, John 
Denver and assorted esoterica. Eventually he started slinging his guitars onto 
his back when he picked up a new one, and when he walked off the stage he 
looked like some prehistoric creature festooned with spiky armor. RICHARD

JAZZ MASTERS TEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was delighted to see Don Heckman's excellent article about the Joshua 
Redman/Sergio Salvatore/Jack Elliott presentations at USC as part of the 
American Express Gold Card Grammy Festival ("These Teachers Are Music to 
Students' Ears," Nov. 10). 
</P>
<P>
 I know from experience that the youngsters who were fortunate enough to attend 
that event really appreciated their exposure to jazz.Last summer we touched 
more than 50 youngsters from all over Los Angeles County during six weeks of 
free master classes at the Music Center. The jazz masters who taught the 
classes still hear from many of the young musicians, who report that they have 
a new understanding of the art and continue to practice what they were taught. 
</P>
<P>
 We consulted with public school music teachers and administrators before 
structuring the master class sessions. They told us that even when there was a 
decent music education program in the schools, most teachers were not educated 
about jazz. As a result, we shall also present a course in jazz studies for 
music teachers as another way to benefit the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way jazz can survive and prosper is to reach young people and help 
them appreciate their nation's native art form.

DOHERTY'S 'PASSION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although your reviewer was somewhat kind to Shannen Doherty's performance as 
Margaret Mitchell in NBC's "A Burning Passion," this viewer was appalled (" 
'Burning Passion' Brings Mitchell's Tara to Real Life," Nov. 7). 
</P>
<P>
 Doherty may make it as a Beverly Hills brat, but as Mitchell she did not have 
the vaguest concept of what being a flirtatious Atlanta belle is all about.Most 
of the time she was simply dour, morose and downright unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 In a television interview, Doherty stated that, as part of the research for 
the role, she did not bother to read "Gone With the Wind"! And Mitchell only 
wrote one novel. God forbid if Doherty were asked to portray the prolific Joyce 
Carol Oates! 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't Americans bring off what the English could do in their sleep? Our 
two most famous Southern belles, Scarlett O'Hara and Blanche DuBois, were 
essayed by Vivien Leigh. Now Joanne Whalley-Kilmer and Timothy Dalton have 
portrayed Scarlett and Rhett on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there something that can be done? Can we send the cast of "Beverly Hills, 
90210" to England for 10 years so that they can come back with a little more 
skill and polish and perhaps the ability to get through reading "Gone With the 
Wind"?

COMING TO THE DEFENSE OF 'NYPD BLUE'S' DAVID MILCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Vernon D. Sanders' letter, "How to Define One's Fate in Hollywood" 
(Saturday Letters, Nov. 12): I attended the Humanitas lecture on "NYPD Blue." 
David Milch did state that the writing for a seminar he led was not good enough 
for submission as a television writing sample. But Milch also said he started 
that seminar to create more opportunities for minority writers. And, after the 
Humanitas lecture, Milch invited the African American writers present to submit 
writing samples to him. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Milch's comment, "I'm racist," I think it was an honest recognition 
that prejudice exists in all of us. I'm far more suspicious of any person who 
declares him or herself free of racism. At least Milch has both admitted it and 
taken positive steps to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders pronounces Milch "arrogant." As a writer, I hope Sanders knows that 
research is a key foundation for good writing. To base his opinion of a person 
and a television show on a few highly edited quotes is another, even more 
prejudiced form of arrogance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As a writer in attendance at the October Humanitas workshop, I would describe 
Milch as honest in his remarks describing his own opinions and experience. Over 
the five donated hours of his address, he provided people who were really 
listening with a lot of insight into his show, his body of work and his own 
creative process. That was generous -- a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 I appreciated his honesty about rejecting racial and gender quotas on his 
show. He doesn't believe in them. Fine. That is his privilege. He believes in a 
meritocracy on his writing staff. So do we all, frankly. We just want to be 
found meritorious by him. I wish we could all be. 
</P>
<P>
 When he addresses a professional writers' group, hungry for insight into his 
show and his mental process, that's what we should get -- and did get. I want 
truth, not some sanitized version. The question "why?" is always the one that's 
hardest for writers to answer. Milch tried to tell us why he does what he does. 
We should all be so brazen, and so open-minded.

MUSIC REVIEW; LACO GETS BACK TO ROOTS WITH SOME 'FAVORITES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra is increasingly returning to its roots in 
18th-Century repertory, a decision that seemed to please the large audience 
present for the concert on Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a return as well to the days when the guest director of the present 
occasion, Iona Brown, was a shining light of Neville Marriner's Academy of St. 
Martin-in-the-Fields, when it specialized in the kind of music Marriner would 
eventually bring to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the feel of those less hectic, less scholarship-dominated days, too, 
in Thursday's comfortable, often noble performances, as distinct from the 
hectic, short-breathed, gotta-dance rhythmic blowouts in which some period 
bands specialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The LACO program, in which Brown shared solo duties with the orchestra's 
ever-alert concertmaster, Ralph Morrison, comprised "favorites" we hardly ever 
hear in concert: music by Handel, Corelli, Vivaldi and J.S. Bach that the 
traveling antiquarians rarely program, in the belief that we've had our fill of 
them, when, in fact, the Baroque movements of decades past largely bypassed 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by Patricia Mabee's busy, at times soloistic harpsichord continuo 
(another throwback), the 15-member string ensemble delivered with consistent 
suavity and exemplary balances, slimming its tone appropriately for the 
propulsive demands of Corelli's Concerto Grosso in D, Opus 6, No. 4, its first 
Adagio lavishly decorated by violinist Brown, and the A-minor Concerto (No. 8) 
from Vivaldi's "L'Estro Armonico," in which Brown and Morrison were at once 
well-matched and neatly differentiated solo presences. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynamic fussing gave an inappropriately Romantic, even bathetic feel to the 
slow movement of Bach's Concerto for Two Violins, and the slower portions of 
Handel's Concerto Grosso in A, Opus 6, No. 11, might have been more compact and 
angular as well. In the main, however, the concert showed what satisfying 
results a Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra with reduced forces (and ambitions) can 
achieve.HERBERT GLASS

MUSIC REVIEW; KRONOS QUARTET ESSAYS EIGHT NEW WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kronos Quartet just doesn't ever seem to run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a kind of musical housecleaning in Schoenberg Hall at UCLA Thursday night, 
the group, now 21 years old, turned up small treasure after small treasure, 
presenting eight new works, seven written especially for the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 These musicians -- David Harrington and John Sherba, violins, Hank Dutt, 
viola, and Jean Jeanrenaud, cello -- showed their usual commitment and 
precision, but it is their ease of playing that allows one to concentrate 
solely on the music. They get out of the way, in the best sense. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of works incorporated taped sounds on this occasion. Ingram 
Marshall's "Fog Tropes II" mixes sweet, gentle string music in a misty, distant 
collage of fog horns, wind, voices and Balinese instruments, a kind of "La 
Mer," George Crumb-style. Similarly, Peter Sculthorpe's "From Ubirr" uses a 
throbbing stream of didgeridoo music to create a rich, sonorous backdrop for 
harmonious and folksy string parts. Not afraid to make pleasant sounds, these 
two composers. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Ana-Maria Avram isn't afraid to make ugly ones in her "Ikarus II," a 
fairly typical work experimenting with new playing techniques perhaps, but 
performed with such aplomb that its grindings, thwackings, growlings and 
rattlings became fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Daugherty's "Elvis Everywhere" proved a wonderfully hammy medley for 
(taped) Elvis impersonators and string quartet, using "thank you very much" as 
a kind of mantra and quoting "Dixie" and "O Sole Mio," among others -- dizzy 
with energy. A very different evocation, Elliott Carter's 1994 "Fragment," 
written entirely in harmonics, briefly shimmers in the air, in an evaporating 
remembrance of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Music by Ken Benshoof, Hirokazu Hiraishi and Osvaldo Golijov further reminded 
us of this quartet's wide interests and sure instincts. Model lighting and 
amplification, subtle and unobtrusive, added yet another entrancing 
element.TIMOTHY MANGAN

EAGLES PULL THE PLUG ON NIRVANA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many industry insiders figured that Nirvana's "Unplugged" would top the album 
charts throughout the holiday season, but the insiders didn't count on that 
fearsome yuppie buying power. The Eagles are among the all-time thirty- and 
fortysomething favorites and the band's new "Hell Freezes Over" knocked Nirvana 
out of No. 1 after just one week.The other shocker is that Madonna's "Bedtime

A SURPRISING TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to draw your attention to Howard Rosenberg's review of 
"Scarlett," ("Frankly, 'Scarlett,' I Had a Ball," Nov. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 I was astonished and offended to note that Rosenberg referred to Irish people 
as "potatoheads." 
</P>
<P>
 This demeaning racial term is doubly offensive because of its reference to the 
Great Famine of 1847-49, during which the population of Ireland was halved from 
8 million to 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only hope it was ignorance on Rosenberg's part and not intentional. 
Still, ignorance is no excuse, as they say in court.

TV REVIEWS; 'CAGE / CUNNINGHAM' HONORS INNOVATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 50-year partnership between composer John Cage and choreographer Merce 
Cunningham redefined the possibilities for music and dance by questioning 
nearly all the basic assumptions about those arts. Elliot Caplan's 1991 film 
"Cage/Cunningham" honors their innovations by adopting many of their methods in 
its style and structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing twice Sunday on Bravo cable, Caplan's non-linear documentary 
juxtaposes intimate interview and historic archival footage, clips from home 
movies and excerpts from stage performances -- and sometimes just fragments of 
sound and color. As the evidence accumulates over 96 minutes, a who's who of 
modern music and, particularly, painting drops in to chat about key creative 
issues and discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cage talks about the influence of Buddhist scholar D.T. Suzuki and Cunningham 
the concepts of space common to Buddhism and scientific theory. Robert 
Rauschenberg discusses collaborations in which the choreographer, composer and 
designer went off and worked independently, so "nobody knew what anybody else 
was doing until it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Former company dancers from Viola Farber to Remy Charlip illuminate the 
physical challenges of Cunningham's pieces and even Rudolf Nureyev materializes 
long enough to make a statement about aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Cage died two years ago at 79, but the film celebrates all the new beginnings 
of his and Cunningham's career. It's fascinating moment by moment and never 
forces a grand historical overview down your throat. 
</P>
<P>
 You're free to consider modern art a sublime prank by the unlikeliest 
revolutionaries you could imagine. Or you can just bask in the warmth of 
reminiscences that give the film its sweetly personal tone. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the last dance clip doesn't show some futuristic experiment but the 
balletic body-sculpture of "Septet" to music by Satie. Cage and Cunningham 
could always surprise you, and Caplan's film is no different. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Cage/Cunningham" airs at 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. Sunday and at 3:35 p.m. Nov. 26

TV REVIEWS; LIMITED THRILLS IN 'MORTAL FEAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a medical thriller, "Mortal Fear" is about as entertaining as a clogged 
artery. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, adapted from Robin Cook's novel about the perils of gene-tampering, 
expires in the first half hour from a lack of narrative oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the production, starring Joanna Kearns as a tireless physician 
tracking down mysterious deaths in a Boston hospital, is claustrophobic. When 
the plot gets murky, director Larry Shaw (from a scenario by Rob Gilmer and 
Roger Young) tends to rely on unnerving close-ups of needle injections. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least the thematic aspirations are current: managed health care, of all 
things, and genetic engineering (in this case, an age reversal gene that 
unfortunately only ages). 
</P>
<P>
 The movie foolishly tries to enliven events with a romance between Kearns and 
the hospital administrator (Gregory Harrison) that's devoid of chemistry, a 
subplot about a forlorn stripper (Katherine LaNasa) and weird moments with a 
cheerful coroner (Rebecca Schull). -- R.L. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Mortal Fear" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 39).

TV REVIEWS; 'BABIES' SHOWS POPULARITY, EXPLOITATION OF QUINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A picture calendar of the quints, with their distinctive brunette ringlets, 
adorned almost every family's home in the 1930s. The Dionne Quintuplets were 
bigger than Shirley Temple, a beacon of hope in the middle of the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 They were also shamelessly exploited, literally ripped from their parents' 
arms and turned into media freaks whom tourists flocked to ogle, like monkeys 
in a cage. 
</P>
<P>
 The incredible chronicle of their early captive years, when an adoring public 
took scant note of their regimented life in a glorified laboratory, is 
dramatized in "Million Dollar Babies," a richly told, two-part biographical 
movie on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Beau Bridges stars as an affable country doctor dragged out in the middle of 
the night to deliver not one or even twin babies, but, in a dramatic sequence 
using animatronic dolls as infants, the first case of surviving quintuplets in 
recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
 The quints were born two months premature in 1934 in a raggedy farmhouse in 
backwoods Ottawa, Canada. The stunned parents are a poor French Canadian 
couple, the soon-to-be victimized and embittered Oliva and Elzire Dionne 
(played with quiet integrity by Canadian actors Roy Dupuis and Celine Bonnier). 
</P>
<P>
 The insightful movie (written by Suzette Couture and directed by Christian 
Duguay) paints the earthy, loving pair (who already had five kids) as targets 
of racism. Canadian authorities politically branded the parents as incompetents 
because, as the couple's defense attorney later argues, "they're impoverished, 
French and Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind all the maneuvering, of course, and violating this very real miracle of 
a birth, were five bundles of money waiting to be plucked. Bridges' physician 
(the self-promoting Dr. Allan DaFoe) is a curious Jekyll-and-Hyde character who 
snared legal custody of the quints and beamingly commercialized his good 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Deliciously spurring the gouging and the media hype -- in a feeding lather 
that clearly echoes the O.J. Simpson blitz -- is a fictional but savvy sob 
sister (the ripely haughty Kate Nelligan). An early-day version of a talk-show 
sniper, she extols the homespun values of the births on her popular American 
radio show, where the studio scenes are an Art Deco hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Million Dollar Babies" begins Sunday at 9 p.m. and concludes Tuesday at 9 
on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). RAY LOYND

ACCENTS; FLAG DAYS; THEY CELEBRATE FALL COLORS, SPRING FLOWERS AND A HOST OF 
HOLIDAYS. THE ONES THAT PEOPLE FLY FROM THEIR HOMES THESE DAYS ARE DOWNRIGHT 
PLAYFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Flying flags and banners to draw attention to store sales or upcoming 
municipal events is a time-honored tradition. Old Glory can be seen waving from 
houses as well as public places on every national holiday. But these days, 
flags and banners are being used in new ways: They are swaying in the breeze 
outside homes, an everyday sight welcoming the seasons and marking holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The decorative flags add color and motion and seem to say that someone in a 
pleasant frame of mind lives here. Once a specialty shop item, the flags are 
also now for sale in department, hardware and even drug stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Flag sales started strong in the Southeast, eventually catching on along the 
West Coast and then the rest of the country, according to Tom Michero, sales 
manager for Windsport Inc., manufacturers of decorative flags, banners and 
windsocks in Austin, Tex. "It's not just houses along the beach, but 
neighborhoods all over that are hanging decorative flags," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 First offered 14 years ago, flags and banners for the home were slow to catch 
on but are now the firm's biggest sellers, Michero said. Windsocks are also a 
hit, he said. "We got the idea from the celebration of Boys' Day in Japan, 
which has been going on for thousands of years," Michero said. For that 
celebration on May 5, every male member of a Japanese household hangs a special 
windsock outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put an American spin on it by making our windsocks very colorful and 
designed for all sorts of American seasons," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial sales were slow. People did not seem to know what to do with these 
kite-like socks that floated in the breeze. But as they began to appear on more 
and more houses, sales started taking off. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always looking for new decorative accessories for their homes. As 
the windsocks gained in popularity, we started adding flags and banners to our 
line," Michero said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Kent, owner of Kites Etc. in Newport Beach, said it took a while for her 
customers to come around to the flags and windsocks she sells. "It's funny, we 
opened the kite shop about seven years ago and carried the flags, and they just 
did not move," she said. "We put them away and then brought them out again 
about two years ago, and they started selling like hot cakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Kent attributes the change in public attitude to the few people who did hang 
the colorful decorations outside their homes. "People saw their neighbors 
hanging these flags and came in a bit confused as to why they were doing it. 
Once they learned it was just for decoration, they too started buying them. Now 
it's about 65% of my business." 
</P>
<P>
 The decorations are usually made of nylon and come in myriad colors and 
designs. Every holiday from Halloween to Cinco de Mayo is represented. Seasonal 
flags and banners with sunflowers for summer and cornucopias for fall are 
available. Hobbies are also well represented. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Pinel has a flag depicting a sailboat hanging from the eaves of her 
Silverado Canyon home. "I got it about four months ago," she said. "It caught 
my eye because my husband and I have a sailboat and it's our main hobby." 
</P>
<P>
 So far she is pleased with the added touch the flag gives to her home. "I just 
wonder if it will survive the Santa Anas," Pinel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeryl Vonesh of Costa Mesa changes the flags on her two-story house with the 
seasons. "I wanted to add a decorative touch to the house, something personal." 
Each holiday has its own flag, and there is one she hangs for her children's 
birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've also given them as gifts, which is great because you can keep adding to 
someone's collection with each season," Vonesh added. 
</P>
<P>
 She has tried several flags in different price ranges but recommends staying 
away from the bargain basement variety. "They tend to fade out really quickly 
and become frayed." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of banners, flags and windsocks vary widely with quality, size and 
complexity of design. They can range in price from $3 to more than $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Defendorf and her husband, Ed, started selling the three styles of 
outdoor decorations alongside their kites at the Orange County Marketplace in 
Costa Mesa three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Because their overhead is low, they are able to sell the decorations for $3 to 
$20. "Being an outdoor market we can get away with selling at wholesale prices. 
We will also do mail orders for an extra $2," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a while for them to catch on, but now we have a great call for them."

TRUE OR FALSE; TEST YOUR ORGANIC GARDENING KNOWLEDGE WITH THIS QUIZ. SOME OF 
THE ANSWERS MAY SUPRISE YOU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1. Most insects are bad news and should be eliminated from the garden in order 
to preserve plant health. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Organic gardening can be less expensive than going the chemical route. 
</P>
<P>
 3. When a food package reads "certified organically grown," you can be assured 
that the food was grown organically. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Organic pesticides are all natural and therefore nontoxic and completely 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
 5. The average home gardener useing a weedkiller sprays a solution much 
stronger than the Malathion mixture sprayed on agricultural crops. 
</P>
<P>
 6. A garden full of bacteria is an unhealthy one. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Compost smells bad, but the results are worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Organically grown plants and jproduce tend to have a lot of insect damage, 
such as chew holes in leaves. Quiz Answers 
</P>
<P>
 1) False. Only 10% of insects in the garden will cause problems. The other 90% 
are beneficial, and a garden will actually suffer without their presence.  
</P>
<P>
 2) True. Organic gardening is usually very inexpensive. Yard waste can be 
recycled to make compost, which helps fertilize plants and cuts down on 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
 3) True. Packaging claims are now closely scrutinized, and it is against the 
law to state that something was organically grown if it wasn't. Make sure that 
the food was certified by an organization and the name is listed. On California 
products you'll often see printed, California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF). 
</P>
<P>
 4) False. Although organic pesticides are all natural and they decompose 
rapidly when exposed to air and sunlight, they are poisons. Many are toxic to 
beneficial insects and in varying degrees to humans and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 5) True. A minuscule amount of Malathion per gallon is used in the aerial 
sprays for Medflies contrasted with the pesticide mixtures recommended for home 
gardeners.  
</P>
<P>
 6) False. A healthy garden has a soil rich in bacteria. Bacteria help 
accomplish a number of critical tasks, including digesting and converting 
various raw materials, such as organic fertilizer, into a form that plants can 
then absorb through their roots. Good bacteria also help to keep bad bacteria 
and harmful nematodes in check. 
</P>
<P>
 7) False. Compost that is tended properly and provided with good air 
circulation doesn't smell bad at all. Finished compost even has a sweet, earthy 
smell. 
</P>
<P>
 8) False. A healthy organic garden has vigorous, green plants that produce 
appetizing, attractive fruits and vegetables.

EMULATING NATURE TO CONTROL PLANT PESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing things without using synthetic fertilizers or insecticides is gaining 
new attention, but it is a very old concept. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years before chemicals were introduced, there was no way to garden but 
organically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous to say that crops won't thrive without chemicals," said Mike 
McGrath, editor in chief of Organic Gardening magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 "True gardening is growing without the use of chemicals. People who go out and 
soak the garden with chemicals aren't gardeners, they're mad scientists." 
</P>
<P>
 Organic gardening lost popularity in the late 1940s when using petroleum-based 
chemical fertilizers and pesticides became the "new and better way" to farm and 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers and home gardeners began using tons of chemical fertilizers and 
pesticides without much thought until the 1960s and early 1970s, when 
scientists began discovering how these chemicals harm the Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, scientists have found that much of the ground water in the United 
States is contaminated with pesticides and chemical fertilizers, including 
California's, which is in "pretty bad shape," said entomologist Michael Atkins, 
one of the founders of Safer Inc., a company that produces organic pesticides.  
</P>
<P>
 Research has shown for years that chemical pesticide use has led to a decline 
in the numbers and health of many animals. And now there is alarming evidence 
that artificial pesticides and industrial chemicals are causing sexual 
confusion and an inability to reproduce in some animals.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike organic fertilizers and pesticides, which quickly degrade to harmless 
compounds when exposed to sunlight and air, synthetic chemical fertilizers and 
insecticides last much longer. A case in point is DDT. The pesticide was used 
throughout the United States until it was banned in 1970. Now, nearly 25 years 
later, it continues to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "DDT is still showing up in ground water and soil samples in many agricultural 
regions," Atkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finally beginning to understand the total costs of our habits when it 
comes to chemicals," said Bill Roley, who is director of the Laguna Beach-based 
Permaculture Institute of Southern California, which is an educational 
nonprofit organization that deals with the relationship between water, waste 
and soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using chemical fertilizers does produce a lot quickly, but you don't feed the 
soil," Roley said. "If you add up the costs in terms of health and depletion of 
natural resources, chemical fertilizers aren't such a bargain."  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, many home gardeners have given up chemicals.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the second half of the 1980s we saw an organic gardening boom," Atkins 
said. He noted that Safer, which was started in 1981, was doing $10 million a 
year in business by 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 Big business has even started to grow produce organically in response to 
customer demands and because many chemicals are being restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California is a leader in the production of organic produce. 
</P>
<P>
 In north San Diego County, there are about 400 organic farms, the highest 
concentration in the state and probably the country, said Faustino Munoz, farm 
adviser for UC Cooperative Extension in the county. He regularly advises small 
farmers, many of whom choose the organic route for health reasons and because 
they are interested in long-term viability of their farms.  
</P>
<P>
 "I farm organically because I can't in good conscience cheat the Earth," said 
Jerry Weiss, owner of Rocky Peak Farms in Fallbrook, a farm and a retail store. 
"Studies show organic foods are three to four times higher in minerals than 
non-organically grown foods."  
</P>
<P>
 Prolonged use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides can eventually sterilize 
soil. There is also the danger of overfertilizing with chemicals, which quickly 
enter the plant's system and can burn roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic fertilizers work differently than chemical fertilizers. Organic ones 
usually require soil bacteria to break them down before they are taken up by 
plant roots, so plants are fed slowly over a long period of time, said Roger 
Aguinaga, owner of Aguinaga Fertilizer Inc. in Irvine, which provides organic 
fertilizers and soil amendments to homeowners and farmers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Organic fertilizers also don't become soluble and leach into ground water 
like their synthetic counterparts," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Margret Wagner of Orange is among gardeners who have embraced the organic 
concept. She has been gardening organically for five years at the Fullerton 
Arboretum, where she is chairwoman of the demonstration garden for the 
California Organic Gardening Club. She also has a private garden on the 
arboretum grounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "I garden organically because I feel it's important not to poison the soil 
with chemicals that have a long life," she said. "I also don't want to kill 
beneficial insects. And organic gardening is cheaper; I fertilize with compost, 
and mulching keeps watering down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To successfully garden organically, you must emulate nature, rather than fight 
it. If you've been using chemical methods, take heart. It's never too late to 
rebuild your soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic gardening is best understood through the principles of "integrated 
pest management," or IPM, which include selecting appropriate plants, using 
compost and not worrying about bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 This method was developed 30 years ago in California and Texas for the 
agricultural community, and although IPM doesn't forbid the use of chemical 
fertilizers and pesticides, most of its methods are organic. With IPM, only as 
a last resort are chemicals to be used, and then in controlled and limited 
amounts.  
</P>
<P>
 IPM involves a combination of strategies to keep pest populations at a 
tolerable level and plants healthy, said Lili Singer, a Los Angeles 
horticultural consultant, publisher of the Southern California Gardener and 
host of a weekly radio gardening program.  
</P>
<P>
 The first rule of IPM is proper plant selection, Singer said. "Get a plant 
that will be happy in our Mediterranean climate. Then take proper care of the 
plant so it remains strong against pests and disease."

 One vital aspect of plant health is the soil condition. "Plants grown in rich, 
organic soil are easy to spot," said Erik Katzmaier, a landscape architect with 
Katzmaier Newell Kehr in Corona del Mar. "Organically grown plants are deep 
green, lush and thick and have few pest problems."  
</P>
<P>
 A good organic soil is built with compost, said Katzmaier, who regularly uses 
homemade compost in his own garden. "An organic garden sustains itself just 
like nature. You compost all of your kitchen scraps (except meat products), 
grass clippings, leaves and branches and return them to your soil."  
</P>
<P>
 When you feed the soil with compost, you build the humisphere, said Roley of 
the Permaculture Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 "The humisphere is that crucial 12-inch layer of earth below your feet where 
90% of biological life is found," he said. "If you feed that layer with 
compost, you greatly reduce plant needs for fertilizer and pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding the soil with compost also does the important job of releasing helpful 
bacteria, which will keep in check harmful bacteria and soil-borne disease such 
as that caused by nematodes, said Aguinaga, whose company has a green waste 
recycling program. Every day it receives an average of 125 tons of plant 
materials from individuals and companies, which it uses to make compost.  
</P>
<P>
 "Compost also helps encourage drainage in clay soils, where plants suffer root 
disease because of excessive moisture, and compost bulks up fast-draining, 
sandy soil," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Another must of organic gardening is learning to live with a few bugs.  
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of eliminating all insects from the garden is ridiculous," said 
entomologist Atkins. "The truth is, people who use insecticides on a routine 
basis are destroying beneficial insects, of which there are many. There are no 
pests in nature. Everything has a purpose. Only about 10% of insects are true 
pests. The other 90% are beneficial insects that actually prey on pests and 
survive because of them."  
</P>
<P>
 Beneficial insects such as ladybug larvae may look frightening, but they are 
actually voracious eaters of harmful pests such as aphids. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it is true pests such as aphids and whiteflies that are resistant 
to pesticides. When you use chemicals, you knock out beneficial populations and 
can make a problem worse, Atkins said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know people get frustrated with pests, but they must discipline themselves 
not to run to the garden center for the strongest chemical and nuke 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is tolerance," Singer said. "Who cares if a tomato hornworm eats a 
couple of tomatoes? There's usually enough left for you and your neighbors."  
</P>
<P>
 If you do have an infestation of a certain pest, there are nontoxic ways to 
control them that won't annihilate beneficial populations.  
</P>
<P>
 Two completely benign yet deadly weapons everyone has at their disposal are 
fingers and water. Organic gardener Wagner thinks nothing of handpicking worms 
or large bugs from her plants. Soft-bodied aphids can also be easily squished 
between the fingers. A strong spray of water will dislodge many pests and may 
even kill aphids without harming larger beneficial insects.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, many biological controls have also been introduced, such as 
insects, bacteria, fungi, viruses and nematodes that are predators or parasites 
of plant pests. The most widely used of these, Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) is 
widely available. This causes caterpillars to stop eating and poisons their 
blood. It is not harmful to humans or most other insects.  
</P>
<P>
 Other biological controls include ladybugs and lacewings, which feast on 
aphids. Beneficial nematodes clean up harmful nematodes in the ground. There 
are also parasitic wasps, which burrow into the bodies of various pesky insects 
and lay eggs.  
</P>
<P>
 The ash whitefly that was devastating fruit trees a few years ago was killed 
off by a stingless wasp brought in from northern Europe, the whitefly's 
original home, Singer said. 
</P>
<P>
 When all else fails, some organic gardeners believe that the use of organic 
pesticides in limited amounts is warranted, as long as they are used with care. 
Organic pesticides are preferable to chemicals because they quickly break down 
when exposed to sun and air and leave no harmful residuals. They are, however, 
toxic during application, and some can be lethal to humans and wildlife.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important rule of organic gardening is patience. It takes 
time to build up soil and lure beneficial insects into your garden.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who have made the commitment to garden without chemicals say that each 
season the garden gets better and better.  
</P>
<P>
 "Organic growing builds the soil," Weiss said. "When the soil is healthy, so 
is the food you produce."

 In most homes, there is never quite enough closet space, and what space there 
is could probably stand to have its molecules rearranged. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the StorMate track furniture system by White Home Products Inc., 
designed to maximize storage space in existing closets. The cabinets and 
shelves move easily from side to side on tracks that are installed in front of 
rods and shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track system works just like those in a library or hospital file room, 
but we toned it down for residential use," said Pamela Jules of White Home 
Products, the Georgia-based company that specializes in the manufacture of the 
storage systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks fit any width closet and the multifunction melamine cabinets and 
shelves are tip-proof. The system (about $900 for custom tracks, in 15- or 
18-inch depths, two cabinets and four drawers) is also available without 
cabinetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option: the automated Closet Carousel, a state-of-the-art conveyor 
that works like the belts used by dry cleaners. The carousel (prices start at 
$1,450) eliminates the need for aisles in walk-in closets and uses all 
available space. 
</P>
<P>
 For the kitchen, White Home has recently introduced a custom pantry carousel. 
At the press of a button, shelves come to you at counter level, giving easy 
access to the contents, a boon to anyone with limited reach or in a wheelchair. 
It sells for $5,500.

 Dimmer switches are no longer simply setting the mood in the dining room: 
Lighting controls are moving into the bedroom, the garden, the kitchen and 
bathroom, too. They are being used to enhance architecture and furnishings as 
well as provide safety and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Using new technology, Pennsylvania-based Lutron has introduced three new 
switches for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ariadni features a toggle switch and a small sliding dimmer. Its controls 
have true three-way switching, so the switch never loses its ability to dim. 
The Diva features a sliding dimmer on a paddle switch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maestro is a multilocation dimmer that allows full-range dimming from up 
to 10 locations; indicator lights show preset levels and glow to act as a night 
light in the off position. The Maestro also has a fade feature, which allows 
for a three- or 10-second delay between when a light is switched off and it 
actually goes off. The feature allows time to exit a room (or reach the bed) 
before it goes dark. 
</P>
<P>
 All the switches have lightning surge protection and the solid-state dimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutron products are available in Orange County at electrical wholesalers, 
lighting showrooms and home decorating and remodeling centers. Knowledge in 
Store 
</P>
<P>
 Need help with your latest do-it-yourself home improvement project? You may be 
able to find it at the newest branch of the KCET Store of Knowledge, which 
opened this fall at Fashion Island in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Store of Knowledge has an extensive selection of videotapes, reference 
books and coffee table books on gardening and home improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the more popular books include Martha Stewart's 'Renovating With 
Style,' a handyman book by Reader's Digest and a series of videos on 
gardening," said assistant manager Tony Lavagnino. "We have a huge selection." 
</P>
<P>
 The KCET stores, created as an alternative way for the public television 
station to raise money, has several departments -- including home improvement, 
arts and crafts and gardening, and a holiday theme area.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; GENTLE CLEANER RIDS VINYL OF STAINS

 Q. We have white vinyl-strapped patio furniture that looked great until this 
past summer. A yellowish film has developed on them and nothing I've used has 
been able to remove it, except that I've had some luck using a nylon scrub pad 
and cleanser. Is there any other solution other than replacing the straps? 
</P>
<P>
 V.M. La Habra * 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a product that's recommended by most patio furniture manufacturers 
called Feron Clean, says Linda Snow of Yorba Linda Patio & Hearth. It's simply 
applied with a rag, and it removes most vinyl stains. Then you can apply a 
sealant to the straps to protect them. She advises against using an abrasive 
since you'll end up scratching the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinyl-strapped furniture is often subject to staining from the sun's 
ultraviolet rays when it's left unprotected all the time. Suntan lotion can 
also help deteriorate vinyl, which is why it's a good idea to keep your 
furniture clean. If you have good quality chairs made with what's called 
"virgin vinyl," and not vinyl that's clay-filled, they should be able to last 
and stand up to numerous cleanings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Since it's started getting cold at night, we've noticed that the windows in 
our bedrooms tend to fog up on the inside. I suspect it's a problem with the 
insulation. Any ideas on how to fix it? 
</P>
<P>
 C.N. Lake Forest * 
</P>
<P>
 A. If it's a double-glazed window, fogging is a sign of a broken seal, says 
Katy Jackson of Maley's Glass in Anaheim. If it's a single-glazed window, it 
usually means the glass isn't very tight in the frame. A double-glazed window 
generally has to be replaced once it loses its seal. With a single-glazed one, 
you can fix it by replacing the window or installing a glasscene panel. This is 
a soft clear plastic insert that creates a double-pane effect. Many people put 
these up just in the winter to help them save energy because they insulate so 
well. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. Our furnace works very well, except when we turn it on after it's been shut 
off for a month or more. The problem is that after the thermostat is clicked 
on, it takes an hour or more before the furnace runs. After it's been running 
for a day or so, it comes on immediately. Is this a sign of big trouble around 
the corner? 
</P>
<P>
 M.M. Santa Ana * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Today's furnaces are very complex, so it would be difficult to determine 
whether there is a problem in the thermostat or igniter without examining it, 
says Tom Houlihan of Orange County Appliance Parts in Garden Grove. One 
possibility is that spiders or other insects may be getting inside the passages 
during spring and summer, and their webs and nests might be blocking the gas. 
You may want to have a furnace technician or the gas company inspect your unit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We have a large fireplace made of slump stone that we've had a difficult 
time cleaning. We've used a variety of solutions, but it still looks dingy. Any 
idea on what can be used to brighten it up? 
</P>
<P>
 J.R.F. Garden Grove * 
</P>
<P>
 A. There are stone cleaners available at most fireplace shops that will work 
on slump stone, says George Moelter of Anaheim Patio & Fireside in Brea. Slump 
stone looks like an uneven flagstone. There are no easy ways to clean it. You 
have to use a stiff brush and lots of elbow grease to make a difference because 
you're probably dealing with a lot of old soot and dust. Look for a cleaner 
that will also work on your grout. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We'd like to move the oak wall paneling from our den and put it in one of 
our bedrooms. We realize that the job will hinge on how successful we are at 
taking the old nails out without damaging the paneling. Are there any tricks to 
this? 
</P>
<P>
 E.F. Laguna Hills * 
</P>
<P>
 A. With a good pair of needle-nose pliers, try to grip the nailheads as you 
push the paneling in and out, says carpenter Dave Willits of Santa Ana. Once 
you can get the head out just a little, use a pair of nippers and cut the head 
off. Once the heads that hold a piece of paneling have all been removed, you 
can pry it off the wall. You need to be careful if you're reusing the panels, 
but keep in mind that you'll probably need to make some repairs in the finish 
once it's been reinstalled.

MATERIALS; GLASS BLOCKS: CLEARLY VERSATILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glass-block walls, windows and other design features are being installed in 
more homes for reasons besides pure stylishness. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy care and reasonable cost stand out; but, perhaps more exciting, no other 
material so successfully transmits light while maintaining privacy, enhancing 
security and providing both thermal and acoustical insulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Building a simple glass-block partition wall or room divider is a good 
beginner's project. Except for certain kits, all glass-block installations 
require modest carpentry and bricklaying skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Block walls generally must be framed for support by a sturdy wooden beam, or 
header, across the top, a wood or concrete sill at the bottom and one or two 
vertical jambs along the sides. Consult the block manufacturer for details. 
Before attempting a large project, show your design to a building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass blocks come in two thicknesses -- 3 1/8-inch and 3 7/8-inch and several 
square, rectangular and other sizes with sides ranging from six to 12 inches in 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortar is used to bond most blocks (some kits use acrylic strips and silicone 
sealant instead). Plastic spacers are set in the mortar joints to maintain 
uniform gaps between blocks, and special metal is used to secure the blocks to 
the framework. Partition 
</P>
<P>
 To build a partition wall, start by joining the sill, jamb or jambs, and 
header to create the supporting framework. Next, arrange the first row, or 
course, of blocks and spacers on the sill without mortar to test the fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the course and the intended width of the mortar joint above it as a 
guide, mark the heights of the subsequent courses on the jambs. 
</P>
<P>
 To eliminate extra space, plan to install wooden filler strips against the 
inside of the framework. Then remove the blocks, brush the sill with a coat of 
asphalt emulsion sealer to protect it from the mortar and let it dry for at 
least two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 As a final preparation step, loosely tack fiberglass expansion strips (sold 
with block supplies) to the jambs and the header. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread a smooth bed of mortar onto the sill and install the first block at the 
corner using spacers between it and the jamb. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortar for glass block usually is mixed to a drier consistency than brick 
mortar and is colored white rather than gray, for better appearance. Tap the 
block into place with a rubber mallet, then fit spacers against it for the next 
block. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply mortar to the adjoining side of the next block and repeat the previous 
steps. Continue to the end of the first course; then check that the entire row 
of blocks is level and that all blocks are aligned. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread mortar on top of the first course and install the second course the 
same way. After the second course, embed a right-angled metal panel anchor in 
the mortar at each end of the wall. Slit and lift the expansion strips and 
fasten the anchors to the jambs; then re-secure the strips over the anchor. 
Attaching and Installing Anchors 
</P>
<P>
 Install anchors on top of every other course. After the next to last course, 
attach anchors to the header so they will extend vertically between every other 
block in the final course. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove visible parts of spacers and smooth the mortar between blocks as soon 
as pressing it gently leaves a thumb print. 
</P>
<P>
 Slide a bricklayer's striking tool along each joint, working from the bottom 
up. Promptly wipe cement haze with cloth and a dry, non-metallic abrasive pad. 
To finish the project, fill the gaps between the blocks and framework with 
caulking compound.

CEMENTING A BOND THAT STRENGTHENS WITH TIME

 Have you ever wondered why concrete gets so hard?  
</P>
<P>
 Concrete consists of portland cement mixed with sand and gravel or crushed 
stone. Portland cement cements the sand and gravel or crushed stone together. 
</P>
<P>
 The cement is made of calcium (usually finely ground limestone), silica 
(sand), aluminum, iron ore and small amounts of other materials (sometimes fly 
ash, for instance). These materials are quarried, crushed, ground and blended. 
Then they are fired in a kiln with an average temperature of about 2,700 
degrees -- hot enough to melt steel.  
</P>
<P>
 The material emerges from the kiln as marble-size pellets known as clinkers. 
These are ground into a fine powder, and this is bagged or delivered in bulk as 
portland cement. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of portland cement is that, to form a rocklike mass, all you do is 
mix it with sand, gravel or crushed stone and then add some water. The chemical 
properties of portland cement are such that it reacts with water in a process 
known as hydration. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how hydration works: Water and cement particles form a solution. To the 
naked eye, this solution appears as a paste that coats each grain of sand and 
each piece of gravel or stone. 
</P>
<P>
 If you could see the paste at a molecular level, you would notice that water 
molecules arrange themselves around each particle of cement (each particle is a 
fraction of a millimeter in diameter). 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, heat is generated as the molecules rub against each other and 
arrange themselves. Excess water molecules make their way to the slab surface 
and evaporate. Other water molecules are locked out of the hydration process by 
the bonds formed by the hydrating cement particles.  
</P>
<P>
 It takes decades for this water to escape, and this is why concrete gets 
harder as it gets older. The water that was involved in the hydration process 
remains behind indefinitely as a crystal known as water of hydration.  
</P>
<P>
 Under ideal circumstances, concrete takes its own sweet time arranging these 
cement-water-of-hydration particles. By the time the hydration process is 
essentially complete (it takes several weeks), you have a well-organized mass 
of sand and stone bonded in a matrix of cement-water-of-hydration particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this bonding takes place at a molecular level, it's extremely thorough 
and very strong. And, as a bonus, the concrete grows stronger with age.

MATERIALS; CONCRETE WAYS TO ACHIEVE ELEGANT FINISH IN MASONRY PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people see concrete without noticing it. To them it's ubiquitous and, 
worse yet, boring. They couldn't care less about its looks because it's not 
supposed to look good. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it's hard to believe that concrete can be elegant. Worked by skilled 
hands, it can be finished in a variety of patterns, colors and textures, even 
to the point of looking like something else, including flagstone, brick and 
slate. This versatility expands anyone's design options for that pool deck, 
patio or walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not use brick, stone or slate? Each of these is a fine material, but 
natural materials (and to a lesser extent, brick) dictate the color and shape 
you must work with, and not all options are available in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, concrete is generally less expensive than quarried materials, which 
often must be shipped over long distances. Decorative concrete is more 
expensive than regular concrete, and its cost varies greatly by location and 
even among contractors in the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing concrete to make it look like brick, slate or stone is not a typical 
do-it-yourself project. You would have to invest in the tools and finish quite 
a bit of experimental concrete before you pour the main pavement. It takes 
experience and the right tools to make concrete look like something it's not, 
so it makes more sense to hire a masonry contractor for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic process, however, is not complicated. Masons pour and place the 
concrete like they would regular concrete, using a 3,000-pound to 4,000-pound 
psi (pounds per square inch) mix, the typical concrete for outdoor pavements. 
At this point, there are several methods that cement masons use to shape the 
concrete to look like brick, stone or slate. In one method, they press strips 
of building paper or a paper stencil into the wet concrete using a float. For 
faux stone, the masons cut out strips of building paper. And for a brick 
pattern, they buy a ready-made paper stencil. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the masons spread colored granules over the concrete to give it the 
desired shade of brick or stone. They work the granules, known as dry-shake 
compound, into the concrete, with floats. Incidentally, dry-shake compound also 
increases the surface hardness of the concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of paper strips, the granules are carefully scraped off before the 
strips are lifted from the concrete. With paper lattice, the surface area is 
too large to do this, so the lattice is carefully peeled from the concrete 
after the dry-shake compound has been floated in. The area underneath the paper 
appears as mortar joints, while the area between the strips is colored to look 
like slate, stone or brick. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve the faux finish of dry-laid stone (without contrasting-color mortar 
joints), the masons use stamps, rollers and mats to press a shape into the 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 In one example, a sheet of polyethylene plastic is spread over the concrete. 
This prevents the concrete from sticking to the stamp or roller. It also gives 
nicely rounded edges to each stamped shape. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve faux mortar joints with this method, the masons spread mortar over 
the slab and scrape off the excess, so it fills in the joints between the 
stamped patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, they use a rotary floor polisher to remove mortar residue from the 
slab's face.

 Over the years Norman Rockwell has been warmly welcomed into the American 
home, first with his art on the covers of the Saturday Evening Post, then with 
the trinkets and wall calendars and framed illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's furniture. And fabrics, accessories, lamps, custom window 
treatments and area rugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional American and country-style pieces inspired by the beloved 
illustrator are in the Saturday Evening Post-Norman Rockwell Home Furnishings 
Collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection, available in late January, was introduced at the fall 
furniture market in High Point, N.C., to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
Rockwell's birth. His first Saturday Evening Post cover appeared when he was 
20. Thereafter, he contributed about 10 a year, plus illustrations for many 
other publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell died in 1978 at age 84, but he's plainly not forgotten. Last year, 
about 375,000 people visited the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 While Rockwell's images of Americana are well-known, they're based on people 
more than possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Except maybe for roll-top desks, you don't see a lot of furniture in 
Rockwell's paintings," Bill Cubberley says. Cubberley is marketing vice 
president for Stanley Furniture Co. of Stanleytown, Va., a major force behind 
the home furnishings designs. 
</P>
<P>
 So the company engaged in some creative thinking and came up with pieces it 
imagined people in the illustrations might have owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figured we needed to do furniture that the people in Rockwell's paintings 
could have had," Cubberley says. "We thought that they were probably from small 
towns in New England and lived in a Cape Cod house or a saltbox colonial." 
</P>
<P>
 The signature piece in the collection is a drop-front desk with prints of 
Rockwell's "Four Freedoms" illustrations. They first appeared in the Saturday 
Evening Post in 1943, and the originals toured the country to help boost sales 
of war bonds during World War II. The desk will sell for $3,750 in a limited 
edition of 2,500. The illustrations also are on a block of commemorative U.S. 
postage stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Other items in the collection include a wing chair done in a "Rosie the 
Riveter" motif on an American flag background and den furniture with a golf 
theme based on Rockwell's "Important Business" illustration. List prices range 
from $525 for a small occasional table to about $4,500 for a china cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies marketing Norman Rockwell home furnishings include Capel Inc. 
for area rugs, Carole Fabrics for custom bed and window coverings, Palacek for 
accessories, Ridgeway for clocks and Sedgefield by Adams for lamps. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 stores around the country made early commitments to carry the 
furniture, which is nostalgic yet conforms to today's taste for cherry and 
darker wood finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 The seating is bigger and cushier than so-called colonial pieces would have 
been and the proportions, sizes and units are updated. 
</P>
<P>
 The furniture reminds Norman Rockwell's son Peter "of the kind of furniture 
that I was brought up with: well-stuffed chairs and couches and good wood 
furniture from the 1930s and 1940s in traditional styles with a few fairly 
valuable antiques." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rockwell, a sculptor living in Rome, recalls his father as a "workaholic 
and a dedicated artist who was not above throwing a picture out in fury, and 
then two hours later getting it back. He never stopped working, but it never 
upset him to have us wandering in and out of the studio." 
</P>
<P>
 The life of the Rockwell family was a curious mix of small-town America, as 
depicted in the posters, and sophistication. After a start in New Rochelle, 
N.Y., they settled in New England, except for a few winters in Hollywood during 
the 1940s, where Rockwell worked for the film industry.

CONSTRUCTION; DETAILS THAT MAKE FOR PEOPLE-FRIENDLY HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Building a home that is friendly and convenient for people of all ages and 
different degrees of health may be one of the smartest investments you can make 
with your home-buying dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 One in every three Americans will develop special housing needs in his or her 
lifetime. Building the right features now will add little to your overall costs 
but can spare you many costly remodelings or an even more expensive move to a 
nursing home later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most beneficial details you should look for in an adaptable house 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lever handles on doors and faucets. Round knobs can be impossible to grasp 
or turn if you suffer from arthritis or an injured hand or wrist, if your arms 
are full or if you're just a tyke. Levers can be operated with little effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * Height-adjustable showers. These and adjustable soap dishes serve everybody 
well, from the wheelchair user to people who need to sit when bathing to that 
6-foot-10-inch family basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lower light switches. By placing switches, fuse boxes and thermostats at 48 
inches, you bring them within reach of wheelchair users and kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reinforced bath walls. Installed during framing, a simple 2-by-4 brace for a 
grab bar in your bath wall can save you from having to pay for installation 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate level changes. Sunken living rooms and other level changes can 
stop a wheelchair cold and can even cause a fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wide doors and halls. Doors should be a minimum of 34 inches, hallways 42 
inches. This not only gives you access for wheelchairs and walkers, but also 
makes moving furniture or any bulky object easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight-foot-high garage doors. Taller garage doors allow wheelchair vans to 
get in and out, and a wider garage also makes climbing in and out of the car 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single-story living. For some elderly people and many people with injuries, 
stairs can be impossible to negotiate. Your best option is to build a 
single-story home. If that's out of the question, build a house with everything 
you need on the entry level. 
</P>
<P>
 * High-density, low-pile carpets. These are less likely to trip you or to 
cause you to lose your balance with soft footing and much easier to roll a 
wheelchair across. 
</P>
<P>
 * Flat thresholds. By flattening the sill of a doorway, you eliminate a bump 
that can trip anyone and give wheelchair users trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raised work areas. Bending and stooping can be largely eliminated by keeping 
certain surfaces off the floor or higher than normal. Raised fireplace hearths 
and raised garden beds can save your back a lot of strain, as can 36-inch-high 
bathroom countertops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kitchens. For wheelchair mobility, keep aisles and work triangles extra 
wide. By lowering your cooking surface, you make lifting pots and pans easier 
for everyone. Side-by-side refrigerators with bins and pullout shelves offer 
the best accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baths. Leave room for wheelchair negotiation. A large walk-in shower with a 
flat threshold is convenient even if you don't use a wheelchair or walker.

WALLS; EMBOSSED PAPERS RAISE OPTIONS 
</P>

 It's not easy to please a paper hanger. "Like everyone else, I want my home to 
be unique," said Sally Combs, a professional wallpaper hanger. "But after 
putting so many patterns in other people's houses, I feel as though I've 
already seen it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Combs says she found the solution a couple of years ago when she discovered 
the high-relief charms of Lincrusta and Anaglypta, two paintable Victorian-era 
embossed wall coverings that are making a comeback on walls, ceilings and under 
chair rails. After using a border of Anaglypta on her bedroom ceiling and a 
dado of Lincrusta in her guest bathroom, Combs recommends the two wall 
coverings to all her clients -- and still never sees the same thing twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret is in the amazing range of decorative finishes that the two 
materials can take. Originally invented to mimic expensive molded plaster, the 
wall coverings can be painted a single color -- semigloss is best for bringing 
out the pattern and texture -- or can be glazed and burnished to resemble 
anything from tooled leather to pressed tin. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened with two of the most peculiar names in the wall covering world, 
Anaglypta (a combination of the Greek words for "raised" and "cameo") and 
Lincrusta ("lin" meaning flat and "crusta" meaning relief) take a little 
explaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Invented in 1877 to bring upper-class elegance to middle-class walls, 
Lincrusta is a compound of linseed oil and putty, similar to linoleum. Highly 
durable -- it was once used to decorate the outside of Pullman cars -- it can 
be embossed with a very high relief. Because of its weight (a double roll 
weighs more than 30 pounds) and relatively high cost, Lincrusta is used most 
often these days for borders and friezes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Lincrusta was invented as a low-cost alternative to expensive 
traditional materials, Anaglypta was developed in the 1880s as a low-cost 
alternative to Lincrusta. Both are produced by Crown Berger, an English 
company. Classic Anaglypta -- now known as Anaglypta SupaDurable -- is a 
heavyweight paper product that gets much of its strength from its high cotton 
rag content. Like Lincrusta, SupaDurable can be embossed in high relief. Less 
expensive than Lincrusta -- about $60 for a double roll as opposed to $180 for 
a double roll of Lincrusta -- SupaDurable is also lighter, which makes it easy 
to use on ceilings or as an all-over pattern on walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincrusta and Anaglypta are hung just as conventional wall coverings are; the 
only special tool needed is an extra measure of patience. "Because they're 
heavier, they take a little longer to cut, which can slow the process," said 
Whitney Lewis, whose Bentley Bros. company distributes Anaglypta and Lincrusta. 
</P>
<P>
 Once up, Anaglypta and Lincrusta can be expected to last for decades. "There 
are plenty of historic houses that still have their original Anaglypta and 
Lincrusta," Lewis said. "You can paint it over and over again and the embossing 
will not lose its sharpness." 
</P>
<P>
 Although still relatively unknown in the United States, both Lincrusta and 
Anaglypta have been in production in England since their invention. Hailed as 
"utopian wall coverings" in Victorian times for their decorative potential, 
they became prized in the more sober 20th Century for their ability to hide 
cracks and bulges in plaster walls. 
</P>
<P>
 First embraced by people who, like Lewis, were involved in period 
restorations, Lincrusta and Anaglypta are finding their way into a wide variety 
of settings. One surprise has been their popularity in the film industry -- the 
wall coverings have lent a touch of class to settings like Tom Cruise's office 
in "The Firm" and Kevin Costner's farmhouse in "Field of Dreams." Equally 
surprising, some architects have begun specifying the traditional wall 
coverings for their new construction. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trend that may well continue into the 21st Century. "I firmly believe 
that we've been staring at blank walls for too many years," said Joni Monnich, 
a San Francisco-area decorative painter who wrote a pamphlet on wall-covering 
finishes for Crown Berger. "Anaglypta and Lincrusta offer us a wonderful 
opportunity to bring ornament back into our lives."

 AIR WAR: United Airlines is generating passengers with its new, low-fare 
shuttle service that flies out of Burbank and 10 other Western cities. But is 
it generating profits? United won't say (D1). . . . And has it taken business 
away from Southwest, which has dominated Burbank traffic? Absolutely not, says 
Southwest's station manager John Thomas. "What they've done is actually 
stimulate the market," he says.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; THE SUPES IN FULL RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors quit the agency planning the future of 
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station with the justification that board members 
were heeding the voice of the people. But another way of viewing this week's 
action was that the supervisors threw up their hands when faced with a tough 
political problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Orange County voters supported ballot Measure A, mandating an 
airport at El Toro after the Marines leave. The vote was extremely close, 51.1% 
to 48.9%. One supervisor said that if a recount showed voters defeated the 
measure, the board would change its mind and stay on the El Toro Reuse Planning 
Authority. Otherwise, the resignation takes effect Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of reversing field, though remote, raises the question of why 
the board felt it necessary to act this week. Why not wait until all the votes 
were counted, and the result certified? 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors did not spell out the next step in the planning process, 
although county officials said several possibilities are being explored. One 
question is what happens to the nine-member authority in the absence of the 
supervisors. The remaining members are Irvine, with three seats, and Lake 
Forest, with one. Both cities are opposed to an airport at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Measure A represented bad planning, the supervisors did have to 
acknowledge electoral opinion -- though not necessarily by quitting the agency. 
They also must keep the planning process going, aware that the federal 
government does not consider the measure binding and has insisted all along 
that the feelings of neighboring communities be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 There are good arguments in favor of an airport at El Toro, but other options 
should be considered as well. Nor is there need for haste. The Marines plan to 
leave in 1999, and the Navy Department last summer raised the faint possibility 
the base might stay open if it proved too expensive to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also no justification for abandoning planning for all 
possibilities, and the county has the needed expertise in land use. Assuming 
the Marines do leave, the best use for El Toro still is an open question.

 If France, Germany, Italy and Mexico were to simultaneously decide that they

VENERABLE I. MAGNIN TO PASS INTO HISTORY; RETAILING: MACY CO. REJECTS OFFER BY 
GRANDSON OF FOUNDER. FASHION ISLAND STORE AND SEVEN OTHERS WILL CLOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE and DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R. H. Macy & Co. went ahead Friday with plans to discontinue its financially 
troubled I. Magnin retail operations, despite an offer by a grandson of the 
chain's founder to buy the 12 remaining Magnin stores. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Macy announced it will phase out the tradition-rich Magnin 
retailing name while converting four existing Magnin sites -- including the 
Woodland Hills store -- into different specialty stores. Liquidation sales were 
set for the Newport Beach store and seven other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co., which owns Fashion Island, declined comment Friday on what it 
would do after the 80,000-square-foot store closes early next year. "Obviously, 
they still control the space," spokeswoman Dawn McCormick said. "We'll have to 
wait and have further discussions about which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The action officially ended a bid by Beverly Hills retailer Jerry Magnin to 
buy all the Magnin stores. Magnin, who owns the Ralph Lauren Polo store on 
Rodeo Drive, said Friday he had offered Macy $40 million for the 12 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnin, grandson of Mary Ann Magnin, who founded the chain in San Francisco in 
1876, said he first inquired about purchasing the stores in 1991 and resumed 
that bid three months ago. Magnin wouldn't identify the source of financing for 
the offer because his last offer wasn't accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our offer was a fair one," Magnin said. "It is a naive assumption 
that liquidation will bring much more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, which also operates the Bullock's chain, declined comment on Magnin's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy said liquidation sales will commence Friday at the Magnin stores in 
Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Palos Verdes, Pasadena, San Diego, Carmel, 
Phoenix and at its San Francisco headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Magnin stores will be closed Monday through Wednesday to allow store 
personnel to prepare for the liquidation sales, which could continue until 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Macy will convert the Magnins in Woodland Hills, Palm Desert, Palo 
Alto and Walnut Creek into specialty men's or home stores within the Bullock's 
chain or into specialty Macy operations, such as Macy men's store. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy, which will maintain the I. Magnin catalogue sales operation, said it 
will continue to explore options for the other eight Magnin stores -- including 
the possibility of further conversions to Bullock's and Macy's specialty 
formats. 
</P>
<P>
 Word that Newport Beach's I. Magnin would likely close prompted shoppers and 
retail analysts to begin speculating about Fashion Island's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Zucht, a Newport Beach resident who has shopped I. Magnin since she was 
a child, suggested that Fashion Island try to snare a Bloomingdale's department 
store.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Zucht: "If I can't have my I. Magnin, I'll take a Bloomingdale's." 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Limburg, a retail broker in Newport Beach with CB Commercial, agreed: 
"This might be an opportunity for Fashion Island to get a high-fashion tenant 
like a Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irvine Co. wants to make that a cutting-edge mall, so they will hold out 
for a unique tenant," Limburg said. "You're not going to get a typical retailer 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomingdale's previously acknowledged that it is talking to both Fashion 
Island and South Coast Plaza about possible locations for an Orange County 
store. Some of South Coast's larger stores would likely oppose Bloomingdale's 
arrival at the Costa Mesa shopping center, Limburg said, "but Fashion Island 
tenants would welcome Bloomingdale's with open arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Retail observers also suggested that Fashion Island might do well to court 
Dillard, a Little Rock, Ark.-based retailer with more than 200 stores, or 
Barneys New York, a tony East Coast retailer that has stores in Costa Mesa and 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, the outdoor fountains at Fashion Island danced, Christmas 
music played and a chilly wind blew off of the ocean as shoppers digested news 
that the I. Magnin store would close.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing a member of your family," Zucht said. "I've been shopping 
(at) I. Magnin since I was 5 years old, and here I am 40, bringing my 
daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Mia Zucht, 11, who bought some bath soap for a friend, finds I. Magnin "a fun 
place to shop. I just like it because it has different things. You can buy the 
stuff at Robinsons-May at any place." 
</P>
<P>
 I. Magnin has been a "special store" for Leonard Lewkowict, a Montreal 
resident who visits the Newport Beach shop at least once a year during trips to 
Southern California. "They have everything here," Lewkowict said. "It's a very 
special store. The way (sales personnel) served us today after having learned 
(of the closing) is a testament to how special these people are." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources at the company have said it has explored the possibility of selling 
store sites to St. Louis-based May Department Stores and the Jackson, 
Mich.-based Jacobson Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Macy is in bankruptcy but is to emerge from bankruptcy protection when it 
merges with the Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores in late December. 
In a joint statement, Federated and Macy said I. Magnin operations will be 
phased out because it "is not expected to make a meaningful contribution to the 
combined company's bottom line." The Chain is Broken

 Brokers Disciplined: Two Anaheim securities brokers accused of breaking 
trading rules were disciplined and fined Friday by the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers, which enforces securities rules for the brokerage industry. 
Eddie Seung Chun was fined $120,000 and barred from the industry, the NASD 
said.In addition, Chun was ordered to reimburse his brokerage $448,351 based on 
findings that Chun, without the knowledge and consent of a customer, liquidated 
a customer's IRA account and ordered that a $311,275.62 check from that account 
be made paid to a firm under Chun's control, the NASD said. In addition, the 
NASD found that Chun allegedly cashed a customer's $50,000 check and kept the 
funds; and at his request, a customer issued a $37,076.16 check made payable to 
a firm under Chun's control for the purchase of an annuity, but Chun allegedly 
kept the funds. Another broker, George H. Gable, was fined $30,000 and barred 
from the industry without admitting or denying NASD findings that a customer 
placed three option orders that Gable said were executed but were not. The NASD 
also found that Gable prepared a false ledger reporting cash and margin 
balances that incorrectly represented a customer's account.

 $2.3-Million Loss: Wiz Technology Inc., a San Juan Capistrano computer 
software manufacturer, recorded a loss of $2.3 million, or 36 cents a share, 
for its fiscal year ended July 31.That contrasted with profit of $75,911, or 1 
cent a share, for the previous 12 months. Revenue declined 11% to $1.7 million 
from $1.9 million. The company said the loss was primarily related to a delay 
of several months in its 1993 underwriting, which resulted in extraordinary 
legal and accounting expenses and suspension of virtually all sales and 
shipments during the second and third fiscal quarters.

LABOR COALITION OPPOSES SUPER KMARTS; WORKPLACE: THE TWO NEW NON-UNION O.C. 
STORES HURT SMALL BUSINESSES, GROUP CONTENDS. 
</P>

<P>
 The opening of Super Kmart Centers in Anaheim and La Habra this week is 
drawing a negative response from a small group of local union members. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Kmart officials have said that the two stores, each about twice the size 
of a typical Kmart, are generating more than 1,500 jobs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Organizing Public Awareness Coalition, arguing that the megastores 
will squelch small businesses in the area, said Friday that it will boycott the 
stores and will urge other local residents to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Eiden, chairman of the coalition, said Friday that Kmart, a non-union 
chain of discount department stores, provides only 32% of its employees with 
benefits and pays salaries that are just barely above the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unionized grocery stores, by contrast, pay $15.15 an hour and provide health 
benefits, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have spent their lives supporting the union to maintain decent 
wages and a good standard of living," said Eiden, who is director of organizing 
for the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union. "Now they're replacing our 
good-paying jobs with substandard jobs. That's exploitative." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Woodhouse, director of the La Habra Super Kmart, said that isn't true. 
Though he would not reveal what his store's workers will be paid, he maintained 
that "our wages are competitive in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in La Habra have been touting the arrival of that city's Super Kmart 
for more than a year, describing it as the largest store in town. City Manager 
Lee Risner said the store has hired 250 full-time employees and 600 part-time 
workers. More than 70% of those new hires, he said, live in La Habra. In 
Anaheim, about 700 full- and part-time jobs will be created. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Orange County stores opened this week and have grand opening ceremonies 
scheduled for Sunday. The La Habra center has appeared to be doing a brisk 
business, Risner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Super Kmart officials project that the store will have annual sales of $70 
million, he said, and "that means a large addition to our tax base." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The union's sentiments echo those of groups across the nation that have sprung 
up to protest the opening of Wal-Mart stores. Fierce opposition against the 
Arkansas-based discounting giant has arisen, especially in small towns in the 
South and Midwest, where local merchants contend that they are being 
underpriced and driven out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Kmart concept was launched two years ago by Troy, Mich.-based Kmart 
Corp. in part to counter Wal-Mart's aggressive expansion. The company now has 
67 Super Kmarts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The stores, each about three times the size of a football field, include not 
only conventional department-store merchandise but also hair salons, automotive 
departments and full-service grocery markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition supporting the boycott includes members of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers Union, the United Auto Workers, the Asian Pacific American 
Labor Alliance and environmentalists against aggressive development, Eiden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group has sent out more than 100,000 flyers and bought newspaper and TV 
ads denouncing the megastore, he said.

INVESTORS BUY GRUBB & ELLIS RESIDENTIAL UNIT; HOUSING: NEW O.C. OWNERS WILL 
FOCUS ON LUXURY MARKET. NO LAYOFFS ARE PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Seeking to ride a rebound in upscale housing sales, an investor group headed 
by two Orange County businessmen said Friday that it has acquired the business 
of Grubb & Ellis/Better Homes and Gardens in Orange and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a real upturn in the luxury home market in the last 12 months 
and that prompted our move to purchase the company," said Dennis Gordon, former 
senior vice president and director of operations for Coldwell Banker in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said that he and Charles Neubauer, former manager of Coldwell Banker's 
Newport Beach office, are both investors in the purchasing group, called Newco 
Realty Corp. They will manage the Newport Beach-based company, he said, with 
Gordon serving as president and Neubauer as executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gordon nor Joe Hanauer, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based 
Grubb & Ellis, would disclose the purchase price of the transaction, which 
became effective Friday. The purchase included nine residential sales offices, 
six in Orange County and three in San Diego County, with 325 sales associates 
and 95 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County offices are located in Newport Beach, Laguna Beach, Dana 
Point, Irvine, Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer estimated that Grubb & Ellis's Southern California residential 
operation last year sold about 3,000 homes with a combined value of $900 
million. Hanauer said the residential offices will continue to operate under 
the name Grubb & Ellis as an independent licensee of Grubb & Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 A major attraction of the investment group's offer, Hanauer said, was a 
promise that the offices would continue to operate as a network and not be 
split off and sold to other brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are keeping all of the managers and support staff and all of the 
associates," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said that Grubb & Ellis residential sales in Southern California are 
strongest in the market for homes valued at $500,000 or more, which this year 
have made a faster comeback than less pricey real estate after a deep, 
three-year recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to continue to focus on the upper end market," Gordon said. "Our 
plan is to grow the company throughout Orange and San Diego counties through 
acquisition, merger and franchising," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said the new owners also will retain a franchise membership with Better 
Homes and Gardens which, among other things, has enhanced the relocation 
business at Grubb & Ellis offices in Southern California by linking them 
nationally with other brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California sale, Hanauer said, completes a two-year campaign by 
San Francisco-based Grubb & Ellis to divest all of its residential services in 
order to concentrate on its mainstay commercial and industrial business.

IMPROPER TMI MONEY SHIFTS CITED; INVESTING: COURT-APPOINTED MANAGER DESCRIBES A 
'DISTURBING PATTERN.' TMI OWNER CALLS REPORT A 'HATCHET JOB.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The owners of Teachers Management & Investment Corp. improperly transferred 
nearly $600,000 from one of the fund's three dozen partnerships, according to a 
report by the court-appointed manager for TMI's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis B. Schmucker said in his report, filed Thursday in Orange County 
Superior Court, that TMI "paid itself in apparent violation of the partnership 
agreement" for Parducci Winery Ltd. and that there was a "co-mingling of 
partnership funds" with other accounts. Schmucker, a veteran Southern 
California real estate trouble-shooter, also said he found a "disturbing 
pattern of apparent violations or distortion of the traditional transactions 
permitted under the terms of the partnership agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 That included evidence that an estimated $122,500 was diverted by TMI during 
the past three years as management fees in excess of the amounts disclosed to 
investors in partnership agreements, the report stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another $199,800 was taken to pay TMI staff salaries, also a violation of the 
partnership agreements, Schmucker said, citing an examination by the accounting 
firm Kenneth Leventhal & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI owner Maurice B. Shuman called the report a "hatchet job" and said he will 
dispute the findings at hearing set for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four investors filed a lawsuit in August alleging that TMI, based in Newport 
Beach, fraudulently lost $100 million of clients' funds. Most of the money in 
TMI's 38 real estate partnerships -- estimated to total nearly $1 billion -- 
was invested by California teachers for their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmucker was appointed by the court Oct. 6 to manage TMI's assets and examine 
the partnerships. He is to issue a full report to Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Francisco F. Firmat next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In this week's report, Schmucker also stated that an estimated $100,000 of 
investors' funds was transferred from various partnerships to pay some of TMI's 
legal fees stemming from the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the report stated, in recent years TMI owners "began to look for new 
ways to withdraw money from the partnerships and to look for novel ways to 
attempt to justify the withdrawal of those funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the winery's future is now in jeopardy, according to Kenneth 
Leventhal examiners, who found that TMI has operated Parducci in the red since 
1991, losing $2.8 million during the past three years. The company has not paid 
returns to investors since 1991, the accounting firm found.

COFFEEHOUSE CHAIN WON'T BUY DIEDRICH; RETAILING: ORANGE COUNTY COMPANY'S 
PRESIDENT CITES DIFFERENCE IN GROWTH PHILOSOPHIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Canada's largest chain of coffeehouses said Friday that it has called off its 
plan to acquire Orange County's Diedrich Coffee for as much as $6 million in 
cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Cup Ltd. in Toronto said it decided during a review process that "it 
would not be in the best interest of the Second Cup shareholders to proceed 
with the transaction at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Second Cup, which has been pushing an aggressive growth strategy in the United 
States, also fired Louis Basile as president and chief operating officer of its 
U.S. operation, Coffee Plantation in Phoenix, citing "differences regarding the 
company's U.S. direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed acquisition of Diedrich, announced Oct. 26, hinged partly on a 
review of growth strategies of Diedrich and Second Cup, said Steven Lupinacci, 
Diedrich's president. The review was important, he said, because the deal 
involved mainly stock, and the privately held, family-controlled Diedrich chain 
of coffee shops needed to know what kind of say it would have in the combined 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came to the conclusion that we did not have as common an idea of what we 
wanted to accomplish," Lupinacci said. "We looked at our company and culture. 
It's a family company that wants to grow slowly. It's a fragile structure. 
Second Cup wanted to grow faster than we did. When we talked about it, we 
decided we were not ready for a very accelerated growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Second Cup has big growth plans for Coffee Plantation, which would have moved 
its headquarters to Orange County after taking over Diedrich. The Canadian 
company said previously that it wanted the Diedrich-Coffee Plantation unit to 
open a dozen stores in California, Arizona and Texas by next June and at least 
20 more in the Southwest by mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich has 200 employees at eight locations in Orange County serving gourmet 
coffee. Second Cup, with 2,750 employees in all, operates 200 stores in Canada 
and, through Coffee Plantation, five in Arizona.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: VERTEQ WINS PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pennsylvania company infringed on three patents held by Verteq Inc., a 
privately held Santa Ana company, a U.S. District judge has ruled. Judge Gary 
Taylor in Santa Ana said Thursday that two of SubMicron Systems Corp.'s 
products violated the patents held by Verteq.Both companies make equipment used 
to sterilize "clean rooms" where computer chips are made. "We have invested 
significant money and effort developing Megasonic cleaning technology and our 
leadership position therein, and the very favorable decision on our behalf 
rewards us for our efforts," Keith Norby, chairman and chief executive of 
Verteq, said. Officials at SubMicron's Allentown, Pa., headquarters could not 
be reached for comment. Verteq filed a lawsuit against SubMicron in June, 1992, 
Norby said. Financial compensation to be awarded to Verteq will be determined 
in an upcoming trial, he said. With manufacturing operations in Santa Ana and 
Corvallis, Ore., Verteq employs about 290 people. It sells equipment to 
semiconductor manufacturers, including giant chip maker Intel Corp. and 
Motorola Inc.

 Notes Sold: Costa Mesa-based ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Friday that it sold 
$115 million worth of notes -- the equivalent of a corporate IOU -- and will 
use a substantial part of the proceeds to retire existing debts with higher 
interest rates. The notes issued Friday mature in 1999 and carry an 8.5% 
interest rate. Among other things, ICN now intends to retire $37 million worth 
of 12.875% notes, plus interest that would be due for the period from July 15 
through Dec. 19 of this year.

 Bridgford Stock Surge: Bridgford Foods Corp.'s common stock rose 16.7% to 
close at $10.50 a share in Friday's Nasdaq trading.Officials at the company, 
which produces convenience foods, said they knew of no particular reason for 
the stock surge. "The company has continued to do well, we cleared another 
fiscal year at the end of October, and while final results aren't available, 
we're sure we had our eighth consecutive record year," said Bob Schulze, chief 
financial officer of the Anaheim-based company. "And, earlier this week, we 
announced a three-cent extra cash dividend in addition to the regular 
dividend."

HOME INSPECTIONS KEEP EXPENSES DOWN; REAL ESTATE: ONLY ABOUT 40% OF HOMES SOLD 
NATIONALLY ARE CHECKED OUT. IF YOU DO HIRE AN INSPECTOR, BE SURE TO EVALUATE 
HIS CREDENTIALS BEFOREHAND. 
</P>

 That charm ing Victorian purchased with your life savings has a boiler that 
conks out in the dead of winter. The roof leaks. Repairs on the wrap-around 
porch don't hold up as well as the previous owners promised. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's impossible to catch everything that can go wrong, household 
calamities like these can often be avoided with a thorough inspection before 
the final sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But inspect the credentials of your inspector first; a shoddy examination can 
be worse than none. 
</P>
<P>
 A good inspector usually will charge around $250 and spend at least two hours 
examining the structural, electrical and mechanical elements of a home. Among 
the areas checked: the heating and cooling systems; roof and siding; walls, 
ceilings and floors; foundation; plumbing; and indoor appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector's report should note any defects, along with an estimate for the 
cost of repairs. The home buyer either can request the repairs be made before 
the sale, have the costs deducted from the selling price, or walk away from the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorcas Helfant, who runs Coldwell Banker-Helfant Realty in Virginia Beach, 
Va., said even though she's seen deals occasionally fall through because of a 
negative inspection report, her office routinely recommends all buyers have 
professional inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably going to be the biggest investment of their lives . . . 
(and) most people don't have the expertise to pick out defects in a house," 
said Helfant, a past president of the National Assn. of Realtors trade group in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, who wants to crawl under a house with all those creepy, crawly 
things?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many parts of the country, buying a home without a professional inspection 
is unthinkable. In fact, more sellers are also having inspections done after 
they advertise their property to avoid price haggling and to comply with state 
disclosure laws that make them liable for known defects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, inspections are conducted on only 40% of all the homes sold in this 
country, said the American Society of Home Inspectors in Arlington Heights, 
Ill. Most mortgage lenders don't routinely require them, relying instead on the 
appraisal and separate termite or water-testing reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Some inspectors report resistance among real estate agents in certain parts of 
the country, particularly in rural areas. 
</P>

 "A Realtor may see home inspections as another hurdle to jump over to make the 
sale," said Ron Passaro, owner of Res-I-Tech Inc. in Bethel, Conn., and a 
founding member of ASHI. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home inspection is still a relatively new profession; it didn't exist 25 yeas 
ago for the most part," he said. It "started basically in the Northeast, spread 
along the Eastern corridor, jumped to California and grew on the West Coast. In 
the last 10 years, it's filling in the heartland." 
</P>
<P>
 ASHI has been active these days promoting the largely unregulated industry, as 
well as denouncing so-called "fly-by-night" home-inspection schools, which it 
says offer students insufficient crash courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think all they need is a clipboard and a pencil and they're 
inspectors," said Passaro. "In every profession there are people who are 
straightforward . . . and then there are those who choose to operate on a 
sleazy basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Antt, who runs Jim Antt Realtor in Bakersfield, Calif., has seen the 
results of a sleazy inspection. He recalled one unsuspecting home buyer who had 
to pay another $1,000 just weeks after the closing to repair a problem roof the 
inspector failed to spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they known about the defect beforehand, they could have prevented some of 
the water damage that occurred, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roofer said a good inspector should have spotted it in a minute," Antt 
said. "We tried to call the home inspector and found they had gone out of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Passaro said that, in the absence of federal licensing requirements his group 
imposes its own set of guidelines that require, among other things, members to 
take at least 18 hours of additional home-inspection courses each year to keep 
abreast of environmental and other issues. ASHI also prohibits members from 
endorsing contractors for specific repair work or from doing the work 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 While certification by ASHI is a positive sign, home buyers should do some 
checking on their own before hiring an inspector. For example, they'll want to 
know how long the inspector has been in business, the extent of training and 
whether there's adequate insurance coverage. ("Errors and omissions" insurance 
policies cover inspector negligence; liability insurance protects the home 
buyer should the inspector damage something at the inspection site.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeowner should . . . also go down to the local town hall and check the 
local flood plan or talk to neighbors," said Kenneth T. Austin, chairman of 
HouseMaster of America Inc. in Bound Brook, N.J. "Some people will tell you 
everything. If it's a new development and the neighbors are angry at the 
builder, that's their way of getting even." 
</P>
<P>
 Home buyers must also be aware of regional differences. In certain parts of 
California, inspectors may urge home buyers to obtain geological studies of 
their neighborhood, while in Florida they may recommend examining a flood map. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing home buyers need to remember is that, regardless of an inspector's 
expertise, there's no such thing as 100% accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an art form. It's not an exacting science. It's based on a visual 
observation," Passaro said. "I can't tell you what's behind the walls or 
ceilings -- at least not now." 
</P>
<P>
 He said one person who applied for membership in ASHI claimed she could do 
that. "She said she was a psychic and could feel the vibes in a house. We 
politely turned her down."

POWER OF ATTORNEY IS EASILY ACCOMPLISHED AND CAN PREVENT HARDSHIP; FINANCES: 
ARRANGING FOR SOMEONE TO HANDLE YOUR AFFAIRS WHEN YOU'RE UNABLE TO DO SO IS A 
PRUDENT PROCEDURE. 
</P>

 Keeping track of personal finances prob ably is the least of O.J. Simpson's 
worries. 
</P>
<P>
 But it does raise the question of what happens to those who find themselves 
unable to manage their affairs due, for example, to a medical condition, aging, 
or in Simpson's case, incarceration on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution in most instances is to prearrange what's known as a power of 
attorney -- giving someone else the legal power to act on your behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a simple document to prepare . . . but it's a very important part of 
financial planning," said Denis Clifford, co-author of "Who Will Handle Your 
Finances If You Can't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you're married, no one else has authority to act on your behalf if you 
become incapacitated for whatever reason, be it jail, disease, or an accident," 
he said, noting that there are even limits to what spouses can do. 
</P>
<P>
 A power of attorney contract simply states who will pay bills, cash checks or 
invest your money and under what circumstances. You don't need court approval 
to have one, nor do you need to transfer title of assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract typically runs about two to four pages and can be quickly drawn 
up when a will or living trust are prepared, usually as part of a packaged 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Done separately the fee is usually less than $100. (For do-it-yourselfers: 
Clifford's book, published by Nolo Press in Berkeley, Calif., contains standard 
forms for each state. Forms also may be available in some office-supply 
stores.) 
</P>
<P>
 A power of attorney can prevent potential complications by assuring that 
someone trusted is handling your finances in a way you'd prefer, rather than a 
having a guardian or conservator appointed in a drawn-out, costly court 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen many horror stories," said Martin M. Shenkman, a Teaneck, N.J., 
attorney who advises clients to make provisions for a power of attorney when 
they make up their will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, "The Estate Planning Guide," he recalls what happened to a 
widower who never bothered to do that: 
</P>
<P>
 "He suffered an unexpected and severe heart attack and was hospitalized for an 
extended duration. . . . His nearest family could not access his savings, and 
they didn't have sufficient funds of their own to meet the expenses of 
maintaining his home and paying medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 At enormous legal expense, the widower's family was forced to seek a 
court-appointed guardian to get access to the widower's savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely signing a person's name to a check or document won't work, says 
Clifford, since forgery is illegal. "You may get away with it for awhile, but 
at some point someone might ask, 'What happened to Uncle Joe's money?"' 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy individuals often will give power of attorney to financial advisers or 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure Simpson already has someone who pays his bills and handles his 
investments given the size of his estate," said Shenkman. 
</P>
<P>
 The football Hall of Famer has pleaded innocent to charges he murdered his 
ex-wife and her male friend. He has remained jailed without bail since June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Incarceration doesn't necessarily prevent individuals from handling their 
financial affairs, though it can be difficult if their activities are greatly 
restricted or nearly impossible if assets are frozen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on what they're in jail for," said Benjamin T. White, an Atlanta 
lawyer specializing in estate planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure someone like Michael Milken would continue to have some type of 
ability to work from jail," he said, referring to junk bond pioneer Milken, who 
served time in a minimum-security prison in California for securities fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are different types of power of attorney contracts. A standard one can 
be drawn up to handle specific business only. For instance, a home buyer unable 
to attend a real estate closing may give power of attorney to a lawyer or a 
spouse; a couple taking a one-month trip around the world may transfer 
bill-paying authority to a son or daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 A durable power of attorney, on the other hand, remains effective until the 
death of the person who created it, even if that person becomes incapacitated. 
Clifford says many people opt for a "springing" durable power of attorney, 
which becomes effective only when they become disabled. In that case, a doctor 
would certify in writing that an individual is unable to handle his or her 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Special arrangements also should be made with financial institutions since 
many banks or brokerage houses require clients fill out their company forms as 
well, said White. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just take a power of attorney to a bank or a brokerage firm... you 
will find they they resist it vigorously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shenkman offers additional advice: Make financial records available to your 
designated guardian, known legally as the attorney-in-fact.

IT'S FEAR OF CRIME THAT PAYS FOR SECURITY FIRM; SERVICES: WACKENHUT CORP. 
PROFITS IN PICKING UP WHERE THE AUTHORITIES LEAVE OFF. IT MANAGES 12 PRISONS 
AND PATROLS DOWNTOWN STREETS AND INTERSTATE HIGHWAY REST STOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Crime and punishment are creating new opportunities for Wackenhut Corp., a 
private security firm that provides police and prison services once monopolized 
by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 After a British tourist was shot to death by robbers at a north Florida 
highway rest stop in the fall of 1993, Wackenhut won a $6.7-million contract to 
provide security at rest stops throughout Florida's 1,500-mile interstate 
highway system. 
</P>
<P>
 When fear of crime threatened to keep shoppers out of downtown Miami, 
merchants banded together to hire a squad of Wackenhut guards to patrol the 
area at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just aren't enough police to handle all the problems, so the answer is 
the private sector. It's expanding faster than I could possibly imagine," said 
Chairman George Wackenhut, who retired from the FBI in 1952 to found the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of a public outcry for more protection, the United States now has 
three private security guards for every public police officer, according to 
experts.  
</P>
<P>
 Crime means brisk business for Wackenhut. Wall Street analysts estimate the 
company's annual operating income will soar to 85 cents per share for 1994 from 
47 cents per share last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Wackenhut had operating income of $4.4 million on sales of $664.2 
million. The figures came before a $1.4 million charge, or 19 cents a share, 
from debt retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miami-based Wackenhut operates in 54 countries, providing security for 
everything from embassies and nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Its guards patrol on foot and in marked cars to keep robbers, vandals and 
assorted other miscreants at bay. Some guards are former members of elite U.S. 
military units such as the Army's Green Berets and Navy Seals. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the $664 million revenues for 1993 came from Wackenhut's U.S. 
unit, which operates prisons and supplies guards for business, neighborhoods 
and housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a relatively new area providing services that were almost a monopoly 
of public government. Now we have the private sector moving in, saying, 'We can 
do a better job more cheaply,"' said Frederick Shenkman, who teaches law 
enforcement at the University of Florida and is a consultant for police 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the private security boom is partly the result of unrealistic 
expectations by the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to see a cop on every stoop," Shenkman said. "The only way you 
can get that is if a neighborhood or a store owner can pay somebody to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has 2.4 police officers for every 1,000 people, but only 
about 60% are patrol officers, Shenkman said. "At any given time, there's maybe 
one cop available for every 5,000 or 6,000 people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released this week by the FBI show the rate of U.S. violent crime 
dropped by 3% from last year, the second year the rate has fallen. But the 
decreases have failed to offset the surge in overall crime since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wackenhut and its competitors are also banking on growth in managing prisons. 
The nation incarcerates roughly three times as many people as it did 30 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies, including one by the National Institute of Justice, suggest 
private companies can run those prisons for 10% to 20% less than governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wackenhut already manages 12 prisons in the United States and Australia and is 
under contract to manage five more under construction in Texas, Florida and 
Britain. It provides everything from guards and meals to drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the year is over we'll be the No. 1 private manager of public 
prisons," Wackenhut said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend toward privatization has generated controversy, particularly when it 
comes to private guards opening fire on a suspected criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Private security guards can make citizen's arrests, but generally have no 
police powers. However, those hired by public agencies operate in an official 
capacity and must do such things as read suspects their rights when arrested.

A $10-TRILLION LEGACY HAS FINANCIAL PLANNERS TALKING; INVESTMENT: FORTUNE 
AMASSED BY OLDER GENERATION SINCE WORLD WAR II WILL SOON PASS TO BABY BOOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When many of today's parents sit down to plan for their retirements and their 
children's college education, images of Grandma and Grandpa quickly come to 
their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whose estimate you use, that older generation has amassed a 
collective fortune of somewhere between $10 trillion and $12 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 And over the next few decades much of their money will be passed down through 
inheritances and gifts in what Institutional Investor magazine calls "the 
largest transfer of wealth in history." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject has just begun to come up for discussion among business and 
investment planners, government policy-makers and others concerned with both 
the opportunities and problems it may represent. 
</P>
<P>
 As it gets more attention, it seems sure to stir strong feelings in national 
and state political arenas as well as in the privacy of many households. It 
figures to play an important part, for instance, in any plans for the future of 
Social Security and quite possibly the whole tax system as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, it represents a huge potential market for financial services 
companies that sell stocks, bonds, insurance, annuities, mutual funds and other 
investment products. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether for good or ill, the Great $10-Trillion Legacy looms as a certainty, 
ordained by the nation's economic history since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 As today's seniors came out of the war years to form families and begin 
careers, they began buying houses that would in many cases rise dramatically in 
value through the 1960s, '70s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the economy enjoyed many booms and relatively few busts through 
those decades. In the midst of this prosperity, millions of people worked hard, 
saved assiduously and invested well. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that this generation is aging, it faces the eternal truth of "you can't 
take it with you." So financial analysts have begun to consider what might 
happen to this money as it is passed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Already they disagree. Institutional Investor says much of it will be saved 
and invested, rather than spent. By contrast, a recent poll of baby boomers 
conducted for the First Interstate Bank of California in Los Angeles says a 
majority will use it to pay off debts or earmark it for tuition bills. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it seems likely that many current members of the mid-30s to upper-40s 
generation don't know yet how much money they might have coming or what they 
will do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 500 baby boomers polled for First Interstate by Fleishman-Hillard Inc. 
of St. Louis, 14% reported having already received some type of inheritance 
from parents or an immediate family member other than a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 62% said they were "somewhat" to "extremely" likely to receive an 
inheritance in the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what they would do with a hypothetical $50,000 inheritance, 26% of the 
respondents said they would use it to pay off debts, and 25% said they would 
save it for children's college tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty percent reported they would save it for retirement, and 14% said they 
would use it to buy a home. A far smaller number -- 4% -- said they would spend 
it on personal items. 
</P>
<P>
 That last figure, at least, suggests what many financial experts regard as a 
healthy awareness among today's young to middle-aged adults that their 
financial preparedness for the future isn't as solid as it might be. 
</P>
<P>
 No less than 86% of the survey respondents said they felt, either "strongly" 
or "somewhat," that their generation isn't saving enough for retirement.

MAXWELL HOUSE CUTS WHOLESALE COFFEE PRICES; CONSUMERS: DECISION REFLECTS 
VOLATILE MARKET. GROUND VARIETY TO DROP 10 CENTS A POUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maxwell House Coffee Co. said Friday it has cut wholesale prices on its ground 
and instant coffees to reflect declining prices for unprocessed coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The price cuts marked a continuation of the unusual volatility since summer in 
prices that coffee makers are charging on their sales to grocers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House has now changed its wholesale prices seven times since late 
June, when damaging weather in Brazil threatened its huge coffee crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House, based in White Plains, N.Y., said it was cutting wholesale 
prices by 10 cents a pound on its ground coffees and 2.5 cents an ounce on 
selected instant coffees. 
</P>
<P>
 The wholesale price of a 13-ounce can of Maxwell House regular ground coffee 
is now $3.06, while an eight-ounce jar of Maxwell House instant coffee goes for 
$4.28. Those prices are what Maxwell House charges grocers and differ from 
prices available to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House was the second-best-selling coffee brand in the United States 
last year behind Folger's from Procter & Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest reductions erased part of the increases Maxwell House announced in 
early September when it raised ground coffee prices by 20 cents a pound and by 
2.5 cents an ounce for instant coffees. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, it cut prices in two steps in August after raising them in three 
steps from June 29 through the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell House had been charging $2.39 for a 13-ounce can of its flagship 
ground coffee before a June frost in Brazil sent coffee bean prices soaring on 
world commodity markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest price cuts affect most of Maxwell House's coffee brands including 
Yuban, Sanka and Brim but exclude its specialty coffees like Cappio.

ENTREPRENEUR'S GOOD SCENTS BROUGHT HIM THE SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS; 
AROMATHERAPY: RIVALS LAUGHED AT HIS IDEAS ON THERAPEUTIC VALUES OF AROMAS. NOW 
THEY COPY HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Horst Rechelbacher didn't realize he was planting the seeds of an aromatic 
empire when 20-odd years ago he whipped up his first batch of homemade clove 
shampoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Noses wrinkled over the pungent, murky concoction intended for his small chain 
of hair salons. But that didn't stop the Austrian expatriate from preaching the 
gospel of aromatherapy -- the belief that essences of plants and flowers have 
therapeutic benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 52, Horst (as he prefers to be called) is basking in the sweet smell of 
success. The founder and chairman of Aveda Corp. oversees a 400-employee 
dominion credited with popularizing aromatherapy in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the privately owned company won't release sales figures, it does say 
it has enjoyed strong double-digit growth annually for the past 15 years. In 
1990, one report had it doing an estimated $200 million in retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Horst was ahead of his time, definitely," says John Steele, a 
California aromatherapist who has done consulting for Aveda. "That's one of the 
reasons his company has done so well. He had the sense of smelling the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aveda is an interesting mix of old-fashioned capitalism and conscientious 
naturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 25,000 salons, spas and flagship stores called "esthetiques" carry 
its products ranging from shampoos and cosmetics to "purefumes" and sunscreen. 
A spa in Osceola, Wis., for example, delivers flower-essence massage and 
hydrotherapy, among other indulgences using Aveda products. 
</P>
<P>
 Horst's interest in the natural began early. His mother was a herbalist, 
someone who grows or uses herbs. A visit he made to India in the 1960s inspired 
his decision to make pure products out of herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aveda, derived from a Sanskrit phrase meaning "the wisdom of nature," has 
found devotees among the famous: Elizabeth Taylor and Goldie Hawn have worn its 
basil-based lipsticks, and Princess Diana has reportedly dabbled in 
aromatherapy to curb her nail-biting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the renewed belief in the power of scent has created its own problems for 
Horst, who recently dumped aromatherapy in favor of what he calls a more 
distinguishing term: "aromaology." 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to survive in business," he says. "I saw myself become diluted and 
polluted by companies that didn't care about what I cared about in 
manufacturing. They just wanted to make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 Horst is the first to admit that aromatherapy has been around long before he 
helped popularize it. Many ancient cultures, including the Egyptians, the 
Aztecs and Chinese, documented the use of essential oils to treat physical 
disorders.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the three Wise Men's gifts to a celebrated baby included frankincense 
and myrrh, said to calm the nervous system and evoke inner strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Aromatherapy revolves around absolute essences -- plant's molecular gases. A 
distillation and evaporation process breaks the plant down into liquid form. It 
takes 4.5 million jasmine petals to create just 450 grams, or nearly a pound, 
of its essential oil. 
</P>
<P>
 In Aveda's fragrant aroma lab, Ko-Ichi Siozawa dips a testing stick into a 
vial of frankincense. The stuff is tart, clean-smelling. 
</P>
<P>
 Siozawa, Aveda's chief perfumer with more than 25 years of experience, works 
with essential oils that come from all over the world: roses from Bulgaria, oak 
moss from the former Yugoslavia, myrrh from Somalia, pimento from Jamaica, to 
name just a few. 
</P>
<P>
 Working at Aveda is different than working for a more mainstream perfumer. 
"Virtually all of the formula of a regular perfumer consists of chemicals. I 
have to forget all that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although science has yet to document medical benefits from aromatherapy, 
studies have shown that scents do alter moods. A study at Rensselaer 
Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., found pleasant fragrance can improve one's 
demeanor. Scientists at the University of Cincinnati determined that volunteers 
who inhaled peppermint scents while working on computer tasks made fewer errors 
than those in an unscented control group. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Costanzo, a neurologist at Virginia Commonwealth University in 
Richmond, says a strong link between emotions and smell isn't surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a powerful sense and deals more with emotions and feelings," Costanzo 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 So why is the sense of smell undergoing a renaissance? 
</P>
<P>
 "Smell was neglected before. It was the sense that was used for seduction, 
allure, power," said Steele, an archeologist until he discovered plant 
essences. "The aromatherapy movement is based on healing rather than image, 
balance and restoration of the body's innate capabilities. . . . Using 
fragrance to alter moods, not just to make an impression on somebody else."

THEATER REVIEW; 'TWELFTH NIGHT' TAKES A RIDE INTO THE WILD WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If a director, such as Orange Coast College's Alex Golson,decides to update or 
conceptualize a Shakespearean play, it's a good idea to have an obvious link 
between text and concept. 
</P>
<P>
 As minor as it is, one of Golson's links in his Gold Rush staging of "Twelfth 
Night" at the Robert B. Moore Theatre turns out to be very funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Festus on "Gunsmoke"? Of course, he has become, in this rumbustious 
production, Olivia's madcap clown Feste. Matt Nevis, who plays the role with 
the Festus costume and only a slight hint of Ken Curtis' delivery, also wrote 
original music for the Shakespearean lyrics, plays and sings them with the 
proper twang, and sets the tone for the rest of the production. He's a charmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the production works. Some of it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19th-Century California ambience, for one thing, is not consistent 
throughout. Peter J. Balgoyen's giddy, mini-Colonel Blimp of a Sir Andrew 
Aguecheek is pure 17th Century in costume and tone, which gives an odd balance 
with Tony A. Swagler's boisterous mountain man of a Toby Belch, who is swathed 
in fur snatches and roistering good humor. Even so, they're a very funny Laurel 
and Hardy act. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Nevis, Swagler and Balgoyen, some of the cast have an easy time 
paying attention to the Bard's meter while speaking either television Western 
standard American, which also fits. Bronwen D. Bitetti, when disguised as the 
male Cesario (for most of the play), really shines -- a little brash, with a 
little swagger and light sense of machismo. As the bright Viola, however, 
Bitetti is pretty ordinary. Diana Brooks' Olivia is less effective in her 
delivery, but her general performance as a landed lady of Spanish wealth has 
fire and a good general shape. 
</P>
<P>
 As Orsino, a sort of town boss or range honcho, Damon Warren Hill fills out 
the basics of the part very well but doesn't add much on top of that. The 
opposite is true of Troy M. Johnson's starchy Malvolio, a sort of 19th-Century 
prig with delusions of the grandeur that was the Wilde West. Outside of a 
tendency to shout most of his lines, Johnson is a notable Malvolio, 
particularly yellow-stockinged and gartered in a sort of froufrou torero suit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy McBride's volatile and energetic Maria, the bawdy servant to Olivia, who 
helps disgrace Malvolio, is one of the really solid performances here, along 
with Steven El Ray Parker's heartfelt Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
 The staging suffers most in its supporting roles, with, among others, a rather 
pale Sebastian by P. J. Agnew, and Michael L. Nottingham's slightly overdone 
Fabian. 
</P>
<P>
 Golson's concept is an amusing one and guided well according to the abilities 
of his company, and it looks very attractive in David Scaglione's boom-town 
setting and Brenda Wyatt's vivacious costumes. Dialogue coach Tangie Velie, 
however, might have woven the accents into a smoother piece of fabric. 
</P>
<P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JACKSON STAYS CLEAR OF DEEP END AT THE POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the music industry gave awards for niceness, country singer Alan Jackson 
would have a bushelbasket full. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, that's right. They do -- and he does. 
</P>
<P>
 You really couldn't ask for a more congenial, from-head-to-toe likable star 
than this long, tall Georgian. For close to 90 minutes Thursday at The Pond, 
Jackson oozed gawrsh-ma'am sincerity and Gary Cooper-like decency. 
</P>
<P>
 Those qualities, with a strong measure of all-American good looks to boot, are 
every bit as important to Jackson's remarkable commercial success as his 
singing or his songwriting, which are, at best, modestly above average. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, friendliness, sincerity and physical attractiveness are at 
a premium in country music today -- more important, it can be argued, than 
talent alone. Hence Jackson keeps raking in the industry's top awards even 
though there are far better singers, more dynamic performers and more 
consistently insightful songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 What he does as effectively as anyone in the game right now is play to his 
strengths and minimize his weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 19 songs -- virtually the same set list he performed here almost 
exactly one year ago -- Jackson steered his expert Strayhorns band smoothly 
around any and all pockets of turbulence. It's a great quality in an airline 
pilot, less desirable in a country singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Such emotional evenhandedness provides a comforting consistency but doesn't 
allow for the joyous highs or melancholy lows the best country singers hit. An 
exuberant exception was "What Kind of Man?" a traditional bluegrass-gospel 
roof-raiser that came mid-show. But then, in gospel music, spirit of delivery 
is more crucial than vocal power or gymnastics, and Jackson truly seemed to 
come alive on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 He left it to his band to provide the rest of the show's musical sparks: 
guitarist Danny Groah, fiddler Monty Parkey and, especially, steel guitarist 
Robbie Flint often evinced the heartache that their boss merely described. 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, Jackson connects two or three times per album -- not an 
impressive average, but often enough to keep alive the hope that he'll come up 
with a truly special album one day. If everything he wrote was as revealing as 
"Tonight I Climbed the Wall," a 1992 study in pride swallowing, Jackson would 
be more deserving of those songwriter trophies he keeps accumulating. 
</P>
<P>
 But singing and songwriting -- once upon a time the alpha and omega of country 
music -- were just two of many components, and often not even the two most 
important, of Jackson's multimedia production. Make that Production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Video was the dominant element in at least half the songs. Footage from his 
music videos -- Alan skiing, Alan four-wheeling, Alan pining -- was interwoven 
on the plentiful video screens with live shots of Jackson and his band members. 
In some cases, videos were shown virtually uninterrupted. If he didn't seem so 
genuinely unassuming, you'd get the idea he had a big ego. 
</P>
<P>
 By relying so heavily on electronic visuals, Jackson telegraphed a lack of 
confidence in his ability as a singer to conjure images, situations or 
emotions. Perhaps in his case, it's justified. While his voice is as pleasant 
as a glass of warm milk, it's also every bit as mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the crowd erupted with some of its biggest cheers not in response to 
a skillful vocal turn or a particularly meaningful lyric, but at the derring-do 
stunts Jackson was performing on screen. So much for the virtues of 
in-the-moment live performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opener Faith Hill let loose with more vocal power than on her thoroughly 
unremarkable debut album "Take Me As I Am." She even managed a couple of gutsy 
growls and leaps into falsetto range during her 45-minute set. 
</P>
<P>
 But her voice has little inherent character, and the 27-year-old Mississippian 
with the fashion-model face and figure did little with it except belt, belt, 
belt. Then again, she wasn't helped by a muddy, booming sound mix that left 
Hill and her band sounding as if they were swirling around at the bottom of a 
cement mixer.

MUSIC REVIEW; OLD 'FAVORITES' AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra is increasingly returning to its roots in 
18th-Century repertory, a decision that seemed to please the large audience 
present for the concert on Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a return as well to the days when the guest director of the present 
occasion, Iona Brown, was a shining light of Neville Marriner's Academy of St. 
Martin-in-the-Fields, when it specialized in the kind of music Marriner would 
eventually bring to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the feel of those less hectic, less scholarship-dominated days, too, 
in Thursday's comfortable, often noble performances, as distinct from the 
hectic, short-breathed, gotta-dance rhythmic blowouts in which some period 
bands specialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The LACO program, in which Brown shared solo duties with the orchestra's 
ever-alert concertmaster, Ralph Morrison, comprised "favorites" we hardly ever 
hear in concert: music by Handel, Corelli, Vivaldi and J.S. Bach that the 
traveling antiquarians rarely program, in the belief that we've had our fill of 
them, when, in fact, the Baroque movements of decades past largely bypassed 
Southern California. (The program will be repeated Sunday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre.) 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by Patricia Mabee's busy, at-times soloistic harpsichord continuo 
(another throwback), the 15-member string ensemble delivered with consistent 
suavity and exemplary balances, slimming its tone appropriately for the 
propulsive demands of Corelli's Concerto Grosso in D, Opus 6, No. 4, its first 
Adagio lavishly decorated by violinist Brown, and the A-minor Concerto (No. 8) 
from Vivaldi's "L'Estro Armonico," in which Brown and Morrison were at once 
well-matched and neatly differentiated solo presences. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynamic fussing gave an inappropriately Romantic, even bathetic feel to the 
slow movement of Bach's Concerto for Two Violins, and the slower portions of 
Handel's Concerto Grosso in A, Opus 6, No. 11, might have been more compact and 
angular as well. In the main, however, the concert showed what satisfying 
results a Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra with reduced forces (and ambitions) can 
achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra plays Handel's Sonata for Two Violins in G 
minor and the Concerto Grosso, Corelli's Concerto Grosso, Vivaldi's Concerto 
for Two Violins in A minor and Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D minor on 
Sunday at 3 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. $17 
to $45. Sponsored by the Orange County Philharmonic Society. (714) 854-4646.

SANTA ANA'S MAYOR-ELECT KEEPS JUGGLING; POLITICS: MIGUEL A. PULIDO JR. IS BOTH 
ADMIRED AND CRITICIZED FOR WOOING A WIDE SPECTRUM OF VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel A. Pulido Jr. starts this day in the well-worn offices of his family's 
muffler shop, slipping easily from English to Spanish to French as he studies 
the absentee vote count, ducks under a car to diagnose a faulty converter and 
takes a call from a Vietnamese supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman and mayor-elect then dashes to City Hall for a briefing on 
pending projects, pays his respects at a viewing for deceased Latino community 
attorney Wallace Davis, and rushes to Costa Mesa's swank Center Club for a 
gathering of the newly formed Latin American Voters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he takes his seat on the council dais for an evening forum on 
community policing on this recent day, he is 30 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido, 38, has earned both respect and criticism for his ambitious effort to 
juggle engagements and his diplomatic knack for wooing a wide range of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 When he is sworn in later this month as Santa Ana's first Latino mayor, the 
Mexican-born Pulido may face the greatest challenge of all -- finding a way to 
unite and satisfy a city of extremes that includes the conservative Anglo 
residents who have long held considerable voting clout and the vocal Latino 
community activists who have eyed his politicking with growing adisdain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who criticize him for not being a single-issue elected 
official," said outgoing Mayor Daniel H. Young. "The fact of the matter is he's 
the mayor. . . . Let me tell you from a guy who has eight years on the beat, 
Santa Ana is one of the toughest cities to represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have every nationality, every income group, every political persuasion, 
all of whom are struggling to get to the forefront. You have to be a supremely 
talented listener. You have to be someone who has a genuine interest in all 
points of view, or you just flat won't succeed. That's where I think Miguel has 
the right talents." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido, a handsome yet shy former engineer and tennis player, was elected to 
the City Council in 1986 after his family successfully fought the city's 
attempts to raze their business, the Ace Muffler shop on 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, he was a little-known activist who tenaciously battled Santa Ana's 
powers-that-be. Since then, he has emerged as an accomplished politician, adept 
at working state and federal government officials to pull in millions of 
dollars in grants for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pulido's agility in sporting different hats when addressing different 
audiences has alienated him from some Latino community leaders, who say he 
shapes his opinions to what constituents want to hear, often shows up late or 
not at all to community events, and hasn't shown enough sensitivity to the 
city's low-income immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say you're going to be there, you have to follow through," said Rueben 
Martinez, a downtown barber and bookseller who supported Pulido strongly in his 
early years but has become disenchanted with the mayor-elect. "That's where you 
get your credibility and integrity built. Through the years, he's gained some 
and he's lost some. He's always sitting on the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the recent election, Pulido came under fire from some Latino 
community activists for sending out a final-hour mailer to Anglo voters that 
stated he opposed Proposition 187 because it "does not go far enough" in 
cracking down on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week earlier, he had publicly stated that he was opposed to the 
measure, but cited different reasons, namely that Prop. 187 would deny children 
access to education and health care. Those sentiments were absent from the 
mailer, which instead focused on the threats that some "illegal aliens" pose to 
public safety and on Pulido's efforts to clear the city of the homeless and 
limit the number of people who can live in a residence -- key concerns to many 
Santa Ana voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awful piece. Of course it hurt him," Martinez said. "It did not 
show any passion, and no sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor-elect, however, said his position on the controversial initiative 
remained consistent, and that he sent out the mailer to stress his opposition 
to illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido points out that his own family immigrated legally from Mexico. He says 
he is proud of his cultural heritage and fluency in three languages, and he 
enjoys strumming his guitar as his father sings traditional Mexican ballads 
that his grandfather wrote and passed down. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino community, he says, is as diverse as the Anglo community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel the connection some people assume I feel. I don't think any one 
voice can speak on behalf of all Hispanics," Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido was born in Mexico City to Miguel Armando Pulido, an engineer, and 
Maria Soledad Pulido, whose French ancestry piqued the younger Miguel's 
interest in the language before she died when he was 19. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, now 68, immigrated to California legally in 1960 for a Van Nuys 
factory job that never materialized. Instead, his father worked in the 
Placentia cornfields, fixing transmissions on his own time until he earned 
enough to bring his wife and four children to join him in the semi-abandoned 
farmhouse they called home. 
</P>
<P>
 When the young Miguel was bused to Commonwealth Elementary School in Fullerton 
for kindergarten at age 5, he spoke no English and was the only Latino boy in 
his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "On my first day of school, my mother made me two pieces of paper to carry 
with me," Pulido said. "The one in my right pocket said, 'My name is Miguel 
Pulido and I live at 801 S. Placentia Drive.' The one in my left pocket said, 
'I have to go to the bathroom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido used both slips that day, he said, and took his first steps toward the 
assimilation that he prides himself on. By sixth grade, he was class president, 
assuring fellow students that he would do his best, but warning that he 
couldn't promise A's or free soda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in a very Anglo environment, and because of that I'm very 
comfortable in diverse environments," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido went on to Ladera Vista Junior High and Troy High School, both in 
Fullerton, and to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pulido quit his job as a solar engineer in 1984 and emerged onto the 
political stage as a devoted son fighting to save his family's business, he 
grabbed attention for his intelligence and measured eloquence. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Al Amezcua, who is now putting together a committee of community 
leaders to serve as the mayor's "eyes and ears," remembers meeting Pulido at 
the muffler shop when he brought his old Honda there for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after, Pulido called Amezcua for advice in mounting a challenge to the 
city's plan to raze Ace Muffler for a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him really for the first time taking a very strong position on 
what he believed in, and doing things the smart way, not screaming, not 
yelling, but making presentations stating his positions in a very calm, a very 
sound way," Amezcua said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amezcua said that while Pulido is not "a flag raiser for the Mexican 
community," he has shown great talent in working with "every segment of the 
community," from staunch Republicans to Democrats, from Korean business owners 
to Vietnamese senior citizens and wealthy Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he's the man of our times," Amezcua said. "This city needs someone 
who is able to pull everyone in, and almost be at the pulpit to ensure that all 
voices, and all perspectives, and everybody's position is taken into 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 When two youths were killed in a drive-by shooting near Amezcua's uncle's 
house several years ago, Amezcua took a personal interest in pushing for the 
city to address the gang problem. He called Pulido, who met him at a Taco Bell 
near the muffler shop -- a hangout Pulido jokingly refers to as his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of that meeting eventually came Pulido's anti-gang plan, which includes 
the city's Project PRIDE, a youth employment program, and an effort to build 
more community centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido also has worked with Councilman Robert L. Richardson to try to curtail 
residential overcrowding, and has lobbied to lure a new federal courthouse to 
Santa Ana, along with a host of other federal grants. Pulido also spearheaded 
an effort to get Santa Ana designated as a "federal enterprise community," 
which would ensure tax breaks for business and eligibility for more social 
service grants. (The city's application is still under review in Washington.) 
And although he came onto the council fighting City Hall, Pulido quickly 
distanced himself from the acrimonious battles that then plagued the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first several months on the council I did nothing but listen and listen 
and listen to see what was occurring," Pulido said. "I think some people 
weren't happy with that because they wanted me to grandstand. But that's not 
what I was about." 
</P>
<P>
 His attentiveness has won him praise from some of the city's neighborhood 
associations, organizations made up predominantly of homeowners in the city's 
better-kept neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has always been concerned about neighborhood integrity and about the 
people who live in the neighborhoods," said Lorri Schmitt-Tudor, president of 
the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn. "I have never had the feeling that he 
was dividing people up in terms of ethnicity. He has a genuine concern. He's a 
very caring man. He wouldn't be doing what he is doing for all of us if he 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 But his critics offer a different portrayal, saying that while Pulido may have 
an open ear for some people in town, he has not been as receptive to 
lower-income residents, many of them non-voting immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy likes to go to Washington, D.C., instead of going into the barrios 
," Martinez said. "He goes into the nice neighborhoods in town, but we're human 
beings too. He's going to have to clean it up, and if he does, I'll be there 
for him, because we need to be united. Can he do it? We need to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have harsher criticisms. When Pulido offered differing statements on 
Proposition 187, some Latino community activists charged the behavior was all 
too typical of the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he lacks the integrity and the character and the commitment and the 
political will to lead a diverse community," said John Palacio, of the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "Pulido, in my judgment, 
exemplifies a career politician who will say or do anything to remain in 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacio and others said they are already wary of Pulido after he sent out a 
similar final-hour election mailer in 1986 calling illegal immigrants a "public 
nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 "The support that he had in the Latino community was very soft, but we heard 
he was going to be a new Pulido, a new leader," Palacio said. "What we really 
saw was vintage Pulido, a man who will sell his community out for political 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticisms illustrate one thing, said outgoing Mayor Young: that governing 
a city of extremes is a delicate business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he faces some extremely difficult challenges to make everyone 
comfortable," Young said, "but I think he's up to the task." Profile: Miguel A.

PANEL PROPOSES ALTERNATIVES TO CAR POOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Backing away from its pioneering and strict ride-sharing rule, the board of 
Southern California's air quality agency voted Friday in favor of a more 
flexible strategy to make it cheaper and easier for employers to reduce auto 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agency formally adopts the set of proposed alternatives, employers by 
next summer could begin replacing or supplementing their ride-sharing programs 
with several options, such as installing sensors in their parking lots to 
identify which vehicles are the worst polluters.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the past seven years, the South Coast Air Quality Management District's 
stringent car-pooling rule has become a model for smog-choked cities across the 
country, but it has been a bane to local employers who have spent hundreds of 
millions of dollars trying, with mixed results, to change employees' commuting 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Marvin Braude, a Los Angeles city councilman, characterized the 
existing rideshare rule Friday as "expensive, cumbersome and ineffective." 
</P>
<P>
 The air quality agency's new direction, however, could face legal opposition 
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency because the concept behind the 
Southern California ride-share mandate was included in the 1990 Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 While the ride-sharing mandate tries to get cars off the road by altering 
commuters' behavior, the proposed alternatives focus more on making cars run 
cleaner. Although reduced emissions are the ultimate aim of the Clean Air Act, 
the EPA told the air quality district in a recent letter that its alternate 
plan will not pass muster unless more attention is paid to decreasing car trips 
and miles traveled. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed AQMD alternatives were drawn up by a task force of 85 business 
and community leaders from Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternatives include charging employers a lump sum based on the number of 
drivers who are employed and using the money to finance research into the 
development of emission-free vehicles, setting up buyback programs for firms to 
acquire and scrap heavily polluting vehicles, and imposing parking fees on solo 
drivers and using the proceeds to reward employees who car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Hewitt, the Orange County lawyer who headed the alternatives task force, 
said he disagreeswith the EPA's interpretation of the Clean Air Act and that he 
thought the air district should adopt the alternatives despite the EPA's 
cautionary letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My preferred approach is to go ahead with it and let people sue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The air quality district, along with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, is also looking into a pricing strategy that would attempt to 
influence driving habits by imposing a tax on motorists based on annual miles 
driven. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry W. Wedaa, the air district's chairman, insisted that the agency is not 
weakening its commitment to clean air but rather "putting a lot of different 
options on the table so that companies don't have to do just one thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted in 1987, the air district's ride-sharing rule covers 5,200 work sites 
in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside Counties. The purpose of 
the rule is to increase average rush-hour ridership to 1.5 passengers per car. 
So far, the average number has risen to 1.31 passengers, from 1.13 seven years 
ago. According to the air quality district, of the 1.273-million employees 
covered by the rule, 370,000 share rides to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule requires firms with more than 100 employees to establish detailed 
programs that encourage car-pooling, mass transit use and other ways of getting 
to work. In order to comply, companies have subsidized train and bus tickets 
for workers, formed van pools and offered free parking to people who don't 
drive alone. The average cost per employee ranges from $40 to $105, according 
to the air district. Altogether, it is estimated that employers pay $160 
million each year to comply with the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the air district's staff contends that progress has been made under 
the rule, they say the alternatives are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the agency's executive officer, James Lents, disagreed with 
the contention of some on the board that the ride-sharing rule amounted to a 
failed experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is one of the few places in the nation where (ride-sharing) has 
been going up," Lents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial alternative advanced Friday is the proposal for 
sensors to sniff out polluting cars in parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists as well as the EPA said the strategy is unacceptable in part 
because nothing in the proposal would compel the owner of an offending vehicle 
to do anything about the problem.

GAZA POLICE FIRE ON MILITANTS; 12 DEAD IN CLASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Palestinian police Friday opened fire on Palestinian demonstrators for the 
first time, killing at least 11, wounding more than 120 and fueling fears that 
PLO chief Yasser Arafat's confrontation with Islamic militants could trigger 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palestinian police officer was also killed as the new force and Islamic 
militants first clashed outside a mosque, then engaged in street battles that 
lasted even after police vainly imposed a curfew in parts of the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry followers of the militant Islamic Jihad and Hamas movements poured into 
hospitals where the wounded were taken. They denounced Arafat, who is chairman 
of the Palestine Liberation Organization and head of the Palestinian 
self-governing authority, as a traitor and a stooge of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Militants torched Gaza's single movie theater and overran and burned an 
Israeli checkpoint near the isolated settlement of Netzarim. They gathered 
outside police headquarters and clashed with officers there as truckloads of 
suspected militants who had been detained by police pulled into the compound. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza City, as women wept in the stairwells and hospital rooms of Shifa 
Hospital, the sound of gunfire could be heard in the streets outside. Hundreds 
of men milled around the hospital compound. Some prayed, others wept. 
</P>
<P>
 Across from the hospital, a mosque broadcast the names of the dead, who were 
given the title "martyr" -- one previously reserved for Palestinians who died 
fighting Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the city, grim-faced, bearded men gathered at the homes of 
families who had lost a member in clashes with police. Hasty burials, lit only 
by the light of the full moon, were under way by 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't expect this to happen between Palestinians," said a man who refused 
to give his name. He was hovering anxiously over the bed of his nephew, 
13-year-old Mahmoud Sakr Biltaggi, at Shifa Hospital. The boy was shot in the 
abdomen during the clash that erupted at Gaza City's Palestine Mosque after 
noon prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father, the uncle said, is an activist with Islamic Jihad who was 
arrested a week ago by the Palestinian police, after a suicide bomber and 
member of Islamic Jihad blew himself up at the same Israeli checkpoint that was 
overrun Friday. In the earlier attack, the bomber, Hisham Hamad, killed three 
Israeli soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel responded to Hamad's attack by pressuring Arafat to crack down on 
Islamic Jihad and Hamas. The two organizations have carried out a string of 
bloody attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers and have vowed to torpedo 
Arafat's peace accord with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and other Israeli officials have 
repeatedly warned Arafat that he must either face down Islamic militants or 
risk the collapse of the peace process. Since arriving in Gaza in July, Arafat 
has ordered the arrest of dozens of Islamic activists after each attack on 
Israelis. But those arrested have usually been released without charge within a 
few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Arafat avoided using force against the militants. Advisers 
warned him that any use of force against Hamas in Gaza, where the organization 
is a strong, well-organized political and social force with a wide following, 
would alienate a majority of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hamas' increasingly bold challenges to his authority appear to have pushed 
Arafat into Friday's confrontation. After Islamic Jihad and Hamas militants 
staged a massive rally Nov. 11 in the heart of Gaza City, chanting slogans 
against Arafat and Israel, Justice Minister Freih abu Medeen warned that they 
had "crossed a red line." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent clash started after noon prayers Friday at the Palestine 
Mosque, where about 6,000 worshipers had gathered to observe the Muslim 
Sabbath. The white mosque is Gaza's largest, and a Hamas stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Militants interviewed at Shifa Hospital said worshipers were incited by the 
presence of about 200 armed, shielded police. The police reportedly surrounded 
a crowd of about 1,000 worshipers who had begun praying in the street when they 
couldn't squeeze inside the packed mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman said that the officers took up positions around the mosque 
only after police headquarters received information that Hamas and the smaller 
Islamic Jihad group planned a violent demonstration after prayers. The police 
said they started shooting only after militants started marching toward the 
home of the suicide bomber and began throwing stones at the police. 
</P>
<P>
 The police said that they warned the demonstrators to stop, then fired in the 
air before shooting at any worshipers. But witnesses disputed that account. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the intifada (Palestinian uprising), the Israeli soldiers would first 
fire tear gas, and then fire rubber bullets and only then shoot live 
ammunition," said Mahmoud, a worshiper who returned to the Palestine Mosque for 
evening prayers. "They never shot at us without a direct order to shoot, and 
then they only shot a few bullets. But these Palestinian police started 
shooting immediately, and they shot everywhere." Mahmoud declined to give his 
last name. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Friday evening, Brig. Gen. Gazi Jibali, the Gaza police 
chief, said worshipers were incited to riot by militants and "opened fire 
suddenly at some of our forces and burned two vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the police officer who was killed during the riot that 
erupted was hit by a stone or a bullet. Several other officers reportedly were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were praying, and at the last minute of the prayers, we heard shooting 
outside," said one worshiper, a 23-year-old who identified himself only as 
Mohammad. "The police were ready for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad said he was standing with his closest friend, Hazzam Dalou, when the 
shooting began. Dalou, 23, was fatally shot in the chest, Mohammad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clothes are still soaked in his blood," he said. "I carried his body to 
the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could say Friday night how many were injured in the initial clash, and 
how many were hurt in the street battles that followed. Police reportedly 
opened fire on the demonstrators who gathered outside the central jail, and 
again at police headquarters. Police and demonstrators also reportedly clashed 
outside Shifa Hospital, where militants ambushed a police van carrying wounded 
police officers, stoning the officers and setting fire to the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "We warn these groups of thugs against attempts to harm the public safety," 
Jibali said in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Police threw up checkpoints along many Gaza City roads, and armed plainclothes 
officers and uniformed police were out in force. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday evening, Israel Radio reported that disturbances had spread to 
Rafah in southern Gaza. Militants reportedly set fire to a cinema there. By 10 
p.m., there was still no statement from Arafat. But his Fatah faction issued a 
statement accusing Hamas and Islamic Jihad of being involved in "conspiratorial 
plans . . . on behalf of foreign parties." The statement added: "We cannot make 
concessions or be lenient with regard to their insistence on harming national 
unity." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat met late into the night with representatives from all PLO factions, 
including those opposed to the autonomy deal with Israel, to discuss the 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hamas leader, Salah Safade, appealed for calm during a rally at a Gaza City 
mosque Friday night. "We don't want a massacre here to continue," Safade said.

RUSSIA SUSPENDS ADOPTIONS BY FOREIGNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia will suspend adoptions by foreign citizens starting Dec. 1 for an 
indefinite period to resolve allegations of baby-selling and other abuses, 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of swindlers representing private companies and agencies 
who are scouring Russia in search of children. Who knows what they are doing 
here?" asked Alexander N. Fedoseyev, head of the department of the Russian 
Education Ministry that supervises adoptions. "The process has acquired a 
really unregulated and uncontrolled nature in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Fedoseyev and other officials said adoption will be suspended for a 
"stock-taking" to set up a tracking system for Russia's estimated 100,000 
orphans and make sure Russian law is applied. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will be a blow to about 1,000 American families who have submitted 
applications to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in hopes of finding children to 
adopt here. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has become an 
adoption mecca -- now more popular even than South Korea -- and Americans adopt 
more Russian children than do any other foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last 12 months, Americans have adopted 1,779 children from the 
former Soviet Union, a U.S. Embassy official said. Between eight and 20 new 
applications arrive every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The embassy will be writing to those would-be parents to warn that those who 
do not receive permission to adopt by Dec. 1 should not waste time traveling to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they expect the ban to last at least several months, 
possibly much longer. Paperwork already submitted to the Moscow embassy will be 
kept on file in hopes the moratorium proves temporary. The State Department 
also released a telephone number for U.S. citizens seeking more information 
about the status of Russian adoptions: (202) 647-3445, during regular office 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine has also suspended foreign adoptions, although it is expected to enact 
a new adoption law and lift its moratorium within several months. Belarus 
lifted its adoption ban in January, the U.S. Embassy official said, adding, 
however: "I haven't seen a single child from Belarus since then, maybe one." 
</P>
<P>
 However, adoptions from other former Soviet republics may still be possible. 
Last year, Americans adopted "a handful" of children from Kazakhstan, 
Uzbekistan and Georgia, according to the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 What worries U.S. officials more than the Russian adoption moratorium is a 
bill now making its way through Parliament that would outlaw adoption brokers 
-- even nonprofit agencies -- and impose Draconian penalties on anyone 
attempting to profit from adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the draft law now in the Duma, or lower house of Parliament, no 
commissions or other payment would be allowed during adoptions, including fees 
for documents. Anyone convicted of the illegal export of minors abroad could 
face up to 15 years' imprisonment and confiscation of all property. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, adoption would be all but impossible for most Americans without 
an agency to help arrange travel to Russia, an escort for the trek from 
orphanage to orphanage, translation services and the myriad documents and 
procedures required for a legal Russian adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Though outlawing agencies would probably eliminate any profiteering, the U.S. 
official warned that "it would make it very difficult for foreigners to find a 
child." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law would give Russian families first priority in adopting children. 
Children who have not been adopted by Russians after six months (three months 
if the child is younger than 3) would then be eligible for adoption by 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Current Russian policy is that adoption by foreigners is permitted only when 
deemed in the best medical interests of the child. In principle, this means 
that only children with health problems -- or "undesirables," such as children 
of alcoholics -- are available to foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the policy seemed to be easing, in practice, as Russia's economic and 
social troubles have swelled the population of children in underfunded 
orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Russian children's advocates and orphanage officials are anxious to see 
children settled with any family -- even a foreign one -- that can provide them 
a good home. However, officials are also frequently accused of falsifying 
medical certificates to facilitate "export" of healthy children, allegedly in 
exchange for bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new draft law makes no mention of the child's health. It would thus make 
it possible for foreigners to adopt a healthy child once the waiting period 
ends.  
</P>
<P>
 Permission from the local authorities in the child's hometown would still be 
required, and a court could overrule any adoption it believed was not in the 
best interest of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite news reports that black-market adoption agencies are flourishing in 
Russia along with legal ones, charging foreigners up to $20,000 for a young, 
white child, Fedoseyev said he was not aware of any cases of baby-selling or 
any other abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, media and the Russian prosecutor's office were concerned that 
Education Ministry officials "were sort of selling kids abroad for mercenary 
motives, and were highly interested in preserving chaos in the sphere of 
adoptions," Fedoseyev said. "We have to sort things out within our own agency. 
Then, I am sure, the situation will improve and adoptions will be resumed."

COLUMN ONE; DUELING PROPHETS OF NEXT L.A.; MIKE DAVIS SEES MURKY DECAY, WHILE 
KEVIN STARR EMBRACES SHINY OPTIMISM. THIS ODD COUPLE OF HISTORIANS IS HELPING 
TO SHAPE THE DEBATE OVER THE PAST -- AND FUTURE -- OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

<P>
 If the world has come to see Los Angeles as either hell or heaven -- as a 
"Blade Runnerish" swamp of crime, race wars and economic devastation or a 
dynamic, multicultural cosmopolis -- two of the people most responsible are 
historians Mike Davis and Kevin Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 Gangs, toxic waste, racial strife and a Neanderthal middle class fill Davis' 
"City of Quartz," a jeremiad on 20th-Century Los Angeles history that depicts 
the city as the ultimate gladiatorial arena of Darwinian capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange blossoms, red-tile bungalows and Pasadena literati abound in Starr's 
"Material Dreams," a history of Los Angeles in the 1920s that celebrates the 
entrepreneurial, Progressive foundations of this "Great Gatsby of American 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
 When the two books came out in 1990, Davis groupies scorned Starr's boosterism 
as unfashionably chipper. Many Starr fans dismissed Davis as a left-wing 
lunatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the 1992 riots, and both authors were transformed into media stars. 
Now, as they work the talk show circuit, fill the Op-Ed pages, guide European 
documentary makers around town and teach a new generation of urban planners, 
these very public men of letters are helping to define not only how Los Angeles 
will be remembered, but what it will become. 
</P>
<P>
 Marxist and Catholic, thin and fat, rebel and defender of civilization, the 
48-year-old Davis and the 54-year-old Starr are the odd couple of the booming 
industry of explaining L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that there's been anybody else as important to shaping 
intellectual perceptions of Los Angeles," said Warren Olney, host of the 
influential radio show "Which Way L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, they will refuel debate with new books: a local history of the 
Great Depression by Starr, and a chronicle of recent riots, quakes and fires by 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 If Davis expresses the despair of the working class, while Starr captures its 
hopes, it is because they know them firsthand. Starr's poor city childhood in 
San Francisco seems straight out of Dickens, while Davis' youth in what he 
calls an "Okie suburb" of San Diego could have been invented by Steinbeck. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr envisions the ideal Los Angeles as a city dotted with high-rise 
apartments and bustling with street life, unified by great public edifices near 
its center. Davis imagines a place not too different from East L.A. at its 
best: working people hanging out on the front porches of their bungalows, 
enjoying the local library branch and the corner mural. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' writing focuses on the victims of capitalism. He chronicles the 
destruction of working-class Los Angeles with the closing of the great auto and 
tire plants south of Downtown, and traces the roots of current gang warfare to 
the lack of decent paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember sitting around in '67, '68," Davis said, "trying to figure out: 
well, were you gonna be an auto worker, a longshoreman or a trucker? You just 
sat down and decided. Look, I could end the gang problem in L.A. in five 
minutes. Just give me 50,000 good jobs that existed here in L.A. in the '60s."  
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Starr mines the history of Los Angeles for nuggets of hope. He 
reminds readers that violence-torn Venice was once a Utopian village of canals 
and concert halls, and that Los Angeles in living memory enjoyed a first-rate 
public transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Los Angeles," said the ever-ebullient Starr. "You banish violent crime 
from L.A. and you almost have Utopia." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men agree that a sprawling morality tale is being played out here, one 
with consequences for America and the world. For all their differences, Davis 
and Starr have one agenda in common: the defense of public space and the civic 
life it represents in a metropolis that is increasingly walling itself off into 
gated communities and fortress-like patios. Their shared passions for mundane 
and precious public places such as parks and libraries make the men friendlier 
toward each other than one might imagine -- as do their working-class 
upbringings. Childhood Contrasts 
</P>
<P>
 Starr grew up in San Francisco as what today would be called an "at-risk 
youth." It was the city and its churches that saved him, he says. He considers 
his life a testament to the power of cities -- so often seen as corrupters of 
the young but really great ethical classrooms, and networks of religious, civic 
and educational institutions linked by public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 His Irish American family had lived in San Francisco for generations. His 
grandfather was a firefighter in the Great Fire of 1906. His father was a union 
machinist. 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy struck early. His parents separated when he was 3; his mother had a 
nervous breakdown, his father was disabled by a brain tumor. Starr and his 
brother spent much of their childhood in a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, the kind of institutional anchor Starr finds so crucial to a civil 
society, was where the troubled child developed his dedication to social 
orderliness and a love of teaching. "He was such a good boy," said Sister 
Mauritia Bleiker, now 94. "He helped me take care of the littler boys." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 11, Starr and his brother moved back in with their mother. They 
lived on welfare in the Potrero Hill housing project where O.J. Simpson grew 
up. Starr hated the projects, but from the top of Potrero Hill he could see 
downtown San Francisco shining in the distance -- "like Oz," an image he would 
later apply to Los Angeles. He spent his time roaming the city, exploring the 
libraries and museums, running a paper route in Union Square, and drinking in 
the beauty of churches. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the architecture of Davis' youth consisted of scattered rural 
shacks, suburban tract housing and back-yard chicken coops. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents hitchhiked to San Diego from Ohio during the Depression. They came 
with nothing and within a year had a little house on an acre of avocados. 
"Nobody ever loved Southern California more than my dad did," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born during his parents' stint in Fontana, birthplace of the Hells Angels, he 
moved with his family to Seattle, where his parents ran a hot-dog stand on Skid 
Row. The business failed, instilling the roots of Davis' skepticism of "the 
mythology of messianic entrepreneurialism" -- the widely held belief that 
mom-and-pop business creation is the cure for L.A.'s woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communities hollowed out by the loss of automobile and aircraft plants," 
Davis writes, "will not be re-industrialized by more nail parlors, barbecue 
chicken franchises or greeting card shops."  
</P>
<P>
 From Seattle, the Davises moved back to San Diego County, to Bostonia, a dusty 
hamlet next to El Cajon. Davis' father, a meat cutter, was a good-natured man. 
Davis seems to have picked up more of his Irish mother's feistiness. When he 
writes of Mayor Richard Riordan as "a 63-year-old Irish American robber baron 
with GOP monogrammed on his Jockey shorts," Davis admits he may be showing his 
mother's prejudices against "lace curtain" Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 (To Starr, the mayor is merely familiar and benign: "Riordan looks like a 
thousand other freckle-faced guys in rumpled suits at the 40th reunion of a 
Jesuit high school.")  
</P>
<P>
 Most of Davis' friends -- "sons and daughters of the 'Grapes of Wrath' " -- 
knew as teen-agers what the rest of their lives would look like: They would be 
truckers or meat cutters or hairdressers. Davis was into drag-racing, stealing 
cars and being vaguely angry and aimless -- "pretty much your average redneck 
16-year-old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no surprise that the Utopia with which he opens up "City of Quartz" is 
the quirky, short-lived LLano del Rio commune in the Antelope Valley: socialism 
with drag strips. Even today, Davis is drawn to inland Southern California and 
the West: Vernon and Cudahy, Fontana and Ontario, Las Vegas and Butte, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Starr is essentially an urban, coastal Californian. His Los 
Angeles faces the ocean -- a great trading power that willed its port out of a 
swamp and touts itself as "capital of the Pacific Rim."  
</P>
<P>
 To see California clearly, both men had to leave. In the 1960s they headed in 
wildly different directions, members of profoundly different generations even 
though close in age. "We were total products of the late '40s, early '50s," 
said John Stein, a lawyer and Starr's classmate at the Catholic University of 
San Francisco, from which they graduated in 1962. "We bought everything they 
told us." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr married a doctor's daughter who attended the genteel Catholic women's 
college next door. He spent two years in the Army in Germany, then headed to 
Harvard University for graduate studies in English and American literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, meanwhile, was going through the rites of passage of a teen-age 
radical. 
</P>
<P>
 At 16, while working as a meat cutter, he quit high school to support his 
family when his father was temporarily disabled by a heart attack. His fate 
might have been set. But then his cousin, who had married a black man, invited 
Davis to a civil rights demonstration in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 For "a lost, you know, confused, teen-ager . . . coming out of the boondocks 
of eastern San Diego County . . . (the civil rights movement) was an incredibly 
beautiful, stirring thing to be involved in," Davis said. It made him feel 
connected to a larger world. By 1964, he was on a Greyhound bus for New York, 
headquarters of Students for a Democratic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 While Starr was tutoring students in a Harvard office he decorated with an 
American flag and a portrait of radical-buster S.I. Hayakawa, Davis was filling 
a 100-page FBI record, spraying anti-war graffiti on USC frat houses, traveling 
from Oakland to Texas as an organizer for SDS, and getting married for the 
first of four times. 
</P>
<P>
 While Starr was writing the dissertation that became his acclaimed book 
"Americans and the California Dream," Davis was running the Communist Party 
bookstore in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, Davis drove trucks across the country. As he delivered tons of 
Barbies working for a toy wholesaler in Los Angeles, he amassed an intimate 
knowledge of industrial Los Angeles that serves him well on his now-famous 
tours, in which he drives busloads of urban planners up the bed of the Los 
Angeles River and treats European social theorists to the scenic route through 
Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis spent the 1970s and '80s in and out of college and graduate school on 
union scholarships at UCLA and in exile in Belfast and London, where he was an 
editor for the New Left Review and for Verso, a leftist book publisher. He 
penned "Prisoners of the American Dream," a unionist, anti-Reagan polemic, 
dense as a Marxist poundcake. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Starr had left academia for a life as a peripatetic public 
intellectual. He churned out columns for the San Francisco Examiner. He was 
city librarian of San Francisco and executive director of the San Francisco 
Taxicab Assn. He taught college and worked in public relations. He ran 
unsuccessfully for San Francisco County supervisor and wrote a massive novel. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the elite circles in San Francisco he had admired as a boy -- the 
all-male Bohemian Club and the Olympic Club, whose cathedral-like swimming pool 
he had first encountered in an eighth-grade swim meet. He was much in demand as 
a dinner party guest, a rollicking storyteller with a prodigious appetite for 
good food and wine and intellectual debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the late 1980s, Starr was disillusioned with what he saw as his 
economically sleepy and culturally "alternative" city. He wrote a telling Op-Ed 
piece for The Times in 1986 describing the passing of the flame to Los Angeles 
as the leading city of California. 
</P>
<P>
 When USC offered him a job in 1989, he took it. Starr is that rare being, a 
native San Franciscan who loves Los Angeles. He seems to see something of the 
gung-ho spirit of turn-of-the-century San Francisco in the L.A. of today. 
</P>
<P>
 In his five years in this city, (where he has always lived Downtown,) Starr 
has re-created his role as a public man of letters, expounding on politics and 
gang violence in Times opinion pieces, broadcasting his views on public radio, 
advising Republican Mayor Riordan and recent Democratic gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown and lecturing at business luncheons. He is a proud capitalist 
but excoriates "the Adam Smith gang" who would let the weak perish in the name 
of free markets, and cites the papal encyclical of 1891 -- which demands social 
justice in any economic system -- as his standard for judging modern society.  
</P>
<P>
 He is completing the next volume in his magisterial history of California, 
"The Dream Endures: California Through the Great Depression," and a book about 
being Catholic in America. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Starr was appointed state librarian by Gov. Pete Wilson, a move 
that will take him to Sacramento on a mission he describes as fostering 
literacy and civic-mindedness, especially among young people as bad off as he 
once was. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis returned to Los Angeles from Europe in 1987, but saw something very 
different than Starr did. The country, he said, "had changed beyond 
recognition" -- and for the worse. He tried driving a truck again, but the good 
wages of the early 1970s were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry, Davis focused his writing on Los Angeles. Published in London, "City of 
Quartz" managed to turn local zoning battles into revolutionary high drama and 
gritty Fontana into a lyrical paradise lost. Then came the riots, which made 
the book seem eerily prophetic. That turned it into a bestseller with more than 
60,000 copies in print -- phenomenal for a social history book -- and Davis 
into a hot property. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis looks nothing like the promotional photo on his book cover. There, a 
crew-cut, blue-jeaned hoodlum glares at the camera, simultaneously thuggish and 
righteous. In person he is unassuming, courteous, even gentle -- more 
mischievous than defiant. The fire-breathing revolutionary, now married with a 
baby son, a 12-year-old daughter and a mortgage, greets a visitor to his 
Pasadena bungalow with the baby drooling copiously on his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 He still thinks of himself as an activist, not just an auteur. He walks picket 
lines for restaurant and hotel workers unions, works with Friends of the L.A. 
River, deploys local college students on inner-city research projects, nurtures 
young writers, is researching a book on the Western environment, and lectures 
at urban issues seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, Davis and Starr crossed paths. Surprising Friendship 
</P>
<P>
 They met when they were invited to debate each other a couple of years ago at 
a Westside public affairs forum. "I came in my usually pugnacious mood," Davis 
said. "I came to fight him because I thought he was this kind of corporate 
apologist." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Davis said, "I found somebody who was just incredibly kind and 
complimentary to me. Warm-hearted. A lot more liberal than I had suspected. And 
I was absolutely charmed by Kevin." 
</P>
<P>
 They have become fast friends. When it comes down to it, Davis says, "we're 
just a couple of middle-aged Irish American guys."  
</P>
<P>
 The two came together in Nick Patsaouras' oddball, visionary campaign for 
mayor last year. The three huddled to create a template for a 
pedestrian-friendly city united by buses and trains, graced with greenbelts and 
bustling with urban energy and new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Patsaouras lost. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a pathos to Davis and Starr, old-fashioned idealists both, looking to 
Teamsters and popes for guidance, refusing to believe their visions are pipe 
dreams. Both are acutely aware of being part of a generation that enjoyed the 
incredible opportunities of a California now vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Davis: "When I graduated from school in 1964 there was this magnificent 
education system all for free. And there were plenty of jobs. Well now I look 
out and it's appalling. All the advantages I had have not been passed on." 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, the two men take a walk around Los Angeles, Starr's generous 
middle swelling his seersucker jacket under a red bow tie as he gesticulates 
toward the wiry Davis. They're not arguing. They're laughing. Commiserating 
over editors. Exchanging bibliographical tips on their shared hero, the late 
L.A. chronicler Carey McWilliams. Tugging at each other's sleeves to point out 
hidden historic treasures. Finishing each other's sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 Starr does try to get Davis to see the bright side of things, taking him to 
the recently restored 1926 Central Library. "Look at the dignity of this!" says 
Starr, knocking on the beautiful, solid wood carrels -- available free, he 
noted, for any poor kid to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis allows that the murals and atriums of the library are impressive. "This 
is great public space," he says. But he cannot help noting the stark contrast 
with the impoverished county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis takes Starr to his Los Angeles. On the way, ever protective of social 
order, Starr dissuades Davis from making a left turn against a light. They 
arrive at Belmont Tunnel, the graffiti-encrusted urban ruin at Beverly and 
Glendale boulevards, a standard stop on Davis' tours. 
</P>
<P>
 In the foreground is a weed-filled lot embraced by two thickly spray-painted 
walls, leading into the black hole that burrows underneath Bunker Hill, 
designed to serve a subway plan deserted long ago. A colony of homeless that 
ebbs and flows with the recession inhabits the area. Above the tunnel creeps a 
bald hill scraped clear years ago of its crumbling Victorian mansions -- 
including the one where Davis and his SDS cohorts lived -- in an aborted 
program of urban renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiking up immediately behind the hill are the sparkling skyscrapers of 
Downtown, symbols, in Davis' view, of the "spatial apartheid" that separates 
the towers of high finance from the impoverished streets of Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as is often the case, a movie crew is filming in the mouth of the 
tunnel, taking advantage of its picturesque decay and air of impending urban 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 That this is where Davis often takes visitors disturbs many people. "If you 
are out there propagating this view of L.A . . . you won't get social reform. 
People will leave and you'll get Detroit," says rival L.A. pundit Joel Kotkin.  
</P>
<P>
 Starr takes Davis to the Old Plaza, next to Olvera Street, and describes how 
the power of cities is close to sacred. "The Spanish colonial notion of cities 
(was) cross-fertilized with Christian thought on the City of God. This (city) 
is a vehicle for our salvation, not just our religious salvation but our 
salvation in this world as well -- that there be enough work for people, enough 
to eat, the possibilities of decent family life and education." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Davis has a more Machiavellian view of the Old Plaza. He believes 
that the Spanish bureaucracy set up a secular pueblo here with a garrison to 
counter the growing power of the Franciscan missions nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Davis' hopes for the city are no less Oz-like than Starr's.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is crazy," Davis says as they sit outside the Church of Our Lady Queen 
of Angels across from the Old Plaza, "but I kinda have this idea that what we 
should be organizing for right now is to end the 20th Century with a World's 
Fair in L.A. -- have a world exposition devoted to the ecologically and humanly 
sustainable city. And what better place to do it than L.A. with all of its 
environmental problems, and maybe do it along the L.A. River and make real 
environmental restoration. A green city!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential to be a wonderful and unprecedented kind of civilization," 
Davis insists, "exists here."

L.A. AREA POISED TO SHARE IN LANDMARK EDUCATION GRANT; SCHOOLS: PORTION OF 
$500-MILLION ANNENBERG GIFT IS EXPECTED TO HELP BOOST REFORMS SUCH AS LEARN 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of bicoastal negotiations and local planning sessions, the Los 
Angeles area is on the verge of receiving a large chunk of the biggest private 
donation ever made to public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of philanthropist and former publishing magnate Walter H. 
Annenberg and local education and community leaders are putting the finishing 
touches on a plan that would pump millions of dollars into promising school 
reform efforts within Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Annenberg plans to reveal the gift -- which is contingent on a match from 
local sources -- next month, around the one-year anniversary of his White House 
announcement last Dec. 17 that he would donate $500 million to improve public 
schools around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles was among a handful of urban areas invited by Annenberg 
representatives earlier this year to submit proposals for using some of that 
money. In September, a coalition in New York City was awarded $50 million to 
launch new, independent public schools, and negotiations are progressing in 
several other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most closely involved in the efforts to bring some of the money to Los 
Angeles declined to discuss details of the expected grant out of deference to 
Annenberg, who will make the final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But others among the education, business and community leaders who have been 
involved in drafting the Los Angeles Metropolitan Project (LAMP), as the 
proposal is known, say they anticipate receiving about $50 million from the 
Annenberg Foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 They said efforts have begun to match that amount from private donations and 
with some public funds earmarked for school reforms. They do not expect to have 
to raise the entire amount before receiving the first installment of the 
Annenberg gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year grant and matching funds would generate at least $100 million to 
boost reforms already in place and create a mechanism for spreading them among 
a so-called critical mass of schools throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although isolated efforts to improve schools over the last decade have been 
showing success, reformers have been frustrated by a shortage of funds that has 
hobbled efforts to spread the changes. Leaders in the Los Angeles efforts see 
the Annenberg gift as a way to remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't another school reform program but a way of consolidating, 
solidifying and building on the momentum that's already present here," said 
Theodore Mitchell, dean of the UCLA Graduate School of Education and 
Information Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell and his counterpart at USC, School of Education Dean Guilbert C. 
Hentschke, spent most of the summer and fall coordinating grant application 
efforts between Los Angeles leaders and Annenberg officials. On Friday, they 
submitted the often-revised proposal to officials from Brown University, who 
are advising Annenberg on the distribution of his gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will center its efforts on groups or "families" of reform-minded 
schools dedicated to improved learning for all students, and will send most of 
the Annenberg funds directly to those campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of administering the project and disseminating the reforms to schools 
throughout the county will be paid for by private donations or public education 
funds that could be channeled into the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working for community-led changes within individual schools, 
the project also seeks to encourage reform in the school systems by identifying 
and spreading the best education practices and supporting such key activities 
as teacher training and staff development, parental involvement and 
coordination of public services.  
</P>
<P>
 To foster stability and consistency for students, participating schools will 
be asked to join four or five others to form clusters, or families, including a 
high school, middle school and several elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, campuses wanting to participate 
will be required to align themselves with the Los Angeles Educational Alliance 
for Restructuring Now, or LEARN, the district's business-and 
community-supported reform program. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most significant things about this grant is that it recognizes 
that we have a certain momentum going with LEARN and we need to keep it going," 
said Robert E. Wycoff, LEARN chairman and a member of the board that will 
oversee the project. "To try to start all over would have been a serious 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Interested schools in other districts will be asked to choose a primary 
sponsor to advise parents, teachers and community members in reshaping the 
school. Sponsors range from the county Office of Education to the Getty Center 
for Education in the Arts to the Coalition of Essential Schools. The coalition 
was founded a decade ago by nationally known reformer Theodore R. Sizer, a 
Brown education professor who is a key player in the Annenberg gift decisions.  
</P>
<P>
 All participating schools also must embrace a series of "action principles" 
that include giving teachers planning and skills-development time, developing 
standards and goals, and bringing parents into key decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Districts must agree to give individual schools autonomy in budget and hiring 
decisions and demonstrate they are willing to change their own practices to 
better support individual campuses. Employee unions at participating schools 
will be required to grant waivers on certain contract provisions governing the 
hiring of teachers and principals and the participation of staff members in 
academic and financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will draw on about a dozen "strategic partners" to provide 
financial support and technical expertise to the challenge of making district 
and other bureaucracies more helpful to reforming schools. They include such 
diverse organizations as the California Business Roundtable, the U.S. 
Department of Education, Rebuild LA and the Xerox Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, UCLA and the California State University system, which trains most of the 
state's public school teachers, will have substantial roles in the project, 
which CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz sees as a rare chance to make important 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the one tangible opportunity to seriously examine with all the 
players -- the unions, the families, the students, the school systems -- how we 
might do things differently into the 21st Century," Munitz said. "It gives us a 
chance to test the best practices . . . and apply them elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The project will be run by a director and several associates who will come 
from the teaching or school administrator ranks, and report to the governing 
board.  
</P>
<P>
 "(The directorship) is going to be a significant job for somebody," said 
business executive Virgil Roberts, a member of the governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will require a complex set of skills, and the board is going to want 
someone who has credibility (among people who work in the schools), the ability 
to communicate the program, and somebody who would be comfortable talking to 
legislators and the governor," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the project began in mid-May when USC President Steven B. Sample was 
approached by a longtime friend, Brown University President Vartan Gregorian, 
who had been designated to advise Annenberg on distributing his gift. Sample, 
along with UCLA Chancellor Charles Young, drew together those who had a hand in 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money itself is very important, but it goes beyond that," Sample said 
Friday. "If it comes through, it symbolizes that someone (of Annenberg's 
stature) recognizes the programs that we have in Los Angeles and believes 
investing in this area is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will inspire a lot of other people in the private sector to invest 
in the public schools of Los Angeles County. It will give inspiration and hope 
to a lot of people who have dedicated years to school reform here."

WILSON PROPOSES U.S. VERSION OF PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: HE URGES CONGRESS TO 
ENACT SIMILAR MEASURES. BUT LAWMAKERS ARE LIKELY TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, fresh from his resounding reelection victory, proposed 
Friday that Congress adopt a federal version of California's controversial 
Proposition 187, which would deny all benefits except emergency medical care to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a confident address to the conservative Heritage Foundation, Wilson said 
that the new Congress should either fully reimburse states for the cost of 
education and medical services to illegal immigrants or seek to end the 
requirements that they provide such services at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is proper for federal or state taxpayers to pay the costs of 
those services," Wilson said, "so my preference is to end the services." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Wilson expressed support for a new program to import 
temporary "guest workers" from Mexico -- an idea that traditionally has enjoyed 
strong support from California agricultural interests but in the past has been 
resisted by the kind of illegal immigration critics who worked with Wilson to 
pass the 187 initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In his wide-ranging remarks, Wilson again denied interest in seeking the 1996 
presidential nomination, said that Republicans should pass authority over 
welfare to the states rather than attempt to rewrite the program in Washington, 
urged Congress to pass the new world trade agreement later this month and 
sharply denounced the Mexican government's criticism of Proposition 187.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Mexican government should really butt out of the internal affairs 
of the United States," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he arrived at the Heritage Foundation, Wilson was greeted by a noisy throng 
of anti-Proposition 187 protesters who carried signs accusing him of fomenting 
racism. "Pete Wilson: The George Wallace of The '90s," read one placard. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Pete Wilson comes to Washington to step onto the national stage, we want 
the national Republican Party to know he comes with some serious baggage," said 
Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, an advocacy 
group that organized the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said suggestions that the proposition is racist or anti-immigrant are 
"insulting to the people of California who voted for it." 
</P>
<P>
 With his address, which drew a throng of reporters, Wilson clearly signaled 
that he intends to push the Proposition 187 message onto the national stage. He 
indicated that in addition to lobbying Congress he also will work with other 
states interested in passing similar laws. That effort promises to widen a 
rapidly sharpening fault line in conservative ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most national Republican leaders supported the California measure, it 
drew intense fire from several conservative leaders -- including former Cabinet 
secretaries Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett, leading GOP strategist William 
Kristol and representatives of several conservative think tanks including the 
Heritage Foundation -- which condemned it as a "big brother" expansion of 
government power. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett and Kemp have scheduled a news conference for next Monday with Linda 
Chavez, a former top civil rights official in the Ronald Reagan Administration, 
to push alternatives to the benefits cutoffs Wilson advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not specify exactly what a federal version of Proposition 187 would 
look like. But in his remarks he suggested that any federal action should be 
based on the measure's provisions to cut off educational and non-emergency 
medical services to illegal immigrants. In California, Proposition 187 faces 
numerous legal hurdles, and most of its provisions have been temporarily 
blocked by a federal judge pending further review by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress may have only limited maneuvering room to affect such benefits, 
however. Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for federal welfare and food 
stamps. Congress has required states to provide emergency medical care to 
illegal immigrants, but Proposition 187 leaves this undisturbed. The measure 
cuts back on non-emergency services provided through state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The California initiative also attempts to remove illegal immigrants from 
public schools. But any effort to expand that on a national basis would face 
the same hurdle now confronting Proposition 187: the 1982 Supreme Court ruling 
that the Constitution requires states to educate illegal immigrants. 
Ultimately, the Supreme Court would have to approve any congressional effort to 
reverse that decision, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that he has spoken with both incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) and likely Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and that each 
indicated support for steps to reduce the cost to states of illegal immigrants. 
In comments to reporters after their meeting Thursday night, Gingrich said he 
believes that "the best response is to eliminate the mandates (to provide 
services) because the welfare magnet (is) drawing people into the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Gingrich's sympathetic comments, several Republican sources said 
Friday that Congress is likely to move cautiously before tackling the emotional 
issue of further limiting benefits to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Senate nor House Republicans laid out positions on illegal immigration 
in the "contracts" they produced during the campaign. And last year, a House 
Republican task force on immigration chaired by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) did 
not endorse barring illegal immigrant children from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, Smith, who is likely to chair the House Judiciary 
subcommittee on immigration, said that "the thrust of 187 is going to be 
seriously considered by Congress." But he suggested that provoking a court 
challenge by denying educational benefits to children might prove too 
controversial for inclusion in any immigration package. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us are more interested in passing a bill than posturing and that 
means producing a bill that has bipartisan support in Congress," Smith said. 
Any provision cutting off educational benefits for children, he said, "would 
make it difficult" to attract such broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's suggestion Friday that Congress consider a new guest-worker program 
is also likely to prove controversial. When Congress revised the immigration 
laws in 1986, Wilson, then a U.S. senator, pushed through the Senate a large 
guest-worker program with the strong support of California agribusiness, which 
wanted low-cost seasonal labor. But the House rejected the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, while offering few specifics, Wilson said the United States should 
consider reinstating a guest-worker program to alleviate the pressure for 
illegal immigration created by Mexico's inability to produce enough jobs for 
its people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense -- it has in the past, it may well continue to do so in the 
future -- to have some sort of guest-worker program," Wilson said. "But not the 
kind of thing we have been seeing where there has been massive illegal 
immigration, where whole families have come and where they are . . . requiring 
services that are being paid for by state taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates immediately accused Wilson of hypocrisy and attempting to 
ensure low-cost labor for agribusiness even as he seeks to deny public services 
to illegal immigrants. "It's like saying you can't attend our schools, but you 
can still pick cotton for us," Sharry said.

CONSERVANCY'S DEAL WITH SOKA MAY FALL APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tentative deal between the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and Soka 
University to convert part of the school's campus to parkland is in danger of 
falling apart as opposition from local homeowners and elected officials 
intensifies, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy board is scheduled to meet Monday night to consider settling 
its eminent domain lawsuit against the school, but several sources told The 
Times that it is unlikely the deal will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have coveted Soka's scenic campus for decades. They consider 
the campus, nestled in an oak-stubbled valley, the premier spot for a visitors 
center to the surrounding mountain parkland. Soka and the conservancy have 
spent the past two years -- and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- fighting 
each other in court over the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources blamed the likely failure of the deal on mounting criticism from the 
conservancy's traditional supporters -- including Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson, 
who helped create the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who will take over Dec. 5 as the 
area's representative on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to conservancy board Chairman Jerry Daniel, Yaroslavsky called the 
proposed deal "public policy at its worst" and characterized it as "insidious" 
because it would undermine standard approval processes. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the conservancy's tacit support could leave supervisors little 
choice but to approve some form of expansion for Soka. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel declined to speculate how Yaroslavsky's letter and a similar one from 
Beilenson might influence the board's decision. "Your guess is as good as 
mine," Daniel said. "We'll see what happens Monday night." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, dozens of homeowners and environmentalists excoriated the proposed 
settlement at a hearing before the Mountains Recreation and Conservation 
Authority, the arm of the conservancy trying to condemn a portion of Soka's 
campus for use as a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The most crucial hearing so far in the case is scheduled for Wednesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the proposed deal, which was leaked two weeks ago, the 
conservancy would drop its condemnation lawsuit against the school. In 
exchange, Soka would sell 173 acres -- including the historic Gillette Mansion 
and most of the land the conservancy wants. 
</P>
<P>
 The school would also agree to scale back its expansion plans by building a 
campus on the eastern part of the property that would enroll a maximum of 2,500 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would take effect only if Soka is granted permits for a smaller 
university by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the deal had hoped they could announce the settlement to Judge 
Barnet Cooperman on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, lawyers probably will argue over whether the conservancy followed 
proper procedure when it launched eminent domain proceedings late in 1992. If 
the judge rules that the conservancy has the right to seize Soka's campus, a 
jury will decide how much the university should be compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the risks of proceeding with trial, several critics of the settlement 
proposal said that they were heartened by news of its faltering support. "I'm 
thrilled because it means to me that the conservancy is staying the course," 
said Les Hardie, past president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the judge kicks the case out of court then I would say the conservancy 
will leave the field with honor," Hardie said. "They may be defeated but they 
will have done it with honor and done it with grace." 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy is trying to condemn 245 of Soka's 668 acres at the corner of 
Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway. Soka, in turn, wants to expand its 
200-student language school into a full liberal arts college of about 3,500 
students.

USDA STAFFERS WERE TARGETS OF '92 CLINTON FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the frantic weeks before Bill Clinton's 1992 election as President, 
high-ranking career employees working on a politically sensitive program in the 
Agriculture Department were invited to contribute to a political action 
committee that was raising money for the Arkansas governor's White House bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those involved with the PAC were then-Rep. Mike Espy, who would later 
become agriculture secretary, and Grant B. Buntrock, a Democrat who would be 
Espy's and Clinton's choice to head the Agricultural Stabilization and 
Conservation Service, the nation's major domestic farm-aid program. 
</P>
<P>
 Implicit in the invitation, some of the Civil Service employees now say, was 
the suggestion that their careers would benefit if they helped elect a 
Democratic President. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-eight career employees -- some of whom say they were approached at work 
-- subsequently made the donations, most of $50 to $500. Much of the money was 
passed on to the Arkansas-based PAC by Buntrock. Many of the checks were 
delivered together on a single day in a much-criticized practice known as 
bundling. 
</P>
<P>
 After the election, Espy -- a longtime Clinton ally -- and, later, Buntrock 
got their appointments. Many upper-level management employees who contributed 
to the Farmers & Ranchers '92 PAC, nearly all of them Democrats, also were 
promoted or given better job assignments. At the same time, career colleagues 
identified as Republicans or GOP allies were transferred to less desirable 
positions, according to records and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, Buntrock and other Agriculture Department officials contend that there 
was no connection between the contributions -- or the donors' partisan 
allegiance -- and the advancement of any employees at the ASCS, which recently 
became part of a new Farm Service Agency. Buntrock said all appointments 
adhered to the "very, very strict requirements" of the Civil Service process. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics -- both within the department and outside it -- insist that the 
unusual pattern of campaign contributions by career employees, combined with 
the post-election personnel shifts, represent an alarming case of 
politicization of a Civil Service system that is supposed to be based on merit, 
not political loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an egregious example of abuse, of what money buys in politics," said 
Ellen Miller, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a 
nonpartisan research group that tracks federal campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most government employees don't make enough to give large contributions 
without their eyes on some prize in return or some kind of potential 
enhancement of their career," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations of partisanship in government promotions are not taken lightly. It 
is illegal to promote or demote a federal employee for making or failing to 
make a political contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the nature of the fund raising itself raises legal questions. Under 
the Hatch Act and other statutes, federal workers may donate to campaigns. But 
nearly all solicitation or collection of campaign funds by civil servants is 
prohibited, particularly at government workplaces. Violations are punishable by 
suspension or dismissal of those involved with the collections. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions, a cornerstone of the federal merit system, are designed to 
preserve the professionalism of career employees and ensure the nonpartisan 
delivery of federally funded public services. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, most of the employees who made donations to the pro-Clinton 
PAC said no one suggested that doing so would enhance their careers. And many 
who have since advanced said they did not believe that their contributions had 
any bearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But others see a link. Said one donor: "Being a Democrat, you might hope 
something might come of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another career employee, who declined to contribute, said he was approached at 
work by a senior associate who advised him: "If you're going to send money to 
the Democratic Party, don't send it through regular channels. You want to make 
sure it gets to a location where they would be able to recognize very clearly 
that you were in the Agriculture Department." 
</P>
<P>
 The employee, who requested anonymity, said he felt the remark indicated that 
"if there was an opportunity for (the Democrats) to reward those who supported 
that particular ticket, they wanted to know who it was they should reward." 
</P>
<P>
 A whistle-blower complaint provided by its author to The Times on the 
condition of anonymity alleges that the correlation between the donations and 
subsequent personnel changes represents a pattern that "is clear and blatant." 
It was filed with the Office of the Special Counsel, which generally doesn't 
disclose whether it is conducting an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Assertions that the career personnel process has been politicized are being 
raised as Espy is under investigation by independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz 
concerning allegations that he improperly accepted travel and entertainment 
from agriculture concerns. As a result of the probe, Espy has resigned, 
effective Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz is also exploring whether Ronald Blackley -- Espy's first Agriculture 
Department chief of staff -- improperly interceded to aid farmers who were his 
former clients by reversing lower-level ASCS decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, of Mississippi, was one of nine national co-chairmen of Farmers & 
Ranchers '92, while Buntrock, an ex-ASCS career employee, acted as Washington 
co-chairman. The PAC was set up -- in the words of William Gillon, a National 
Cotton Council attorney who advised it -- to "get farmers active in the 
political process." 
</P>
<P>
 The PAC raised $93,100 in 1992. It spent $45,116 on behalf of Clinton, $1,093 
against George Bush, and $9,252 to support nine Democratic Senate and House 
candidates from farm states. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-three career employees in the ASCS Washington office and five in a 
Kansas City office donated $7,225, Federal Election Commission campaign records 
show. A political appointee gave $200 and a former ASCS worker donated $1,000. 
Buntrock chipped in $400. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sum collected from ASCS employees was modest by private-sector 
standards, the fund-raising effort was notable because of widespread 
sensitivity to laws restricting most partisan activities by civil servants. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine of the donations were received on a single day, Oct. 14, 1992, FEC 
records show. Eight more arrived the next day. One donor recalled that a 
contribution deadline had been set because "the money was being turned in to 
one person to send it in." 
</P>
<P>
 Bundling -- or pooling small donations into a larger sum -- is legal but is 
criticized by advocates of campaign-finance reform as a way to skirt limits on 
individual contributions. Campaign-finance experts said they were unaware of 
any previous case of bundling donations from federal workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the effort was Buntrock, whom Espy appointed to the $120,000-a-year 
ASCS administrator post in October, 1993. Both Buntrock and Espy deny that the 
fund raising had anything to do with Buntrock's selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Buntrock was appointed "purely on his qualifications" in conjunction with the 
White House, said Espy spokesman Tom Amontree, who added that Espy's position 
with the PAC was merely honorary and that he had no contact with Buntrock in 
that capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Buntrock, 57, was well-known to many veteran ASCS employees. He was assistant 
deputy administrator of ASCS during the Jimmy Carter Administration and left 
the agency in 1985. Recently, he directed the Washington office of the National 
Farmers Organization, an advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those involved in the fund raising said the money was channeled to the 
PAC through Buntrock -- who, in turn, made sure that fellow Democrats knew he 
was responsible. Overall, Buntrock said his office at the National Farmers 
Organization sent 100 to 200 checks to Little Rock, Ark., over several months, 
forwarding packets "on an average of once a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Several employees said that at the time the money was collected, Buntrock was 
rumored to be a candidate for a senior Agriculture Department post if Clinton 
was elected. Campaign fund raising is a time-honored way to enhance one's 
prospects for a political appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Forlines, a friend of Buntrock's who had worked for the Agriculture 
Department for 38 years and was deputy director of the ASCS' tobacco and 
peanuts division in 1992, said he doubted Buntrock would have gotten the job if 
he hadn't been "recognized as a supporter of the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Buntrock insisted, however, that he had no idea a job might be offered to him 
until mid-1993. While acknowledging that he had been "a contact point" for the 
PAC, he denied seeking contributions from anyone at the ASCS. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the donors said they gave to support Clinton or American farmers. Some 
donors said they learned of the PAC at the office -- where it was widely 
discussed -- and gave their checks to co-workers. Several employees said they 
were approached by specific colleagues: ASCS career veterans Jeffress Wells, 
Grady Bilberry, Jim Ray and Forlines. 
</P>
<P>
 One longtime employee said he was called into the office of his former boss 
before the 1992 election and told "there was an organization that was 
interested in getting Clinton elected, and would I contribute?" 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believed that if the Democrats regained the White House, this man 
might again be his boss. Therefore, he said, to his mind, "there wasn't any 
choice." He said he wrote a check and gave it to his co-worker in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlines, a Democrat who contributed $100, acknowledged collecting funds from 
five to 10 co-workers who "found out through me" about the PAC. He said he 
could not recall whether he discussed the PAC with them at the office or 
received the checks at work. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Forlines said he passed the money to a friend at the ASCS, whom he 
declined to name. Forlines, who was made acting director of the tobacco and 
peanuts division after the election and who retired this year, said he was 
unaware of any suggestion that donating might enhance anyone's career. 
</P>
<P>
 As ASCS administrator, Buntrock oversaw more than 12,500 full-time employees 
and a politically sensitive program that handled $9 billion to $10 billion in 
payments to farmers last year. He has similar duties during a departmental 
reorganization that is under way and is said to be a candidate to head the Farm 
Service Agency that has been formed by consolidating the ASCS with other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Buntrock said he has made a "very minimal" number of personnel 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But under his leadership, 21 of the 38 career employees who donated to the PAC 
were promoted or given more desirable temporary or permanent positions, 
according to records and numerous ASCS employees. The moves have afforded 
beneficiaries one or more of the following: greater visibility, enhanced 
authority, improved potential for advancement or higher pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture Department records show that seven PAC contributors are among the 
17 career employees who have been promoted permanently at the upper Civil 
Service ranks -- grades 14 and 15 -- in the ASCS Washington and Kansas City 
offices. Three more donors received temporary promotions; five have been 
assigned temporarily to more high-powered jobs; four have been moved laterally 
to higher-profile posts and two were transferred to ASCS offices outside 
Washington at their request. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, only one donor has been moved to a position considered less 
desirable. Numerous non-donors -- many of whom were known Republicans or had 
close ties to Republicans -- say they have experienced such a transfer. 
Although no employee has been demoted or received a pay cut, the new jobs have 
less prominence and prestige, employees say. 
</P>
<P>
 One individual who lost out in the process has filed a grievance with Council 
26 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; two 
filed discrimination complaints with the Agriculture Department and a fourth 
filed the whistle-blower complaint. These matters are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major beneficiaries have been Wells and Jack Webb, Democrats who 
each gave $500. Both have been temporarily assigned to the influential office 
of deputy administrator for state and county operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Their positions are important because they involve policy development and 
contact with politically appointed ASCS state and county committees that 
administer farm programs. While such temporary assignments don't bring higher 
pay, they can provide valuable experience that leads to future promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells, a 40-year ASCS veteran and friend of Buntrock's for 25 years, said that 
while he and Buntrock discussed the PAC in 1992, his friend never asked for a 
donation. He also denied that he had solicited PAC money but acknowledged that 
friends from North Carolina and possibly "a friend or two in the Washington 
area" asked where they could make a contribution. He said none worked for the 
ASCS. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb said he contributed because he supported the PAC's goals but never 
discussed it with Buntrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, a former Democratic political appointee and 29-year ASCS employee, has 
been temporarily promoted and is acting as director of the Kansas City office. 
He gave $500 to the PAC but said he had "absolutely not" approached any 
associates about it. He insisted the contribution had nothing to do with his 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Also promoted was Bilberry, a 25-year employee who contributed $125. He said 
he could not recall how he heard about the PAC or to whom he gave his check. He 
initially said he didn't remember how many others gave him donations but later 
denied soliciting at all. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision to reassign Sandra Penn was particularly controversial. A 15-year 
ASCS employee who won the Agriculture Department's distinguished service award 
in 1992, Penn had been deputy director of the cotton, grain and rice division 
for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though said to be abrasive at times, Penn was well respected. She oversaw a 
staff of about 50 that implemented some of the department's highest-profile 
programs, involving billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Penn was shifted to the job of assistant to the deputy 
administrator for management and was moved from a spacious office in the 
Agriculture Department building to an outpost in Virginia. She said the job had 
"no staff, no office, no specific responsibilities." She was subsequently 
assigned to produce an internal report. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn recently filed a sex discrimination complaint with the Agriculture 
Department. It is still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn said her new boss, Rashid Nuri, the deputy administrator for management, 
"told me he was given a list of Republicans when he first came there and my 
name was on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn is a registered Democrat, but she is married to Bill Penn, a former 
Republican political appointee at the ASCS, and had flourished under GOP 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuri denied having a list of Republicans and said he had told Penn that he 
would do everything possible "to find her substantial work." 
</P>
<P>
 Buntrock said no career employee, including Penn, has been given a less 
desirable job. He called every job "critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Top-level political appointees are routinely replaced when a new 
Administration takes office, and these government managers have broad 
discretion to reassign career bureaucrats on the basis of compatibility or who 
will best implement their policies. But it is prohibited to consider 
partisanship in deploying Civil Service employees, personnel specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never the expectation that partisan affiliation would influence 
decision-making for career civil servants," said Constance Horner, an expert on 
federal personnel practices at the Brookings Institution. "In fact, it would be 
unusual for partisan affiliation for civil servants to be known to political 
appointees."

TRADE DEFICIT GROWS, DEALING SETBACK TO GATT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States trade deficit grew ominously in September, according to 
figures released Friday, and the widening gap seems certain to give opponents 
new ammunition in their fight against approval of an expanded global trade 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortfall between U.S. purchases of imported goods and sales of 
American-made products overseas reached $10.1 billion in September, figures 
show, raising the prospect of an annual deficit that will rival the record $152 
billion recorded in 1987. The September deficit was $400 million greater than 
the August deficit of $9.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers reflect imports that continue to flow into the country at 
stunningly high levels, a record volume of oil purchases from overseas, a 
near-record deficit in the balance of trade involving manufactured goods and 
the largest ever one-month deficit with China. 
</P>
<P>
 The report quickly became an element in the debate on Capitol Hill over the 
plan to rewrite the rules of global trade, which is scheduled for votes in 
Congress later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would create a new World Trade Organization as a successor to the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which now governs global commerce. 
President Clinton and his allies have embarked on a feverish campaign to win 
congressional approval of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the figures) play into the GATT debate because the GATT is seen by the 
opposition as a continuation of Cold War trade policy," said economist Charles 
McMillion, president of MBG information services, a business information 
analysis and forecasting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there is a strong belief on the Hill -- and it is bipartisan -- that it 
is time for a major re-examination of how we do international economic policy. 
These are the results of the old policies and seven rounds of Cold War-GATT 
negotiations, which lowered tariffs." 
</P>
<P>
 The House and Senate are scheduled to vote on the trade pact in less than two 
weeks, during a special session that has shaped up as an important test not 
only of Clinton's leadership but of Republican willingness to address foreign 
policy issues in a bipartisan manner as they prepare to move into leadership 
positions in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agreement, negotiated by 123 nations, would cut tariffs on 
manufactured goods by an average of 40% around the world and extend copyright 
and other protections to such diverse areas as the production of 
pharmaceuticals and musical recordings. In addition, the pact would make it 
easier for banks, insurance companies and other financial service firms to 
operate in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, it would bring down import taxes globally by $744 billion, the 
Clinton Administration says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is seeking support among Republicans, traditional allies of 
proposals that bring down trade barriers, to offset some Democratic opposition. 
Both sides are increasingly digging in as they fight to woo the undecided 
members of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader to whom others in his party 
will look for guidance and political cover, has expressed reservations about 
the agreement, forcing the White House into unresolved negotiations over one of 
the most sensitive elements in the pact -- the clout that the World Trade 
Organization would have over U.S. laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said that the Administration's 
talks with Dole are "making good progress." Dole reportedly wants a commission 
created to monitor operation of the new trade organization so the Unites States 
can determine whether the new rules are in the nation's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly trade figures published by the Commerce Department showed a 4.6% 
jump in the trade imbalance over August. Imports fell slightly, by 0.1%, but 
the United States' exports fell much more rapidly, at a pace of 1.3%, worsening 
the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 While the amount spent on imported oil declined, reflecting a drop in prices, 
the volume of imported crude oil reached 260.8 million barrels in September. 
Combined with higher prices, the record-high volume would have made the deficit 
even greater. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit with Japan, a perpetual trouble spot, dipped to $5.4 billion, from 
$5.8 billion in August. But the United States' difficult trade deficit with 
China continued to grow, to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, imports of foreign-made high-technology products reached an 
all-time level of $9.26 billion, in a segment of the economy in which the 
United States has been judged highly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Barry P. Bosworth of the Brookings Institution said that the large 
monthly trade deficit is continuing unabated "because the United States' 
economy is still stronger than (that of) its major trading partners," a fact 
which creates a lag in foreign purchases of U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.), the numbers are "a powerful argument 
against the approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the current trade strategy, which is based on lowering tariffs -- 
the taxes paid on imports -- and reducing other barriers to boost global 
commerce "is producing lost jobs and lower incomes for American workers. That 
conclusion is clear from the burgeoning trade deficit."

LABOR; MEXICO PAPER PRESSES THE ISSUE OF UNION'S POWER; LA REFORMA SENDS 
VENDORS INTO THE STREETS, BYPASSING HAWKERS GUILD AFTER ITS MEMBERS REFUSE TO 
SELL THE DAILY ON A HOLIDAY. SOME SEE BATTLE AS A CLASS STRUGGLE.

<P>
 Every morning, a new army appears on the streets of this teeming capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with white baseball caps and newspaper bundles, they battle rush-hour 
smog, pirouette through chaotic traffic snarls -- shouting above horns and 
unmuffled tailpipes -- and compete with juggling clowns, window washers and 
street beggars. 
</P>
<P>
 A few are politicians, some are even rich. But most are otherwise unemployed. 
Together, they have become an overnight Mexico City institution: street 
soldiers in a battle that has captured the attention of a nation at the edge of 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 What began as a young newspaper's challenge to a powerful union -- which owned 
the capital's streets for 71 years -- has become, for many analysts here, a 
test case of Mexican neo-capitalism and freedom of the press on one hand, and 
the traditional patronage of institutional labor on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 This is La Reforma versus the Union of Mexican Newspaper Hawkers and Vendors, 
which represents 20,500 lower-class families that own kiosks and hawker posts 
in a city awash with daily newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is pending before Mexico's Federal Commission on Competitiveness, 
which has been asked to rule on whether a labor group should maintain seven 
decades of exclusive rights to hawk every newspaper, magazine, novella and 
comic book sold on the city's public byways. 
</P>
<P>
 For La Reforma, it is a landmark effort to break up a government-backed 
monopoly that is among the relics of Mexico's socialist past. For the street 
hawkers, it is union-busting by rich capitalists at a time when the official 
pendulum has swung too far in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the capital audience that has watched this drama play out on their 
busiest thoroughfares, it has been pure street theater. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, some of the nation's top politicians joined in the act, which began 
Nov. 3 when the newspaper's president and general manager, Alejandro Junco de 
la Vega, led his new, non-union army of novice hawkers into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They were joined by some of Mexico's best-known intellectuals, traditional 
supporters of workers' rights. On Tuesday, even Cecilia Soto, the glamorous 
former presidential candidate of the Workers Party, put on a white Reforma 
baseball cap and spent the morning side-by-side with the scabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people in the street selling our paper who don't need to 
be there but who think there is more at stake than a dispute between one 
company and one union," Junco said. "There is more at stake. . . . We have, for 
so many years, relied on a system of patronage . . . that we are trying to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Countering that opinion, union lawyer Nestor de Buen, a labor analyst and 
prominent newspaper columnist, said of La Reforma's actions, "The intention is 
just to rob the union of its power and its strength." 
</P>
<P>
 That alone would have been impossible five years ago and unthinkable in the 
era when the hawkers union was born. Since its inception Jan. 15, 1923, the 
union has held exclusive rights to the streets because of government rulings, 
verbal agreements with publishers and a succession of administrations -- until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has made a concerted effort to break 
labor's lock on commerce during his six-year term. Aides to Salinas' successor 
-- Yale-educated President-elect Ernesto Zedillo -- have indicated that those 
policies will continue when he takes office Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But the flash point for La Reforma's fight struck at the core of labor's 
protection -- the right not to work five days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the case is now anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Junco triggered it when he demanded the union vendors sell his paper this 
Sunday. It's La Reforma's first anniversary. But it's also the anniversary of 
the Mexican Revolution -- one of five sacred days of rest that are 
constitutionally guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after Junco's demand -- a legitimate right for a free press to 
publish as it wishes, he asserted -- the union stopped selling his paper at its 
17,000 street stands citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Junco mobilized his "alternative channel" overnight. "This all goes far beyond 
the Mickey Mouse issue of five holidays a year," said Junco, who insisted that 
he has passed the point of no return and now must fight until his paper wins or 
dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exposing a whole scheme of inefficiency, corruption and union patronage, 
an old way of dividing the country up into feudal fiefdoms," he added. "The 
people working for us directly now are making more than they would make if they 
were working for the union." 
</P>
<P>
 "Absurd," De Buen replied, drawing future battle lines that both sides believe 
will continue for weeks. "In fact, the hawkers have now become the victims of 
this very aggressive campaign in the press. The Juncos are trying to do in 
Mexico City what they did before in Monterrey (the northern business 
metropolis, where another Junco-owned paper broke the hawkers union). But 
Mexico City is not Monterrey. And there are the lives of 20,500 poor families 
at stake."

RELIGION; POPE'S APPOINTEES SHOW CHANGE IS CARDINAL VIRTUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Archbishop Jan P. Schotte is a personable, polyglot Belgian prelate who is 
helping lay the foundation for the 21st-Century Roman Catholic Church as the 
organizer of papal-summoned international congresses of bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday, Schotte, 66, will cross an invisible yet portentous line 
between churchman and potential Pope when John Paul II elevates him and 29 
other bishops from 24 countries to the College of Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Schotte, a close papal ally of impeccable credentials, is emblematic of the 
change that John Paul is bringing to that most exclusive of men's clubs. The 
college's principal task is not only to elect the next Pope, but to produce him 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The college has elected one of its members to the papacy without exception 
since the 14th Century. Thus, like some other newcomers in the Class of '94, 
Schotte becomes papabile the instant John Paul invests him with the cardinal's 
trademark red hat. 
</P>
<P>
 As he elevates the largest number of new cardinals in almost half a century, 
John Paul is simultaneously directing a process of renewal and a broadening of 
horizons for his 2,000-year-old Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Restocked to its maximum 120 voting members, the new college mirrors the 
church's changing geographic priorities and John Paul's attempts to shape its 
theological future. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new cardinals share their Pope's doctrinal conservatism and his 
preoccupation with what he sees as the growing secularization of consumer 
societies. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul, 74, should have named cardinals in the spring, but he was 
hospitalized with a broken leg. In early autumn, he looked increasingly frail 
but has strengthened recently and is clearly feeling better. This week he 
outlined spiritual -- and travel -- plans for the year 2000, and announced a 
major trip to the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Australia and Sri Lanka in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 With his new nominations, John Paul will have appointed 100 of the 120 
cardinal electors. There are 47 other cardinals, but they are older than 80 -- 
too old to vote for Pope under Vatican rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Like those in the new class, about half of the college electors are European. 
Since the fall of communism, John Paul has focused firmly on Eastern Europe, 
renewing vacant cardinalates there and creating new ones in countries emerging 
from Communist totalitarianism with resurgent religion as counterpoint to 
tattered social fabrics and shattered economies. 
</P>
<P>
 The new appointees include a cardinal for Prague who spent eight years as a 
window washer under Czech Communist rule; Belarus' first cardinal, who spent 10 
years in Soviet prisons, and a 92-year-old Albanian, imprisoned under communism 
for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul has once again used appointments to reinforce his church in places 
where it is under duress or shows prospects of a comeback. Among the new 
cardinals are prelates from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lebanon, Cuba and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The reign of the church's first Polish Pope has not been kind to historic 
Italian dominance of the college and the Curia, the Vatican administration. 
There are three Italian electors among the new cardinals, and Italians -- with 
20 -- will remain the largest national group in the new college, but never 
again will the election of a non-Italian Pope be as startling as when Cardinal 
Karol Wojtyla of Krakow was elected in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans will be the second-largest national contingent. Cardinalates for 
Archbishops William H. Keeler of Baltimore and Adam J. Maida of Detroit raise 
the number of American electors to 10: eight at home and two at the Curia. 
</P>
<P>
 In his numerical and geographic expansion of the college, John Paul has mainly 
added men who share his conservative vision for the church in the next century. 
In a real sense, the College of Cardinals will be his spiritual legacy.

BADGERED OVER JABS AT CLINTON, RADIO HOST QUITS; MEDIA: COLORADO SPRINGS 
CONSERVATIVE'S FIERY RHETORIC IS BLAMED FOR WHITE HOUSE SHOOTING INCIDENT. HE 
RECEIVED FLOOD OF HATE MAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A conservative radio talk-show host has called it quits amid threats from 
people who believe his hard-nosed opinions about President Clinton may have 
incited a Colorado man to spray the White House with gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaving," Chuck Baker, 50, told listeners of his popular show "On the 
Carpet," which has aired for six years on KVOR-AM in Colorado Springs, about 70 
miles south of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that will make you left-wing liberals out there very happy," Baker 
said, "but it will be a long time before we have an opportunity to visit here 
again in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same farewell on Tuesday, Baker fumed over rumors that Francisco Martin 
Duran -- the Widefield, Colo., man who fired 27 shots at the White House from a 
semiautomatic assault rifle last month -- told investigators that he was 
influenced by "On the Carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 "So what if the jerk, the wacko, the creep . . . that shot the White House 
said that. If this man thinks I or Rush Limbaugh are the reason he went out 
there, he needs psychiatric counseling in the first degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker could not be reached for comment. But KVOR general manager Donn Seidholz 
said Baker was pushed to the "edge of a nervous breakdown" by a flood of hate 
mail and telephone calls immediately after the Oct. 29 shooting incident -- and 
rumors that investigators wanted to indict him for co-conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that, coupled with the fact that Chuck had not had a vacation in six 
months, exploded on him," Seidholz said. "Now, he's trying to get his head 
together. He will come back to work eventually, I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Seidholz denied that Baker ever urged anybody to shoot Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Baker may have figured in a telephone call that Duran placed to 
Democratic Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell's Colorado Springs office on Aug. 23. 
That day, Baker urged his listeners to take action against the crime bill, 
which included a ban on certain assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Duran called us and said, 'This is very bad. I will go to Washington and take 
someone out,' " said Alton Dillard, a spokesman for Campbell. "A peculiar thing 
about it was that Duran also gave us his name." 
</P>
<P>
 A tape recording of that call, which was among hundreds Campbell's office 
received that day on the crime bill issue, has been turned over to the Secret 
Service, Dillard said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Duran, 26, pleaded not guilty to a federal attempted 
assassination charge, which carries a maximum possible punishment of life 
imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors in Washington have refused to divulge any specific 
evidence supporting the charge, except to suggest that it is based largely on 
statements given to the FBI this month by several people who knew Duran in 
Colorado and on observations by people in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, KVOR has been hit by a new wave of telephone calls and letters from 
people who want Baker back on the air, Seidholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd welcome him back with open arms," Seidholz said. "I think he will be a 
more tolerant man on the air; he'll have the same opinions but he'll be a lot 
more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a refreshing change, according to critics of the talk-show host 
who have long feared that his tirades against liberals in general and the 
Clinton Administration in particular were potentially dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent program, for example, Baker said: "We ought to slap (U.S. Atty. 
Gen.) Janet Reno across the face" and "send her back to Florida where she can 
live with her relatives -- the gators." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, such comments are inflammatory and really do fan the fires of hate," 
said Bill Huddy of Citizens Project, a group that monitors the activities of 
extreme right-wing political and religious groups in Colorado Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillard agreed, saying it would be a good idea for Baker, who sometimes 
broadcast live from a Colorado Springs-area gun shop, "to keep a low profile 
for a while."

MEXICO MOURNS COLOSIO'S WIDOW; EULOGIES: THE CHARISMATIC SPOUSE OF THE SLAIN 
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DIES. SHE HAD LED CALL FOR FULL INVESTIGATION INTO HIS 
ASSASSINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico mourned the Colosio name again Friday with the death of the charismatic 
widow of slain presidential candidate Luis Donald Colosio, and political 
leaders called on investigators to intensify their probe into the unsolved 
killing of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Eulogies filled the capital's airwaves and houses of power throughout the day 
for Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio, 34, an economist who had emerged as a 
powerful force in the search for the truth behind her husband's assassination 
at a Tijuana campaign rally in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after her husband -- the ruling party's presidential heir 
apparent -- was gunned down, Colosio's widow stunned the nation by suggesting 
in a letter to prosecutors that there was evidence indicating that the killing 
"could have been planned by a mastermind." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she toured Europe, meeting Pope John Paul II and key opinion makers in 
a campaign for a thorough investigation back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Government prosecutors, who publicly maintain that they are continuing their 
investigation, so far have blamed the killing on a single man, Mario Aburto 
Martinez, who has been convicted and sentenced to 42 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 During Riojas' hospitalization in the last month, reportedly for pancreatic 
cancer, several analysts had speculated that her death could reduce public 
pressure for a deeper probe into the assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficial sources have blamed the assassination variously on rival politics 
or the drug gangs that reformer Colosio had vowed to destroy. 
</P>
<P>
 In several speeches in the House of Deputies on Friday, legislators said 
Riojas' death should have the opposite effect. In unison, ruling party and 
opposition deputies called for an acceleration of the probe, with several 
stressing that the widow's strength of conviction should be remembered by the 
official agencies charged with resolving her husband's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City Mayor Manuel Aguilera Gomez added his voice to the appeal, 
declaring in a radio interview: "It is not the task just of this administration 
but also of the incoming administration to continue, deepen and intensify" the 
Colosio investigation.

 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who had chosen Colosio as his successor 
in the tradition of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, canceled most 
of his public appearances Friday. He visited the Mexico City funeral home where 
Riojas' body lay in state, offering condolences and praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This moment is very sad and painful for everyone," the president said, adding 
that Riojas "left us a legacy of great determination to live, to fight against 
adversity, to always keep a positive spirit, to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The day before Riojas' death, Salinas, whose six-year term ends in two weeks, 
toured two Mexican states dedicating memorial projects in her husband's name. 
</P>
<P>
 He christened the Luis Donaldo Colosio Dam in the state of Sinaloa, "to put 
into cement a construction that will last for centuries and serve as a memory 
of Colosio." 
</P>
<P>
 And the president paid a final, official visit to Colosio's hometown of 
Magdalena de Kino, where "we come to reaffirm the memory and affection that 
forever we will carry in our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 During her seven months in Mexico's spotlight, Riojas became a symbol of far 
more than justice in her husband's slaying. A Sept. 11 column titled "The 
Women" in the daily newspaper La Jornada said she had left a permanent mark on 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drama of Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio has left a positive lesson that is 
strengthening Mexican society: the lesson of integrity," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diana Laura never bowed or yielded. . . . We are never going to be able to 
repay her for the lesson of courage and integrity that she has offered us."

NEWS ANALYSIS; NEW VIOLENCE COULD IGNITE CROATIAN TINDERBOX; BALKANS: SERBS ARE 
USING SEIZED LAND TO ATTACK BOSNIA. THEIR SUCCESS COULD COMPLETE DREAM OF A 
GREATER SERBIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a provocative move that could ignite an all-against-all bloodletting in the 
Balkans, rebel Serbs who seized one-third of Croatia three years ago are now 
using that occupied territory as the staging ground for air and artillery 
assaults on neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian Serbs, in league with Bosnian Serbs, have armed and mobilized a 
renegade Muslim refugee force in a chilling campaign to conquer Bosnia's Bihac 
pocket, which would uproot another 200,000 Muslims and make Greater Serbia a 
virtual fait accompli.  
</P>
<P>
 International aid agencies have condemned the Croatian Serbs' conscription of 
5,000 Muslim males from refugee camps in Serb-occupied Croatia, and 
peacekeeping officials warn that air attacks launched Friday and the 
involvement of those highly manipulated Bosnian refugees could spur the 
Croatian government army to move in. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagreb officials fear that the fall of Bihac, in northwestern Bosnia, would 
unleash another destabilizing flood of refugees into this war-impoverished 
country, so they have been arming for a deadly rematch with the rebel Serbs who 
are now creating international havoc from within the occupied Krajina region. 
</P>
<P>
 Cautioned by Washington and Western Europe to hold fire in an offensive that 
could easily flare into a conflagration, Zagreb has appealed to the U.N. 
Protection Force to avert this predictable disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 But Croatian nationalists who have been itching for such a pretext to strike 
back at the Krajina Serbs and recover their territory appear to be counting on 
the United Nations to retreat behind its mission's toothless mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Defense Minister Gojko Susak, an ardent nationalist, warned at the 
onset of the Krajina Serb encroachment on Bosnia that his army would "respond" 
unless the provocations ceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mate Granic, the moderate foreign minister, hinted at a military reaction 
in a letter to the U.N. Security Council earlier this month that made clear 
that the Croatian government would "under no circumstances be able to cope" 
with the consequences of a vanquished Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Krajina Serbs are courting having their fate decided by a military 
solution, instead of a diplomatic one," a senior Western diplomat warned as 
rebel Serb attacks intensified against Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Western mediators trying to re-integrate Krajina Serbs into the rest of 
Croatia claimed a small breakthrough on several economic issues this last week. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebel Serbs' sincerity was called into question by their firing of 
SA-2 missiles into the Bihac pocket, even as their negotiators were saying at 
the long-stalled peace talks that they could be flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, only two days after the purported diplomatic advance, Krajina Serbs 
launched a second aerial bombardment of Bihac in little more than a week, 
prompting a fresh threat of air strikes from the U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The bombing sorties have been conducted from the Udbina air base in Serb-held 
Croatia, about 18 miles southwest of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about this spinning out of control," Madeleine Albright, 
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said of the Croatian Serb actions after 
a Security Council meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorvald Stoltenberg, the former Norwegian foreign minister now serving as 
chief U.N. negotiator for the Balkan crisis, said he and other mediators made 
an issue of the rebel attacks on Bihac during the latest talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs denied that they had sent in forces (to Bosnia) and said they had 
not been attacking from their areas," Stoltenberg said, adding that the U.N. 
mission and the diplomatic community had significant evidence to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajina rebels a week earlier launched an air attack against Bihac with 
warplanes that took off from an airfield near the rebel Serb stronghold of Knin 
in southern Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the gravest concern to the U.N. Protection Force and foreign aid agencies 
trying to assist the war's millions of victims has been the conscription of the 
Muslim followers of defeated warlord Fikret Abdic. 
</P>
<P>
 A black-market kingpin with a criminal past, Abdic has been inciting 
insurgency against the Bosnian government through a radio station he operates 
from his haven in Croatian Serb territory. He has also persuaded the 30,000 
Muslims who followed him when he fled Bihac in August that they will be 
slaughtered if they take up a U.N.-backed Bosnian government offer of amnesty 
for having taken up arms against their country's military. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with his Krajina Serb collaborators, Abdic has rearmed 5,000 
fighting-age males from among his followers for another try at conquering the 
Bihac pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear breach of international law," protested Robyn Thompson, 
spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, referring to the 
mobilization of refugees for armed combat. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which 
had been feeding and sheltering the Abdic followers at two camps in Serb-held 
territory, condemned the mobilization as "utterly abhorrent to the whole idea 
of what refuge is about." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the rebel Serbs have been staging the Bihac attacks from occupied 
territory in Croatia, Bosnian government officials have appealed to the 
nominally allied Croats to intervene militarily to "take all necessary steps" 
to eradicate the insurgency nests. 
</P>
<P>
 Granic warned the Security Council that Croatia was finding it "extremely 
difficult" to fend off the Bosnian appeals for help and to continue counting on 
the powerless U.N. peacekeeping force to resolve the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, there is the danger that the military conflict in the Bihac area 
could spill over into Croatian territory," U.N. mission spokesman Michael 
Williams said of the risk of Croatian army action. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams said the U.N. peacekeepers were powerless to do more than express 
their concern over the recent attacks on Bihac because the mission has no 
mandate to prevent hostile actions from Croatian territory and the NATO "no 
fly" zone only extends to Bosnia, not Serb-held areas of this country. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Serbs succeed in taking most of the Bihac pocket, leaving some token 
fiefdom for Abdic and his pliant followers -- Western diplomats describe them 
as "brainwashed" -- the Balkan Serbs will have effectively united all of the 
territory they have conquered in Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 That solid expanse of heavily armed Serbian territory would make it impossible 
for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to refuse annexation into a Greater 
Serbia and would likely deal political and military setbacks of such 
proportions to both Bosnia and Croatia that moderates in their governments 
would be defeated and more radically nationalist elements would seize power. 
</P>
<P>
 With continued attacks on Bihac, analysts see a serious risk of Croats 
resuming their war with Serbs in Croatia, Muslims and Croats fighting Serbs 
throughout Bosnia, Muslims fighting Muslims in the Bihac pocket, and the 
hardships and disruptions of war eventually wearing down the fragile 
Muslim-Croat alliance and returning those recently reconciled communities to a 
new phase of war. 
</P>
<P>
 In the increasingly likely scenario of a rekindled clash in Croatia, the 
stakes this time are exponentially higher than when Serbs and Croats wrestled 
over the wreckage of the former Yugoslav federation in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian army, despite a U.N. weapons embargo against all former Yugoslav 
republics, has been on an arms acquisition binge since agreeing three years ago 
to a cease-fire and the 14,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 With its growing arsenal of MIG jet fighters, French-made Leopard tanks and 
sophisticated missile systems, the Croats now equal or exceed the killing 
capacity of the Serbian rebels who had a huge arms advantage in the 1991 war by 
virtue of having been supplied by the Yugoslav People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
 All that restrains Croatia from a counterattack on Krajina is the whispered 
warning from supportive Western governments that a resort to violence could 
lead to its exclusion from the alliances and international financial circles 
vital to economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But sage advice and longer-term interests are receding from Zagreb's view with 
each advance by Krajina rebels, their Bosnian Serb brothers and the Abdic 
conscripts toward the vulnerable Bihac pocket and the goal of creating a 
Greater Serbia the world would have no choice but to live with.

 A tiny sliver of highly radioactive metal poisoned the atmosphere in the

people to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no clear explanation how the sliver found its way into the home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was discovered after members of the family became sick. Authorities said 
the victims were exposed over a period of weeks to the lump of radioactive 
metal, cesium-137. Cesium is used in cancer research and radiation therapy.

QUEBEC DROPS DAM PLANS; INDIANS HAD FOUGHT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TURNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Quebec government suspended plans Friday for a controversial dam on the 
Great Whale River in northern Quebec, a project that has been the focus of 
international environmental protests led by the Cree Indians who live along the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing a conference here of the American Council for Quebec Studies, a 
U.S. academic group, provincial Tourism Minister Rita Dionne-Marsolais said the 
Great Whale project is "no longer a priority" for the Quebec government. She 
said the decision to shelve the project was based mainly on economics, and she 
did not rule out its revival. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was also made in Quebec City by provincial Premier Jacques 
Parizeau. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Matthew Coon Comb, grand chief of the Cree of Quebec and 
the dam's leading critic, appeared at the meeting and attacked the 
$9.75-billion project. 
</P>
<P>
 Coon Comb has received several major environmental preservation awards for his 
campaign against the dam, which would flood thousands of acres of the Cree's 
traditional hunting and trapping grounds along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay 
and inland. In 1992, the Cree persuaded the New York Power Authority to cancel 
a contract with Quebec for electricity.  
</P>
<P>
 The future of the dam was already in question because of extensive new 
environmental reviews. Dionne-Marsolais said it has not been decided whether to 
go ahead with those studies. The most immediate impact of Friday's announcement 
may be on the campaign for Quebec independence. Native communities in the 
province, which generally support continued union with Canada, have emerged as 
among the most effective opponents of independence in the forums of 
international opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 By seeking to remove the Great Whale dam as an issue, the Parizeau government 
appears to be trying to nullify a rallying point for international opposition 
to Quebec separatism. Parizeau was elected Sept. 12 on a platform of 
independence for the predominantly French-speaking province.

SERB JETS RAID 'SAFE AREA' IN BOSNIA; REBELS USE NAPALM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jets apparently flying from a Serb-held base in Croatia raided a "safe area" 
of northwest Bosnia on Friday in defiance of U.N. warnings. The United Nations 
said napalm was used. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in the Bosnian capital, Serbs besieging Sarajevo killed a 7-year-old 
boy with sniper fire and launched two more antitank missiles, one of which 
carried handwritten warnings of further attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. reports of an air attack on the government-held town of Bihac in 
northwest Bosnia were the first confirmation of napalm use in the 2 1/2-year 
war. There have been past allegations of such antipersonnel weapons being used, 
but none confirmed by the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. spokesman Paul Risley in Zagreb, Croatia, said U.N. military observers in 
Bihac saw two planes fly low over the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "After they arrived, two loud explosions were heard," Risley said. Another 
team of observers reported seeing one missile being launched, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Risley said U.N. monitors "found fragments of napalm and cluster bombs. This 
is evidence that napalm and cluster bombs were used in the air attack." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Maj. Koos Sol, another U.N. spokesman, said two cluster bombs and a 
napalm bomb hit the center of Bihac, but the napalm bomb didn't explode. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sarajevo, Serbs fired two wire-guided missiles Friday, and one hit the 
temporary Parliament of a federation of Bosnian Croats and the Sarajevo 
government. A woman was wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Missile fragments, shown to reporters by U.N. officials, carried a handwritten 
message in the Cyrillic alphabet used by Serbs: "Many hot greetings. HOT. This 
is the beginning."

ANOTHER SERIAL KILLER PLAGUES RUSSIAN CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight months after the execution of a resident who murdered 52 people, 
authorities in this southern Russian city are searching once again for a serial 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the culprit has already slain eight women in two rural 
districts of the Rostov region, the Itar-Tass news agency reported on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that more than one killer is at 
work, said Col. Vasily Kolesnik, the region's chief criminal investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The city won notoriety as home of the so-called "Rostov Ripper," a former 
teacher and Communist Party member who terrorized the region for 12 years 
before he was arrested in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrei Chikatilo was convicted of murdering, mutilating and cannibalizing 21 
boys, 14 girls and 17 older women. Chikatilo was executed in Rostov-on-Don in 
February.

JUDGE ALLOWS KEVORKIAN TO EXPLAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge on Friday granted Jack Kevorkian one month to explain 
why he failed to attend numerous administrative law hearings leading to the 
revocation of his California medical license. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, 66, dubbed "Dr. Death" for having assisted in 21 suicides, 
including that of a Costa Mesa real estate agent, filed suit against the 
Medical Board of California after it voted in July to revoke the license. 
</P>
<P>
 Awarded the license in 1957, Kevorkian worked as a pathologist at two 
hospitals in Long Beach from 1979 to 1982. Michigan -- the only other state to 
have given him a medical license -- has suspended Kevorkian's right to practice 
medicine in his home state, where each of the suicides has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 A Michigan court overturned a state law designed to stop Kevorkian's practice 
of assisted suicide. That court then ordered murder charges reinstated against 
Kevorkian. The Michigan Supreme Court has agreed to review the entire matter, 
with a ruling expected next month. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's hearing in Kevorkian's lawsuit, the Medical Board of California 
argued that he had the ability to protest the suspension and revocation of his 
medical license but failed to appear or send a representative to numerous 
hearings in San Diego before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court judge agreed to rule in the matter, pending an explanation 
of why Kevorkian "failed to exhaust administrative remedies."

CHINA BEGINS COUNTING 'FLOATING POPULATION'; ASIA: ECONOMIC OPENING HAS CREATED 
LARGE NUMBER OF INTERNAL MIGRANTS. GOVERNMENT FEARS CHAOS IF GROUP BECOMES 
DETACHED FROM NATIONAL ORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Teams of government officials and neighborhood-watch committees fanned out 
into the narrow-laned traditional hutongs and burgeoning workers' suburbs of 
the Chinese capital this week as part of a historic census of migrant labor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 10, the first day of the census, all bus stations, train stations and 
airports were sealed while police checked the identity papers of travelers, 
arriving and departing. This week, they began a citywide, house-by-house survey 
interviewing residents and lodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose, officials said, is to find out just how many Beijing residents 
are part of the huge "floating population" that has surfaced in China since 
economic liberalization began more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beijing alone, the number of migrants from all parts of China is estimated 
to be more than 1.6 million. Nationally, the number of migrants is believed to 
exceed 80 million, more than the population of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Through official newspapers and special television programs, the government 
has reassured migrants that the census data will not be used to punish them or 
evict them for living in the city without work permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please cooperate," Zou Lanchun, deputy commissioner of the Beijing 
Statistical Bureau, appealed in a television appearance. "Don't worry about 
being charged or expelled." 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the government effort, however, is a widespread fear of what might 
go wrong if this huge mobile population becomes untethered from the national 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 The transient population is relatively new, at least in the Communist era of 
Chinese history. Before 1978, when economic reform was launched by senior 
leader Deng Xiaoping, citizens could not buy tickets for transportation without 
written permission, and they could not work without permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a desperate attempt to get a grip on the floating population," 
commented journalist Liu Yida, who has written extensively on the migrant 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Migrants are blamed by Beijing residents for much of the crime in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 When a sensational case comes along, such as the murder of the wife of 
television star Zhou Lijun earlier this year, it fans the flames of an already 
considerable prejudice against the wai di ren , or "outsiders." According to 
the Beijing Wanbao newspaper, one of several in the city that gives extensive 
coverage to crime, the woman was killed by a migrant repairman from Hebei 
province when she surprised him attempting to rob the couple's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the migrant census has been widely welcomed by the native Beijing 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good idea to identify all these outsiders," commented one man, the 
owner of a small shop selling denim jeans and jackets in the Xiaozhuang 
neighborhood in northeastern Beijing. Across the street, migrants from other 
provinces had set up sidewalk stands selling many of the same clothing featured 
in his shop for much less. In one half-block stretch of the street market were 
migrants from four provinces: Henan, Hubei, Shandong and Anhui. 
</P>
<P>
 "I buy my jeans for 40 yuan (about $5) and sell them for 90," the shop owner 
said. "That's the Beijing way to do business. But those people from Anhui, they 
will buy the same thing for 40 yuan and sell it for 45." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to prevent the census from turning into a witch hunt, government 
television and newspapers have attempted to present the migrants in their most 
positive light, as hard-working people who do jobs that no one else will do. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening Beijing television program "City Government-City People," 
citizens testified to the value of the migrant work force as preparers of 
breakfast snacks in local shops, vegetable vendors and shoe repairers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outsiders are good at making the Beijing economy active," said one in a 
glowing tribute. "In Beijing, no one else but the outsiders repairs our shoes. 
We have nowhere else to get them fixed."  
</P>
<P>
 Already blamed for much of the urban crime in China, the floating population 
-- translated literally from Chinese as "blind flow" -- is also seen as a 
potentially volatile political force. Chinese officials got a sobering taste of 
that possibility two years ago when Muslim migrants from distant Xinjiang 
region, living in the capital, threatened police with riots after one of their 
population was murdered with a watermelon knife by a Beijing shopkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those being counted this week in Beijing were six young carpenters from 
rural Jiangsu province; they were living in two small rooms in the northeastern 
Beijing migrant neighborhood known as Six Li Village. 
</P>
<P>
 By working on construction projects and doing free-lance carpentry, the men 
said they were able to send about $1 a day home to their families, after their 
living expenses were subtracted. When construction work is slow, the men go to 
the local market where they sit on the curb with a handwritten sign: "I am a 
carpenter." 
</P>
<P>
 Migrants complain that they are often persecuted by Beijing natives. One 
worker, interviewed on local television, said that bus conductors often refuse 
to let migrant workers aboard if they are carrying heavy packs of tools and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But mixed with the resentment is a feeling of pride that a modern city is 
being built with their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we have made some contribution to building our capital," said one 
hard-hat migrant worker on one of Beijing's many construction sites.

SINGAPORE PLANS TO CHARGE WRITER OVER ARTICLE; ASIA: PROFESSOR WROTE THAT 
REGION'S REGIMES REPRESSED DISSENT. ACTION ALSO PLANNED AGAINST U.S.-OWNED 
NEWSPAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Singaporean government announced Friday that it is bringing contempt of 
court charges against an American academic and a U.S.-owned newspaper for 
publishing an opinion article critical of the human rights records of Asian 
regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement released by the attorney general's office said the High Court had 
granted the government permission to seek contempt of court charges against the 
academic, Christopher Lingle, and the newspaper, the International Herald 
Tribune, as well as the newspaper's Singapore correspondent, its publisher and 
its printer in Singapore. A hearing on the case was set for Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Herald Tribune is jointly owned by the New York Times and 
the Washington Post. Its headquarters is in Paris, and it prints editions in a 
number of cities around the world. The Singapore printer charged is the owner 
of the Straits Times, the government-controlled newspaper here. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said the contempt of court action was for the publication on 
Oct. 7 of an editorial page article written by Lingle, who was a senior fellow 
at the National University of Singapore, that contained "a statement concerning 
the Singapore judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
 Contempt of court is a quasi-criminal charge and can result in a fine or 
imprisonment. The defendants were ordered to show cause why they should not be 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Lingle's article alleged that regimes in the region, which he did not name, 
used "considerable ingenuity in the methods of suppressing dissent." He said 
some regimes rely on a "compliant judiciary" to bankrupt opposition 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Singaporean authorities maintain that the reference was an innuendo that 
could only apply to Singapore. While a number of opposition politicians have 
been bankrupted by defamation suits, government officials maintain that they 
won the cases on their merits and not because the judiciary was compliant. 
</P>
<P>
 After the publication of the article, Lingle was questioned by the police at 
his office at the university. He subsequently left Singapore on an emergency 
leave and has not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone in Atlanta on Friday, Lingle said he would not return to 
Singapore to face the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to be a citizen of a country that holds freedom of the press to be 
sacred," Lingle said. "Freedom of the press is a necessary vehicle for citizens 
to challenge their government without fear of arrest or punishment for 
expressing their opinions." 
</P>
<P>
 The case attracted considerable attention in the United States after the State 
Department issued a statement expressing "disappointment at this apparent 
attempt by Singaporean authorities to intimidate Professor Lingle." 
</P>
<P>
 It followed an international uproar over Singapore's flogging of American 
teen-ager Michael Fay in May on vandalism charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong defended the toughness of the 
response in the Lingle case, saying the government is "thin-skinned" when it 
came to remarks about its honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody impugns the government's integrity, and it amounts to defamation, 
the government will take action," Goh said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Singaporean authorities have sought to restrict the 
circulation of a number of foreign publications that carried articles 
displeasing to the government, including the Hong Kong magazine Far Eastern 
Economic Review, the Asian Wall Street Journal and the British magazine The 
Economist. 
</P>
<P>
 For foreign publications circulating in Singapore, the government demands a 
"right of reply" in which newspapers and magazines must print government 
letters responding to articles about Singapore or face restrictions on their 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the International Herald Tribune printed a public apology 
to Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore who now holds the title 
senior minister, for another opinion page article that suggested "dynastic" 
politics were at work in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee filed a defamation suit against the Asian Wall Street Journal in 1989 
after the newspaper printed remarks about a High Court judgment awarding Lee 
$230,000 damages in compensation. The newspaper apologized.

IRAN GIVES DIVORCED WOMEN PROPERTY RIGHT

<P>
 A new Iranian law gives some women being divorced by their husbands the right 
to up to half the property accumulated during their married life, Iran's top 
judge said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the law is limited in scope, and the actual awards are to be decided by 
a court, the measure could prove a significant advance for women in the face of 
Islamic family laws that give most rights to men. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the chief of the judiciary, said the law was 
designed to protect women whose husbands wanted to leave them for younger 
wives.

FINNISH PARLIAMENT OKS MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPEAN UNION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Finnish lawmakers endorsed membership in the European Union on Friday, paving 
the way for the country to join the political and trade bloc next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a filibuster that delayed the vote by several weeks, the EU bill 
passed, 152-45. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved," Prime Minister Esko Aho said. "The long, arduous task, at 
least on Finland's part, is now over." 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-EU lawmakers, mainly from Aho's Center party, delayed the vote until 
after Sweden's referendum last Sunday, hoping a Swedish "no" would help block 
ratification in Finland. But Swedish voters passed the referendum with 52% in 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 57% of 4 million Finnish voters approved EU membership in a 
referendum. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegians will vote Nov. 28 on whether they want to join. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Nordic nations and Austria, which has already approved joining, the 
union would grow to 16 members encompassing 375 million people.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS CALL GOP AGENDA EXTREMIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breaking more than a week of silence, House Democratic leaders emerged from 
their post-election trenches Friday to denounce the new GOP congressional 
agenda as "extremist" and to vow that they will use all the legislative 
maneuvers at their disposal to keep the country from reverting to the 
supply-side economics of the Ronald Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking out for the first time since the election, House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said that while Democrats hope to cooperate with 
Republicans in the new Congress, they plan to use every tool at their disposal 
to delay, "defeat or turn back ill-advised, wrong-headed and damaging" GOP 
economic proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to the principles that are the heart of the Democratic Party 
and the heart of the American working people, we will never yield and we will 
never concede," Gephardt declared, sounding a position of defiance that could 
herald a new kind of gridlock next year, if Democrats adopt the obstructionist 
tactics that Republicans employed in the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt, a liberal who faces a challenge from a more conservative Southern 
Democrat for the post of minority leader next year, pledged that Democrats will 
seek to keep the Republicans from dismantling programs for the poor, enacting 
tax cuts for the wealthy and passing other supply-side economic reforms that 
were tried in the 1980s and which he said resulted in "a $300-billion deficit 
as far as the eye can see." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the Democrats will do that, Gephardt acknowledged that they will not 
have the votes to stop what is expected to be a juggernaut of GOP reforms when 
Congress convenes in January, with the Republicans promising to bring to a vote 
all 10 points of their "contract with America" campaign pledge within the first 
100 days of the new session. 
</P>
<P>
 But where they cannot block or modify legislation through coalitions with 
moderate Republicans, the Democrats may fall back on parliamentary delaying 
tactics and "whatever else we can think up" under the new open rules that the 
Republicans have promised will apply to floor debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although, Gephardt said, Democrats do not want to exploit their minority 
status "to create gridlock," he vowed that they also will not "capitulate on 
things we think are important." 
</P>
<P>
 The combative stance outlined by Gephardt and several other Democrats at a 
Capitol Hill news conference was the first indication from a senior Democratic 
leader of what the party's strategy will be in the new Congress, where 
Democrats will constitute a significantly larger minority than Republicans do 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few House races were so close that the outcomes have still not been 
officially decided, the Republicans are expected to hold a roughly 30-seat 
advantage in the 435-member House. In the Senate, they will control 53 seats to 
47 for the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt's defiant return to the bruising political arena of C-SPAN and the 
swirl of Capitol Hill press conferences -- dominated for the last week by 
incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and other jubilant Republicans 
-- also signaled an end to a post-election Democratic silence that had alarmed 
the White House, which has appeared increasingly isolated since the Democratic 
defeat at the polls Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gephardt and the other leaders have been under pressure to get back here and 
start responding to Gingrich because it appears that we've just rolled over, 
given up and left Clinton out to dry," a Democratic source said, adding that 
"post-election shock" largely accounted for his party's silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Majority Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.), who was the first to speak out 
Thursday, joined Gephardt in the latest attack, saying that GOP promises to 
force votes on balanced-budget and term-limit amendments to the Constitution 
within the first 100 days of the new Congress amount to an "outrageous raid on 
the work of our forefathers" who did "a pretty good job of writing . . . a 
document that has stood us in good stead for more than 200 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to pass all their major ideas in 100 days "exposes the extremist 
position in the Republican Conference with respect to their contract," Bonior 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the initial Democratic fire, however, was being aimed at the 
contract's tax cuts and defense spending increases, which the Democrats sought 
to characterize as a return to the failed experiment with supply-side economics 
undertaken during Reagan's first term. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us in 1981 that this theory of supply-side economics, of tax breaks 
for the wealthy and increased defense spending, would result in a balanced 
budget," Gephardt said, adding that the nation learned the hard way "that it 
didn't work." Now, he added, "history is repeating itself as . . . the same 
people who created this mess in the first place are ready to do it all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting the criticism, Tony Blankley, a spokesman for Gingrich, suggested 
that the Democrats seem to have already forgotten that "it was not just the 
rich who voted them out of office last week." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Gephardt's threat to delay GOP legislation on the floor, 
Blankley added that, while Republicans were accused of gridlock for employing 
similar tactics in the past, the strategy could backfire on Democrats if they 
block Republican initiatives that are popular with voters. Doing so, he said, 
"may not be the best way for them to rebuild their party back to the majority."

BENTSEN SIGNALS POSSIBLE WHITE HOUSE TAX PLAN; BUDGET: TREASURY SECRETARY'S 
COMMENTS ARE THE STRONGEST INDICATION THE ADMINISTRATION MAY PROPOSE A 
MIDDLE-CLASS CUT. GOP WELCOMES REMARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, sending the strongest signal yet of White 
House plans to propose tax relief next year, said Friday a middle-class tax cut 
is desirable so long as it doesn't worsen the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree on the desirability of a tax cut for middle-income Americans, but 
something of that nature must be properly paid for," said Bentsen, the Clinton 
Administration's chief spokesman on economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the sweeping victory by Republicans in last week's elections, the 
Administration has been scrambling to revise its still-developing budget 
proposal and come up with other ways to deal with a Congress that will be in 
Republican hands for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen's comments -- to a group of U.S. and European legislators called the 
North Atlantic Assembly -- were the Administration's strongest indication that 
a middle-class tax cut is a top option as President Clinton begins in coming 
weeks to make final decisions on the Administration's 1996 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dick Armey (R-Tex.), the incoming House majority leader, said: "I welcome 
the Clinton Administration's belated support for our 1994 Republican budget 
initiative. The average American family today pays more in taxes than food, 
shelter and clothing combined, and we look forward to working with the White 
House to remedy that." 
</P>
<P>
 During his 1992 election campaign, Clinton promised tax relief for the middle 
class. But he abandoned the pledge after saying federal deficits looked worse 
than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said any tax relief offered by the Administration would be offset 
either by spending cuts or higher taxes elsewhere to ensure that the budget 
deficit does not grow larger and crowd out private demands for capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one wants higher interest rates and slow growth if it's the price for a 
slightly smaller tax burden," Bentsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he did not specifically say what type of tax relief the Administration 
was considering, private economists said they viewed Bentsen's comments as an 
Administration signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is significant," said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co., a 
New York City government securities dealer. But he added that if a bidding war 
develops between the Administration and Republicans over the size of a tax cut, 
it could threaten financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Chimerine of the Economic Strategy Institute, a think tank, said the 
Administration could be caving in on taxes. Bentsen "is sort of capitulating 
already to the Republican strategy," he said. "The Administration is saying if 
there are spending cuts, the first priority is to pay for tax cuts rather than 
cut the deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Clinton budget chief Alice Rivlin said proposed GOP tax cuts could 
drive the deficits skyward and shove the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivlin, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said it would be 
irresponsible to cut taxes without paying for them with offsetting spending 
cuts. "If we had a big tax cut right now and people were spending more, the 
inflation danger would be much more real than it is now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While sounding a similar theme, Bentsen was more conciliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen, who served 22 years in the Senate, said: "I learned in my years as 
chairman of the Finance Committee, and as a minority member, that cooperation 
takes you a great deal farther than does confrontation."

GINGRICH IS GOING ALONG ON NATIONAL REVIEW CRUISE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The two top leaders of the incoming Republican House majority are spending the 
weekend on an expense-paid Caribbean cruise with National Review subscribers 
discussing political affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, in line to become Speaker in the 
Republican-controlled House in January, said his expenses were being paid by 
the National Review and quipped: "I promised I'd be conservative."The ship was 
scheduled to leave Miami on Friday and return on Monday, with a stop in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, in line to become House majority leader, was also 
planning on attending, as was Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, a candidate for 
the No. 2 job in the Senate GOP leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Capano, publisher of the conservative magazine, said the cruise was 
advertised in the publication, and about 100 cabins had been sold at prices 
ranging from $895 to $1,095, including air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Blankley, Gingrich's spokesman, said his boss and the other political 
leaders "will discuss political affairs with people on the boat."

PROMOTE DNA TECHNOLOGY, PANEL IS URGED; LAW: NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES IS 
TOLD THAT ITS 1992 REPORT PAVED THE WAY FOR LEGAL ATTACKS ON TEST RESULTS. MORE 
POSITIVE SUPPORT IS RECOMMENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A National Academy of Sciences panel was urged Friday to stress the positive 
aspects of DNA technology in its next report, on grounds that the academy's 
1992 study gave criminal defense lawyers unjustified reason to attack DNA test 
results in court. 
</P>
<P>
 At the first of a series of hearings to be conducted by the panel, authorities 
who deal in physical evidence -- including an FBI laboratory official -- said 
that the scientific community is in general agreement on the validity of DNA 
testing, even though some judges and defense attorneys have adopted what DNA 
advocates described as an exaggerated view of its shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Inman, head of the California Assn. of Criminalists in Oakland, told the 
panel that the academy's 1992 report -- which raised concerns about DNA testing 
-- has assisted defense lawyers, perhaps unintentionally. Inman said scientific 
disputes "are perceived by the courts as a lack of consensus," causing judges 
to mistrust all scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 Through use of so-called DNA fingerprinting, or DNA typing, it is possible to 
match an individual with biological evidence -- such as blood, skin, hair or 
semen -- gathered at a crime scene. The technique is based on the fact that the 
genetic pattern carried in a molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, in 
every cell is unique for each person, except identical twins. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the methods used to distinguish one person's DNA from all others are 
not yet as fully developed as other means, such as fingerprint analysis.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the concept is accepted, defense attorneys often challenge DNA 
results on the basis of flawed testing procedures and the fact that the testing 
is not precise enough to pinpoint a particular defendant. If properly done, the 
testing will give a probable identification in terms of 1 in 10,000, for 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report two years ago, the academy's scientists supported the 
controversial technique but called for higher standards for laboratories and 
personnel performing the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman said he hoped the academy would endorse DNA technology as providing 
"accurate, reliable and meaningful information."  
</P>
<P>
 The academy's Committee on DNA Forensic Science, which is planning to issue an 
updated report on DNA technology by next summer or fall, did not indicate which 
way it is leaning. The subject, of increasing interest to the legal community 
as well as to scientists and criminologists, is expected to be highlighted by 
upcoming testimony in the O.J. Simpson trial -- where the DNA testing of blood 
samples found at the crime scene has been called into question by the defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Frederick Millar, an expert with the California attorney general's office, 
told the panel Friday that the problem for prosecutors in murder and rape cases 
is that "courts need scientific conclusions -- not just information, but clear 
and unambiguous conclusions." For this reason, the legal admissibility of DNA 
evidence still remains unsettled in California and some other states, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a similar point, Ivan Balazs, who runs a private testing facility in 
Connecticut, said the panel might want to emphasize that DNA technology can 
provide "strong circumstantial evidence pointing in a certain direction" 
without getting involved in a statistical morass over probabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would prefer a simple statement to arguing about whether the probability in 
a certain case is 1 in 1 million or 1 in 1 trillion," Balazs said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an oblique reference to defense attorneys, Harold Deadman, a leading FBI 
expert in DNA testing, said the panel should remember that "not everyone in the 
legal system wants to resolve these issues. There are always those who will 
testify against DNA results." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Coleman, president of a Seattle laboratory, complained that the 1992 
study "became the Bible for attacking DNA." Robin Cotton, another private 
laboratory official, drew laughter in agreeing that "information is handled far 
differently in the courtroom than at a scientific meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the testimony Friday was from DNA advocates, but another hearing is 
planned next spring. An official of the National Assn. of Criminal Defense 
Lawyers said it wants to present its views then. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Levine, representing the association, told a reporter that he hoped the 
panel would not back away from its 1992 view calling for independent 
certification of private laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers group believes the Department of Health and Human 
Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health and other scientific 
units, should be in charge of this certification rather than the FBI, as called 
for in this year's anti-crime bill, Levine said.

HELMS SAYS CLINTON IS NOT AN ABLE LEADER OF MILITARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The soon-to-be chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said Friday 
he doesn't believe President Clinton is a capable commander in chief of the 
nation's armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) also said in an interview for CNN's "Evans and 
Novak" program to be broadcast today that he will try as soon as the new 
Congress convenes in January to get all U.S. troops recalled home from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ought never to have been sent in there in the first place," Helms said. 
"I think it's disgraceful that we have U.S. troops collecting garbage in 
Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging interview, Helms, 73, said he also would oppose Senate 
ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty and the Biodiversity Treaty and that 
he would like to abolish the U.S. Agency for International Development, which 
hands out most foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we ought to replace it with something that does not willy-nilly give 
away United States taxpayer money to foreign governments who are opposed to us, 
or at least opposed to civil rights and all the rest of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Helms said he opposes an option reportedly under consideration by the 
Administration to provide up to $5 billion in military aid for Bosnia's 
Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's give compassionate aid where we can to help children . . . and that 
sort of thing," he said. "But . . . sooner or later we're going to get down to 
common sense and realize that we can't solve disputes with money and the blood 
of our people by interfering with things that have been going on for thousands 
of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked specifically if he thought Clinton was up to the job as commander in 
chief, Helms said: "No, I do not, and neither do the people in the armed 
forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to name any generals or admirals who hold that view, Helms said there 
are some, but he would not name them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Helms said he thinks he will work well with Clinton's secretary of state, 
Warren Christopher, calling him "a decent man." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think there'll be more agreement than you might imagine between Warren 
Christopher and me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms said he also would support a constitutional amendment to allow prayer in 
public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this falderal about who will be offended and all the rest of it is just 
too much for me," he said.

COURT UPHOLDS LAW RESTRICTING 'GREEN' LABELING; BUSINESS: APPEALS JUDGES SAY 
THE MEASURE PROPERLY CURBS ENVIRONMENTAL MARKETING CLAIMS, REJECTING CHARGES 
THAT IT LIMITS COMPANIES' 1ST AMENDMENT RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a setback for several large business associations, a federal appeals court 
in San Francisco on Friday upheld a California law regulating claims that 
manufacturers or distributors can make about the environmental friendliness of 
their products. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the statute properly advances 
the state's interest in curbing the potential for abuse raised by the 
increasing popularity of "green marketing," which touts a product's 
environmental purity. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate judges rejected the claims of 10 groups -- including the Assn. 
of National Advertisers, the Soap and Detergent Assn., the Society of the 
Plastics Industry and the California Chamber of Commerce -- that the law 
unconstitutionally infringed on their 1st Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled that the messages regulated by the statute constitute 
commercial speech and are thus subject to restrictions that could not be placed 
on other types of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges held that the law restricts potentially misleading speech. They 
said the statute also gives consumers information permitting them to make 
rational product comparisons and balance price and environmental factors, and 
helps the state's environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statute increases consumer knowledge and awareness and discourages 
exploitation and deception of the growing 'green market,' " Judge Herbert Y.C. 
Choy wrote in the 3-0 decision. Judges John T. Noonan and Alfredo C. Marquez 
joined in the opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 law, the first of its kind in the nation, set standards for several 
terms that were being used increasingly in product advertising: "ozone 
friendly," "biodegradable," "photodegradable," "recyclable" and "recycled." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, "ozone friendly" means that "any chemical or material released 
into the environment as a result of the use or production of a product will not 
migrate to the stratosphere and cause unnatural and accelerated deterioration 
of the ozone," according to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In urging passage of the law, then California Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp 
said environmental claims being made on behalf of products were "similar to the 
'health' claims made for elixirs in the Old West. There was no scientific or 
medical basis for the claims, but there was also no basis for disproving them." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians Against Waste and the Environmental Defense Fund joined the case 
in support of upholding the law. Several states, including Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, Texas and Washington, filed briefs supporting the statute, as 
did the California Resource Assn., Natural Resources Defense Council and San 
Diego Recycling Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the statute was supported by the Washington Legal Foundation and 
several media organizations, including Capital Cities/ABC, Dow Jones & Co. and 
the National Assn. of Broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel of San Francisco upheld most of the law 
nearly two years ago. However, she struck down the definition of "recyclable," 
which said an article could be "conveniently recycled" in each of the state's 
21 most populous counties, a standard she found too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to amend that term since then have foundered in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court upheld every aspect of Patel's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "In setting rather modest minimum targets for the recycling content and 
decomposition periods of consumer products, the statute creates an incentive 
for manufacturers of non-complying products to enhance the environmental 
attributes of their goods in order to capture the benefits of green labeling," 
the judges wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This incentive directly furthers California's substantial interest in 
promoting resource conservation, and reducing the burden on its brimming 
landfills. If producers of ecologically substandard products achieve the 
statute's minimum thresholds, these improvements translate directly into less 
waste being dumped," the judges added. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was hailed by Albert N. Shelden, deputy attorney general in the 
California Department of Justice's consumer protection unit. "We think a 
legislature has the right to adopt a statute which defines terms so that when 
those terms are used they will not be misleading or deceptive." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "We think the environmental goals the Legislature sought to foster 
by the statute are of utmost importance to the California public." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no prosecutions have been brought under the law because of the 
litigation, "we think there is less deceptive advertising going on than 
previously," Shelden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an unabashed victory because it affirms the rights of states to 
restrict the use of environmental marketing claims," said Lance King, community 
outreach director of Californians Against Waste, a nonprofit environmental 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Abrams, a constitutional lawyer who represented the opponents, said his 
clients "will certainly consider" appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. "We 
think the decision . . . restricts rather than expands the information that 
Californians and others may have about lawfully sold products, and as a result, 
it threatens well-established 1st Amendment interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams maintained that companies are prohibited from making even truthful 
assertions about their products simply because they do not adhere to the 
California definitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams and Shelden said the success of an appeal might depend on the outcome 
of a case pending in the Supreme Court, in which Coors is challenging a 1935 
statute that prohibits beer companies from putting alcohol content on their 
labels.

EX-SEN. CARPENTER EXTRADITED TO U.S.; CRIME: FIGHTING CANCER, FORMER LEGISLATOR 
LOSES FINAL LEGAL BATTLE TO AVOID BEING RETURNED FROM COSTA RICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and BRIAN HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After languishing for months in a Costa Rican jail, fugitive former state Sen. 
Paul Carpenter was on his way back to California and a possible sentence of up 
to nine years in prison Friday on political corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, who is suffering from advanced prostate cancer, lost the last legal 
skirmish in his battle to avoid extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic politician was taken in handcuffs from his hospital bed, driven 
to the airport and turned over to U.S. Consul General Ken Sackett. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by two U.S. deputy marshals from Florida, he boarded a flight for 
Miami, where he will spend the weekend in a local jail. On Monday, deputies 
from the U.S. marshal's office in Sacramento will take custody of the onetime 
legislator and state Board of Equalization member and escort him back to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Carpenter will be given a complete medical exam and will be 
brought before U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia for sentencing, perhaps as 
early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview at Costa Rica's largest public hospital, Carpenter said 
his cancer was spreading and he had only 15 months to live. He had asked 
authorities to delay his extradition so he could undergo surgery, but on 
Tuesday he lost his last appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport Friday, the 66-year-old politician was dressed in a pink and 
blue polo shirt and baggy blue jeans. It was clear that his health has been 
failing: Beneath a thick gray beard that he has grown since his arrest, his 
face had become gaunt, his skin ashen. He has lost considerable weight since he 
was apprehended by Costa Rican authorities and jailed pending extradition. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. Atty. Charles J. Stevens in Sacramento said that medical 
authorities in Costa Rica said Carpenter was fit to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 After his conviction in December on 11 counts of mail fraud, obstruction of 
justice and money laundering, Carpenter was released without bail. He 
disappeared before he could be sentenced in February, leaving a note to the 
judge that said: "I find my drive for survival stronger than my sense of 
obligation to your legal system." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials located him at a hotel in San Jose, traveling under the alias 
Paul Bruce -- using his middle name as his surname. But he left the hotel 
before the paperwork was completed to enable Costa Rican police to make an 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 He was finally tracked down and apprehended in April at a suburban condominium 
he shared with another U.S. expatriate, but until Friday he had managed to 
fight extradition through a series of legal maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials thought that the matter was settled more than a week ago 
and deputy marshals flew here Nov. 8 to transport him back. However, 
Carpenter's attorneys were able to delay his extradition one more time by 
filing additional appeals, claiming that he was a political prisoner and 
seeking a delay so that he could undergo surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Stevens has said he has no plans to pursue charges against 
Carpenter for unlawful flight.

UC REGENTS SEEK $145-MILLION BUDGET INCREASE FROM GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The University of California Board of Regents approved a preliminary budget 
Friday that seeks an increase of $145.4 million in state funding from Gov. Pete 
Wilson to stave off student fee increases and halt an exodus of experienced 
professors. 
</P>
<P>
 That amount is nearly four times the size of the $38-million budget increase 
granted the university system last year, its first funding increase in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said they hope that improvements in the state's economy 
will allow the governor and Legislature to approve the funding increase. Their 
budget is a recommendation to Wilson, who will release his budget proposal in 
January and indicate whether the regents' conditions can be met. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Provost Walter E. Massey characterized the regents' budget -- the first in 
four years that does not call for a student fee increase -- as one designed to 
stabilize the system and set the stage for competitive recruitment of faculty. 
It would bring the system's total funding to $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the state is able to fund our full need, we will be able to maintain 
student fees at their current level next year," Massey said. "If state funding 
falls short, we will have to continue looking to student fee increases as one 
way to help fund the budget. If so, we are committed to increasing financial 
aid as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Massey said one of the chief concerns in drafting next year's budget was to 
include enough money to recruit faculty members. The university system's 
teaching staff has been reduced significantly by early retirements over the 
last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed budget includes funds to hire 120 new faculty members and 
increase faculty salaries 5%, bringing them closer to the average paid by 
comparable institutions.  
</P>
<P>
 At the regents' October meeting, Massey also expressed concern that the best 
of the remaining faculty have become easy recruitment targets for other 
universities because of the lag in pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential that we make some progress toward full restoration of 
competitive salary levels," Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action during the two-day session, the board approved a $168-million 
capital budget. Almost all the projects were approved by the governor and 
Legislature last year, but lost funding when voters rejected a bond issue on 
the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The regents also appointed UC San Francisco faculty member and Nobel laureate 
J. Michael Bishop to a University Professorship, the highest honor the system 
bestows on a professor for outstanding scholarship and teaching. Bishop shared 
the 1989 Nobel Prize for medicine/physiology.

STORMY WEATHER LEADING TO PRICIER THANKSGIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vegetables for Thanksgiving dinner may be pricier and punier because of severe 
storm damage to Southern Florida farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, much of America's Thanksgiving dinner is under water," Florida 
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tropical Storm Gordon caused an estimated $200 million to $225 million in 
damage to vegetable crops in southern Florida, which supplies about half of the 
nation's winter produce. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state could lose up to $70 million of its sugar cane harvest, 
state officials said. About 100,000 acres of cane were damaged, but the full 
extent of the loss would not be known until after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 High winds shredded thousands of acres of leafy vegetable crops, such as 
lettuce and celery, and torrential rains washed away other crops, including 
squash, sweet corn, tomatoes, green beans, peppers, eggplants and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon zigzagged across Florida early in the week, reaching hurricane strength 
Thursday off North Carolina. It weakened into a tropical storm again Friday and 
turned back toward Florida, causing forecasters there to again keep a wary eye 
on its track. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Gilmer, spokesman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Growers Assn., said 
Gordon's timing was particularly bad because growers are just about to enter 
the peak period of their growing year. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the winter months, a lot of these vegetables are only grown here in 
Florida," Gilmer said. "That's why the timing of this storm was so critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmer said standing water was the biggest threat, as crops too wet to save 
would have to be replanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next few days will decide," Gilmer said. "When those fields dry out, 
you'll be able to tell if (the plants) can be saved or if there's been too much 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Only citrus growers escaped the storm relatively unscathed. Ken Kennedy, owner 
and president of United Indian River Packers Inc., said Gordon would cause 
brief delays in harvesting that shouldn't result in higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Decker, a spokeswoman for American Stores Inc. in Dublin, Calif., said 
the crop damage in Florida has created more demand for California produce and 
pushed prices higher there. 
</P>
<P>
 While some retailers said Friday they had no choice but to raise prices, 
several other companies said they'll stick to advertised specials and honor 
discounts on Thanksgiving menu favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to be able to maintain our pricing throughout the Thanksgiving 
holiday period," said Stan Sorkin, a vice president at Pathmark Stores Inc., 
which operates supermarkets in the mid-Atlantic states. "After Thanksgiving, we 
expect prices to rise on the commodities affected by the hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Bagoly, produce director for Food Gallery, a chain of four Pittsburgh, Pa., 
supermarkets, said he bought bell peppers for $10.50 a box last week, before 
the storm hit the Florida coast. He said suppliers are now asking $19 to $24 a 
box.

WAYWARD STORM FALTERS, HEADS BACK TOWARD FLORIDA; WEATHER: HURRICANE GORDON 
WEAKENS AFTER LASHING THE OUTER BANKS. A WARY EYE IS KEPT ON THE ATLANTIC'S 
MOST 'BIZARRE' CYCLONE IN 22 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hurricane Gordon, the Atlantic's "most bizarre storm" in 22 years, battered 
North Carolina's Outer Banks before it weakened into a tropical storm Friday 
and doubled back unexpectedly toward Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters in Florida kept a wary eye on Gordon, which left a trail of 
devastation as it took a zigzag course up from the Caribbean earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm -- which didn't reach the 74-m.p.h. hurricane threshold until 
Thursday, when it was off North Carolina -- was blamed for hundreds of deaths 
in Haiti, and six deaths and at least $200 million in vegetable crop damage in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not panicking or anything here, but we are taking it seriously," said 
Mike Rucker, a meteorologist with the Florida Division of Emergency Management. 
"If it does get as far south as the Bahamas, it gets into warm waters again and 
can rejuvenate." 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 p.m. EST Friday, Gordon had 60-m.p.h. winds and was about 275 miles east 
of Charleston, S.C. It was drifting south at about 7 m.p.h., and forecasters 
predicted continued weakening today. 
</P>
<P>
 Its southerly motion was expected to continue Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters had expected the storm to move slowly northward, losing strength 
as it reached cooler, more northern waters. 
</P>
<P>
 A coastal flood warning remained in effect from North Carolina's border with 
Virginia to Cape Lookout, southwest of Cape Hatteras, as the National Hurricane 
Center warned that tides of three to five feet above normal were still expected 
over portions of the Outer Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Hurricane Center also warned that tornadoes were possible over 
eastern portions of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker called Gordon "the most bizarre storm since September of '72," when 
Hurricane Dawn hit southern Florida and headed into the open Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gordon, Dawn headed north, then turned west toward the Outer Banks, where 
it got close but never hit land. Dawn then doubled back toward Florida, barely 
missing Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on the Outer Banks worked Friday to clean up after a punishing high 
tide with waves up to 16 feet destroyed four empty houses in Kitty Hawk. Three 
of the houses had been condemned because of heavy damage from earlier storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance industry representatives said the storm left a minimum $10 million 
to $15 million in damage to homes and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers had not ordered residents of the Outer Banks to evacuate, 
but ocean waters still covered North Carolina 12, the only highway linking the 
region's isolated resort towns, rendering it impassable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A five-mile area on the east end of Ocracoke Island has lost 50% of its 
dunes," said Bob Woody, public information officer for the Cape Hatteras 
National Seashore Park. "Damage is significant." Gordon's Furious Path 
</P>
<P>
 Tropical Storm Gordon killed more than 500 people in Haiti and swamped much of 
Florida's winter vegetable crop. Gordon, which became a hurricane Thursday, was 
downgraded to a tropical storm Friday afternoon.

SMOKING BAN IS OKD FOR TEXAS PRISON SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the 95,000 inmates in the Texas penal system may be doing a slow burn 
after authorities decided Friday to ban smoking in the state's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote by the Texas Board of Criminal Justice followed two hours 
of debate over issues including whether to allow Death Row inmates a last 
cigarette before their executions and whether the smoking ban would spark 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not operating the Ritz-Carlton," said board member Allan Polunsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision taking the butts out of America's second largest prison 
system takes effect March 1. The new policy also covers prison employees, 
including guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Board of Criminal Justice spokesman Larry Todd said he anticipates 
inmate lawsuits challenging the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there have been no problems at a small prison facility in Huntsville, 
90 miles north of Houston, that opened this year as a smoke-free facility.

WOMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING SONS IS 'LIKE A 6-YEAR-OLD,' LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Susan Smith, charged with drowning her two young sons in a faked carjacking, 
is emotionally like a 6-year-old and not ready to be examined by state 
psychiatrists, her lawyer said in court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Thomas Pope wants a judge to order a psychiatric exam for Smith, 
23, of Union, S.C., to determine if she is sane enough to stand trial on murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 She is accused of drowning her sons Michael, 3, and Alex, 14 months. Police 
say she confessed to letting her car, with the boys strapped into their safety 
seats, roll into John D. Long Lake on Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was Smith's first court appearance since her Nov. 3 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 She never acknowledged her husband, David, or her family sitting in the 
courtroom, instead staring straight ahead or looking at her lawyer, David 
Bruck, and Circuit Judge John Hayes III. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Smith's parents and other relatives said in a statement that "our 
love for Susan is unconditional. We are by her side and will not forsake her." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruck opposed Pope's motion for a psychiatric examination, "and I can give you 
a three-word reason why . . . the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 A psychiatric examination could be used as evidence to execute Smith if Pope 
seeks the death penalty and she is convicted, Bruck said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law under which I am working does not let me roll the dice," said Bruck, 
a death-penalty opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan is a lot like a 6-year-old child. She needs to be protected from the 
legal peril that is before her." 
</P>
<P>
 Pope said he does not expect to decide until at least January whether he will 
seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope said it was vital to have Smith examined quickly. "The closer to the time 
(of the drownings) the examination (occurs), the clearer indication the answers 
will give," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes said he would rule within 10 days. He said he would also give Bruck 
extra time to decide whether to use an insanity plea or plead guilty but 
mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 For nine days Smith told the nation her sons were taken by a carjacker. Then 
she confessed, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her arrest, she has been held at a women's prison.

U.S. APPEALS COURT MAY PERMIT CAMERA COVERAGE; JUDICIARY: GROUP OF JURISTS 
PROPOSE ALLOWING TELEVISION IN THEIR COURTROOMS. PLAN DEALS WITH THE APPELLATE 
CIRCUITS ONLY, NOT TRIAL LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cameras could be allowed in federal appeals courts starting next year under a 
proposal by a group of judges that comes not long after a judicial panel 
refused to open federal courtrooms to such coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to do it, we've got to be very careful about it," Chief Judge 
Gilbert S. Merritt of the Cincinnati-based U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, 
who supports the new proposal, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In appellate courts, lawyers argue before a panel of judges and there are no 
witnesses or jurors. Thus, appellate judges need not worry -- as some trial 
judges do -- that jurors or witnesses might be intimidated by the prospect of 
winding up on the evening news, Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only benefit of cameras in the courts is so that the American people are 
informed as to what goes on in the courtrooms," Merritt said. "Anything that is 
done with cameras that doesn't carry out the function is beside the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the chief judges of the 13 federal appeals circuits have signed a 
letter asking a committee of the U.S. Judicial Conference to recommend allowing 
cameras into the appeals courts, Merritt said. The 27-member conference is the 
federal judiciary's policy-making body and is chaired by Chief Justice William 
H. Rehnquist. 
</P>
<P>
 Each appellate circuit might be allowed to decide for itself whether to allow 
cameras in the courtrooms, Merritt said. If the committee approves in December, 
the conference could vote on the proposal in March, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Judicial Conference committee also is expected next month to consider a 
new experiment to allow television and still cameras into federal trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3 1/2-year experiment that allowed cameras into civil trials in six federal 
district courts and two appeals courts will expire at the end of the year. Even 
though a study on the experiment found only "small or no effects" from the 
experiment, the Judicial Conference voted in September by a 2-1 margin not to 
open federal courts across the country to camera coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new experiments are aimed at heading off the broadcast media's 
tendency to use short "sound bites" of trial coverage, Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The camera can be used to mislead as well as to inform if it's not in 
context," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said one proposal would require any camera coverage to continue for 
the duration of the trial, although the news organization would not be required 
to broadcast all of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal, he said, would set a minimum length -- something more than 
15 seconds -- for any video excerpt that is broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Merritt said the conference's September vote focused mainly on the effects of 
cameras in trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The appellate judges' new proposal seeks to make a distinction between cameras 
in appellate courts and trial courts "and to indicate that there's more support 
for one than the other," Merritt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment that ends next month has been conducted in federal trial courts 
in Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington and 
federal appeals courts in New York and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Every state except Indiana, Mississippi and South Dakota allows some use of 
cameras in state trial or appeals courts.

O.C. ATTORNEY GETS OUT THE CONSERVATIVE MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though a man of many media, Orange County attorney Hugh Hewitt's message never 
wavers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's for his newspaper columns or his radio and television shows, the 
38-year-old former White House assistant counsel abides by the conservative 
political maxim: "The government is best which governs least." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest application of his guiding principle came when Hewitt headed a task 
force of 85 community and business leaders who this week proposed a host of 
alternatives to what they regard as the cumbersome regulations of the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt's group urged the district, which is charged with improving air 
quality, to junk their mandatory car-pooling regulations for businesses. Among 
other things, the task force suggested that the district finance research for 
emission-free vehicles and impose parking fees on solo drivers and use proceeds 
to reward employees who car-pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the district's entire ride-share rule "deserves to be abolished in 
toto ," said Hewitt Friday, moments before co-hosting another segment of 
KCET-TV Channel 28's "Life and Times." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his television show duties, Hewitt also hosts his own radio 
show on KFI-AM 640 and writes a local newspaper column. And, notes the Irvine 
resident wryly, he contributes to The Times opinion pages when "they need a 
token conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt's intense involvement in so many communication arenas may appear 
somewhat ironic, in view of his scathing attacks on the media. Not only is the 
media overridden with "liberals," they are also losing their standards, said 
Hewitt, whose Newport Beach law firm defended developers in the California 
gnatcatcher battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent book review in which he glowed over former Vice President Dan 
Quayle's "Standing Firm," Hewitt said of his media colleagues: "This nation's 
media elite has abandoned the old virtues of journalism: including objectivity, 
fairness, balance, context and -- critically -- any sense of relative import." 
</P>
<P>
 If his stalwart conservatism puts him at odds with his co-workers in the 
media, why do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy the exchange of ideas," said Hewitt, who served as the first 
executive director of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace from July to 
September, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The unabashed conservatism of the former Reagan Administration official has 
won him wide praise in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hugh's influence is far reaching in that both conservatives and liberals 
listen to him and respect his opinions," said Kevin Cartwright, the Nixon 
library's assistant director. "He has the rare ability to cut through public 
policy matters and make them understandable in ways that elicit a strong 
reaction -- and a call to action."

WOOTEN FELONY EMBEZZLEMENT CONVICTION REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The felony embezzlement conviction of a Ventura County transportation 
commissioner and one-time promoter of a card club for Oxnard was reduced Friday 
to a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding to reduce Michael E. Wooten's conviction, Superior Court Judge 
Allan L. Steele said he considered the defendant's "substantial contribution to 
this community" and his relative lack of a criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also noted he had received dozens of letters in support of Wooten, 
including those from county Supervisors John Flynn and Susan Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten, 46, of Camarillo, was convicted by a jury of grand theft in July for 
stealing $10,000 from Community Group Funding, a private lending company. 
According to trial evidence, Wooten presented a voucher to the lender which 
falsely claimed that work had been completed on a Santa Paula development 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The lender paid $10,000 for the work and Wooten pocketed the money, 
prosecutors claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wooten continued to maintain his innocence outside of court -- saying 
his prosecution was politically motivated -- Steele said at the sentencing 
hearing that there was "a substantial amount of evidence from which this jury 
could have concluded that a crime had been committed." 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge also said he believes Wooten's biggest offense was "an unending 
attempt at control" of the people around him. 
</P>
<P>
 He placed Wooten on probation for one year and ordered him to pay $5,000 to 
the state restitution fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele's decision to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor was especially 
significant because as a convicted felon Wooten would no longer have been able 
to serve on the Ventura County Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member panel decides how $64 million in state and federal 
transportation funds should be spent in Ventura County each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooten, whose term runs until 1997, is one of two citizen representatives on 
the commission. Elected officials from around the county hold the other five 
seats on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, defense attorney George Eskin said he was not surprised the 
conviction was reduced to a misdemeanor. He said that the 47 people who wrote 
letters to Steele extolling the quality of Wooten's community service painted a 
far different picture of the defendant than prosecutors did. 
</P>
<P>
 Eskin said Wooten has been targeted by prosecutors ever since he tried 
unsuccessfully to persuade Oxnard city officials to open a card club. Earlier 
this year Wooten, who manages the Ash Street Card Club in Ventura, pleaded 
guilty to a misdemeanor charge of money laundering in connection with small 
contributions to some Oxnard political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 That conviction was followed by the embezzlement trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced this was a politically motivated prosecution because he 
stepped on the wrong toes," Eskin said. "He went over to Oxnard and pursued the 
card club, and (Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury) is opposed to card clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff G. Bennett, who prosecuted Wooten, denied that 
politics played a part in the case.

COUNCIL MAY TARGET RIVER-BOTTOM TRANSIENTS; VENTURA: HOUSING COMMITTEE'S PLAN 
TO FORCE THEM OUT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY. THREE MEMBERS HAVE 
CRITICIZED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to force homeless people out of the Ventura River bottom, where 
some transients have lived for decades, will be considered by the Ventura City 
Council next week.  
</P>
<P>
 The council's housing committee has worked on the plan for months, hoping not 
only to clean out the river bottom but also to remove transients from the 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea's test comes Monday night, when the full council is expected to vote 
on whether to begin moving the river-bottom homeless as early as this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The three council members on the housing committee favor the plan, but three 
others say they have serious concerns. The seventh member, Steve Bennett, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are coming up with simplistic solutions to complicated problems," 
Councilman Gregory L. Carson said. "It sounds like another Band-Aid approach, 
and it doesn't solve the long-range problem of the homeless."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said the proposal raises serious civil rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are limits to what a city can do to remove citizens . . . just because 
they don't look like what certain people would like," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving the homeless from the river has strong support from many downtown 
merchants, who complain that the homeless disturb their customers. But some 
advocates for the homeless say the plan will not give some river dwellers' 
another place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's got two sides to it, doesn't it?" said Councilman Gary Tuttle. "On 
the one hand, it'll clean up downtown, which I'm all for. But the other side . 
. . is it has a tendency to look ugly."  
</P>
<P>
 The housing committee -- made up of council members Jack Tingstrom, Rosa Lee 
Measures and Jim Monahan -- has crafted the proposal since spring. At first, 
the committee worked with homeless advocates and police on a plan that would 
give the transients a roof over their heads and access to crucial social 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 But this fall, committee members decided that Ventura could not afford to pay 
for a campground. As it now stands, the proposal would move the estimated 200 
squatters in three phases over about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, which could begin in January, includes advertising housing 
and social services and notifying river-bottom residents that they must soon 
leave. Ventura Police Capt. Randy Adams said the entire effort, which would 
include a downtown storefront to monitor the homeless, could cost up to 
$200,000 in its first year.  
</P>
<P>
 However, City Atty. Pete Bulens has warned that the city could be setting 
itself up for a lawsuit if it does not provide alternative housing for the 
squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said he hopes to locate housing countywide, from Ojai to Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Such casual discussion about where to move the river dwellers unnerves Rick 
Pearson, director of Project Understanding, which provides homeless services.  
</P>
<P>
 "Has Ventura talked to these other jurisdictions, asked them, 'How would you 
feel, we're going to export our homeless people to you?' " he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pearson worked with the committee to craft the campground plan, and now he 
wonders where that portion of the proposal went. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have we given up all hope of providing anything else?" he asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city would be on shaky legal grounds to go forward without some (housing) 
alternatives," he said. "Do we want to get into a position of arresting people 
for being homeless?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson and others maintain that cleaning out the river bottom will not solve 
the downtown's transient problem, since panhandlers go there from all over the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 But merchants say they are at the end of their patience. Ed Warren, who owns 
two restaurants downtown, said clearing the river would be a start. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are totally undesirable people that stink to high heaven," he said. 
"I've had my customers leave because they are bothering them." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said he is not unsympathetic to the homeless -- it's just that he has 
to earn a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something I can't tolerate," he said. "But why should I have to 
tolerate it?"

HOMELESS MAN'S CHANCE AT A FRESH START FALTERS WITH ARREST ON SUSPICION OF 
THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On Monday, Pack-Rat stood before the Ventura City Council, an example of how, 
with a little help from his friends -- including Councilman Jim Monahan -- a 
homeless man could hope for a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the self-proclaimed "Chief of the Ventura River Bottom" found 
himself in jail, accused of robbing a local business of 67 compact discs and a 
small amount of cash on Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Mahala, better known as Pack-Rat for his trash-can-picking prowess, had 
left the river bottom last week to move into the home of a Ventura couple who 
wanted to give him a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 But his stay there proved brief. A photograph of the 55-year-old man 
accompanying a news article about his good fortune prompted an Ojai music store 
owner to point an accusatory finger at Pack-Rat. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Sky Music owner Sal Lucido told police he recognized Pack-Rat as the man 
who had sold him 61 stolen discs on Sept. 1, the day after they were taken from 
the Advanced Rubber Stamp Co. on Front Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lucido had been unable to identify anyone from a lineup of 
suspects in September. But on Nov. 12, he contacted Detective Greg Irvine 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey Greg, I know who the guy is," Lucido told the detective. "His picture is 
in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a case like this," Irvine added. "It's a twist of fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Pack-Rat is scheduled to be arraigned Monday, with bail set at $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at the Ventura County Jail, Pack-Rat proclaimed his innocence 
and said that until last month he had never even been to Ojai, let alone Blue 
Sky Music. He suggested that maybe someone was out to get him because of his 
brief moment in the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shock. I didn't do anything, but I got blamed for doing it," he said 
dressed in his blue jail coveralls instead of his customary head-to-toe leather 
garb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I became a great star overnight, and now you're going to blame me because 
you've seen my picture in the paper?" Pack-Rat said, moving around uneasily in 
his seat. "If this happened in August, and now it's November, something's wrong 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess somebody don't like me that well," he continued. "They were jealous I 
got out of the river bottom. The more I got to the top, the more enemies I 
got." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the arrest, his benefactors still believe in him. He may have been in 
possession of stolen property unknowingly, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who know him very well said he is as honest as the day is long," said 
Monahan, who accepted two gifts of gratitude from Pack-Rat at Monday's meeting 
-- a peace pipe and walking cane -- for helping him find a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether he stole it or not is not really clear yet. When you are in a 
homeless situation, many things end up in trash cans or thrown out or traded. 
In their situation they are not going to check and see whether something is 
good or bad or stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano (Junior) Garcia, the man most responsible for getting Pack-Rat out of 
the river bottom and into the home of Ventura resident Mark Conroy, said he 
believes in his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not guilty," said Garcia, founder of the Ventura-based assistance 
organization Helping Hand. "I don't think he could have done it. He could have 
been given something that was stolen and turned around and sold it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the Conroys will stand by Pack-Rat as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'He is still going to stay with us, absolutely,' " he said. "There 
is no way they are going to kick him out because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he will contribute to Pack-Rat's bail if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it takes to get him out of there, because he is a model citizen," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's especially frustrating, Pack-Rat said, is that everything had been 
going so well for him with his new home and new life. He had his own bedroom 
and access to a television and the kitchen, where he prepared his own meals. 
</P>
<P>
 When not in the house, he said, he spent time in the large back yard, getting 
the soil ready for a garden come spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, until his legal problems are resolved, he shares a room with about 16 
other men at the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will work out," he said. "If it don't work out, then I'll end up losing 
everything I have worked so hard to get."

DISABLED CRITICIZE SATURDAYS POOL CLOSURE

 His head supported by a block of plastic, Marc Castro stared at the ceiling as 
his torso and legs were moved back and forth in the warm water by his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, 24, has visited the Easter Seal pool every week since a 1990 car 
accident robbed him of the ability to eat, move and talk.  
</P>
<P>
 But today may be the last Saturday that Castro and other physically disabled 
swimmers are able to enjoy the only public therapy pool in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Easter Seal officials said a lack of funds has forced them to close the pool 
on Saturdays after today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am devastated," said Castro's mother, Lupe Castro. "This is the only hour 
and a half that he gets off the wheelchair and out of bed. This is the only 
time his body is free." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a number of other disabled county residents, Castro can only use the east 
Ventura pool on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes me and his father to be able to take him out of bed and drive from 
Santa Paula to Ventura, where he can enjoy the pool," Lupe Castro said. "I work 
during the week, and by the time I get home, it's just too late to come here." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Inez Torkelson of Ventura has used the pool on Saturdays for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need this pool desperately," said Torkelson, 72. "I can't walk or do any 
other type of exercise besides swimming. And I need to swim at least three 
times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a week, Torkelson -- who has a severe case of arthritis -- manages to 
leave work an hour early to exercise, but she has been scheduling her third 
workout for Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just ridiculous. What am I supposed to do now? Leave work earlier 
another day? I doubt that will be possible," Torkelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pools are too cool for her, Torkelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a recreational pool, the temperature in a therapeutic pool is kept at 
94 degrees, which is particularly good for people with arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool, part of the nationwide nonprofit Easter Seal Society, is also 
wheelchair accessible and is designed with several iron bars for exercises. It 
is open only to those with a doctor's prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 Ned Washburn, the pool's aquatic director, said the society depends primarily 
on grants and donations to raise the more than $100,000 a year needed to 
operate the pool. But both donations and grants have dwindled drastically in 
the past few years, Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in a position to lose more money, and if we keep the pool open on 
Saturdays, we take the risk, in the long run, of having to close the facility," 
Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "By eliminating our Saturday hours, we are trying to make sure the whole 
facility has a . . . future," he said. "I do understand that people are upset, 
but we are trying to provide the best service we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1974, the Easter Seal Society offers various programs for the 
disabled or developmentally delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapy pool is an important part of the organization, offering patients 
various types of activities, including aerobics, exercises for lower back, laps 
and individual training. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no membership fee, but the organization charges clients $4.50 per 
visit. The fee, however, can be lowered or dropped for needy clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool's users, many of whom have been involved in accidents, may have 
exhausted their insurance coverage or lost their jobs, Washburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn said the society decided to close the pool Saturdays because, while 
it serves an average of 150 to 180 people daily on weekdays, only 15 to 25 
people use the pool Saturdays during its hours of 8 a.m. to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 pool patrons signed a petition last week volunteering to pay an 
additional $2 on Saturdays for the next three months. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washburn said the organization cannot accept the offer, because it would 
clash with its goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart bleeds for these people," Washburn said, "but that runs away from 
our mission statement, and that is that people who can't afford it would not be 
able to be here on Saturdays." 
</P>
<P>
 Washburn said the society hopes to raise money in the next six months and 
reopen the pool on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, several Saturday patrons may face tough choices in the next few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been using the pool on Saturdays for nine years and have been able to 
postpone a surgery for the last seven years," said 67-year-old Francine Ek of 
Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 Ek, who has had a hip-joint replacement and suffers from arthritis, said the 
Easter Seal pool is the only therapy pool in the county she can afford. Others 
are affiliated with therapy centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what keeps me moving are the exercises," she said. "Otherwise I would 
be in a wheelchair and probably be unable to work."

CENSUS REPORT SHOWS CHUMASH POPULATION ROSE SHARPLY IN '80S; NATIVE AMERICANS: 
TINY TRIBE IS SAID TO BE GROWING FASTER THAN MOST GROUPS, THOUGH SOME SAY THE 
JUMP REFLECTS A CHANGE IN RESPONDENTS' VIEW OF THEMSELVES. 
</P>

<P>
 The tiny Chumash tribe of Native Americans is experiencing a population boom, 
growing faster than almost any other group of people in the country, according 
to a Census Bureau report released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census counted 3,208 Chumash nationwide, up 120% from the 1,458 
reported in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also said Chumash women have an average of only about 2.5 
children each. And unlike other rapidly growing racial and ethnic groups, the 
population of Native Americans does not increase because of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, anthropology experts said the mysterious population boom shown in the 
census reflects changing attitudes as much as changing populations. The problem 
is that some people who claim to be Chumash really aren't, and some who claim 
not to be really are, said John Johnson, curator of anthropology at the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History. The Census Bureau has no way of knowing the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all based on self-identification and sometimes it's imaginary," Johnson 
said. "I don't put much stock in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Thornton, a professor of anthropology at UCLA, said the jump in 
Chumash population seemed too high to be a natural increase. He, too, said it 
probably reflected a change in self-identification as much as a change in birth 
or death rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of been fashionable since the '60s to be a member of an ethnic 
group," Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people just want to jump on the bandwagon. Some people feel like they no 
longer have to be ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton said the most glaring problem with the census was that it only 
allowed people to identify themselves as members of one racial group. Racial 
boundaries are increasingly blurring as a result of intermarriage, he said, and 
the census figures do not reflect the reality of mixed families. 
</P>
<P>
 Census officials counted 408 Chumash in Los Angeles County and fewer than 400 
remaining in Ventura County, although they could not provide an exact number. 
About 350 Chumash live on a Santa Ynez reservation in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Before European settlers arrived, the Chumash ranged across Ventura County and 
much of the central coast. Remnants of their villages are often uncovered at 
construction sites, and many developers, following state and local laws, employ 
Chumash monitors. Chumash-style art decorates the Ventura City Hall and 
Thousand Oaks' new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Pace, a spokeswoman for the Santa Ynez band, said she found the higher 
census count an encouraging sign of increased education and pride of heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, there have been times that people were not putting down that 
they were Indian on the survey," Pace said. She said tribal representatives 
worked with census officials in 1990 to encourage Chumash to report themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, despite low high-school graduation rates, the Chumash are 
wealthier than most other Native American groups, according to statistics 
released Thursday in the 1,400-page Census Bureau report, "Characteristics of 
American Indians by Tribe and Language." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Chumash older than 25, 64.3% had high school diplomas or more advanced 
degrees. That falls below the U.S. figure of 75.2% and the Native Americans' 
rate of 65.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The median family income for Chumash was $30,856, higher than the Native 
American median income of $21,619 but lower than the $35,225 figure for the 
general population, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the education and income figures were useless because of the 
distortion that goes along with self-identification. 
</P>
<P>
 But another expert said the census report's information seemed reasonable to 
him. Paul Valenzuela Varela, executive director of the Oak Brook Park Chumash 
Interpretive Center, said most of the Chumash he knew were laborers who worked 
hard but quit school after eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our families didn't have much education at all," Varela said, adding that the 
trend seems to be changing with later generations.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; EX-CHAMBER CHIEF SAYS HE'S DROPPING UTILITY 
TAX LAWSUIT

 Former Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J. O'Neill said Friday he is 
dropping a lawsuit he had filed against the city over the passage of the 
controversial 2% utility tax last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there no longer is a need to sue because the City Council tentatively 
approved repealing the tax this week.Council members are expected to give final 
approval to the action next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have committed themselves to repealing the tax," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said dropping the lawsuit was an "early step in the peace-making process in 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a signal that the community is trying to put divisiveness behind 
us," City Manager James L. Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of businesses throughout the city in 
August, 1993, spent about $25,000 in legal fees. Armstrong said the city spent 
about $30,000.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill had initially sued the city and three council members who had voted 
for the tax. He had charged that then Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin and council 
members Don Bankhead and Molly McClanahan had made up their minds on the tax 
levy prior to a public hearing at which hundreds of residents and business 
owners opposed the move. 
</P>
<P>
 He later dropped the three council members, who were recalled in June over the 
tax, from the lawsuit and only the city remained as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead has subsequently been elected to a council seat. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; FESTIVAL'S OFFERINGS PLEASE THE PALATE

 Software salesman Andy Mouacdie wouldn't have missed the 9th Annual World of 
Wine and Food festival at the Ritz-Carlton for any price. 
</P>
<P>
 With a big smile Friday, he puffed on long, thick barrels of tobacco from the 
Dominican Republic and sipped on 25-year-old Macallan-brand scotch while 
sitting in the opulently appointed ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife makes me go out to the patio when I want to smoke a cigar," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The finest cigars, the best scotch whiskey, who could ask for more?" 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day event, which started Thursday and runs through Sunday, is packed 
with seminars that carry zesty names like "Chocolate! Chocolate! Chocolate! And 
Zinfandel for Lunch" or "The Finest in Cigars Joins the Ultimate in Single Malt 
Whiskies." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is open to anyone who loves the finer food and wine, no matter who you 
are," said Ritz-Carlton general manager John Dravinski.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take the arrogance out of good food and wine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each seminar carries its own price tag, and although not inexpensive, the 
average cost -- between $40 and $95 -- is about the same as a good seat to a 
Mighty Ducks hockey game at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights of the remaining seminars this weekend include the Great American 
Tasting Spectacular, a gathering of wine from more than 100 California 
vineyards ($95) and a Tasting of Oysters and Pinot Gris ($45).

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FORUM TO FOCUS ON TRADE WITH VIETNAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several past and present U.S. officials will discuss free trade with Vietnam 
on Sunday in a forum expected to draw more than 200 people, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, in the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel at Bristol Street and Anton 
Boulevard, is a response to recent events that "rocked the nerve" of the 
Vietnamese community in Orange County, said Dung Tran, chairman of the 
nonpartisan Vietnamese Political Action Committee, which is sponsoring the free 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Since President Clinton lifted the trade embargo in February, the issue of 
trade with the Communist regime has created tension between many Vietnamese on 
both sides of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the Vietnamese community to be perceived as being divided," 
Tran said. "We want to sit down and discuss our differences." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those participating in the forum will be Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach), Rep. Edward Royce (R-Fullerton) and former Undersecretary 
of Commerce Orson Swindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights activists Tran Xuan Ninh and Tran Thai Van also will speak. THAO

SAN CLEMENTE SLAYING SUSPECT HELD IN DELAWARE; CRIME: OFFICER WHO STOPPED TO 
AID STRANDED MOTORISTS ARRESTS 23-YEAR-OLD MAN SOUGHT IN 1990 GANG KILLING, THE 
CITY'S FIRST.

<P>
 Four years to the day after a man was shot outside a San Clemente restaurant 
in that city's first gang slaying, a suspect was arrested Friday when a 
Delaware police officer stopped to help stranded motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 A computer check of the car's occupants showed that 23-year-old Juan Jose 
Ramirez was wanted on suspicion of the Orange County murder, according to 
Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. Ramirez, whose identity was later 
confirmed through California's computerized fingerprint system, was arrested at 
the scene without incident and booked into Gander Hill State Prison in New 
Castle County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great work on their part," Martini said, "and a great solve." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting of 26-year-old Roman C. Calvillo of San Clemente on Nov. 18, 
1990, climaxed a night of taunting between rival San Clemente and San Juan 
Capistrano gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvillo was at a dance with friends at the Great Wall restaurant and 
nightclub in the 100 block of Calle de Industrias. Taunting broke out between 
Calvillo's group and a group that included Ramirez from San Juan Capistrano, 
witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1:30 a.m., the groups began throwing bottles, and one man fired several 
rounds from a .22-caliber automatic handgun at Calvillo, hitting him once in 
the chest, witnesses said. As restaurant customers fled, the shooter pursued 
Calvillo and fired several more shots at him in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvillo, who was hit in the head and stomach in the second volley, was dead 
on arrival at a hospital.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said the same two rival gangs earlier had been involved in the drive-by 
shooting and wounding of a 4-year-old girl in San Clemente and were involved in 
numerous incidents after the restaurant shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 In December of 1990, San Clemente police issued an arrest warrant for Ramirez, 
who they assumed had fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, when the Orange County Sheriff's Department took over law enforcement 
from the San Clemente Police Department, the city's six unsolved homicide cases 
were reactivated and entered into a nationwide computer system, Martini said. A 
"Wanted for Murder -- Special Bulletin" was issued for Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1 p.m. on Thursday, Patrol Officer Laura O'Sullivan responded to a call 
about a disabled car, police said. Since Ramirez's car had no license plate, 
she asked for the occupants' identities and ran a routine records check from 
her car. 
</P>
<P>
 When the check turned up the murder warrant for Ramirez, the officer called 
for backup and the arrest was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is expected to be arraigned there within a few days, and Orange County 
sheriff's officials said they will seek his extradition here.

TALKS EXTENDED ON EL TORO LAND EXCHANGE; CONVERSION: FEDERAL OFFICIAL SAYS IT'S 
UNCLEAR HOW PASSAGE OF AIRPORT INITIATIVE WILL AFFECT PROPOSED SWAP. INTERIOR 
DEPT. AND IRVINE CO. WILL TAKE UNTIL APRIL TO DISCUSS OTHER IDEAS FOR THE LAND. 
</P>

<P>
 The U. S. Interior Department, in a letter to the crippled El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority, said that it needs four more months to conclude land-swap 
negotiations that could give the Irvine Co. a large part of the base and set 
aside 1,100 acres for an ecological preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, signed by department special counsel Joseph L. Sax and dated the 
day before Orange County voters approved Measure A, said the department foresaw 
negotiations with the Irvine Co. continuing until at least April 1, because of 
the "magnitude and complexity of the proposed transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, both sides were supposed to provide details of the proposed 
exchange to the planning authority by Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The land-exchange concept involves a number of issues that require further 
discussion between (Interior Department) and the Irvine Co," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday, however, to withdraw 
from the planning authority, which was forged with two South County cities 
earlier this year to plan the development of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors acted after voters on Nov. 8 approved Measure A, which obliges 
the county to build a commercial airport on 2,000 acres of the facility when 
the Marines leave by 1999. The county's withdrawal from the planning agency 
left in doubt not only the fate of the base but who will plan its development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Jay Ziegler, Interior Department spokesman in Washington, said he 
was aware of the initiative's passage and that the supervisors had voted to 
withdraw from the planning authority by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it was still unclear how the passage of Measure A might impact the 
proposed land exchange, but added that "we respect the role of the local reuse 
authority, even if it's not the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative calls for a 13-member El Toro Airport Citizens Advisory 
Commission to plan for the airport and "airport-compatible" development around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what the effect will be. But both the Irvine Co. and Interior 
Department have made it clear that neither side has an interest in managing an 
airport," said Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, Irvine Co. Executive Vice President Gary Hunt said the giant 
land developer was not interested in the base property earmarked for an 
airport. On Friday, it was still unclear which areas of the base are being eyed 
by Irvine Co. officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A secretary said that Hunt was out of town and unavailable for comment. Other 
Irvine Co. officials who were asked to comment on the letter and land swap were 
also unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if an agreement is reached on a land swap, the Irvine Co. would be able 
to develop, at most, only about one-third of the 4,700-acre base. In addition 
to the 2,000 acres set aside by the initiative for an airport, Ziegler said the 
Interior Department will go ahead with previously announced plans to preserve 
about 1,100 acres of the base as a gnatcatcher preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We view these as two distinct issues. Our first priority is the 1,100 acres 
on the base identified by biologists as a critical piece of the county's 
reserve system. This is independent of whether or not we can reach a land 
exchange with the Irvine Co.," said Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that federal officials still do not know how many of the remaining 
1,600 developable acres the Irvine Co. is interested in. 
</P>
<P>
 "In simple terms, we felt they had a strong interest in everything except the 
airport. But I'm not pretending to speak for the company," Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-page letter also said that both the Interior Department and Irvine 
Co. "are in the process of targeting more precisely the lands that will be the 
subject of the exchange." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed exchange, the Irvine Co. would get an undetermined number 
of acres at the Marine base in exchange for property owned by the company near 
the Cleveland National Forest around Gypsum, Wier and Fremont canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler said the size of Irvine Co. land received by the Interior Department 
will depend on the appraised value of the El Toro property deeded to the 
company. Much of the property that the Interior Department wants to acquire is 
zoned for development, but federal authorities want to preserve it as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been two other proposed land swaps involving the El Toro base. In 
October, the Laguna Hills Audubon Society proposed turning over most of the 
Marine base to the Irvine Co. in exchange for environmentally sensitive 
property in Laguna Canyon subject to development. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, Laguna Hills city officials said they had begun preliminary 
discussions with federal officials about swapping the Marine base to the Irvine 
Co. for a different section of Laguna Canyon. Both proposals were made to the 
Interior Department.

WAR'S UNFINISHED BUSINESS; HE'D LIKE TO RETURN JAPANESE FLAG TAKEN FROM FALLEN 
SOLDIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the autumn of his life, Clair Weeks, is seeking to give up one of the 
prized mementos of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 50 years, Weeks, 83, has kept as a war trophy a Japanese flag that 
he took off the body of a Japanese soldier killed in a firefight in a Burmese 
jungle during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Weeks regaled friends and family members with stories of his 
exploits as an intelligence captain with the Office of Strategic Services, the 
forerunner of the CIA, which assigned him to the British army in India and 
Burma. The 27-inch by 23-inch bloodstained silk flag had often been a prop in 
those tales of youthful bravery. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Weeks is seeking to return the flag as a goodwill gesture, and to put 
some closure on his own wartime memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has no more value to me at this stage in my life," said Weeks, who this 
year began the search for surviving relatives of the Japanese soldier, Miyauchi 
Motohiro. "I thought it would be a nice gesture, with all this talk about our 
MIAs in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of other World War II veterans have contacted the Japanese Consulate 
in Los Angeles over the years with similar offers to return flags, medals, 
uniforms, swords and other items that were taken from dead Japanese soldiers 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 James Aoki, a cultural affairs assistant at the consulate, said the number of 
offers has increased considerably over the past two years, probably because 
next year marks the 50th anniversary of the conclusion of the war in the 
Pacific. Japan surrendered to Allied forces on Aug. 14, 1945, and the surrender 
was formalized on Sept. 2, 1945, aboard the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki said Japanese soldiers carried the flags or wrapped them around their 
waists as a patriotic gesture or for good luck. Some of the soldiers believed 
the flags could stop bullets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were given by friends or family members, with little messages for good 
luck, prayers for their safe return and to get them through the rough time of 
battle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Motohiro inscribed his name on the flag Weeks has, along with his birthplace, 
the village of Moji in the Fukuoka-Ken Prefecture. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kanji , one of the three main forms of Japanese writing, one which uses 
Chinese characters, Motohiro wrote: "Now I am to die for my country. Great 
Heaven and Earth testify to the existence of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks said that a neighbor of Japanese descent helped him translate the 
writing on the flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks, who returned to his job as an animator with Walt Disney after the war, 
said his efforts to return the flag have been unsuccessful. About six months 
ago, he wrote the Japanese government and contacted the Japanese Consulate in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Aoki, the consular officer, said that even with names and addresses of dead 
soldiers, it is often hard to trace their relatives because a large number of 
Japanese have moved from their wartime residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the villages were bombed," Aoki said. "And it's been 50 years. It's 
hard to keep track of people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said requests to return the items are relayed to the Japanese Foreign 
Ministry, which in turn asks the Ministry of Public Health to locate the 
addresses. From the time the consulate in Los Angeles receives a request, it 
takes about six months before information comes back from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost all cases, the relatives cannot be found, Aoki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Nicholas and Peter Thompson of La Habra went to Japan to return 
a flag their father, Cochran Thompson, took from a dead Japanese soldier after 
a battle in Lingayen Gulf in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thompson brothers found relatives of the soldier after a photograph of the 
flag with the inscriptions was published in a Japanese newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks said that he has no such contacts in Japan, but he has made the flag 
available for war memorabilia exhibits, such as the one currently at the Los 
Alamitos Museum, in the hope that someone will find a way to return it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now mounted in a wooden frame to help preserve it from the elements, the flag 
is the featured attraction at the exhibit, which includes uniforms of American 
soldiers who fought in Europe and the Pacific and miniature replicas of the 
B-17 bomber and German tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks, born to Methodist missionaries in India, said that he was sent to Burma 
in 1945 because of his knowledge of Asia and his fluency in some Asian 
languages. He was assigned to the 15th Indian Corps, which was part of the 
British army. 
</P>
<P>
 He served with a unit that gathered intelligence about Japanese forces, which 
by then were beginning to retreat deep into the Burmese jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 During a patrol outside a village in Burma's coastal Arakan region, Weeks' 
unit was ambushed by a platoon of Japanese soldiers. After a 45-minute 
firefight, the enemy retreated, leaving their dead behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dead had flags wrapped around their waists or chests, Weeks said. 
A British officer, Capt. Harold Buckingham, asked if anyone was interested in 
taking some of the flags. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a nice memento," Weeks said. "I'd heard about these 
flags and the Shinto tradition that they were supposed to keep the soldiers 
from harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks said he removed the flag from the body of a soldier in his early 20s, 
who was later identified as Motohiro. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of the war just months away, Weeks said he saw little combat in 
1945, but was able to collect impressive war trophies that included a Japanese 
officer's sword, and knives and hats from the Gurkhas of Nepal, who fought with 
the British army. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection was a source of pride all these years, Weeks said, but now that 
he's growing older and none of his children are interested in keeping the 
Japanese flag, his final mission is to return it. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's not successful, he said, he will donate it to a veterans organization 
or a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been nearly 50 years," Weeks said. "It's time to put the memories to 
rest."

 Council to Complain to Registrar About Long Wait on Election Night 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members are unhappy about the long wait candidates suffered 
through on election night as ballots were being counted and intend to send a 
letter of complaint next week to the Orange County registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I speak for the whole city when I say that this was ridiculous," 
Mayor Donald L. Bone said."I want them to find some other delivery system that 
doesn't have us all up until 4:30 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Alcene M. Cain said that she had not been told that the Buena Park 
Police Department had been chosen as a central collection point for ballots 
from other northern Orange County cities -- a change from previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was just the collection point for Buena Park," she said. "I was 
surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 So were the eight council candidates, who were attending election night 
parties throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other cities were getting their fourth and fifth run-throughs and we were 
still on our second count," Councilman Arthur C. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers ended up roaming from room to room, repeatedly calling the 
registrar's office and getting more and more frustrated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park's absentee ballot count, taken early in the evening, did not change 
until well after midnight, Cain said. In the 1992 presidential election, Cain 
said, council election results were in before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the registrar experiments with different delivery methods from 
election to election," Bone said. "We just want to let them know that this 
method did not work." 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the council's letter, which will ask for an explanation, will be 
sent to the Board of Supervisors, Bone said. LESLEY WRIGHT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: FILLMORE; MILD SHOCKS WARD CONDORS FROM LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to teach California condors to stay away from man-made trouble, 
conservationists at the Los Angeles Zoo have erected a fake power line that 
gives the birds a mild shock. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo's scientists hope to avoid their experience in 1992, when they 
released 13 captive-bred condors into Los Padres National Forest, only to see 
four of them die when they roosted on power lines in the Sespe Condor Refuge 
near Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that some people are worried" by the scientists' shock therapy, 
said biologist Michael Wallace, the zoo's curator of conservation and science. 
"But we would be the last people to do anything to harm these birds. . . . This 
is something that's uncomfortable, but in no way harmful." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace said that young California condors traditionally rely on their elders 
to teach them where to land and what to avoid, but since there are few of the 
birds left, scientists have had to assume the role of mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feared for their lives, putting them out there with no training," Wallace 
said. "It took them only two to three experiences not to touch that pole 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the birds that have been shocked in the L.A. Zoo's special aviary is 
Xewe, one of the first California condors hatched in captivity to be released 
into the wild. Xewe was first let out in 1992 but was recaptured in 1993 
because she liked to perch on power lines. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; IT'S A TEACHER! A PRINCESS! NO, IT'S STORY 
LADY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a typical day, reading teacher Eleanore Schiro spends her time at Oxnard's 
Fred Williams School hunched over books, helping children who struggle with the 
written language. 
</P>
<P>
 But about this time every year, Schiro slips on a long red dress, ties a shiny 
metallic apron around her waist and dons a pointy silver hat. 
</P>
<P>
 She becomes "Story Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, Schiro began a tradition of reading aloud to each class at 
the Hueneme Elementary District school during the annual National Book Week. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, she said, is to promote reading. And her costume aids the cause by 
conveying to children a sense of the magic of books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts them into a world of fantasy," Schiro said, "to show that books can 
take you many places." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers go along with the masquerade, introducing Schiro as Story Lady, even 
though most of the school's students know her as the school's reading 
specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergartners are usually taken in by the disguise. But first-graders 
sometimes call Schiro's bluff, proclaiming that they know who she really is. 
</P>
<P>
 And while children in the upper grades also recognize her, they go along with 
the game. "They like a good story," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of her visits to a kindergarten class Friday, one child told his 
teacher Schiro seemed like a princess from outer space. Another suggested she 
may be a ballerina. And a third said she resembled a servant. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their uncertainty of Schiro's identity, the children appeared 
entranced by her story -- a tale of a grouchy ladybug that challenges a snake, 
an elephant and other large animals to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 They were mesmerized, even though most of the children in the bilingual 
kindergarten are Spanish-speaking and unable to grasp most of the English words 
Schiro read. 
</P>
<P>
 One aim of reading aloud to children, Schiro said, is to expose them to 
stories that would be too difficult for the students to read themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The listening level of a child is always higher than their reading level," 
she said. "It builds vocabulary. You can't read a word you haven't heard 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such benefits, Schiro encourages parents to continue reading to 
their children even after the youngsters are able to read for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But some children at Fred Williams School said they prefer to read on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like reading by myself," third-grader Megan McCorkle said. "Because when 
you read it by yourself you can read in your mind." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN, 66, DIES AFTER BEING HIT BY TRUCK

<P>
 A 66-year-old Oxnard man died Friday after being struck by a truck while 
crossing a street not far from his home in La Colonia, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Bravo Santellano died from multiple head injuries at 6:30 a.m. in St. 
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santellano arrived at the hospital early Thursday after a pickup truck, driven 
by Ramon Call, struck him as he crossed the street in an Oxnard crosswalk at 
Colonia Road and Oxnard Boulevard, Oxnard Police Officer Don Mulville said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear which direction Santellano was walking when he was hit, Mulville 
said. Call told police he did not see Santellano until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Call, 60, of Fontana was questioned and released, Mulville said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santellano has no known relatives in Ventura County, Wingate said. 
Santellano's house mates at an alcohol recovery home in La Colonia said he had 
mentioned relatives in Mexico, but had left no names or phone numbers. KAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; PARK BUILDING TO GET PLASTIC WINDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to stop vandalism at a Port Hueneme park, the City Council has 
agreed to spend more than $7,000 to replace breakable glass windows with 
plastic at the park's recreation building. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late August, several of the windows of a building at the Walter B. 
Moranda Park, situated off Hueneme Road, have been smashed and the city has 
spent more than $1,400 replacing them. 
</P>
<P>
 But every time the windows were replaced, they were broken again. So the city 
decided to use plastic windows similar to those at several local schools, said 
Lisa Donley, the city's manager for recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to take some drastic measures. It costs more money than we want to 
spend, but we have no choice," Donley said. "From time to time we have had 
vandalism, but not as damaging and expensive as this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one was caught, police believe the window vandals also tag the 
area with graffiti, Donley said. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SOMIS; COUPLE CONVICTED OF BANKRUPTCY FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Somis accountant who prosecutors said leased two Maseratis, a Jaguar 
convertible and a Lincoln Town Car just months before filing for bankruptcy was 
convicted this week on nine counts of bankruptcy fraud and tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Assistant U.S. Atty.Steven Jay Katzman said Wednesday that Robert P. 
Dubin, 52, was convicted of failing to report more than $1 million he had 
allegedly embezzled from a client, Arrow Highway Steel, on his income tax 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin was also convicted of failing to report assets -- including $9,500 worth 
of jewelry and 10 fur coats valued at $42,460 -- when he filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for five hours Monday, a federal jury in Los Angeles 
convicted Dubin and his wife, June Helen Dubin. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin, who now lives in Palm Springs, maintained his innocence in an interview 
Wednesday, saying he was the victim of zealous prosecutors out to defend a 
federal bankruptcy trustee he had complained about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government was after us," Dubin said. "As far as I'm concerned, we did 
nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubin said the Arrow Highway Steel money was for a business venture that his 
client was investing in, and that his wife had bought the jewelry without his 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 The fur coats? 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgot about them. It was the middle of July. Who thinks about fur coats?" 
said Dubin, adding that of the 10 furs, two were hats, one was a muff, three 
were jackets and one was bought after the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dubins will be sentenced Jan. 18. Robert Dubin faces a maximum of 31 years 
in prison and a fine of $1.45 million. June Dubin, who was convicted of two 
counts of bankruptcy fraud and the filing of false tax returns, faces up to 10 
years in prison and a $500,000 fine, Katzman said. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DEADLINE NEARS FOR SCHOOL TRANSFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents in the Oxnard Union High School District who want to take advantage of 
a new state law on school choice have until Wednesday to apply to transfer 
students to a different school within the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which took effect early this year, school officials must allow 
students to transfer to any school in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school must have room for additional students and the transfers must 
not cause major shifts in the school's racial balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of crowding in the Oxnard district, some of the five high schools have 
only limited space for transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested parents should call the district office at 385-2500, or visit one 
of the school offices to get a brochure explaining the transfer process. MAIA

 A Canoga Park man was sentenced Friday to 18 years to life in prison for the 
December shooting death of a Ventura man outside the victim's apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Garabet Majoubian, 45, received the mandatory sentence of 15 years to life for 
second-degree murder, plus three years for using a gun to commit the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoubian pleaded guilty in Superior Court to second-degree murder in the Dec. 
20 shooting of Erasmo Moro, 48, who worked at a Ventura pizza shop. Moro's body 
was found in the carport of the Scandia Apartments in eastern Ventura after 
residents reported hearing shots. 
</P>
<P>
 At a court hearing in March, police testified that Majoubian and Moro had 
argued over a Simi Valley woman, whom both men considered to be their 
girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Majoubian, a construction worker, went to Moro's apartment and 
shot the man after an argument. Investigators later found a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistol in Majoubian's apartment, police testified. BARBARA MURPHY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; OPPOSITION SEEN TO DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>

<P>
 The Bixby Ranch Co.'s proposed development of 223 homes, a hotel and 
restaurant near the Old Ranch Golf Course is expected to generate significant 
opposition from the city's slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a strong slow-growth movement in Seal Beach -- it's almost 
no-growth," Councilman William J. Doane said."They'll let an apartment house 
come in, but as far as new developments are concerned, they're very much 
against them." 
</P>
<P>
 The public can review a report through Dec. 27 at City Hall on the 
environmental impact of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach residents were sharply divided over the last major development 
proposed for the city. The Mola Development Corp.'s Hellman Ranch project, to 
be built across from the Naval Weapons Station, was the subject of angry debate 
for five years and was challenged in court. The developer abandoned the project 
after residents voted against it on an advisory ballot measure in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Laszlo, who represents the College Park East neighborhood 
where the Bixby Ranch development is planned, said it would have a devastating 
effect on local traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Bixby Ranch Co. officials were not available for comment Friday. But the 
company has offered to give the city land and tennis courts in the development 
area for the creation of a community recreation center. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 29 and Dec. 13, the city's Environmental Quality Control Review Board 
will accept public comments on the environmental report. The project will come 
before the city Planning Commission by early February. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whichever way it goes in the Planning Commission, it will be appealed," Doane 
said. "The City Council will end up making the decision."RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; RESIDENTS OFFER IDEAS ON CODE ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials recently invited residents to give suggestions about code 
enforcement. City Manager Pamela Gibson said the result was refreshing and 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got many ideas from citizens, and staff will be presenting some of them 
soon," she told the City Council this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement includes maintaining buildings, keeping lawns and vacant lots 
mowed, and preventing eyesores, such as illegally parked boats and vans. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said the city invited residents to attend a workshop on code 
enforcement this month because arcane laws frequently cause confusion and 
misunderstandings. City staffers attended the forum to explain the complexities 
of city ordinances and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that during the workshop, city employees also urged residents to 
suggest ways code enforcement could be improved. "Although there were only a 
few people in attendance, the ideas generated were excellent," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written report to the council, Gibson presented these ideas from the 
workshop: 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a citation for municipal code violations, similar to a parking 
ticket. This would be used for repeat offenders after all other attempts to 
gain compliance have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Soliciting support from service clubs whose members might be willing to 
assist property owners who are ill, elderly or disabled and not able to 
maintain homes or lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Offering fix-up grants to property owners who qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lobbying the Legislature to give cities more local control in code 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spreading information to residents about code requirements through such 
means as inserts to water bills. BILL BILLITER

<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved converting a former Ramada Inn into a 
home for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote this week allows Birtcher Senior Properties to convert the former 
110-unit hotel on a 3.6-acre site at 35 Calle de Industrias into a 75-unit home 
for senior citizens.The City Council must still approve an amendment to the 
city zoning code before the project can go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame the hotel was not able to succeed, but I think everybody thought 
this is a real good use for the site," said Commissioner Steve Apodaca, who was 
recently elected to the council and will change seats on Dec. 7.  
</P>
<P>
 A Birtcher spokesman told the commission that the hotel would be gutted and 
rebuilt and that prices for the new units would start at $900 a month and go 
up. LEN HALL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; KIDNAPER TO BE TRIED 3RD TIME IN SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite two hung juries in the trials of an Anaheim man charged with murder in 
one of the county's first fatal carjackings, the district attorney's office 
will go forward with a third trial, a prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why? Because he did it," said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent. "It was a bad 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rembert, 22, will return to court Dec. 2 for the setting of a new trial. 
Rembert was convicted of kidnaping last spring in connection with the June, 
1992, slaying of Joseph Andrew Kondrath. But two juries have been unable to 
decide on a charge of murder and a special circumstance allegation that a 
robbery occurred. Conviction mandates a life sentence without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In both trials, the majority of jurors wanted to convict Rembert of murder, 
but failed to reach a unanimous decision, Brent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rembert's attorney, Ed Freeman, said the jurors have been unable to decide in 
favor of a murder conviction because Rembert is innocent. The most Rembert can 
be blamed for, he said, was being in bad company. The attorney said he will try 
to have the case dismissed at the Dec. 2 hearing in Orange County Superior 
Court in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've already had two bites at him." Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kondrath, a 23-year-old Rancho Santiago College student, was last seen leaving 
for his job at a supermarket at 4 a.m. on June 10, 1992. Prosecutors say he was 
grabbed from behind the wheel of his car at gunpoint in front of his Anaheim 
home and forced into the trunk. He was robbed of his wallet, which contained 
only about $1, and later shot in the head as he lay curled up in the trunk of 
his car pleading, "Don't hurt me," according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Rembert is one of three defendants convicted in connection with the slaying. 
Shaun Burney, 20, of Tustin was sentenced to death in September for his role as 
the triggerman, and Allen Dean Burnett II, 20, of Anaheim, was sentenced to 
life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent said he believes he can present the case against Rembert this time in a 
way that will get a murder conviction, but declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman and his co-counsel, Tina del Rey, are ready to defend again, Freeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know justice will be served," he said. SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; EXPANSION OF FASHION ISLAND OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An expansion plan that officials hope will make Fashion Island more 
competitive with South Coast Plaza and other Orange County malls passed the 
City Council this week with the blessings of business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Clarence J. Turner said the added revenue would be welcome, noting that 
the state last year reduced the city's cut of property taxes from 20 cents on 
the dollar to 15 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as an opportunity to fight back to restore at least some of the 
loss," he said before joining a unanimous vote Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 New stores in the planned 309,000-square-foot addition are expected to do $75 
million a year in sales, increasing the city's sales tax revenue by $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have been trying to lure Bloomingdale's into the expanded mall 
to add a unique drawing card. But South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa also is 
bidding for the department store. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanded mall is expected to draw 90% of its new business from other malls 
-- primarily South Coast Plaza and neighboring Crystal Court, the Brea Mall and 
MainPlace/Santa Ana. City officials estimated that about 10% -- an estimated $3 
million -- would be shifted from other areas of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance Planner Patricia Temple said expansion of the outdoor mall is expected 
to put little pressure on the eight smaller commercial centers in the city 
which cater to small, specific local populations. Together, those areas 
generated $190 million in sales last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased traffic is anticipated for peak periods such as the Christmas 
season, but the city plans to use shuttle buses and other alternatives to 
alleviate potential holiday parking problems. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; 42 HOMES TO BE BUILT ON 9-ACRE NURSERY 
SITE

<P>
 A developer received approval this week to build 42 single-family homes on the 
site of a nursery. The City Council approved changing the property's zoning to 
allow more homes there and to make the tract compatible with adjacent 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a development agreement with Tava Development Co. to 
reimburse the city $233,000 for the cost of services incurred from the housing 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes will be built on the nine-acre site of National Grower, 17442 
Magnolia St. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Perea, planning services manager, said that the project has undergone 
planning changes to appease neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents had expressed concerns about the proposed lot sizes. As a result, 
Perea said, the developer has agreed to build homes on 7,200-square-foot lots 
instead of the original proposal to build 46 homes on 6,000-square-foot lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also wanted no access to the new tract from Winterberry Street, 
greater rear-yard setbacks to increase privacy and a minimum of noise during 
construction. Perea said these concerns have been addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 No one spoke in opposition to the project at Tuesday's public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin next spring, Perea said. DEBRA CANO

<P>
 The weekend should be a great one for outdoor sports and events, according to 
weather forecasters who predict warmer temperatures and clear skies for Orange 
County through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong winds should continue to buffet the Southland, with gusts of up to 35 
m.p.h. expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind advisories are in effect for mountain areas and the San Gabriel and San 
Fernando valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 According to WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times, 
temperatures today should reach the lower 70s and not dip below the upper 40s. 
Sunday should be a bit warmer with most of the gusty wind conditions, what 
forecasters describe as a "cool Santa Ana," gone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beaches, waves are expected to be 3 to 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters don't expect any rain for the county in the next few days, as 
several storms from the Pacific Ocean will move inland across the Rocky 
Mountains rather than over Southern California. LYNN FRANEY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 'MIRACLE' GIRL FROM CAR CRASH GREETS 
RESCUERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his 23 years as a firefighter, Capt. Dick Dobbin has responded to countless 
car accidents and witnessed far too many deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 So when he saw 17-year-old Kristine Stemples' crushed young body collapsed in 
the back of a wrecked car last summer, Dobbin seriously doubted that the girl 
would live. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday afternoon, the shy Simi Valley teen-ager who spent seven weeks in a 
coma walked into Ventura County Fire Station 44 to embrace Dobbin and other 
firefighters responsible for her rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," the blonde girl said to the crews from engines 40, 44 and truck 
30 -- all of whom responded to her accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look a lot better this time than the last time I saw you," Capt. Lee 
Heise told her. "It's a miracle you survived." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Kristine was critically injured when the car in which she was a 
passenger swerved off Tierra Rejada Road and plunged 100 feet down an 
embankment. Four other teen-agers escaped the car unhurt, but Kristine suffered 
massive head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Stemples said her daughter's doctors said Kristine would have died 
without county firefighters' fast response. "If she hadn't got (to the 
hospital) when she did, she wouldn't have made it," Stemples said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five weeks, Kristine has been relearning how to walk, talk and 
eat, her mother said. She hopes to return to Royal High School for the 
remainder of her senior year in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Since firefighters often don't know what happens to the people they rescue, 
Dobbin said seeing Kristine alive and nearly recovered was a reward for those 
who saved her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen too many people die," he said to Kristine. "I'm glad you're still 
here with us." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; KIDNAPING EXPERT ALLOWED TO TESTIFY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An expert on kidnaping will be allowed to testify at the Mark Scott Thornton 
murder trial, a judge ruled Friday, handing a setback to the man accused of 
killing Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan and abducting his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath said that psychologist Chris 
Hatcher may only testify generally about how kidnap victims become paralyzed 
with fear and other emotions when they are abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher will not be allowed to testify about harm done to the former 
girlfriend, Stephanie Campbell, whom Thornton has admitted abducting hours 
after O'Sullivan was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is charged with murder under the special circumstances of kidnaping 
and robbery, crimes that could send him to the gas chamber if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say he killed the nurse and stole her truck on Sept. 14, 1993. 
Then he kidnaped Campbell and kept her for five days, until he was arrested at 
a casino in Reno, they allege. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has said that Campbell was free to leave Thornton at any time 
during the five days they were together. But Campbell testified that Thornton 
was armed with a revolver and threatened to kill her if she tried to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatcher will testify that kidnap victims, especially young ones, frequently 
believe that they have a better chance at not being harmed if they cooperate 
with their abductors and do not try to escape, Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. 
Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher said that Campbell explained 
herself well enough during two days on the witness stand, and argued against 
Hatcher analyzing her actions for the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ms. Campbell's behavior was not so paradoxical that the jury couldn't 
understand it," the defense attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will begin its fourth week with testimony Monday. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; TELEDYNE AGREES TO SETTLE CIVIL CLAIMS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a third defense fraud case against its Newbury Park facility, Teledyne 
Industries has agreed to pay $850,000 to settle federal civil claims that it 
lied about the true cost of assembling electronic components for military 
aircraft, the Justice Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement announced last week resolves a whistle-blower's allegations 
that Teledyne failed to tell Defense Department officials it was using 
equipment in stock that was cheaper than what it charged the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was also accused of not telling the government it would require 
fewer hours of labor to build the instruments than originally proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Teledyne spokeswoman Rosanne O'Brien said the company denies the allegations 
but decided to settle because of the growing cost of litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the two other defense fraud cases, the allegations of wrongdoing 
centered on Teledyne's manufacture of "identification friend or foe" systems at 
its plant in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification systems, produced by Teledyne and other defense 
contractors, are used on virtually all military aircraft to identify friendly 
aircraft and thus avoid casualties from friendly fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike earlier cases that alleged falsifying tests of the instruments, this 
settlement focused on the prices charged to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The case came up when a Teledyne official accused his company of failing to 
provide real pricing data for contracts with the Army, Navy and Air Force from 
1987 to 1991, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was investigated by the Ventura County office of the FBI and an 
assortment of military investigators. KENNETH R. WEISS

<P>
 The California Highway Patrol arrested a man suspected of being a freeway 
flasher at his workplace Friday in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Murg, 35, of Temecula was booked by the CHP on suspicion of 
indecent exposure after he reportedly pulled alongside a female driver on the 
Artesia Freeway and exposed himself.The woman said the same man had exposed 
himself on the same freeway 10 to 12 times since August. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Sgt. Paul Golonski said that a driver, one whose front license plate had 
been removed, always exposed himself during afternoon commuter hours on the 
Artesia Freeway or the Corona Freeway in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Murg, a carpenter, has a 1993 conviction for indecent exposure and two prior 
arrests on similar charges, Golonski said. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP investigator Mike Pimento has asked that anyone with additional 
information call him at (714) 547-8311. SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: TUSTIN; TRAFFIC SAFETY MEASURE TARGETS PANHANDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Complaints by motorists who have been asked for money near automated teller 
machines and on public roadways have prompted city officials to enact a new law 
aimed at panhandlers, street vendors and other solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the traffic safety measure, which will go into effect Dec. 7, it will be 
illegal to solicit contributions, business or employment from motor vehicle 
occupants in the public right-of-way or in private commercial parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The justification for the new law is that solicitors tend to distract drivers, 
impede traffic flow and create safety hazards. Violators could be charged with 
an infraction or a misdemeanor under the City Code. The law, which is based on 
legislation enacted by Agoura Hills, received final approval this month by a 
unanimous vote of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Jim Potts introduced the measure after hearing from women at a 
public forum who said they had been frightened by panhandlers while they were 
shopping with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our residents have been complaining that people solicit them in the shopping 
centers, especially around the ATMs," Potts said. "And they wanted us to do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been problems with panhandlers and vendors who solicit 
motorists by standing in median strips and on the side of the road holding 
signs, Potts said.ALAN EYERLY

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 School district Supt. David Andrews has asked parents worried about passage of 
Prop. 187 to do nothing drastic and keep their children in school. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to parents earlier this week, Andrews said that it might take 
months or years before the courts resolve legal challenges to the measure, 
which was approved in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the California School Boards Assn. was among several groups that have 
filed suits contesting the constitutionality of the provision that would deny 
public education to children of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco Superior Court judge has issued a temporary restraining order 
against the implementation of the education ban pending further hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that Proposition 187 will be found unconstitutional in a number of 
areas, and, therefore, you must allow the courts to determine what parts are 
legal and what are not," Andrews wrote. He urged parents to call the principal 
of their children's school before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not do something drastic by taking your children out of school until we 
all know what the courts decide," he said. BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; THREE RECEIVE AWARDS FOR URBAN PLANNING

<P>
 An anti-graffiti program in Anaheim, a Fountain Valley affordable-housing 
program and a UCI doctoral student were all given awards by an organization of 
professional urban planners. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were announced this week by the California Chapter of the American 
Planning Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put Your Mark on the World, Not on the Wall," was recognized for its efforts 
to provide youths with alternatives to joining gangs. Anaheim was awarded the 
Education Project Award of Excellence for the anti-graffiti program, which 
sponsors poster, photography and T-shirt contests. Program officials say calls 
to the graffiti hot line are down 30% since the program started in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley received the Distinguished Leadership Merit Award for Heil 
Park, a 24-unit affordable housing project partially subsidized by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization singled out the city for overcoming the not-in-my-back-yard 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Academic Award was given to doctoral student Rachel Struglia for her 
paper, "Alternative Approaches to Urban Planning: Jane Jacobs and Feminist 
Urban Planners." 
</P>
<P>
 The points raised in the UCI student's paper "are salient to urban 
professionals today who constantly must seek to accommodate diverse viewpoints 
stemming from ethnicity, race and gender," a spokesperson for the organization 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 24 awards were given this year. More than 60 programs, 
organizations and individuals were nominated for awards. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY WORKERS TO GET THEIR FIRST RAISES IN 3 
YEARS

<P>
 For the first time in more than three years, city employees will receive 
salary increases under the terms of new contracts approved by the City Council 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Maintenance employees belonging to the Garden Grove Employees League and 
professional, technical and clerical workers in the Garden Grove Employees 
Assn. will receive 2% pay increases.Members of the Garden Grove Firefighters' 
Assn. will receive 5% merit increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary increases will take effect Dec. 31, except for firefighters, 
paramedics, fire engineers and fire captains, who will be eligible for pay 
raises July 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Services Director Steven Larson said a seventh step was added to the 
firefighters' salary range, and about 65 of the Fire Department's 93 sworn 
officers, who have worked at least three years, will be eligible for the pay 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the additional step was intended to reward employees for good 
performance over a long period of time, and to keep the salaries of "people at 
the top" competitive with those from neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees received their last increase in April, 1991, Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council unanimously approved the contracts Tuesday for the Garden Grove 
Employees Assn., which consists of 190 professional, technical and clerical 
employees, and the Garden Grove Employees League, made up of 87 maintenance 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Dinsen voted against the firefighters contract, saying 
the additional step in the salary range was wrong. He said the new step is an 
attempt to hide pay raises for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's going to be a pay increase, it has to go to the council, and the 
public made aware of it," Dinsen said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larson said that the merit increase would cost the city less than 
across-the-board raises. BERT ELJERA

ALLEGEDLY TROUBLED MAN FOUND BULLET-RIDDLED BUT ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A man whose parents told a court he was sometimes violent and troubled by 
drugs was found within blocks of their home Friday with six bullet holes in his 
body and in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul A. Vidana Jr., 23, of Santa Ana, whose parents had a restraining order 
against him, was found unconscious on a sidewalk at 1329 N. King St. at 3:39 
a.m. by passing motorists.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were just some citizens driving through the area," Lt. Robert Helton 
said. "They saw his body lying on the sidewalk and at first they were scared 
but then they made a U-turn and called us." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have no suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidana was in critical condition at UCI Medical Center. He had been shot five 
times in his upper torso and in his right eye by an assault-type weapon, Helton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating this as an attempted homicide. We've been out interviewing but 
we have no idea who could be responsible or what the motive is," Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Vidana's parents obtained an order in August 
restraining him from coming within 100 yards of them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 7, "he was out of control and under drugs or alcohol," Paul M. Vidana 
Sr., 47, said in the documents. "I called the police to remove him from my 
house. He verbally attacked me and acted like he wanted to fight. He was asked 
to leave by a police officer and later returned to my house to threaten me 
again. He threw objects at my security door and made threats at me and my wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Paul Vidana continues to live with me and my wife in his drug or alcohol 
state he will try to harm me or my wife. . . . I am asking the court to grant 
us this restraining order before someone gets hurt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vidana also said that his son hit him and broke his nose in January.  
</P>
<P>
 In the documents, the younger Vidana was alleged to have broken chairs and 
mirrors and made holes in the walls and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Aguilar, Paul Vidana Jr.'s brother-in-law, said Friday he is "a good 
kid. As far as I know he wasn't in any gangs." Aguilar said the family had 
spent most of the day at the hospital.

COMPETENCY QUESTION HALTS CHILD-TORTURE TRIAL; COURTS: TWO PSYCHIATRISTS SAY 
CYNTHIA MEDINA IS ABLE TO FACE CHARGES. DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS SHE IS 
'OVERWHELMED,' WILL GET A THIRD OPINION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A woman charged with torturing and sexually abusing her 10-year-old nephew is 
mentally competent to stand trial, two court-appointed psychiatrists reported 
to a Superior Court judge Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But at a defense attorney's urging, the judge agreed the woman may be examined 
by a third psychiatrist before the competency issue is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is a picture of insanity," said defense attorney Richard Gilbert. 
"My client is not able to help me with her defense. She's not able to cope. 
She's overwhelmed with sorrow and grief." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina, 31, is charged with three counts of felony child abuse and one 
count of torture. Authorities allege Medina abused her nephew over the past 
year by burning his tongue with heated knives and whipping him with electrical 
cords. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert's request for another psychiatric examination brings the criminal 
proceedings in the county's first child-torture case to a halt until the 
questions about her mental capability are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 If Medina is found competent -- either through evaluations or a hearing -- she 
would go back to Municipal Court for further criminal prosecution. A finding of 
incompetence means she would be sent to a state mental hospital until she is 
deemed able to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles J. Middleton said he believes Medina is perfectly 
competent to stand trial, as the two psychiatrists maintain. The question that 
needs to be settled to move forward with a trial is whether she is mentally 
competent now, Middleton said, not whether she was insane at the time the 
crimes were committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that that (the reports) would be sufficient," he said. "I don't 
know what Mr. Gilbert is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he plans to request a jury trial on the question of whether 
Medina is competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina is accused of assaulting the boy most severely on Sept. 7, when she 
punished him for playing with her marijuana cigarettes, allegedly searing his 
tongue with a heated knife again, beating him with a miniature baseball bat and 
sodomizing him with it, causing severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Edward Medina, 45, is accused of standing by while the boy begged 
for his help. He is also charged with three counts of felony child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said that Medina admits abusing the boy, but he contends that she was 
insane at the time. She has pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert complained that the district attorney's office has been unwilling to 
settle the case with a plea bargain. He insisted that the prosecution's plans 
to call the boy, and the Medinas' 9-year-old son, to testify during a trial 
could further traumatize the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the Medinas' son was also abused by Cynthia Medina, although 
not as severely. Gilbert said he plans to ask that a private attorney be 
appointed to protect the interests of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said his office is doing everything possible to mitigate any further 
trauma to the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My interests have always been to protect children from trauma as much as I 
can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is due back in court Dec. 2 with a report from the third 
psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The felony abuse charges each carries a sentence of two to six years in 
prison. A conviction for torture could result in a sentence of life in prison.

GRANT TO PAY FOR 'DECOY' PROGRAM TARGETING LIQUOR SALES TO MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said Friday they will spend a $97,000 state grant sending 
teen-age cadets into east Ventura County liquor stores to catch merchants in 
the act of selling booze to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Valley Sheriff's Station won the hefty state Department of Alcoholic 
Beverage Control grant to target liquor outlets in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and 
unincorporated areas, Chief Deputy Robert Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled to get the grant," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, east county deputies had used underage cadets about twice a year to 
try buying liquor from merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The new money will pay for one senior deputy and two sheriff's cadets to run a 
similar "decoy" program year-round, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned yearlong crackdown won quick praise from the head of the Ventura 
County chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol is the No. 1 killer of our teen-agers, so if we can get this taken 
care of, that would be fantastic," said Linda Oxenreider, president of Ventura 
County MADD. 
</P>
<P>
 A drunk driver killed Oxenreider's son and two other young men and injured two 
others in March, 1989, striking them as they walked away from a disabled car on 
the Conejo Grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of kids getting injured or killed in crashes," Oxenreider said. 
"I wish all the police and sheriff's departments had grants to do something 
like this and to get these liquor stores closed down." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one liquor merchant said Friday that police decoys are easily 
spotted -- they are the ones who stride to the counter with a single four-pack 
of wine coolers and nary a trace of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Sheriff's Department sends in decoys, they're pretty well trained . 
. . not to act as typical minors, but as mature drinkers," said Bill, an 
employee at Bakarat Liquor Market in Moorpark who would not give his last name. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his store consistently cards younger customers and even displays signs 
reading, "I'd card my own mother" and "If you're under 21, soft drinks are over 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be very surprised if there are any liquor stores that purposely sell to 
minors," he added. "The consequences of selling make us very vigilant." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, however, said, "We know that underage purchasers have a relatively 
easy time," and he estimated that about half of east county liquor stores do 
not card underage buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Several east county liquor merchants said they often are approached by young 
would-be drinkers with lame ploys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day," said Raymond Bahnam, manager of Park Oaks Liquor Store in 
Thousand Oaks. "Sometimes they don't have their ID on them, or they have some 
fake ID." 
</P>
<P>
 Other minors, he said, stand outside the store and offer a stranger $5 or $10 
to buy a 12-pack. But, Bahnam said, "I don't sell it to the other guy either, 
and I warn them, 'You're going to be cited . . . if they catch you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Few underage buyers come into Conejo Valley Liquor in Thousand Oaks, said 
owner Labib Hawa, but those who do stick out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the first thing you've got to do is ask them what their age is, 
then you ask them for ID," Hawa said. "You look at the ID, the date, the 
picture, height, eyes. Normally, you can tell by looking at them -- they're 
either shaking or not behaving normally." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will pay for one existing senior deputy to be reassigned full time 
to the program, and for two sheriff's cadets to work as decoys, said Sheriff's 
Lt. Marty Rouse, who heads the Moorpark Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also will buy a video camcorder and a pair of binoculars to be used 
for surveillance, and will pay for printing of pamphlets explaining the ABC law 
to merchants, Rouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, lack of funding has allowed only two decoy sting operations per 
year in east county, with perhaps 20 citations written each time, Rouse said. 
The misdemeanor violation of the business and professions code carries up to a 
$1,000 fine and repeat offenders can have their liquor licenses revoked, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While underage drinking itself is a problem, Chief Deputy Brooks said, 
cracking down on it also will "shut off the source of a lot of other problems 
that we have -- gang violence, other kinds of violence, traffic collisions."

NEW POLICE HEADQUARTERS ON CITY AGENDA; SIMI VALLEY: COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER 
SITES AND FINANCING FOR EXPANDED OFFICES. CURRENT STATION WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED 
IN JANUARY'S TEMBLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving ahead with plans to build a new police headquarters, the Simi Valley 
City Council on Monday will consider possible sites and funding sources for the 
multimillion-dollar station. 
</P>
<P>
 To best meet the space and location needs of the Police Department, the new 
station should be built on a city-owned lot next to City Hall or a nearby field 
owned by the Simi Valley Unified School District, according to a report 
compiled by consultant Ruth & Going. 
</P>
<P>
 The city commissioned the report after the current station suffered extensive 
damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of details to work out, but I think we're definitely on the 
right path," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "Our goal now is to keep the process 
moving along as smoothly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley could be eligible for as much as $3.7 million in federal 
quake-relief funds to help cover the $11-million cost of the station. An 
additional $2.9 million could be covered by the Community Development Agency, 
with the balance coming from the city's general fund and special districts, the 
report suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake was a terrible thing, but if it helps us get a new police 
station, that's a real benefit," said Councilwoman Sandi Webb, who pledged 
during her recent reelection bid to get a new station built. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's existing headquarters on Cochran Street was designed as a 
temporary facility, built in three stages between 1968 and 1973. It was 
remodeled for the Police Department in the 1980s at a cost to the city of $1.21 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-simmering plans to build a new station became urgent after the earthquake 
caused about $200,000 in damage. A floor sank six inches, walls cracked and 
broken water lines flooded locker rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the damage has been repaired, but the station falls far below 
earthquake building codes, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These buildings were not designed as a permanent home for the department," 
Stratton said. "What we have found is that it is virtually impossible to get 
the existing buildings up to code." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the department has outgrown its 19,200-square-foot facility, 
spilling over into neighboring buildings. The report recommends that the new 
station comprise about 53,000 square feet of space. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report, Ruth & Going outlined design goals for the station, including 
more space for offices, a crime lab, locker rooms and a community room. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project proceeds as planned, the city will select a construction 
manager and architect early next year. Construction would begin in May, 1996, 
and be completed in August, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Paul Miller, who will begin a term on the City Council later this 
month, is looking forward to ushering in the new station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have a real understanding of the needs of law enforcement," said 
Miller, a former Simi Valley police chief. "I can tell you this is something 
we've needed for a long time."

RAIDER FANS WENT TO ANAHEIM STADIUM, AND SOCCER GAME BROKE OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following statement was in The Times on Tuesday: "Al LoCasale, executive 
assistant for the Raiders, defended his fans, saying fights are expected any 
time half of the stadium is filled with people rooting against the home team." 
</P>
<P>
 If this is the attitude of Raider management, no wonder there are fights 
wherever the Raider fans go. I have been a Ram season ticket-holder for 24 
years, and I have yet to see the San Diego Charger fans that come en masse to 
Anaheim act like the Raider thugs. Even the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 
49ers, which always have many fans and are rowdy and spirited, react nothing 
like the Raider thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay in LA!

CHANGING TRADITION TO SAVE IT; O.C. FESTIVAL'S MARIACHIS SAY THE GENRE CAN'T 
SURVIVE WITHOUT EVOLVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In mariachi music, change is not part of a trend; it's a part of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we only allow our performers to play the music they were playing 40 or 50 
years ago, we'll never appeal to a younger audience," says Juan M. Elias, 
executive director of Arizona-based Los Ninos Production Co. The organization 
is holding its second annual Orange County International Mariachi Festival 
tonight at the Anaheim Convention Center, where six acts will play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn on a (Latino) radio station anywhere, and you might hear one or two 
mariachi tunes, and the rest of the tunes are something else," Elias said. 
"Even kids from Mexico are influenced by the sounds of the Top 40," so some 
mariachi musicians are starting to expand their repertoires to include material 
that can compete with contemporary tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, festival-goers will get a taste of experimental mariachi styles 
as well as traditional sounds. Scheduled to play are Mariachi Tlaquepaque of 
Placentia; Las Perlitas Tapatias of Guadalajara; South El Monte-based Mariachi 
Sol de Mexico de Jose Hernandez, and Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan of Mexico 
City. Mexican singer and actress Lucero and Tucson-based Ballet Folklorico de 
San Juan also will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Renowned for its inventive repertoire is Mariachi Sol de Mexico, which has 
been known to play big-band, classical and pop tunes as well as traditional 
material. Among the numbers that the 15-member group plans to perform Saturday 
is Austrian composer Franz von Suppe's "Poet and Peasant" Overture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-minute piece has been performed by mariachis in Mexico, but never in 
the United States and never with such an involved musical arrangement, said 
Jose Hernandez, the band's leader and arranger. "Imagine a 10-minute-long 
piece!" Hernandez said. In arranging the piece, "I utilize the many different 
colors of the mariachi sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, a fifth-generation mariachi player whose five brothers also are 
mariachi musicians, said he shrugs off suggestions from purists who say 
mariachi music should not venture into new territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been evolving for 200 years," Hernandez said. "For example, at the 
beginning of the century, a mariachi band had just three instruments -- a 
guitar, a harp and a violin. So when (purists) say, 'Let's preserve the 
tradition,' I say, 'It's too late.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who helped arrange the music for Linda Ronstadt's 1987 
Spanish-language album "Canciones de Mi Padre," said he has found that second- 
and third-generation Mexican Americans "like the old songs, but they also like 
the new arrangements. Other mariachis tend to play their songs just like on the 
records . . . but Mariachi Sol has that extra spark that has attracted a lot of 
kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call us the avant-garde of mariachis. Our signature song -- believe it 
or not -- is 'New York, New York.' " In fact, the John Kander-Fred Ebb title 
tune from the movie is the title track of Mariachi del Sol's new mariachi album 
for the EMI Latin label. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the adventurous material of Mariachi del Sol, Los Ninos 
director Elias hopes that headliner Lucero will help attract a diverse 
audience. Lucero, 25, has recorded 11 albums and is "someone the kids can 
identify with," Elias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Perlitas Tapatias of Guadalajara -- an all-female group -- represent 
another break with the mariachi tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, mariachi music has been dominated by men," Elias said. "Las 
Perlitas are a good role model for girls. They are people who came from humble 
beginnings, and now they've made it and are very exciting on stage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Elias also want to change the way they believe many Americans 
perceive mariachi musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been the stereotype of mariachi musicians who just play in 
bars and restaurants and sing 'La Cucaracha' and ' ay-yay-yay ,' " but that's 
changing, Hernandez said, thanks in part to festivals and albums that have 
helped spotlight the musicianship and creativity of mariachi musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Elias: Mariachis "are finally getting the respect they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 * The second annual Orange County International Mariachi Festival is tonight 
at the Anaheim Convention Center, 800 W. Katella Ave., Anaheim. 7. $18.50 to 
$56.50. (800) 882-1177.

FINDING THE HOME WHERE GRANT LEE BUFFALO ROAMS; POP BEAT: THOUGH STILL AT 
CULT-LEVEL, THE BAND'S DISCOVERED ITS NICHE: 'MOCKINGBIRDS' IS GETTING AIR PLAY 
AND THE GROUP WILL OPEN FOR R.E.M. 
</P>

 When Grant Lee Phillips headed south from Stockton a decade ago to study film 
at CalArts, his goal was to make a movie that was somewhere in between "The 
Wizard of Oz" and "In Cold Blood." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both road pictures," notes Phillips, who still harbors cinematic 
ambitions but for now channels his vision into the music of Grant Lee Buffalo, 
the trio he fronts as singer, guitarist and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, drummer Joey Peters and bassist Paul Kimble, who wrap up a two-night 
stand at the Roxy tonight, are still at cult-band level, but in just a few 
months their new album, "Mighty Joe Moon," has already outsold their 1993 
debut, "Fuzzy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mockingbirds" -- an apocalyptic scenario delivered in the form of a tender, 
Lennon-like ballad -- is being played extensively on a variety of radio 
formats, as well as on MTV and VH1, and the group is set to embark soon for 
Australia as the opening act on R.E.M.'s overseas tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty stunned, actually," Phillips, 31, says of the band's advances. "I 
didn't know that radio and television could do all that. Now we are at that 
point where we can play in new towns and see an audience, and that's kind of 
thrilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he's become a student of record marketing and radio programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not real preoccupied with that kind of stuff. It kind of makes my stomach 
turn a little bit. We just do what we do and those folks who like it will play 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But yeah, I've thought about that. Some of the stations that play 
'Mockingbirds,' I wonder if they will play a song like 'Lone Star,' which is a 
big black cloud, a big mess comin' down the road. . . . We can't be harnessed 
that easily." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. On "Mighty Joe Moon," the group blends roots-rock, folk-rock and 
classic-pop currents into a dreamlike canvas whose scale ranges from the 
intimate to the panoramic, the personal to the historical. Ambiguous and 
haunting, it sometimes evokes the nostalgic, sepia-tinted perspective of the 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I've heard that comparison before," Phillips says. "In some cases I 
feel like Robbie Robertson was probably trying to be truer to history. . . . 
Our songs are more like a tornado sort of came and rolled through history and 
picked it up and scattered it around in different places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of these songs are kind of searching . . . digging for some 
kind of meaning. I don't know that we necessarily find it, but a lot of them 
draw questions: 'What do you believe in and what can we believe in?' " 
</P>
<P>
 That concern might stem in part from the influence of the several Pentecostal 
preachers in the Phillips family tree. His forebears moved to California from 
Oklahoma, Kansas and Arkansas during the Great Depression, and his introduction 
to music came on visits to church with his grandparents. "It was Pentecostal," 
he says, "but musically if you walked in you'd think it was the Church of Jerry 
Lee Lewis." 
</P>
<P>
 During high school in Stockton, Phillips played in a band and, after 
relocating to L.A., he was seduced away from his film-school plans by the 
Hollywood rock scene. Working as a house roofer by day, he played in the group 
Shiva Burlesque for seven years before forming Grant Lee Buffalo with Kimble 
and Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 It's taken a while, but he finally feels at home in his adopted basin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more time that I spend away from Los Angeles, the more I realize how Los 
Angeles our music all really is. . . . You know, there's moments where it's 
very serene and it's very still, and then there's other times when it's more 
jagged and unpredictable, and that sounds like Los Angeles to me. I think we're 
a fine reflection of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * Grant Lee Buffalo and Giant Sand play tonight at the Roxy, 9009 Sunset 
Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. $15. (310) 276-2222.

HARRY GAMBOA'S EAST SIDE STORY; THE ARTIST WORKS IN A WIDE RANGE OF MEDIA TO 
REFLECT CULTURAL POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Gamboa Jr. is sipping coffee in Philippe's, the downtown deli he's been 
using as his unofficial office for years. A few blocks away, the Los Angeles 
River separates the central city from East L.A., where he grew up -- a 
neighborhood he has come to see as an "urban desert." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean to imply that it's a negative place," he says, "although of 
course a desert can be dangerous. But if you can adapt to this harsh 
environment you can have fun, even though it makes you grow scales, spines and 
a thick skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa certainly adapted. 
</P>
<P>
 One of five children in a poor Mexican immigrant family that settled in L.A. 
in the late '40s, he was raised speaking Spanish, then plunked into an 
English-speaking school that had little patience with his language 
difficulties. Perpetually at odds with authority figures at school and on the 
streets, he remembers that by the time he graduated from high school all he 
wanted to do was "explode." What he did instead was become an artist, a course 
that was set early in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 6 years old, some gang members in our neighborhood rounded up a 
bunch of us small kids and forced us to watch them stab a guy to death," 
Gamboa, 43, recalls. "I realized then that gangs weren't for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the odds were still against Gamboa going on to make 29 videos, 
one of which -- "L.A. Familia" -- will be included in next year's Whitney 
Biennial in New York. He's also written several plays (one of which was 
produced at the Los Angeles Theatre Center), landed two fellowships from the 
National Endowment for the Arts, a grant from the J. Paul Getty Trust Fund for 
the Visual Arts, taught video at UC San Diego, and contributed a story to the 
catalogue for MOCA's 1992 exhibition "Helter Skelter." Tonight, his multimedia, 
interdisciplinary exhibition "The Urban Desert" opens at Cal State L.A. as part 
of LAX/94. 
</P>
<P>
 Working extensively in photography, Gamboa draws on cultural experience and 
politics for his work. However, he doesn't assume the overtly nationalist 
stance of many Chicano artists. Instead, his work has an experimental, 
avant-garde flavor that seems to have little to do with his upbringing. But 
then again . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I barely graduated from high school, and from the first grade on only 
attended 50% of the time," says Gamboa. "When I first went to school I was 
given some construction paper and told to make a cone. The teacher wrote 
something on it and put it on my head, and told me to sit in front of the 
class. The word she'd written was Spanish , and she told me I could take it off 
when I learned to speak English. That was my first conflict at school, and for 
the next 12 years my rage increased every time I got slapped or kicked by the 
police or school administrators, or saw those things happen to my friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Garfield High School, which was very racist and anti-Mexican -- in 
fact, all of East L.A. was extremely segregated then," continues the artist, 
who now lives in Silver Lake. "I was constantly organizing and putting out 
newspapers and flyers, and in the '60s I was involved in the early Chicano 
movement that led to many L.A. schools being temporarily shut-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Chicano activism was part of a larger anti-Vietnam War/civil rights 
movement -- and unfortunately, the goals of the '60s haven't been achieved. In 
fact, we've lost ground since then and young Chicanos have a whole new set of 
problems now. The negative stereotypes haven't gone away -- they've just 
changed. The stereotype used to be that we were simplistic, passive peasants 
with hat in hand, or super-loyal sidekicks; now we're seen as gang members, or 
illegal aliens trying to get into the country so they can become gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't much on the walls of the house I grew up in," says Gamboa, 
charting his early exposure to art. "But my mother's a great storyteller, my 
dad drew caricatures all the time, and he worked as a printer so we always had 
lots of colored paper in the house -- we were always making collages." 
(Something in the household was obviously hospitable to art; one sister, Diane, 
is a painter, and another, Linda, is a poet and video performer.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Art and political activism began to coalesce for Gamboa in 1972 when he 
co-founded ASCO with fellow artists Patssi Valdez, Gronk and Willie Herron. A 
guerrilla performance group with a disparate range of influences that stretched 
from the Mexican muralists to glitter rock, ASCO staged confrontational works 
about problems in the Chicano community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think art can bring about real social change, but it can bring about 
subtle changes in attitude and that belief drove ASCO," says Gamboa of the 
group, which functioned until 1975, then re-formed occasionally for special 
events until 1987 when it formally disbanded. Since then, Gamboa has worked 
largely on his own; the Cal State show, however, incorporates the efforts of 40 
people and includes performances. It marks a return to large-scale 
collaboration for an artist who has spent recent years concentrating on a more 
solitary form. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing is central to everything I do, but oddly enough, I've been influenced 
more by filmmakers than by writers," says Gamboa, who plans to begin working on 
a novel after "The Urban Desert" closes. "Luis Bunuel, Charlie Chaplin, Orson 
Welles and Buster Keaton have been hugely important for me -- and the cartoons 
'Heckle and Jeckle' and 'Screwball Squirrel' are in there too," he says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 That range of influences is central to Gamboa's ability to draw on the duality 
of his culture in a highly personal manner, and to create experimental works 
that exude a quality of cool, cerebral detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always identify myself as a Chicano in my work because I think it's 
necessary," he says, reflecting on the through-line in his work. "I see what I 
do as part of an ongoing Chicano movement and I've never intentionally made a 
work that wasn't political. I wouldn't say that I see myself as part of an 
oppressed minority, but I do think my particular group of people has been 
subjected to a lot of disinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm less angry about that now though," he adds. "One of the hard lessons I 
learned is that if you get angry and stay angry you get sick. I don't want to 
get sick so I avoid people and situations that make me angry. I've learned I 
need to maintain a level of stability in order to be a functioning artist, and 
I seem to be learning how to do that."

'SCARLETT' MINISERIES FALLS SHORT OF CBS' EXPECTATIONS; TELEVISION: ALTHOUGH 
THE PROGRAM HAD SOLID RATINGS, IT DIDN'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT WAS PROMISED 
ADVERTISERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who loved Hollywood's most celebrated romance, "Gone With the Wind," had 
to wait 55 years for its sequel, "Scarlett," the $45-million CBS miniseries 
that concluded Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 So with a buildup like that, the network expected viewers to stage a Sherman's 
March to get to their TV sets for it. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of women did just that. And for an eight-hour miniseries, it pulled down 
solid ratings overall, drawing an average of 17.6 million households a night, 
or 28% of all the homes watching television nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, "Scarlett" fell short of expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 When CBS sold advertising time for the program in June, the network guaranteed 
advertisers that a whopping 36% of the viewing audience would want to see 
Scarlett O'Hara (Joanne Whaley-Kilmer) wooed once more by Rhett Butler (Timothy 
Dalton). 
</P>
<P>
 "Scarlett," however, fell 22% short of that projection in a business where 10% 
is considered acceptable. Now, CBS must give back free advertising time -- 
totaling $3 million-$5 million, according to the network -- in other prime-time 
programs to make good on its promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a successful miniseries," said Paul Schulman of the Paul Schulman Co., a 
New York agency that buys advertising time for corporations. "It's just not the 
blockbuster they anticipated for the amount of time it took to produce it, the 
amount of money they sunk into it and what they sold advertising for." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem was generally tepid reviews, for which no CBS promotional 
punch could compensate. "If every review had been favorable and glowing, then 
it would have done much better," said Betsy Frank, senior vice president at 
Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Scarlett," for which CBS reportedly paid a $20-million license fee, was 
probably most limited by its narrow appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest reason why it didn't do the numbers of a 'Lonesome Dove,' for 
example, is because it was a female special," Schulman said. "It didn't have 
the dual audience appeal that other miniseries have had, like 'The Stand' 
earlier this year on ABC. This was a special for women." 
</P>
<P>
 David Poltrack, executive vice president of research for CBS, agreed. "There 
wasn't enough male appeal that it wasn't vulnerable to counter-programming," he 
said. Some of "Scarlett's" competition over the week included many programs 
popular with men, such as "Home Improvement," "Frasier," "NYPD Blue" and "ER." 
The first hour of "Scarlett's" big finale Thursday night was beat head-to-head 
by two episodes of "Seinfeld" on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to draw the men away from shows like that, whereas a 
miniseries like 'The Stand' will," Poltrack said. "The Stand," based on Stephen 
King's apocalyptic novel, averaged 19.4 million TV households on ABC over four 
nights in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scarlett" reflects an overall trend occurring this fall at CBS, which has 
been somewhat taken aback by the strength of its competition. When CBS sold 
time in "Scarlett," it was still the No. 1-rated network. Now, CBS trails ABC 
in season-to-date ratings, while NBC is a close third and actually is beating 
CBS in adults 18 to 49, an age group that commands a premium rate from 
advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 All season long, CBS prime-time programming has been receiving lower ratings 
than it guaranteed to advertisers, resulting in numerous make-goods across the 
board. That's part of the risk of doing network business, said Poltrack, who 
added that the network's performance has been improving and has approached 
projected levels the last couple weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "With advertiser guarantees, you want to get as close to the rating as you 
possibly can without going under," he explained. "You don't want your program 
to outperform your guarantee, because then, in effect, you are giving away free 
inventory. So you try to get as close as you possibly can."

POORMAN: OUT WITH A FLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 KDOC Channel 56 has stripped Jim (Poorman) Trenton of his teen-advice show 
after Trenton did the same on the air Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Trenton said he doffed his clothes during his midnight "Love Channel" call-in 
show as a last-ditch effort to save the program, which was scheduled to end 
following Friday's show anyway because he could no longer afford to lease the 
air time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I'd get some needed attention," Trenton said in a statement. After 
four months on the air, he was unable to generate roughly $75,000 a month in 
advertising revenues to support the five-night-a-week show, his publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of good on the show, and this is the way I'm repaid," he said. 
"Besides, the camera never showed (frontal) nudity; when it went below my 
waist, I had a baseball cap on my lap." 
</P>
<P>
 Network One, which on Nov. 1 began syndicating "The Love Channel" in New York, 
Washington D.C., San Diego and several other cities, has enough first-run 
episodes to continue airing it through Dec. 22, a programmer at the Woodland 
Hills outlet said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Poorman, who previously was suspended in a contract dispute by 
radio station KROQ-FM (106.7) from his love-and-sex advice show "Loveline," is 
seeking another television station from which to broadcast "The Love Channel," 
his publicist said.

STIFF POLAR BLASTS CHILL THE VALLEY; LIGHT SNOW AND DRIZZLE FALL; WARMING AND 
CLEARING ARE FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Blasts of polar air gave the usually warm winds of a Santa Ana condition the 
cold bite of an East Coast fall Friday, bringing the San Fernando Valley and 
surrounding area its first real nip of winter and the season's coldest day to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Light snow teased the area north of the Santa Clarita Valley, creating 
momentary early-morning pauses on roadways in Gorman and the Antelope Valley, 
but never amounting to more than a light drizzle and melting on contact below 
3,500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing because we don't have any pretty snow, but we also didn't 
have a bunch of wrecks and people sliding into each other," said Deputy Ed 
Grantham of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still cold, though." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Basin, highs Friday of only 59 at the Civic Center and lows 
there of 50 gave the area its lowest peak temperature on record. The coldest 
high temperature previously recorded on a Nov. 18 was 61, in 1982, said Stuart 
Seto of the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 And as cold as it was Downtown, it was even colder through most of the Valley. 
Highs here Friday were as cool as 55 in Burbank and lows were as low as 39 in 
Woodland Hills, where there was also a trace of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the chill had Angelenos buttoning their jackets, it still was not 
cold enough for authorities to open the Valley's only cold-weather shelter for 
the homeless at the National Armory Guard in Van Nuys.  
</P>
<P>
 Through late fall, a federally funded program goes into effect at 22 locations 
in Los Angeles County, but the shelters open only when there is a forecast of 
temperatures falling to below 40 degrees or a 50% chance of rain. During the 
second phase of the program, which begins Dec. 13 and continues through Feb. 
28, the shelters will be open every night, regardless of weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it was cold enough Friday in the Antelope Valley to open a 
50-bed shelter at Catholic Charities in Lancaster. Information about the 
shelters can be obtained daily after 11 a.m. by calling (800) 548-6047.  
</P>
<P>
 The worst is probably over for now, forecasters said. Although lows Friday 
night were expected to hover only around 42 and lows in cold spots like 
Woodland Hills, Canoga Park, Santa Clarita and Newhall were expected to dip 
down to freezing, National Weather Service meteorologists were projecting a 
gradual warming beginning tonight. Sunday is expected to bring more normal high 
temperatures in the 60s and 70s and lows in the 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some store owners weren't complaining. Don Phillips, a manager at Sport Chalet 
in West Hills, said business picked up dramatically toward the end of the week, 
as if the cold weather was both an impetus to buy jackets, parkas, gloves and 
scarves and a reminder that the ski season has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repair shop is going crazy," Phillips said. "Everyone's getting ready for 
the season. All of our rains had snow in the mountains this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cold finally brought people in the stores."

BEILENSON CLAIMS SLIM WIN OVER SYBERT; POLITICS: GOP CHALLENGER CALLS FRAUD AND 
SAYS HE MAY ASK CONGRESS TO DENY A SEAT TO THE NINE-TERM DEMOCRATIC 
REPRESENTATIVE. HE ALSO THREATENS A LAWSUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) declared victory Friday over 
Republican candidate Rich Sybert, but Sybert said he may ask Congress to deny 
Beilenson his seat on grounds of election fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 With some ballots still uncounted, Beilenson campaign manager Craig Miller 
said he expects the nine-term congressman to maintain or increase his lead of 
3,206 votes -- just five more than when election officials finished the first 
tally of ballots on election night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race is clearly over. We clearly have won," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert acknowledged that the vote totals so far favor Beilenson but refused to 
concede the election. Sybert said he and his campaign staff are examining the 
possibility of filing a lawsuit against Beilenson or petitioning the 
GOP-controlled House of Representatives to refuse to seat him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to be guilty of sour grapes," said Sybert, an attorney and 
former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. "If the final result is that he won, I'll 
wish him well. . . . However, I think there are some serious questions about 
whether his tactics were honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, 42, spent more than $1 million on his struggle to dump Beilenson, 62, 
a fixture in California politics for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle in the 24th Congressional District attracted national attention as 
several GOP heavyweights raised campaign cash for Sybert, including U. S. Sen. 
Bob Dole (R-Kansas) and Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). The district covers the 
western San Fernando Valley and nearby coastal areas, running from Sherman Oaks 
and Malibu in Los Angeles County to Thousand Oaks and the Conejo Valley in 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ventura County election officials announced that Sybert had won in 
that portion of the district, tallying 27,440 votes to Beilenson's 15,386. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert's Ventura victory was not enough to offset Beilenson's lead in the 
far more populous Los Angeles County segment of the district. As of Friday, 
Beilenson had 92,733 votes in both counties, and Sybert had 89,527. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County voter registrar said 69,000 votes 
remain to be counted countywide, but she did not know how many of those were in 
the 24th District. A final count should be available next week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, Beilenson's campaign manager, said, however, that in two previous 
vote-count updates in Los Angeles County, Beilenson had increased his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can only go up at this point," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said poll-watchers for his campaign reported that ballot boxes were 
left unlocked at some Encino polling places and absentee-voter lists were not 
maintained, raising the possibility that some voters cast two ballots in an 
area he described as a Beilenson stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert also charged that brochures distorting his positions had been mailed to 
Republican voters the day before the election by two nonexistent GOP groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In one brochure, he said, Beilenson -- a veteran liberal -- was pictured next 
to former Sen. Barry Goldwater, a well-known GOP conservative, with a slogan 
proclaiming, "The Tradition Continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said another brochure sent to GOP voters described him as being "in 
league with right-wing extremists" on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it falsely stated he favored the gag rule, which prohibited employees 
of 4,000 federally funded family-planning clinics from giving clients 
information about abortion services. The rule, imposed in 1988 under former 
President Ronald Reagan, was reversed by President Clinton last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had last-minute lies," said Sybert. "They were not distortions. They were 
not gross distortions. They were flat-out fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he was unaware of any irregularities at county-run polling places 
and, if any occurred, they were not the fault of the Beilenson campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had no knowledge of the alleged Goldwater mailer, but acknowledged 
that the Beilenson campaign had sent out the brochure attacking Sybert on 
abortion, which Miller defended as accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the charge that Sybert supported the gag rule was based on his 
signing of the "Contract for America," a declaration of conservative values 
promoted by the national Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said one provision in the contract backed the gag rule, and suggested 
Sybert may not have thoroughly read the document. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rich Sybert felt he could buy the election with his personal wealth," said 
Miller. "Obviously, he's very disappointed that he couldn't. Now he's trying to 
find something that explains his defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said his campaign staff is exploring the possibility of filing a 
lawsuit against Beilenson or asking the House of Representatives to refuse to 
seat him. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited as precedent the House's refusal to admit former Rep. Adam Clayton 
Powell in 1967. The House shut its doors to the flamboyant Harlem Democrat 
because he had misused public funds. The U. S. Supreme Court later ruled that 
the House could not exclude Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller responded that Sybert's campaign mailers had distorted Beilenson's 
positions on the death penalty and immigration issues. He said Beilenson had 
engaged in no fraud and predicted that the House would not "reverse how the 
voters in a particular district voted."

187 SHOWS CLERGY'S WEAK INFLUENCE ON ELECTORATE; RELIGION: CATHOLICS SUPPORTED 
ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MEASURE IN DROVES DESPITE MANY CHURCHES' OPPOSITION. 
SOME SAY FLOCK NEEDS EDUCATION, SOME SAY SHEPHERDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When California voters -- especially Catholics -- resoundingly approved 
Proposition 187 over the opposition of many of their churches, they raised 
serious questions about the power of religious leaders to sway political 
debates with moral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's big victory revealed "a Catholic electorate which 
increasingly seems to view the statements of its pastoral and moral leaders as 
having little credibility or urgency," lamented The Tidings, the newspaper of 
the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, in a post-ballot editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the election turned out signaled "an alarming trend," in the Catholic 
Church, which already has "a shepherd-flock gap" between the attitudes of lay 
Catholics and their bishops' strict stands against legalized abortion and the 
death penalty, wrote Editor Tod Tamberg. 
</P>
<P>
 While Protestant voters heavily favored 187 at the polls, Protestantism's 
plethora of denominations and long tradition of emphasis on individual 
conscience often weaken efforts to rally churchgoers to one side of a 
moral-political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church, by contrast -- the largest denomination in the state, 
representing about 25% of the electorate -- has a hierarchical structure that 
can marshal its many pulpits to one side, as happened with Proposition 187. Los 
Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was especially active in the anti-187 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Catholics overall opposed the initiative by a narrow 51%-49% 
(according to The Times' exit poll), it was favored 58% to 42% by non-Latino 
white Catholics. That put those white Catholics -- who outnumbered nonwhite 
Catholics 2-1 at the polls -- precisely in step with the 59% of the rest of the 
electorate who voted "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The result appears to indicate that white Catholics simply shrugged off the 
cardinal's stern denunciations of the proposition as inhumane and immoral. 
</P>
<P>
 One devoted parishioner who objected to her priests' homilies against 187 was 
Pat Shuff of Fullerton. She said she and her husband have significantly scaled 
back their contributions to the church as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are here illegally are breaking the law. I don't think we should 
pick and choose which laws we should abide by," she said. Not only that, Shuff 
said, "I do believe in separation of church and state, and I don't think it was 
proper for the church to take a stance." 
</P>
<P>
 Several readers wrote to The Tidings last week, objecting to Tamberg's 
editorial lamenting the failure of Catholic voters to heed the cardinal's 
urgings, the editor said in an interview. The writers protested that the 
bishops had taken the liberal side of a social dispute "and that they should 
stick to religion and stay out of politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tidings, celebrating 100 years of publishing, has a largely older, 
non-Latino white readership that has dwindled to 27,000 in recent decades. An 
experimental one-year plan that will double circulation may be put into place 
early next year, Tamberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamberg, 31, of Studio City, was named editor two years ago -- a job he says 
consumes between 60 and 70 hours a week but which he enjoys. Born in Burbank, 
Tamberg majored in theology and philosophy at Notre Dame while writing for the 
university's newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The editor said in an interview that he believes the Catholic Church needs to 
continue educating members about the social implications of their faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Cardinal Mahony said 187 was an affront to human dignity, for instance, 
many Catholics will hear that as a political statement, rather than a teaching 
that draws upon church tradition," Tamberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at all the state's mainline religious leaders who spoke against it" to 
little or no effect, he said. "These are people who know the Gospel and their 
churches' tradition. I think we have a great deal of educating to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' exit poll showed that of the 48% of voters who identified 
themselves as Protestant, 69% said they voted for 187. That might seem 
surprising in light of the public opposition expressed by United Methodist, 
Episcopal, Presbyterian and other mainline church leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the many religiously and culturally conservative Protestant churches 
and bodies around the state were silent on the issue. And even in the oldline 
denominations, church executives say they can do no more than recommend stances 
on selected propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some clergy see the split between their moral views and those of the laity in 
their churches as a warning sign that perhaps the clergy need "educating" too.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not listening to our own constituency," said Bishop Roy Sano, who 
heads the Pasadena-based California-Pacific Conference of the United Methodist 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt we could have done more" in opposing 187, he said, but mainline 
denominations, while remaining faithful to Christian ethics, need to hear what 
church members are saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishop said that political analysts who describe the Democratic Party as 
isolating itself from voters could have been describing church leadership as 
well. "We have to address what is behind some of the voting pattern -- the 
anxiety arising from tax burdens and the feeling of being inundated" by 
immigrants, the bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic bishops are aware of the dangers of overloading parishioners with 
social and political lectures, said Julie Sly, communications director for the 
Sacramento office that represents the bishops' positions on public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of parishioner resistance to "a barrage of information to vote this 
way or that way, the bishops have been very selective the last few years in 
taking stances on state propositions," she said. For example, the bishops took 
no official position last year on the private-school voucher initiative -- 
which would have been a financial boon to the large Catholic school system -- 
and none this year on the smoking and "three strikes" propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops "deliberately tried to argue the case against Proposition 187 on a 
higher plane, drawing on specific church teachings," Sly said. "We have tried 
to limit the statements to the initiatives which have clear moral or ethical 
implications."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: REPORT TO LOOK AT CHARITIES' HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the holiday season approaching, the Los Angeles Times Valley Edition is 
preparing a special report on the status of charities in the Valley and how 
they have fared after the string of disasters that have struck the region in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, to run next week, will include a listing of many of the 
organizations needing help and donations for the holiday season.Groups that

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: COUNCIL FIRES CITY ATTORNEY IN 3-2 VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando fired its legal counsel, Julia Sylva, of the Los 
Angeles law firm Ochoa & Sillas, during a closed session that occurred after 
midnight at a City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 3-2 to fire Sylva, who has represented the city on legal matters 
since July of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Doude Wysbeek, who once publicly berated Sylva at a council 
meeting, said Friday that last week's action was taken because Sylva "wasn't a 
team player, she just wasn't compatible. A lot of it was personality 
conflicts."  
</P>
<P>
 Council members Raul Godinez and Rosa Chacon voted against the firing. Godinez 
said he thought Sylva was a victim of a "political power play" and that the 
lawyer "was never given a chance to perform and was never trusted." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said Sylva was often left out of the loop on matters of legal concern 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylva will continue representing the city until a new law firm is hired. She 
declined to comment on the council's action, but issued a brief written 
statement saying: "I believe we have performed to the highest standard in 
rendering legal services to the city. There has been a change in the makeup of 
the City Council and it is the prerogative of the majority to change city 
attorneys, it happens all the time."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Wysbeek, council members Raymond Ojeda and Joanne Baltierrez 
voted to terminate Sylva and her law firm as the city's legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek said he was never comfortable with the council's decision last year to 
terminate its former legal counsel, Rutan & Tucker, which had represented the 
city for 14 years. "Nobody was consulted, and it wasn't an openly discussed 
matter," he said. "Somehow, the proposal to fire them was approved." TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DOG PARK PROPOSED IN SEPULVEDA BASIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Park department officials have announced their intention to create an 
off-leash dog park in the 1,200-acre Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the two-acre area, estimated at about $60,000, would be split 
between private sponsors, such as pet food companies, and the city, parks 
officials said at a users committee meeting Thursday. The site proposed for the 
park is a vacant, weedy lot between the National Guard Armory and a day-care 
center on Victory Boulevard just west of Balboa Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members approved of the park, but all 30 in attendance objected to 
the location. Some noted that the entrance to the existing parking lot there is 
narrow. Others cited environmental concerns, noting that noise from the dog 
park could disturb migratory waterfowl that stop to rest in preserves located 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 They suggested another spot, farther east on Victory, near a driving range and 
a parks department building. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials appeared disheartened at the prospect of revising their plans 
and said it would take time to conduct studies of the alternative site. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a victory for them that the dog park found any support at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous proposals for such parks in Los Angeles have met with fierce 
opposition from those who oppose designating parkland for use by animals and 
therefore reducing its usefulness to humans without pets. Of the city's 300 
park facilities, only one has an approved dog park -- the small, secluded 
Laurel Canyon Park on Mulholland Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 A citizen-led drive last month to open a new dog park at Silver Lake 
Recreation Center was resisted by some residents who feared that babies would 
be mauled by unleashed canines and that dog-borne diseases would be contracted 
by humans using the park. Others complained about odors from dog feces and the 
spread of fleas. 
</P>
<P>
 The parks department ultimately decided to establish the Silver Lake dog park 
as a one-year pilot project. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Rose, a spokesman for Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the area, 
said the proposed dog park in the Sepulveda Basin would be totally fenced-in, 
landscaped and located "at least 1,000 yards away from the nearest residence."  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Andervich, assistant general manager for the parks department, said he is 
negotiating with several pet food companies to have them help pay for the park 
in exchange for letting them use the space for occasional promotions, Andervich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we know the people don't like our first choice for the park," 
Andervich said. "We'll take another look at it." TIM MAY

RAM DRAFT REVIEW A MIXED BAG; FOOTBALL: THERE IS PLENTY OF GOOD AND BAD TO GO 
AROUND REGARDING THE TEAM'S YOUNG TALENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After bypassing quarterback Trent Dilfer and failing to trade for Alvin 
Harper, Ram Coach Chuck Knox summarized his team's draft last April by telling 
reporters that "time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months later, time has told us that only one of the Rams' 10 draft picks 
has cracked the starting lineup -- right tackle Wayne Gandy, the 15th overall 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has told us that safeties Toby Wright (second round) and Keith Lyle 
(third round) have shown promise on special teams but aren't starting. 
</P>
<P>
 And time has told us that the Rams' investments in small college defensive end 
Brad Ottis (second round) and Auburn tailback James Bostic (third round) 
haven't paid off yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottis barely plays and Bostic, who hasn't suited up for a game all season, is 
on the injured reserve list after aggravating an old wrist injury in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I would give the Rams' draft a 'B,' " said Joel Buchsbaum, draft 
analyst and contributing editor for Pro Football Weekly. "I think they did a 
pretty good job because they went out and got a lot of players that look like 
they can contribute down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 A vision for the future? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, they went shopping for overall depth and speed for their 
lackluster special teams. Rather than spend the fifth pick overall on Dilfer, 
as Knox had promised he would, they traded down with Indianapolis and San 
Francisco, picked up lower-round picks and invested in: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gandy, who was a bust at left tackle until he replaced an injured Jackie 
Slater at right tackle a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bruce, the first of the Rams' three second-round picks, has three touchdown 
catches, which is three more than Jessie Hester, who starts ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wright, the Rams' projected starting strong safety, returned a fumble for a 
touchdown against New Orleans and proved himself as a heavy hitter on special 
teams by breaking Kevin Lee's jaw in an exhibition game against New England. 
But he can't beat out Marquez Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lyle, the first of three third-round picks, has played on passing downs and 
kick returns and coverages and backs up Anthony Newman at free safety. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Rams' low-round picks have made a significant impact, although 
D'Marco Farr, a rookie free agent from the University of Washington, played 
well in place of an injured Sean Gilbert for two games. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the others: Wide receiver Chris Brantley (fourth round) has two catches 
for 12 yards and linebacker Ernest Jones (third round) has been out with a knee 
injury since August. Tight end Rickey Brady (sixth round) and offensive tackle 
Ron Edwards (sixth round) have yet to play a down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have an excellent rookie group," Knox said. "Wayne is starting and 
D'Marco was a big plus for us. The two safeties have done an outstanding job 
and Isaac Bruce is going to be a great receiver." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams haven't had a winning season since 1989, giving them the luxury of 
drafting high and landing impact players. Their previous two first-round 
selections -- Gilbert and tailback Jerome Bettis -- reached the Pro Bowl last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But only four players the Rams drafted since Knox replaced John Robinson in 
1992 are in the starting lineup -- Gandy, Gilbert, Bettis and tight end Troy 
Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 Four players from the 1992 draft have started in spots -- quarterback T.J. 
Rubley, offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore, fullback Tim Lester and wide receiver 
Todd Kinchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Russell White, a third-round pick last year, was overweight, too slow 
and never played. The Rams cut him on the first day of training camp this 
summer, and receiver Sean LaChapelle, a fifth-round pick in 1993, was out the 
door a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bostic has emerged as this season's version of White, spending all season on 
the scout squad until injuring his wrist in practice. The Rams placed him on 
the injured-reserve list Wednesday to clear a roster spot to re-sign backup 
quarterback Jamie Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottis, discovered by defensive coordinator George Dyer at Division II Wayne 
State in Nebraska, has played on special teams and in goal-line situations. But 
he toils as a third-stringer on the defensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ottis is playing and there are a number of second-round and third-round draft 
picks who have been cut by teams," Knox said. "Bostic, in my opinion, is going 
to be a fine running back. We have some running backs here right now that have 
more experience than he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 73 players taken in the second and third rounds last spring, six have 
been cut, but 10 have made impacts as starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: Philadelphia running back Charlie Garner, Cincinnati receiver 
Darnay Scott, San Francisco kicker Doug Brien and Pittsburgh running back Bam 
Morris, who filled in nicely for an injured Barry Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams drafted Bostic as a backup tailback and fullback, but couldn't find 
room for him in a crowded backfield that includes Bettis, David Lang and Johnny 
Bailey at tailback and Howard Griffith and Tim Lester at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bostic was a good back in college because he was the featured back," 
Buchsbaum said. "But he's not going to beat out a Jerome Bettis. I think he's 
tough enough that he can learn to block and eventually team up with Bettis." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram coaches had the same idea, but Bostic struggled to learn the fullback 
position in training camp, and has had trouble learning the Rams' system all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has taken me some time," Bostic said. "I have a lot of good guys in front 
of me who know the game better. This is more of a learning year for me, like an 
extra year of college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning both positions was sort of a setback because I couldn't concentrate 
on just one. It took me a while to learn both." 
</P>
<P>
 Ottis made a more drastic transition. 
</P>
<P>
 He went from a tiny Division II school, where he dominated as a four-year 
starter, to a pro game where he was suddenly lost in the shuffle. His size (6 
feet 4 and 272 pounds) and speed weren't as dominating as in college.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big jump from even Notre Dame to here," Dyer said. "That was part of 
it for Brad, learning the game once he got here. But he's a bright guy, a tough 
guy and can run and hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he can miss as a prospect. We've had Robert Young, Fred Stokes 
and Gerald Robinson come along this year, so Brad is behind a lot of 
experience. That's why he's not playing much." 
</P>
<P>
 Ottis can find inspiration from Buffalo wide receiver Don Beebe, who played 
two years at Chadron (Neb.) State before the Bills took him in the third round 
of the 1989 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Beebe caught only 17 passes as a rookie, but slowly worked his way into the 
starting lineup as Jim Kelly's second and third receiver on the Bills' four 
Super Bowl teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving up to this level is like starting high school or college all over 
again -- you're back to the bottom," Ottis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I didn't think it was going to matter coming from a small Division 
II school to this level, but I have noticed that people look at you a little 
differently because you're not a Division I player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I need to prove myself at this level, but I haven't had the opportunity 
yet." Rating the Rams' Draft 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams originally said they wanted a quarterback in the first round of the 
1994 draft but bypassed Fresno State's Trent Dilfer and traded down and loaded 
up on middle-round picks. The strategy: Add depth and boost lackluster special 
teams. But has it worked? Only one of the Rams' 10 draft picks is 
starting--first-round pick Wayne Gandy, who was beaten out by free-agent 
Clarence Jones at left tackle, then got the starting nod at right tackle five 
weeks ago when Jackie Slater went out with a torn triceps. A look at the Rams' 
1994 selections through 10 games: * Rnd. (No.): 1 (15th) Player: Wayne Gandy 
Pos.: OT Comment: Bust of draft until replacing Jackie Slater at right tackle; 
should make 5th consecutive start Sunday 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 2 (33) Player: Isaac Bruce Pos.: WR Comment: Three touchdowns 
catches among league's rookie wide receiver leaders; why isn't he starting? 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 2 (49) Player: Toby Wright Pos.: DB Comment: Heavy hitter on 
special teams, but couldn't beat out Marquez Pope as starting strong safety 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 2 (56) Player: Brad Ottis Pos.: DE Comment: Small-college player 
with small impact. Playing only on special teams and goal-line situations 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 3 (71) Player: Keith Lyle Pos.: DB Comment: See Wright. 
Considered the team's free safety of the future 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 3 (83) Player: James Bostic Pos.: RB Comment: Russell White of 
1994; Inactive each week, placed on injured reserve Wednesday with wrist injury 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 3 (100) Player: Ernest Jones Pos.: LB Comment: Placed on injured 
reserve in August with a knee injury 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 4 (108) Player: Chris Brantley Pos.: WR Comment: Two catches for 
12 yards; he's no Isaac Bruce 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 6 (167) Player: Rickey Brady Pos.: TE Comment: Sought from 
Oklahoma as a backup to Troy Drayton but now on practice squad 
</P>
<P>
 * Rnd. (No.): 6 (189) Player: Ron Edwards Pos.: OT Comment: Big, slow and 
inactive; Was waived and then re-signed in October MIKE REILLEY

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; SADDLEBACK TOUGH, BUT 
SAILORS WIN

 Brian Johnson's 183 rushing yards and two blocked punts by Scott Sandstrom 
carried top-seeded Newport Harbor past stubborn Saddleback, 28-14, in a 
Southern Section Division V first-round playoff game Friday night at Newport 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The undefeated Sailors matched the school record for victories with 11, but it 
wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor surged to a 21-7 halftime lead despite an offense that featured 
Johnson and little else. He rushed for 111 first-half yards, including a 
56-yard score on the game's first play. The rest of the team accounted for 
three yards in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback countered Johnson's score with a 66-yard, 10-play drive, capped by 
Danny Verino's 29-yard run. That gave the Roadrunners a 7-6 lead, but then 
Sandstrom struck, setting up Newport Harbor's next two scores. His first block 
at the end of the first quarter gave the the Sailors the ball at the Roadrunner 
30. After five Johnson runs, Jeremy Mason bulled in from the two. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saddleback's next possession, Sandstrom again stormed over left end for a 
block, this time leaving the offense at the Roadrunner 20. Again, Johnson got 
everything but the score, carrying three times for 15 yards before John 
Giordani connected on a five-yarder to Danny Pulido. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Rodriguez's eight-yard pass to Jose Roman made things interesting at 
21-14 with nine minutes left, but the Sailors tore downfield and put the game 
away on a seven-yard pass from Giordani to Matt Riggle.

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I; LOS ALAMITOS TOSSES ASIDE 
DEL REY LEAGUE FOE ST. JOHN BOSCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes said before Friday's game against Bellflower 
St. John Bosco that his team was ready to make a point. Or accept a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been bad-mouthing us on how tough the Del Rey League is," Barnes said 
of his opponent. "We'll find out. For us, it's a real important game." 
</P>
<P>
 And admittedly, St. John Bosco was tough. But not tough enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos matched the Southern Section record for games without a loss, 46, 
by scoring a 37-22 victory over St. John Bosco at Gahr High. The Braves (5-6) 
were the division's at-large team from the Del Rey League. 
</P>
<P>
 The standing-room-only crowd of 4,000 watched the Griffins (11-0) tie Temple 
City (1969-73) and Canyon Country Canyon (1983-86) in the record book. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great accomplishment and a credit to the past teams that started (and 
continued) the streak," said quarterback Kevin Feterik, who passed for 246 
yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the process of winning their first Division I playoff game after 
dominating Division II the past two seasons (and tying for the Division III 
title in 1991), they also made a statement. Los Alamitos will play Long Beach 
Poly next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in the future (we'll beat them)," St. John Bosco Coach Jerry Person 
said. "I've got to give it to them -- those guys are the real deal with their 
passing game. They can throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear a lot that the Sunset League is soft," receiver Brad Melsby said. "We 
wanted to prove something about Orange County football tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby caught eight passes for 146 yards and three touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 Although St. John Bosco controlled the ball in the second half, its 31-7 
halftime deficit was too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik was nearly flawless in the first half, completing 12 of 15 passes -- 
and one was dropped -- for 210 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of those scores went to Tony Hartley on the game's first drive, a 
swift 77-yard, seven-play journey that lasted 1:59. Feterik set up St. John 
Bosco's defense with inside screen passes, then sucked it into looking for Ryan 
Gragnano on the run. Then he found Hartley racing down the sidelines; Hartley 
caught the ball in stride and kept running, to the back of the end zone.  
</P>
<P>
 And the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos next got the ball on the St. John Bosco 35, and Ben Hughes kicked 
a 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And then Melsby took over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins' next three drives ended with Melsby catching the ball over his 
shoulder, racing untouched into the end zone or spinning off would-be tacklers. 
He finished the first half with seven catches for 119 yards and three 
touchdowns of seven, 30 and 26 yards.

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION VII; POMONA GANESHA SHUTS DOWN 
RANCHO ALAMITOS

 Rancho Alamitos Coach Doug Case was upset his team had to face top-seeded 
Culver City in the second round. But Case won't have to worry about that now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros, rocked by off-field distractions and injuries, were upset Friday 
night by an inspired Pomona Ganesha team, 12-6, at Bolsa Grande High in front 
of about 600 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without three starting defensive players and one reserve, Case was 
forced to start freshman David Vickers and sophomore Mike Hanley at linebacker 
and receiver Kevin Allen at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Rancho Alamitos players, two of them starters, were arrested Thursday in 
connection with the murder of a 15-year-old Garden Grove High student. Starting 
receiver/cornerback Jeff Turbarg did not play because of a concussion he 
suffered last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the faces weren't there," Case said. "It's tough when you go 12 weeks 
with the same guys, and then you don't have them there when you need them." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the defense held together fairly well. Vickers, who played on 
the freshman team, recovered a fumble in the first quarter and made several big 
hits. Two other freshmen, Nu Atuatasi and Gerald Laird, also played on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real nervous," said Vickers, whose brother Leon was an All-County 
player at Rancho Alamitos two years ago. "It was hard with three freshmen 
playing. Sometimes we were lost out there." 
</P>
<P>
 But the offense seemed even more lost. Rancho Alamitos' vaunted running game 
was stuffed for much of the game by Ganesha's eight-man line. Quarterback John 
Frank completed only three of 14 passes for 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't execute," Case said. "We couldn't run against their line and then 
every time we passed, it was the wrong route or a bad pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said he missed Turbarg, whom Allen replaced, the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin is a great receiver, but we haven't had time to jell," Frank said. "We 
weren't on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos (7-3-1) scored with five minutes left in the first quarter on 
a two-yard run by Leo Kosi that was set up by Chris Young's 26-yard run. But 
the closest the Vaqueros got after that was the Ganesha three-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganesha (6-4) scored with six minutes left in the first half, and then scored 
the winning touchdown on a four-yard touchdown pass from Kyyahn Lundy to 
Anthony Collins with 3:10 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros, who reached the Division VII finals the last two years, got the 
ball back two more times, but never crossed the Ganesha 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the fourth quarter, I was trying my best to get the team pumped up, but it 
just wasn't there," Frank said.

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; VILLA PARK HANDLES CORONA 
DEL MAR, 43-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean McMahon wishes every game could be like this, but he knows they all 
can't, so he's just grateful whenever they come around. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Villa Park High quarterback was feeling especially fortunate Friday 
night after his team's outstanding, balanced performance in a 43-21 Southern 
Section Division V playoff victory over Corona del Mar in front of about 300 at 
El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon completed 10 of 14 passes for 219 yards and four touchdowns with no 
interceptions for the Spartans (10-1). He threw two touchdowns to wide receiver 
Sean Adams in the second quarter to help give Villa Park a 20-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams had 103 of his 117 receiving yards in the game's first 24 minutes. His 
final touchdown, which covered 14-yards, came with 8 minutes 15 seconds 
remaining in the third quarter and helped Villa Park to an insurmountable 28-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Sam Stremick caught McMahon's final touchdown toss with 5:32 
left in the game -- a 45-yard pass that gave Villa Park a 40-21 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a lot of great receivers made great plays all night," McMahon 
said. "I just got them the ball and they broke tackles and got away." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park plays Servite next Friday. Servite defeated Western, 12-0, in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans' running game was also impressive. Tony D'Amato carried 18 times 
for 122 yards and two touchdowns, and Bo Barnes gained 105 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our running game set up everything," McMahon said. "We try to be this 
balanced every game, but it just doesn't always work this way. Tonight it did." 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, D'Amato rushed in from 18 yards with 10 
minutes to play in the second quarter. Tim Redfern's point-after gave Villa 
Park a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar (5-6) was unable to score until 4:30 remained in the third 
quarter when quarterback Josh Walz ran in from one-yard out. Walz, who 
completed 10 of 14 passes for 167 yards with two interceptions, scored all of 
the Sea Kings touchdowns with one-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
 His third short touchdown run, with 6:52 to play, capped a 68-yard drive and 
cut the Spartans' lead to 34-21. But McMahon and Stremick combined for the long 
touchdown pass to squash any hopes of a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense they were playing left me one-on-one with the cornerback," 
Stremick said, "and Sean made a great throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was kind of surprising. We thought they were going to be a lot better 
than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Redfern's 34-yard field goal closed the scoring with two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hogan, one of the county's best running backs, gained 97 yards in 22 
carries to lead Corona del Mar. Walz had 63 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is really coming together now," McMahon said. "We knew we had a job 
to do tonight and we came out and did it. Now we have to keep working."

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; SCORECARD: COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE 
FIRST ROUND OF THE SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ONE RECORD FALLS 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan McGraw took over the top spot on the county's single-season scoring 
list with a four-touchdown performance in Laguna Hills' 42-6 victory over Lake 
Elsinore Temescal Canyon in the first round of the Southern Section Division 
VIII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw has 234 points this season, surpassing the previous mark of 222 shared 
by Mike Jacot of Southern California Christian in 1991 and Jeff Byrd of Rancho 
Alamitos in 1992. ONE RECORD DOESN'T 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's standout running back Charles Chatman finished the season with 
2,500 yards rushing -- 96 yards shy of tying him for the Orange County 
single-season record of 2,596 yards set by Jeff Byrd of Rancho Alamitos in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A good run through the Division VIII playoffs probably would have easily given 
the Mustang senior the all-time mark, but the Mustangs were upset, 28-12, by 
Riverside Norte Vista. Chatman rushed for 191 yards in 16 carries Friday. A 
SILVER LINING 
</P>
<P>
 Their football team lost by 40 points at Orange Coast College, but at least 
someone returned home to Redlands a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mater Dei booster club's 50-50 raffle collected a whopping season-high 
$1,764, half of which goes to the school and the other half -- $882 -- to the 
lucky ticket holder. This time it just happened to be an out-of-towner. ON THE 
RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no wind . . . I'm in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Barnes, Los Alamitos coach, who had feared bad weather conditions 
would hamper the pass-oriented Griffins during their Southern Section Division 
I playoff game against run-oriented St. John Bosco. POWER OF THE PRESS 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona Ganesha Coach Garry Norvell said his team got all the motivation it 
needed to upset Rancho Alamitos, 12-6, in a Division VII game by reading The 
Times on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "What affected us most of all was the Orange County papers writing that we 
were already beat," Norvell said. YOU CAN GO HOME 
</P>
<P>
 One person on Savanna's side of the press box Friday night at Glover Stadium 
was considerably more animated than anybody else. He exulted after every 
Savanna score and looked in pain whenever El Toro scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he a booster, an assistant coach, an overzealous parent? No, it was none 
other than Paul Waldrop, who led the Rebels to the Division VI title last 
season. But Waldrop went home unhappy; El Toro won the Division V game, 35-33. 
THE NEW PIONEER 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Conrad was starting his second game ever for Western Friday, but he 
easily could have been the starter all year. Coach Jim Howell said Conrad 
showed good skills during spring drills, "but so did Dean Chambers." 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers, who threw for 1,110 yards and 12 touchdowns during the regular 
season, is out because of a torn knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conrad also wanted to stay with his friends on the sophomore team, so we kept 
him there," Howell said. "But he's definitely a name for the future. He's going 
to be a real good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad threw for 120 yards but completed only six of 23 pass attempts in the 
Pioneers' 12-0 loss to Servite in a Division V game. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not see anything terribly great out there. I'm not taking anything away 
from them, but had we executed, it would have been a good, tight football 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Cunningham, University coach, after the Trojans lost to La Mirada, 
24-0, in a Division VIII game. WEDGE-BUSTER 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the best part about Mater Dei scoring 10 times Friday was watching Jose 
"Choo-Choo" Frayne run down the field 11 times (including the second-half 
kickoff on the Monarchs' kickoff team. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's self-proclaimed wedge-buster would either beat the Redlands 
blockers down field before the could set up or would hurdle himself at the 
kick-returner to disrupt him. A LONG TIME AGO 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they lost Friday in a Division I playoff game, Bellflower St. John 
Bosco's senior knew what it was like to beat Los Alamitos. The Braves defeated 
the Griffins, 35-0, when they were freshmen. NICE TIMING 
</P>
<P>
 Bellflower St. John Bosco didn't show much knack for timing before the Braves' 
game Friday against Los Alamitos. The team ran off the field as the Los 
Alamitos band began playing the national anthem. They finally got off as the 
final chords were being played. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to make big plays. We had to make sure they didn't 
make too many." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mike Milner, El Toro coach, after the Chargers held on for a 35-33 victory 
over Savanna, which won the Division VI championship last season. HOW TOP 10 
FARED 
</P>
<P>
 Results of games involving teams in the Orange County Sportswriters' Poll: 
</P>

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; VALENCIA'S SURGE CONTINUES 
AS WESTMINSTER FALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia, continuing its late-season surge, held Westminster to 95 net yards 
and picked up a 28-0 victory in a Southern Section Division V first-round 
playoff game Friday at Westminster High. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia (5-5-1), which won its fourth consecutive game, will play host to 
Foothill in the quarterfinals next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last four weeks our team has really been stepping it up," quarterback Joe 
Secoda said. "The offensive line is opening some huge holes, the defense has 
allowed 14 points the last four games -- everyone has been stepping it up big 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers scored on their first three possessions, taking advantage of a Lion 
fumble and a pair of punts to take a 21-0 lead. Sophomore Aaron Carbajal 
accounted for all three scores on runs of one, one and two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster (6-5), which lost its final three games of the season, advanced as 
far as the Tiger 30 on its opening possession before losing a fumble. The Lions 
managed just one first down the rest of the half and did not move the ball into 
Valencia territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions' Todd Mann recovered an on-side kick to start the second half. After 
one Westminster first down, two Valencia sacks helped the Tigers get the ball 
back on downs. Valencia sacked Westminster quarterback Jerry Allison nine 
times. Rhett Shepard and Steve Flores each had two sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers padded their lead midway through the third quarter, when Secoda 
connected with sophomore Jermaine Gray on a 32-yard scoring pass to make it 
28-0. Secoda completed nine of 11 passes for 142 yards. ERIC MADDY

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; FOOTHILL'S DEFENSE SETS IN 
DEFEAT OF KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Foothill's defense dominated Friday night as the fourth-seeded Knights won 
their sixth game in a row, defeating Kennedy, 27-9, in the first round of 
Division V Southern Section playoffs at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' defense held the Fighting Irish to 141 yards of total offense and 
sacked quarterback Jason Myles four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior defensive linemen Rich Bowman and Tony Tuioti and sophomore linebackers 
Lawrence Mariner and Rubin Vaughn didn't give the 5-foot-7 Myles a moment's 
peace. They were in his face all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been calling themselves the Black Blanket or something like that," 
Foothill Coach Tom Meiss said. "I called them the Wild Bunch all week. They 
have been uncontrollable."  
</P>
<P>
 Foothill meets Valencia, a 28-0 winner against Westminster, in the second 
round of the playoffs Friday at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariner gave the Knights (7-4) their first scoring opportunity when he stepped 
in front of running back Charlie Marino and intercepted a pass by Myles. 
Mariner returned the ball 30 yards to the Irish five-yard line. Quarterback 
Tyler Lang scored on a five-yard run two plays later with six minutes and 16 
seconds remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy (8-3) began the second quarter with a 60-yard drive to Foothill's 
18-yard line, but the Knights' defense was able to stall the drive and the 
Irish settled for a 36-yard field goal by Shy Azoulay. 
</P>
<P>
 On their ensuing possession with 3:45 left in the half, the Knights' Tramel 
Robinson took a swing pass at the line of scrimmage and ran around the 
defenders for a 40-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' defense stopped Kennedy's offense in four plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with six seconds remaining in the half on a fourth-and-18 play from the 
Irish 28, Lang hit sophomore Danny Monarch in the corner of the end zone to put 
the Knights up, 20-3. MELANIE NEFF

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; SERVITE SHUTS OUT BATTERED 
WESTERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the playoffs, pretty and artistic are nice afterthoughts. The objective is 
to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite met that objective with a 12-0 victory against Western in a Southern 
Section Division V playoff game Friday night at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back David Bedard gained 75 yards and scored one touchdown in 23 
carries and Marvin Smith's 15-yard return of a fumble enabled Servite (9-2) to 
reach the second round. The Friars will play Villa Park, a 43-21 winner over 
Corona del Mar, next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and the inability to take advantage of the few scoring opportunities 
it had sent Western (7-3-1) home a loser. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't embarrass ourselves," Western Coach Jim Howell said. "But we didn't 
do everything we could. We played hard, but couldn't get anything going 
consistently on offense. But they're a good team. We were competitive, but just 
not good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they would be physical," Servite Coach Larry Toner said after Western 
stopped the Friars twice inside the 10-yard line on fourth-down plays in the 
first quarter. "They were the first team all year, maybe in years, to stop us 
at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you lose your starting quarterback like they did, it's difficult to keep 
your team's belief system going. But they did." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers, a wild-card entry from the Orange League, came into the game an 
injured team. The biggest loss was starting quarterback Dean Chambers, who 
sustained a torn knee ligament in a 24-7 loss to Valencia three weeks ago. 
Western's hopes were in the hands of sophomore Jimmy Conway, making only his 
second start on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway had a hard time throwing the ball, getting sacked twice and completing 
six of 23 passes for 120 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Western was hurt by three fumbles, two of which it lost, and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 On Servite's first two possessions -- one set up on a blocked punt by Jeff 
Cortese, who had another block in the second quarter -- the Friars got inside 
the Western 10, only to have the drives stopped on fourth down plays. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Friars dominated the second quarter, driving 80 yards in 18 plays to 
score. Bedard got the touchdown on a one-yard plunge. The extra point was 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Western had two opportunities to score. The Pioneers attempted a 51-yard field 
goal in the first half but Bryant Zant's kick hooked wide left. And toward the 
end of the half, Josh Burdett ran to the Servite 15, but fumbled and Friar 
linebacker Tony McCanta recovered.

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V; EL TORO ESTABLISHES EARLY 
LEAD, MANAGES TO HOLD OFF SAVANNA

<P>
 El Toro took an 18-point lead in the first half and held on to upset 
second-seeded Savanna, 35-33, in a Division V playoff game Friday night at 
Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro running back Jamie Hanaway scored the eventual winning touchdown on a 
21-yard run with 6 minutes 3 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, El Toro plays the winner of tonight's Canyon-Loara game. 
</P>
<P>
 After Savanna closed to 35-33 on a 33-yard touchdown pass from Jeremy Klemp to 
Edrick Ennis with 4:05 left, Hanaway picked up first downs on two straight 
third and two situations to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanaway finished with 154 yards in 24 carries, including 103 in the second 
half. He also caught three passes for 20 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna (8-3) hurt itself with three turnovers, and committed two crucial 
errors on special teams in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hanaway caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Brian Wilson to give El 
Toro a 14-10 lead in the second quarter, Savanna's Mike Flores fumbled the 
ensuing kickoff, and Jeremy Jarrett recovered for El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Joe Ader scored on a one-yard run to give El Toro a 21-10 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After stopping Savanna on its next possession, the Chargers' Mark Gates 
blocked a punt and Jarrett returned it 15 yards to the Rebel one-yard line. 
Wilson then scored on a one-yard run. GABE LACQUES

 "I knew our kids would bounce back after that tough loss to Valencia last 
week," Brea-Olinda Coach Jon Looney said. "Defensively, they couldn't run 
against us and then we got some good pressure on them in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Jones had two of the Wildcats' four sacks, and the pressure helped create 
three interceptions. Brea-Olinda's defense hounded and pounded the Centurions 
(6-5) all night. Five Centurions were helped off the field in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Mendez, a 5-foot-10, 150-pound sophomore, was the most severely injured 
Century player. After the first play from scrimmage in the second half, he 
collapsed on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was delayed 30 minutes while team doctors and paramedics tended to 
Mendez. He was taken by ambulance to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, where 
he is listed in serious but stable condition, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unconscious for a brief period," said Dr. Scott Fischer, an orthopedic 
surgeon who serves as Century's team doctor. "They're going to examine him to 
see if there is any other injury besides a concussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Century's lone highlight came in the third quarter, shortly after Mendez was 
taken to the hospital. Stan Villanueva completed a 45-yard touchdown pass to 
Jorge Rodriguez to cap a nine-play, 76-yard drive, cutting the lead to 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda used big plays to set up its three first-half scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Freeze, who caught four passes for 115 yards and a touchdown, caught a 
39-yard pass from Matt Kalcevich to help set up a nine-yard touchdown run in 
the first quarter by Jerome Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-yard run by Owens helped set up a 25-yard field goal by Tommy Prenovost, 
making the score 10-0 with 3 minutes 57 seconds remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeze caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Prenovost with 22 seconds left in 
the half to make the score 17-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda put the game out of reach early in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Dusty Coffey intercepted a pass at the Century 35 and returned it to the two. 
Two plays later, Owens, who rushed for 47 yards in 14 carries, scored a 
touchdown on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 On Century's next possession, Erik Taylor intercepted a pass and returned it 
75 yards for the final touchdown.

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I; MATER DEI SURPRISES COACH 
WITH BIG VICTORY

<P>
 It's not often Coach Bruce Rollinson is rendered speechless after a game. But 
Mater Dei nearly did it to him Friday night in the opening round of the 
Southern Section Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs scored on nine of 11 possessions, and the defense made all the 
big plays. That resulted in a 53-13 thrashing of Redlands in front of 5,000 at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm shocked. I'm not prepared to talk about a one-sided game," Rollinson 
said. "Nobody has stopped them all season. I'm very pleased with the defense 
and offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Second-seeded Mater Dei (11-0) will meet Loyola, a 34-8 winner over Lakewood, 
in the quarterfinals. The Monarchs were unstoppable. The only two times they 
didn't score came on a missed 50-yard field goal and a final possession that 
ended on downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarchs running backs Steve Bodnar and Joey Trampush each scored twice. 
Bodnar rushed for 91 yards and Trampush 78. Quarterback John Flynn threw for 
two touchdowns, completing 12 of 19 for 159 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time the Terriers (5-6) threatened to make it a game came on a 
38-yard touchdown pass from Nick Day to Johnny Fultz that gave them a 7-3 lead 
seven minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei scored 10 points in the final 1:17 of the first half, then broke the 
game open to start the second. Jeremy McGlasson forced a fumble by sacking Day 
and two plays later, Bodnar scored from the one. Jeff Felix then tackled the 
Terrier punter in the end zone for a safety and a 36-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollinson removed his starters with 1:14 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about playing on Thanksgiving," he said. "Now it's down to three 
(games). We'll see what happens." MICHAEL CASEY

 Fontana played brilliantly Friday night in defeating Edison, 30-7, in the 
opening round of the Southern Section Division I playoffs in front of about 
2,500 at Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the Steelers' reward? A second-round meeting with La Puente Bishop 
Amat, The Times No. 1-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we've got to play (Bishop Amat) sometime, we might as well play them 
now," Fontana Coach Dick Bruich said. "If we can't beat them now we won't beat 
them later." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana running back Art Gipson rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns, 
including a game-breaking 84-yard scamper in the fourth quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 Charger quarterback Patrick Markovsky, who was harassed in the backfield and 
in the secondary, completed 15 passes for 159 yards, and was intercepted twice. 
He also was sacked four times for minus-33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do anything right on offense," Edison Coach Dave White said. "Their 
defense dominated the football game." The 12th-ranked Chargers finish 8-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite dominating for much of the first three quarters, No. 17 Fontana (8-3) 
led only, 14-7, after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucien Robinson gave the Steelers a 21-7 cushion early in the fourth 
quarter, when he found room over the right side and scampered 53 yards for a 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana added a safety when Oskar Reyes blocked an Edison punt out of the end 
zone with 9:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers closed out the scoring with 7:38 remaining on Gipson's long 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana took a 14-0 lead midway through the third quarter when Gipson broke a 
tackle over the left side and ran it in for a 24-yard touchdown. MARK STRODER

<P>
 For one quarter, Mission Viejo held its own against the top-ranked team in the 
nation, but reality soon set in. 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente Bishop Amat scored 21 points in the second quarter and rolled to a 
42-11 victory in the first round of the Division I playoffs Friday at Bishop 
Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Lancers (11-0) will meet Fontana, which defeated Edison 30-7, 
in the second round next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diablos (5-6) moved the ball all night against Bishop Amat, but were hurt 
by four turnovers, two of which were returned for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get beat up, we just got outscored," Mission Viejo Coach Bill Denny 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After keeping a scoreless first quarter, Bishop Amat's Roger Ollano 
intercepted a pass by Mission Viejo quarterback Austin Moherman pass on the 
first play of the second quarter and returned it 30 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Another turnover set up the Lancers' second touchdown and Ralph Brown then 
partially blocked a punt giving Bishop Amat the ball at the Mission Viejo 
31-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, James Free hit Kory Minor on a six-yard touchdown pass with 
1:01 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo moved the ball inside the Lancers' 15-yard line three times in 
the third quarter, but got only 11 points from the drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Fielding kicked a 29-yard field goal and later scored on a five yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon, who gained 189 yards in 19 carries, ran for an 80-yard 
touchdown in the third quarter and Trey Sorensen picked off another Moherman 
pass and returned it 30 yards for a score. DAN ARRITT

PREP EXTRA / SOUTHERN SECTION PLAYOFFS; DIVISION VII; ARROYO GRANDE KNOCKS OUT 
FULLERTON DESPITE TURNOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A safety midway through the fourth quarter proved costly Friday night for 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian quarterback Gabriel Almanza was called for intentionally grounding the 
ball in the end zone to avoid a sack, putting Arroyo Grande up by nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles went on to score a late touchdown, clinching a 23-7 victory in a 
first-round game of the Southern Section Division VII playoffs at Doug Hitchen 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to read the rule book before commenting on that play," Fullerton 
Coach Julian Smilowitz said, "but that's the first time I've seen points given 
on a penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Grande (9-1) won despite turning the ball over four times, including 
three lost fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The game started poorly for Arroyo Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Jimmy Pratt fumbled the opening kickoff twice. The second muff was 
recovered by Fullerton's Wayne Navarro at the 16-yard line and Christopher 
Young needed only one play to put the Indians up, 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Young ran 16 yards on a sweep around right end for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton (6-5) didn't score the rest of the game, and Arroyo Grande 
bounced back with 312 yards of total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle defense held Young, Fullerton's 1,100-yard rusher, to only 45 yards 
in 13 carries. It also limited the Indians to 69 yards rushing and 158 yards in 
total offense. ERIC BURDICK

INTERCEPTS IN SOUTH HILLS' VICTORY

 Quarterback Brett Pierce made his biggest plays as a defender to lead West 
Covina South Hills past Los Amigos, 14-3, in a Southern Section Division VII 
playoff game Friday night at Garden Grove High.  
</P>
<P>
 Pierce picked off counterpart Ape Tuato three times, returning the last one to 
the Lobos' six-yard line.Mikal Meister cut through the Los Amigos defense on 
the next play to seal the victory with the Huskies' final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, nursing a sore hamstring, also came up big offensively. He opened the 
scoring for South Hills (9-2) by hitting brother Sean Pierce with a touchdown 
pass in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Pierce also caught a 53-yard flea-flicker from Jose Vera after flipping 
the ball laterally to Vera and sprinting down field. Pierce completed six of 18 
passes for 57 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos (9-2) blew several scoring chances after opening the game with a 
28-yard field goal by Warren Roberge. The Lobos rolled up 163 yards offense in 
the first half, but turned the ball over three times, all in South Hills 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobos had their best chance to get in the end zone in the third quarter. 
Tuato connected on passes of 37, five, and 15 yards to drive Los Amigos to the 
nine-yard line. But the Huskies' defense swarmed running back Greg Fausto on 
third down to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 South Hills Coach Steve Bogan credited the pass rush, along with Pierce's 
all-around play, for stoping the Lobos. "We kept enough pressure on (Tuato) so 
he couldn't throw comfortably," Bogan said. DAVID GRIMM

TOTALLY SHUTS DOWN GARDEN GROVE

<P>
 Sunny Hills' smothering defense limited Garden Grove to 26 net yards and two 
first downs, one on a penalty, as the Lancers blanked the Argonauts, 12-0, in 
the opening round of the Southern Section Division VII playoffs Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts, who will play Lompoc next week, never crossed midfield as the 
Lancers completely dominated the game.Garden Grove (4-7) was held to minus-five 
yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove had its best field possession on the opening kickoff return by 
Ruben Reyna to the Argonauts' 45, but three successive penalties, totaling 20 
yards, started a long night for the offense. Reyna's 10-yard run on the third 
Garden Grove drive produced Garden Grove's only non-penalty first down of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills' quarterback Greg Garand injured his ankle at the end of the 
second drive. Senior Scott Warkentin replaced Garand and generated a 73-yard 
scoring drive for the Lancers late in the first half. Chris Velotta scored from 
the one, but the extra point failed and Sunny Hills took a 6-0 lead with 22 
seconds left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills (5-6) recovered two fumbled punts to maintain ball control for 
most of the second half but could not put the game away until Garand, returning 
in the fourth quarter, scored on a fourth-down plunge with 4:09 left in the 
game, concluding a 28-yard drive. Daniel Amosa broke up the two-point 
conversion pass to preserve the 12-0 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 With Garand missing more than half the game, Velotta was called on to carry 
the ball 26 times, gaining 97 yards. The Lancers have won four of their last 
five games. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

 Laguna Hills running back Brendan McGraw may have had other chances to break 
the Orange County season scoring record late in the season, but Hawks' Coach 
Steve Bresnahan was happy he picked Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw rushed for 240 yards and four touchdowns to break the record and lead 
the Hawks to a 42-6 Division VIII playoff victory over Lake Elsinore Temescal 
Canyon at Mission Viejo High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (9-2) plays Temple City next week. Temescal Canyon ended the 
season 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, who entered the game two touchdowns shy of the record set in 1991 by 
Southern California Christian's Mike Jacot, broke the record on a one-yard run 
with 34 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had chances in the past few weeks to get Brendan the record," Bresnahan 
said. "But it was good to see him get the record on a night when he had to work 
hard to get his yards, and it was in a legitimate game that really meant 
something."  
</P>
<P>
 McGraw carried the ball three times on the Hawks' next possession, the last 
went for a 50-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw's first touchdown came on a 50-yard run. He tied the scoring record in 
the second quarter when he capped a nine-play, 68-yard drive with a two-yard 
run. His record-breaking third touchdown gave the Hawks a 21-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw scored his fourth touchdown, which gives him 39 touchdowns and 234 
points. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

PLAYOFFS

 Gabe Rivas scored three touchdowns and ran for 96 yards in the second half as 
Riverside Norte Vista eliminated Costa Mesa from the Division VIII playoffs 
with a 28-12 victory Friday at Riverside College. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivas, who normally plays only safety, went in on offense to begin the second 
half, with the Braves (7-4) trailing Costa Mesa, 6-0. Rivas carried on the 
Braves' first four plays of the second half, gaining 18 yards and setting up 
Matt Magallanez's 47-yard touchdown pass to Ron Butler, the first completion of 
the game for either team. Norte Vista took the lead, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Two possessions later Rivas broke loose for a 25-yard gain to the Costa Mesa 
three-yard line and bulled his way through the middle on the following play for 
a three-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's star running back Charles Chatman, who gained 191 yards in 16 
carries, tried to get Costa Mesa (7-3-1) back into the game early in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman scored from five yards out with 11 minutes 36 seconds remaining to 
trail by a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa attempted a two-point conversion, but Chatman could not turn the 
corner before being pushed out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The play seemed to give the momentum to Norte Vista, which scored 15 
unanswered points in the fourth quarter to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivas said he told his coach he wanted to go in as a running back during 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach asked us in the locker room, who's going to step it up. I told him I 
can do the job," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's first score came in the second quarter when Chatman broke through 
the line and ran for an 87 yard touchdown. Costa Mesa quarterback Ryan Taylor 
completed five of 11 passes for 58 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 "Norte Vista was hitting a lot harder and making tackles a lot more than we 
were," Costa Mesa Coach Myron Miller said. GEOFF BILAU

BEFORE ITS BOWL, RANCHO SANTIAGO HAS TO DEAL WITH SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's players lifted Coach Dave Ogas on their shoulders last week 
to celebrate the Dons' 34-7 victory over Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The joyful moment came because the Dons clinched a share of the Mission 
Conference Central Division, their first title since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also assured Rancho Santiago a berth in a Dec. 3 bowl game. 
Invitations can't officially be extended until the season is over, but Rancho 
Santiago will be invited to play in the Simple Green Orange County Bowl at 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 As for an opponent, the bowl committee hopes to get Los Angeles Valley, also 
8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 But before worrying about a postseason opponent, the Dons would like to finish 
the regular season with a homecoming victory over Saddleback. The teams meet at 
1:30 p.m. today at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (8-1, 5-0) comes in with an eight-game winning streak and is 
the top-ranked team in Southern California. The Dons are sixth in the J.C. 
Grid-Wire national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback is 1-6-2, 1-2-2, but the Gauchos could have had a much better 
season with a few more breaks. Besides two ties, the Gauchos have lost three 
games by a total of nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Central Division games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (5-3-1, 4-1) at Southwestern (0-8-1, 0-4-1), 7 p.m. -- A week ago, 
Fullerton played for first place in the division and lost. The best the Hornets 
can hope for is a share of the title if they win and Rancho Santiago loses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's offense should do well, considering Southwestern has the worst 
defense in the conference. The Apaches are giving up 49 points per game, 
including 138 in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc O'Brien, Fullerton's quarterback, has completed 65% (156 of 241) for 
1,889 yards. He has thrown for 11 touchdowns and run for three more. Steve 
Correa has 41 catches for 646 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's defense is second in the conference, giving up 348 yards a game. 
The Hornets are fourth against the run and pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside (3-6, 2-3) at Orange Coast (2-7, 2-3), 7 p.m. -- The winner finishes 
third in the division. A victory by Orange Coast would also give the Pirates 
victories in three of their final four games after losing their first six. Jeff 
Clayton of OCC has rushed for a county-high 919 yards in 185 carries. He has 
nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates have gotten a strong performance from wide receiver Chris Jackson, 
a former basketball standout at Mater Dei. Jackson had 33 catches for 694 yards 
and nine touchdowns. He averages 21 yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside leads the conference in rushing (256 yards a game) but last in 
passing (102).

GIRLS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995: GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE; THE BUSIER, THE BETTER FOR 
LOS AMIGOS' ZAVALA; BASKETBALL: SENIOR GUARD IMPRESSES EVERYONE WITH HER TALENT 
ON, OFF THE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bored, is one word that isn't in Carmela Zavala's vocabulary. In fact, the Los 
Amigos senior is so busy these days, it would make any self-respecting couch 
potato shudder in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that Zavala, a 5-foot-7 senior, is emersed in her favorite pastime, 
basketball, which requires lots of time and practice. And never mind she also 
keeps herself in high gear with her studies, cheerleading and a part-time job 
at a health club. 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala, 17, pays no mind. And for those who might advise her to slow down and 
take it easy. Forget it: She seems to thrive on the hectic pace of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really thought about it," Zavala said. "I just have a lot of 
interests and things I want to do. I like to be busy and it doesn't bother me 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, she was named first-team All-Garden Grove League after averaging 
16 points. And her coach, Mike Loftis, thinks she'll be better this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a very good athlete," Loftis said. "She's completely dedicated to the 
sport and her willingness to help other players makes her one of the most 
popular girls on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 He is equally impressed with her ability to do it all and still be a 
well-adjusted teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that Carmela has a busy life," he said. "But even though she 
does all these things, she still is able to maintain a 3.5 grade-point average, 
keep a part-time job and be a cheerleader. She's an angel." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala also participates in cross-country and track and field, in which she 
runs the mile and 880 and was an all-league selection in both sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like cross-country and track. But my main love is basketball," Zavala said. 
"Unlike the other events, basketball is more of a competitive thing. In 
cross-country and track, the individual is stressed more. But in basketball, 
it's you against another person. It's you and your teammates against another 
team. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since she was a little girl, basketball has been her favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and I used to watch the Lakers on TV, and I remember watching 
Magic. He was so good. I thought to myself, 'That's how I want to play,' " she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And play she did. But not with girls on the block or in a girls' league, but 
with her brother in pick-up games. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Zavala Jr., 19, is the junior varsity coach at Los Amigos, and 
throughout their lives, Gilbert was his sister's coach and teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has helped me a lot with my game," Zavala said. "We play against each 
other and he's always telling me the things I need to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala's playing experience mostly comes from playing against boys, something 
she said has made her better. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never really anybody telling me I couldn't play with the boys," she 
said. "My brother would take me with him and I would play." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala said the experience has made playing against girls easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "With boys, the game moves a lot faster. You have to react quickly and the 
level is just so much better," Zavala said. "So when I get on the court with 
the girls, I have an edge." 1993-94 / IN REVIEW

20 Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Tied with La Quinta for first place in the Garden Grove League, Rancho 
Alamitos proved to be the better team during the playoffs. Behind the shooting 
of six-foot center Akilah Rodgers, a two-time Times' all-country first-team 
selection and first-team all-league, the Vaqueros defeated San Dimas, 60-57, in 
a first-round game of the Southern Section Division III-AA playoffs. Although 
Rodgers had a great playoff series, she and her teammates were unable stop a 
tough Estancia team, losing, 51-44, in the quarterfinals. Rodgers finished the 
season averaging 19.5 points, 15.4 rebounds, 3.7 blocks and was dominant 
inside, shooting 56.4% from the field. . . . La Quinta, despite the presence of 
first-team, all-league guards Linda Rodriguez, who averaged 21.5 points, and 
Rhonda Gondringer, who averaged 18.5, was unable to advance to the 
quarterfinals in the Division III-A playoffs, losing to El Dorado, 57-39. . . . 
Kennedy, which has since moved to the Empire League, finished a disappointing 
third, but produced two first-team all-league standouts in guards Karin 
Kitagawa and Damia Williams. . . . Although an inexperienced Garden Grove team 
finished better than its coach would have thought, it was primarily because of 
the one-person show of Michol Murray, who averaged 19.8 points, was the top 
rebounder in the county with an average of 15.5 and was named Player of the 
Year in the Garden Grove League. . . . Pacifica guard Pilar Surch finished the 
season with a 16-point average and was a first-team all-league selection. . . . 
Cari Remmel was the outstanding performer for sixth-place Santiago and was a 
first-team all-league pick. . . . All-league player Theodora Bryant was the 
top-scorer for Bolsa Grande, which finished in seventh place. . . . Though Los 
Amigos finished last, there were good performances from junior Carmela Zavala, 
a first-team all-league selection, who averaged 16 points and was the team's 
leading rebounder.

UCI'S KEEFE LEADS EXHIBITION VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With senior Chris Brown, the nation's top three-point shooter last season, 
suspended for missing team study sessions, freshman Brian Keefe made a bid for 
playing time Friday night during UC Irvine's 93-85 exhibition victory over Five 
Star Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,517 on hand in the Bren Center established Keefe -- who did his best 
Brown imitation by making three of five three-pointers and scoring 20 points -- 
and freshman Kevin Simmons, who scored 18 points and had seven rebounds, as the 
new crowd favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of those guys had been battle tested (in AAU competition) this summer," 
Coach Rod Baker said, "and it showed. They both can play. They made some 
freshman mistakes, but it wasn't like they didn't belong." 
</P>
<P>
 Five Star Sports, a collection of former college players, stayed close to the 
Anteaters in the early going and trailed by just one, 22-21, when Dwayne 
Russilford, formerly of Northern Colorado, hit a three-pointer with eight 
minutes left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Anteaters began to break down Five Star Sports' press and led by 20 
midway through the second half before Baker began to substitute freely. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't a traditional game," Baker said. "They were trapping, running at 
us and crashing the boards. They forced us to make the plays and, for the most 
part, we did. We got a lot of good shots because we were able to make the 
passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Mark Odsather made six of 13 shots from the field -- including four of 
eight three-pointers -- to score 20 points for Irvine. Point guard Raimonds 
Miglinieks, a transfer from Riverside College, had eight points and seven 
assists. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Zuri Williams pulled a groin muscle during warmups and played 
sparingly in the first half, but was unable to continue after the intermission. 
"I hope it's not too bad," he said, "but right now it really hurts."

COTTON SUFFERS BROKEN LEG IN 49ER VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State guard James Cotton, the Big West Conference Freshman of the 
Year last season, suffered a broken leg Friday night during the 49ers' 96-82 
exhibition victory over the Mexican National team in the campus gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was attempting a lay-up late in the game when he went to the floor hard 
and had to be helped from the court.Cotton is believed to have a broken left 
fibula and could be out as long as six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are just hoping for the best," Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg said. 
"He was just playing so well in every phase of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton led the 49ers with 20 points. Mike Atkinson scored 18, Juaquin Hawkins 
had 13, and Terrance O'Kelley and Jamie Davis added 11 each. O'Kelley had eight 
rebounds and Atkinson added six. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach trailed, 48-43, at the half but took the lead when O'Kelley hit a 
three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a better job all around in the second half," Greenberg said.

DWP IS OVERCHARGING USERS TO HELP COVER THE CITY'S FISCAL SHORTFALLS. POLITICAL 
OBSERVERS WONDER WHAT'S BEHIND HIS ACTIONS.

 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has for years imposed a hidden 
tax on its ratepayers by collecting more than it costs to run the utility, 
enabling it to transfer $100 million or more annually to help balance 
increasingly shaky city budgets, state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz is considering legislation to force publicly owned utilities, including 
the DWP, to charge ratepayers what it costs to provide them water and power -- 
and no more. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal indicates that Katz, who unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 1993 and 
whose Assembly term ends in two years, is trying to become a player in the 
city's ongoing -- and grim -- budget deliberations, for reasons that remain 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 His proposal has triggered speculation that he is seriously looking at the 
possibility of running for City Councilman Hal Bernson's Northridge-based seat 
on a utility rate reform platform or seeking leverage at City Hall to close 
Lopez Canyon, the city-owned landfill in Katz's district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all scratching our heads on this one to figure out what Richard is up 
to," one top city official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, in an interview this week, denied any ulterior motives, saying that he 
believes it is wrong for DWP to make a profit on its operations at the expense 
of ratepayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A utility owned by the taxpayers shouldn't be making a profit," Katz said. As 
far as his political future, Katz said he is looking at several options but 
would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The target of Katz's proposal is a yearly transfer of funds to the city budget 
from the city-owned Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 In the preliminary draft of a bill he is considering introducing in 
Sacramento, Katz would bar municipal utilities from overcharging their 
customers to pay for non-utility-related financial obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal utilities that continued such practices would be penalized by losing 
state-controlled revenues in an amount equal to the overbilling, the Katz 
measure states. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's financial experts are grappling with a $200-million deficit they 
expect in the 1995-96 budget. Katz's proposal could aggravate the stark budget 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the DWP has transferred $100 million or more to the city's general 
fund budget. Mayor Richard Riordan has been trying to squeeze even more revenue 
out of the utility for the city's general fund budget, which pays for city 
services ranging from law enforcement and fire safety to street maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would cripple the city to lose this money," City Administrative Officer 
Keith Comrie said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a clue why the assemblyman's doing this," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the council's Budget and Finance Committee. "Richard 
has known about the transfer for years. He's either changed his mind about its 
wisdom or he's got some other reason for doing this that I'm not aware of." 
</P>
<P>
 Several city officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, speculated 
that Katz is using the proposal to gain a reputation as a champion of utility 
reform as a prelude to running against Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson is up for reelection next spring, and term limits will force Katz out 
of his Assembly post in 1996. And if the Republican Party gains control of the 
Assembly, as appears likely, Katz would play a diminished role in Sacramento in 
his final two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scenario has Katz using the proposal as a way to force the city to 
bargain seriously with him as he seeks to close Lopez Canyon. The assemblyman 
has been a vocal critic of the huge landfill. The landfill's operating permit 
expires in 1996 and city officials are seeking a renewal.

CITYSCAPES / EMILY ADAMS: WHEN THEY SAY THEY EXERCISE RELIGIOUSLY,THE 'VESSELS' 
MEAN IT; 'I HAD A VISION ABOUT EXERCISING. I WANTED TO MINISTER TO THE PHYSICAL 
WOMAN AND THE SPIRITUAL WOMAN.'

 A fine sheen of sweat has broken out on Rosita Latham's powerful neck and 
chiseled arms as she calls out the next move to six women in North Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Step and kick!" she tells them, shouting over the music. "Right leg first!" 
</P>
<P>
 The women are breathing hard, but keeping up with Latham and the music's 
relentless beat. They step up on their molded plastic squares, turn left and 
thrust their right legs out. Step down and do it again. For a moment, this 
could be any step aerobics class. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the third such kick, the women begin a hoarse chant, the words 
punctuated with the right leg's thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father!"  
</P>
<P>
 Step down, up, kick.  
</P>
<P>
 "Son!"  
</P>
<P>
 Again.  
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Ghost!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the women in Latham's class, this workout is not just about fitting into a 
smaller dress size. This "exercise ministry" is about building faith along with 
muscle tone. They exercise to music with Christian lyrics and pray together 
after class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a vision about exercising," said Latham, 37, a mother of three and a 
grandmother. "I wanted to minister to the physical woman and the spiritual 
woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Latham and four other women started in a garage, 
</P>
<P>
 praying for strength and guidance while teaching each other how to exercise 
and eat well. As they felt their energy levels increase and their self-esteem 
grow, they wanted to spread the word, Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they claim a loose membership of about 50. In April, the group moved out 
of the garage and into a tiny South Street storefront sandwiched between a 
liquor store and a coin dealer. The organizers charge $2 per class, up from the 
$1 fee they charged in the garage, and can comfortably fit up to 15 women in 
each of the week's three classes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the store's window they proudly painted their name: "The Vessels of Honor 
for God. Exercise Ministry." 
</P>
<P>
 The term exercise ministry is taken from the group's roots in a street 
ministry. Latham and the four other original participants -- Lenia Smith, Nina 
Jewel-Wood, Cynthia Bowan and Karen Houser -- met through their work in Youth 
Action for Christ, a nondenominational Long Beach church that encourages 
members to take to the streets to spread the Bible's teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vessels started handing out flyers on the aerobics class along with Bible 
verses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women my age and older just don't exercise and a lot of them have low 
self-esteem because of their body image," said Smith, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The founders credit Latham, an ordained minister in Youth Action for Christ, 
with kicking the Vessels into high gear. After the 5-foot-5 Latham gave birth 
to her last child four years ago, she weighed in at 215 pounds. Lacking energy 
even for the Lord's work, Latham decided something had to change. Then she met 
Jewel-Wood and Bowan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked nutrition and Cynthia talked exercise," Jewel-Wood said of the 
group's beginnings. "And then we met Rose and she's a doer. She's the one who 
made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosita Latham -- who now weighs 130 pounds after four years of religiously 
exercising and adopting healthier eating habits -- hears Jewel-Wood, smiles and 
says, "The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak: Matthew." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little room for weakness in the Vessels' fast-stepping, one-hour 
aerobics workout three times a week. Yet many of the women who take the classes 
have had a lifetime of bad nutritional habits, Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of churches are good about God, but not about the natural stuff. Too 
many of those preachers have big bellies. And you've got to have this ," Smith 
says, grabbing a well-toned thigh, "to be able to get out there and work for 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 Latham added: "When they feel good about themselves they can do more work for 
the Lord and be a better person." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Jewel-Wood's job to teach women to eat well. At every class, she offers 
cooking and shopping ideas to help cut fat and increase nutritional content. A 
sales representative for a large vitamin company, she readily admits she holds 
no degrees in nutrition. But healthy eating has been a lifelong passion that 
she wants to share with the others, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised Muslim and didn't become Christian until I was 21," she said. 
"And Muslims have much better eating habits, lots of fruits and vegetables and 
whole grains. I was shocked at the way I've seen some Christians eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The women who attend Vessels classes say they are getting a kind of church and 
spa, all in one small room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," said one woman, toweling off her face and breathing hard. 
"Here, there's a lot of love."

LAPD BEGINS CRACKDOWN ON SKID ROW HOMELESS; SAFETY: POLICE TAKE ACTION AFTER 
USDA WARNED FOOD COMPANY THAT IT COULD BE CLOSED OVER HEALTH HAZARDS POSED BY 
TRANSIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the Riordan Administration's blessing, Los Angeles police have launched a 
controversial offensive on homelessness along the edge of the Civic Center, 
where federal authorities have warned at least one food-packing plant of health 
risks because of dirty encampments in front of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest crackdown -- one in a series that have been undertaken over the 
years -- began Wednesday when police moved into one of the worst areas of 
Downtown homelessness on Towne Avenue between 4th and 7th streets and ordered 
everyone off the streets. According to police, the street's residents were told 
they could not return. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night and Friday morning, officers brought a flatbed truck to 
several pockets of transient encampments, confiscating 188 shopping carts used 
by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown was undertaken after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a 
warning to the Tengu Beef Jerky Co. at 5th Street and Towne Avenue that it 
faced closure unless steps were taken to keep the sidewalk clear of trash and 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Michi Osaki, Tengu's office supervisor, said her company wants to be sensitive 
to the needs of the homeless but had no choice other than calling upon the city 
for help. "They could close our plant if we don't comply," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Skid Row residents complained that they lost everything they owned in the 
sweeps -- from medicine to blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took everything I had and threw it in a trash truck," said Richard Cobb, 
who has lived on Skid Row for nearly seven years. "All I have are the clothes 
on my back." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," said Skid Row resident Al Green, 32. "They told us that the city 
is changing and they have a new policy toward the homeless. The business don't 
want us here." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless advocates, still bitter over Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to build a 
homeless drop-in center in a secluded industrial area east of Downtown, said 
the crackdown is another attempt to move the tattered hordes to a place where 
few can see them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their way of announcing the holiday season?" asked Alice Callaghan, 
director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row social service center. "It's 
just part of the city's new policy of meanness toward the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sgt. Robert Veliz, the LAPD Central Division's homeless coordinator, said 
the city had few options. "Because of health reasons, we have to respond to the 
complaints. (The businesses) have a legitimate concern." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double whammy for the businesses," Veliz added. "They have to deal 
with the transients and to be written up by the USDA. Why should they stay in 
Downtown Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Rodriguez, Riordan's press secretary, said: "Our Los Angeles companies 
need to be able to operate in a healthy, business-friendly environment. This is 
important for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Veliz estimated that 30% to 40% of the Skid Row's homeless encampments have 
been affected by the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Schatz, senior vice president for the Central City Assn., which 
represents Downtown businesses, applauded the police's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an issue of balancing rights," Schatz said. "If (the homeless) are 
affecting the health and safety of the people who purchase products from the 
packing plants, then something has to be done." Homeless Crackdown Los Angeles 
police are cracking down on sidewalk encampments on portions of Skid Row, a 
move that has prompted angry criticism from Downtown homeless advocates. The 
police action was requested by food packaging plants in the area.

COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON SOFTENING STANCE AGAINST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council, with three members absent, delayed a vote Friday 
on whether to soften its decision to fight Proposition 187 in the courts, but 
the roiling ill will that has characterized council debate on the divisive 
initiative continued in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, who wants the city to limit its role in the legal 
dispute over implementation of the initiative, said there were not enough 
members present to approve his motion. But the San Fernando Valley councilman 
vowed to raise it again Tuesday. Councilman Mike Hernandez, a leader of the 
council bloc that wants to overturn the measure, countered that Wachs does not 
have the votes and "is blowing hot air." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, City Atty. James K. Hahn, acting in light of a 10-3 council vote 
last week, filed court papers to join in a federal lawsuit seeking to toss out 
the initiative. A day earlier, a federal district judge in Los Angeles issued a 
temporary restraining order covering most portions of the measure, which would 
bar illegal immigrants from already limited government-funded education, health 
care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the repercussions of Proposition 187, which was approved by a 
59%-41% margin in last week's election, continued to grow Friday as boycotts 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, about 500 of the expected 2,000 participants in a conference on 
Spanish-language children's books at the city's Convention Center have stayed 
away to protest the initiative's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, busloads of Mexican teachers' groups from Baja California 
and Mexico City attended the annual meeting, where dozens of book distributors 
offer their wares, according to organizer Isabel Schon, director of the Center 
for Books in Spanish for Children and Adolescents at Cal State San Marcos.  
</P>
<P>
 But in recent days, apologetic Mexican colleagues have called Schon and told 
her they were staying home to protest what they see as an anti-Mexican, 
anti-immigrant climate in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are saying, 'If they don't want us there, we are not going to come,' " 
Schon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Hispanic Journalists voted last weekend to keep future 
national conventions out of California until the illegal immigration initiative 
is repealed by state voters or court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one other national organization, the National Lesbian and Gay 
Journalists Assn., is considering following suit. "We're taking a very serious 
look at it," said Leroy Aarons, president of the group, which has a national 
meeting scheduled for Beverly Hills next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 One consideration, Aarons said, is that the Hispanic journalists' association 
heeded a 1992 call by the gay journalists' association to move its annual 
convention from Colorado because of that state's passage of an initiative -- 
later voided -- banning civil rights protection for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California tourism officials say they are concerned about the 
economic repercussions of an anti-187 boycott. But so far, they said, they have 
heard of few concrete actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the national media, the principal story is that the (initiative) is being 
put in some form of suspended animation because of legal examination," said 
Michael Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. "That's probably slowed down what may have been a larger 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts to challenge 
Proposition 187. Wachs says the city should avoid taking an activist position 
like that of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and 
other civil rights groups in whose suit the city is seeking to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council should limit itself to clarifying its responsibilities under the 
law," Wachs said. "What the public resents is this seeming attitude by the 
council that it knows better." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn and other city officials have retorted that the only way for the city to 
involve itself in the case is by joining in one of the lawsuits challenging the 
measure. Hernandez said he and several other council members are likely to walk 
out of the council chambers rather then participate in any upcoming vote called 
by Wachs. 
</P>
<P>
 "His motion isn't doing anything so I don't want to participate in the motion 
because I think it's all staged," said Hernandez, who represents a large Latino 
constituency in his Central City district. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the polarizing nature of Proposition 187 has overflowed into 
City Hall, where Hernandez has had several confrontations with colleagues. The 
ill will ran so deep that at least one council member privately discussed -- 
but later backed off -- the possibility of asking the council to censure 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began during a closed session of the council Wednesday, when 
Hernandez got into a shouting match with Councilman Nate Holden. The dispute 
became so intense that some observers thought the two men might come to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez later apologized to Holden and told a reporter, "He was mad and I 
was mad. But I told Nate he couldn't step outside, because his hair was too 
gray." 
</P>
<P>
 When the council resumed in open session, Hernandez shredded a copy of Wachs's 
proposal and threw it down in front of Wachs, accusing him of "acting against 
the Latino community."  
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. approached Hernandez to discuss 
the matter. Hernandez swore at Svorinich and said that he then fended his 
colleague off with an outstretched hand. "He tends to get real close to you 
when he talks and I didn't want him real close to me," said Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Another observer said Hernandez was "out of control" and actually jabbed 
Svorinich several times with his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Hernandez was unapologetic, saying many council members do not 
recognize the fear and problems that Proposition 187 is causing in Latino 
communities. He accused Svorinich of having "no guts" and said he had "less 
substance than the Bob's Big Boy mascot." 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich, who could not be reached for comment Friday, has said previously he 
will not speak to Hernandez until he apologizes.

TAKING PARENTING A STEP AT A TIME; EDUCATION: AT L.A. ADULT OCCUPATIONAL 
CENTER, YOUNG MOTHERS CELEBRATE THE LEARNING OF SKILLS AND LESSENING THE 
VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're teen-agers, they're mothers, they're high school dropouts, they're 
poor. In their lives there are few accomplishments without great struggle and 
even fewer celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 So when most of the 30 young mothers enrolled in the Business Industry 
School's Teen Parenting and Child Care Program gathered Friday in the 
toy-filled, brightly colored room where they usually bare their souls, the 
occasion was festive if not downright momentous. 
</P>
<P>
 They had successfully gotten through the week without hitting their children. 
For the most part. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Punishment Week" was the culmination of two months of learning parenting 
skills and alternatives to what Director Ruth Beaglehole considers forms of 
violence against children: smacking, hair-pulling, name-calling or verbal 
humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers come to the Mid-City school -- one of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's adult occupational centers -- with toddlers in tow and hopes 
of finally earning high school diplomas. Parenting is part of the curriculum.  
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a large circle on tiny chairs, the young women with faces of girls, 
some with their children, were praised by Beaglehole and given ornately 
scripted certificates of recognition from Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a stupendous week!" exclaimed Beaglehole, who is counselor and 
confessor to the group. "I want to congratulate you for a week of no hitting, 
no violence."  
</P>
<P>
 Beaglehole stood in the middle of the circle and singled out mothers with a 
call to stand up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonia, you did it, woman!" Beaglehole said. "What do you want to say?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That I gave him no violence," Antonia said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beaglehole turned to the group of mothers and visitors.  
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear that, everyone? She gave her son no violence! Do you feel 
proud?"  
</P>
<P>
 The group applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved on to another mother, asking her how she wrestled with the urge to 
hit. "Was it hard?"  
</P>
<P>
 "Very hard," said the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear that?" Beaglehole commanded of the room. "We need to give 
witness. It was very hard. What was the hardest? . . . Not having patience?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having patience," the young mother responded immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Their voices were low, their grins were sheepish. It is not like that during 
the two-hour counseling sessions that the 51-year-old Beaglehole conducts each 
day. There, the mothers bring their anger and frustration and their honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They walk in and say, 'I hit last night,' " said Beaglehole, a longtime Los 
Angeles resident who was born in New Zealand. "There's no judgment here. The 
message is: Just keep trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for a week of nonviolence, the mothers last week held what they 
called a "forgiving ceremony," symbolically washing their hands of violence in 
a large tub of water filled with white flower petals. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the following Monday they were complaining about what they were doing, 
wondering out loud why they had undertaken the challenge. On Friday, they took 
account of their successes and failed attempts. Plastered on the walls around 
them were warnings, admonitions and inspirations not to hit. "Realize How Old I 
Am," read one in painted block letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaglehole's arm encircled the shoulders of a young mother who takes numerous 
buses to the school. The teen-ager was asked how often she had hit her child. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was less," the girl answered quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Less! Less! " exclaimed Beaglehole. "That's a beautiful thing to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not child abuse as it's normally defined. "I don't think we've 
reported any of these mothers," said Beaglehole, who by state law is obligated 
to report child abuse and has done so in the past.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beaglehole believes that hitting your child as a form of discipline -- even if 
it doesn't hurt -- ought to be as unacceptable as a man striking a woman or 
people beating their dogs. "I'm worried about the (progression) of hitting on 
hands to child abuse," said Beaglehole, who has three children, ages 17, 20, 22 
-- the oldest of whom she admits having hit once or twice. But she insists she 
has lived by what she preaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want this to be a stereotype of this group of people," she added. 
"I'm not doing this because they're a more abusive population. . . . It's not a 
poor people's problem. It's a societal problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony ended with the distribution of flowers, as the teen-agers 
repaired to another room for ice cream and conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never hit my kids, but I hurt them emotionally with my words -- I think 
that's worse," 20-year-old Elsa Aguilar, the mother of a 5-year-old girl and a 
15-month-old boy, said as she fingered the petals of her flower. She had 
recounted before the group how Jesse had tested her patience by turning the 
television on and off more than a dozen times as she repeatedly told him to 
stop.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ruth told me he's just knowing he has the power to make all these lights 
appear and disappear by touching these buttons," she said. "I thought he was 
just being a brat." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar struggles to take care of her children and keep up with the school 
work she has now. "I have a lot, a lot of problems," Aguilar said as she headed 
with Jesse for ice cream. "Like right now, I'm not in the mood for this. I've 
got a lot of things on my mind."  
</P>
<P>
 Marta Molina, 19, hit her 2 1/2-year-old son David on Monday. "On the butt," 
she admitted, recalling how he balked as she put him in his car seat. 
"Sometimes it's just too much. I give him to someone else -- my mom, my 
grandma." 
</P>
<P>
 She made it through the rest of the week fairly violence-free. "I just talked 
to him more instead of yelling at him. . . . I don't want to hit him," she 
said. "I don't want to raise him like my mom raised me. . . . She would hit me 
and I would laugh -- I guess to make her angry." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not quite the same when Molina hits her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "He cries," she said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; CITY 
SEEKS PROBE OF ALLEGED QUAKE THEFTS BY FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica on Friday asked the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to 
investigate allegations that as many as 20 Santa Monica firefighters took 
belongings left by tenants of the earthquake-damaged Sea Castle apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager John Jalili said the request was prompted by allegations that 
firefighters took furniture, a television set and other property from the 
red-tagged Sea Castle, which was sealed off after suffering severe damage in 
the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 During a two-week period in September, the city allowed each Sea Castle tenant 
a four-hour period to retrieve belongings, under the supervision of the Fire 
Department. The department has been conducting an internal investigation of the 
matter since Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a situation like this it is always better to have a totally independent 
agency investigate," Jalili said Friday. He declined to comment on when the 
investigation will begin.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; SCHOOL BOARD 
APPOINTMENT OF FELON PUT INTO LIMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial Compton School Board decision to appoint an applicant with a 
criminal record to fill a vacant school board seat has been thrown into limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials said Friday that they are investigating whether the 
school board had the authority to fill the vacant seat, and whether an 
applicant who has been convicted on felony charges is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, voting last week by secret ballot, appointed Saul E. 
Lankster, a Compton flower shop owner who was convicted in 1985 of selling 
false traffic school diplomas to undercover state investigators and was 
sentenced to 120 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The board drew heated criticism at its meeting Tuesday for selecting Lankster, 
an African American, over a Latino candidate who had been rated the top 
applicant by a screening committee that selected four finalists from a field of 
13 applicants. Martin Chavez, a Port of Los Angeles human resources officer, 
had received the committee's top rating. Lankster was rated second. 
</P>
<P>
 The board decided to vote again Friday after J. Jerome Harris, the 
administrator appointed by the state to run the troubled district, said the 
secret ballot violated public meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But the meeting was called off after William Dawson, acting state 
superintendent of public instruction, informed the district in a letter that he 
would make the final decision about the secret ballots.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEADLINE 
FOR QUAKE AID REQUESTS EXTENDED TO JAN. 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in as many months, state and federal officials extended the 
deadline for quake aid applications, from Nov. 17 to Jan. 20, but vowed that it 
would be the final extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension applies to loan applications to the Small Business 
Administration and requests for aid from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency and the state's Individual and Family Grant Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension was requested by Los Angeles city officials, who said many 
victims are only now learning the extent of the damage and finding out how much 
of their repairs will be paid for by insurance settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline had been extended from, Sept. 17 to Oct. 17, and then to Nov. 17. 
"This is the final extension of the application period for the Northridge 
earthquake," said Frank Kishton, FEMA's coordinating officer.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: NEEDLEWOMAN SEWS HER WAY TO TOP AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA WATSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chatsworth needlewoman Zena Thorpe won Best of Show and the Founders' Award at 
the recent Houston International Quilt Show for her appliqued quilt titled 
"Frogmore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Founders' Award was chosen and presented by four of the original founders 
of the Houston event, sponsored by the American International Quilt Assn., on 
the occasion of its 15th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time Thorpe was invited to enter, and although she has won 
awards each time, this was the first time she took the top prize. In addition, 
a two-foot-square quilt she donated to the celebrity auction benefiting the 
association went for the top amount of $550. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe said most of the themes for her prize-winning quilts come from "my 
English heritage." A naturalized citizen, she came to the United States in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frogmore" was inspired by a well-known ceiling painted in 1790 by Mary Moser 
in the great hall of a British mansion named Frogmore. It was Queen Victoria's 
favorite residence and is known for its beautiful gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe enjoys making her creations out of fabric. "Fabric carries with it a 
cozy sort of feeling," she says. "It has form and texture -- it carries with it 
a feeling of warmth and security. 
</P>
<P>
 "A painting is beautiful, but it doesn't give one the same satisfaction as 
looking at the identical scene created in fabric." VIRGINIA WATSON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAYOR BACKS RULE TO LIMIT COPTER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A campaign by community activists to fight helicopter noise in neighborhoods 
surrounding Van Nuys Airport has received support from the city's top official. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan has added his name to a long list of Los Angeles-area 
politicians who are supporting a proposed federal rule that would force 
non-emergency helicopter operators to observe a 1,000-foot minimum altitude 
over populated areas.Currently, there is no altitude minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 A homeowners association in Encino tried unsuccessfully to persuade helicopter 
pilots to accept minimum altitudes but the airport declined to set them. So the 
association -- the Homeowners of Encino -- took its battle to the federal 
level. The group is seeking a rule to set minimum altitudes nationwide. This 
summer, the Federal Aviation Administration printed the group's petition for 
the proposed rule change in the Federal Register, the first step in a process 
that could take 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the FAA, Riordan wrote: "The City of Los Angeles consistently 
receives complaints by residents who are awakened and disturbed by both early 
morning and low-altitude sight-seeing flights. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some circumstances, these interruptions make it impossible for residents 
to perform their normal daily activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The other local politicians who have written to support the altitude minimum 
are U. S. Reps. Anthony Beilenson, Howard Berman and Henry Waxman; state Sens. 
Herschel Rosenthal, Tom Hayden, Ralph Dills and David Roberti; Assembly members 
Burt Margolin, Barbara Friedman, Terry Friedman and Richard Katz; and City 
Council members Joel Wachs, Marvin Braude, Laura Chick, John Ferraro and Zev 
Yaroslavsky. KAY HWANGBO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWNDALE; CAR KNOCKED 
INTO GEAR BY BOY, 2, INJURES 2 TODDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An idling car knocked into gear by a 2-year-old boy ran into two toddler 
sisters in Lawndale on Friday and pinned them against a garage door, critically 
injuring one girl.  
</P>
<P>
 Two-year-old Esmeralda Figueroa, who suffered a head injury in the 11 a.m. 
accident in the 16500 block of Prairie Avenue, was taken to Robert F. Kennedy 
Medical Center, where she was in critical condition, sheriff's spokeswoman Irma 
Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-year-old Dora Figueroa was hospitalized in stable condition, Becerra 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The girls' uncle started the car and left it idling in the driveway while he 
went into the house, Becerra said.  
</P>
<P>
 Several children were playing nearby, and the boy got behind the steering 
wheel and put the car in gear and it rolled into the girls, pinning them 
against the garage door, Becerra said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: POST-QUAKE DANGER SEEN IN HEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when you thought you had already dealt with all the problems in your 
house caused by the earthquake, the Gas Co. advises that with the onset of 
colder temperatures, Valley residents should examine the condition of their 
heaters to ensure that the quake didn't cause vent connections to shake loose 
or soot to fall inside the vent. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you reach to turn the heat up another notch, Gas Co. officials say, 
check the color of your pilot light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, pilot lights are a dark blue cone shape," said company spokeswoman 
Michelle Bagley. "If a flame has turned orange, it is indicating that there is 
dust nearby and the vents should be cleaned before the heater is used." 
</P>
<P>
 If the flame has turned yellow and flickers high and erratically, she 
continued, a qualified heating inspector should be called to check on the 
condition of the heater. 
</P>
<P>
 A yellow flame, Bagley said, indicates incomplete combustion, which means 
enough dust has entered the vent to prevent the natural gas from burning 
completely, thus releasing poisonous carbon monoxide into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent study conducted by the Gas Co., an average of 20 people 
die each year from carbon monoxide emanating from their gas appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a 7-month-old baby in San Fernando was treated for symptoms of 
carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a heater with a vent crack believed to be 
caused by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was not seriously injured, Bagley said, "but this occurrence is an 
example of the types of problems we're concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 Because carbon monoxide is odorless, it's difficult to detect. Symptoms of 
carbon monoxide poisoning are very similar to those of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, after you turn on your heater, you start to experience nausea, dizziness 
and headaches and there is no reason to suspect the flu," Bagley warns, "you 
should not use your heater until it is inspected by a professional." 
</P>
<P>
 Other good practices encouraged by the Gas Co. include regularly cleaning out 
the filter in a forced air unit, making sure all heating vents are properly 
ventilated, refraining from misusing a gas appliance not intended for indoor 
use and making sure only a qualified worker does any needed inspections or 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley suggested that people suspecting their heaters might be dangerous call 
a heating or plumbing contractor instead of relying on the gas company for an 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the earthquake, we've received a lot of calls from people needing 
work on their appliances," he said. "We're swamped and wouldn't be able to come 
out for a couple of days. This is a matter that needs immediate attention."

 Lockheed Corp.'s plans to clean contaminated soil by pumping up to 40 pounds a 
day of potentially cancer-causing substances into the air has come into 
question by the Burbank Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members made their position official during a meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We voted 5-to-0 to request an environmental impact report because we just 
feel we have a real, vested interest in this," board member Elena Hubbell said. 
"We have students who are most certainly going to be affected by this. We want 
to know what the pluses and minuses are up front." 
</P>
<P>
 George Washington Elementary School, Providencia Elementary School and 
Monterey High School are located near a 90-acre lot that was once the site of 
Lockheed's B-1 plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is trying to clean the land of contaminants to comply with federal 
orders and wants to build a vapor extraction system of wells, pipes and 
filters. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has been criticized by many residents. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; FOUNDATION FUNDS 5 LOCAL CHARITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Community Foundation recently awarded more than $13,000 to five 
local charitable organizations for assistance in their daily operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranging from $700 for a Multiple Sclerosis Society video camera to a two-year 
award of $10,000 for a retirement home fire alarm system, the grants are part 
of a bimonthly program primarily intended to provide support to the disabled, 
senior citizens, disaster victims and the emotionally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Miller, foundation executive director, said the group makes awards to 52 
nonprofit organizations each year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the only criterion "is that these agencies be either physically 
located in Glendale or that they serve Glendale residents."  
</P>
<P>
 A good example of the latter, said Miller, is the California Philanthropic and 
Educational Organization Home, or PEO, a non-college-affiliated sorority based 
in Des Moines, Iowa. PEO provides scholarships and loans to women looking to 
further their education or make ends meet. It was established in 1869 and now 
has retirement homes for women throughout the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Because several members of a newly constructed residential hall in Alhambra 
will be from Glendale, the Glendale Community Foundation has, over a two-year 
period, agreed to provide the sorority with the $10,000 needed for an upgraded 
fire alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grant will help defray the cost of building a new residential hall," said 
Ruth Wolfe, president of the California PEO Home Board of Trustees. "This will 
allow us to continue care for the several PEO retirees residing in Southern 
California."  
</P>
<P>
 Other award recipients include the American Red Cross, which received $2,500 
for a disaster services canteen truck; Glendale Kiwanis Youth Inc., $2,500 to 
allow fifth-grade students to attend a conference on American history in Valley 
Forge, Pa., and the Verdugo Mental Health Center, $2,500 for a photocopier to 
be used at the center's program at Magnolia Park School. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation grants are made possible by endowments provided by the more than 
1,000 philanthropists donating to the organization throughout its 38-year 
history. Upon receiving an endowment, the foundation deposits the money in an 
interest-accruing account and then allocates awards every two months based on 
the projected amount of interest earned during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the foundation awarded more than $65,000 in grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much we can allocate hinges on the interest rate environment," Miller 
said. "Fortunately, rates are going up this year." ANTONIO OLIVO

L.A. ORDERED TO PAY KING LAWYERS $22,000 IN EXPENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal court clerk's office Friday ordered the city of Los Angeles to 
reimburse Rodney G. King's lawyers about $22,000 in legal expenses, but the 
attorneys are still awaiting a judge's decision on their request for $4.4 
million in attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 A city attorney's spokesman said King's attorneys, who can appeal the clerk's 
decision to U.S. District Judge John Davies, asked for $95,000 for deposition 
costs, photocopying and other legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, a federal jury ordered the city to pay King $3.8 million in damages 
after a 10-week civil trial stemming from his 1991 beating by Los Angeles 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen of King's lawyers have asked Davies to award them fees 
totaling $4.4 million for their work on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk's office has the authority to act on litigation support costs. 
Richard Janisch, the office's director, told the Associated Press he omitted 
three-quarters of the requests for reimbursement because they either did not 
fall under the guidelines for reimbursement or attorneys failed to provide 
proper documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that this amount is a fair and equitable figure for both the 
plaintiff in this case and the taxpayers of Los Angeles," City Atty. James Hahn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorney, Steven Lerman, had not seen the clerk's order but said: "This 
is a chapter in the city's history that everybody wants to see closed." 
</P>
<P>
 The order came a day after King settled a child-support lawsuit by agreeing to 
pay an undisclosed amount on behalf of a 12-year-old daughter in San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the courthouse Thursday, King said he was relieved that the 
situation was resolved.

L.A. RIVER BIKE PATH FROM VALLEY TO DOWNTOWN STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a plan being drafted by the Army Corps of Engineers, bicyclists would be 
able to use a bike path winding for about 17 miles alongside the Los Angeles 
River from the Sepulveda Basin to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of easing traffic and expanding recreational opportunities, the corps 
is drafting plans for a bicycle path along the access road that borders the 
river, for the first time connecting the bikeways of the San Fernando Valley to 
Downtown, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles River is an ideal route for a path," said Nancy Wedeen, a 
North Hollywood cycling instructor and member of the League of American 
Bicyclists. "We think its a good investment to improve the health and sanity of 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly proposed bike path would hook up at Griffith Park with a seven-mile 
bikeway the city plans to build from the park to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials provided $200,000 to draft the plan, and a spokeswoman for 
Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) said he plans to talk with other 
federal and local officials about allocating additional money for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been very interested in doing things to rehabilitate the river," said 
Beilenson's spokeswoman, Melissa Kuckro. "We'd love to keep the bike path 
project going." 
</P>
<P>
 A draft report and environmental study by the corps will be completed in 
January. It proposes a 10-mile link to the pathway running along the west side 
of the river, connecting with a previously approved path from Griffith Park to 
Elysian Park, a few blocks north of the Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan will provide only a general outline of the path and will offer 
options for routing it under or over street crossings, freeways and other 
obstacles, said Juan Villalobos, project manager for the corps. The plan will 
also provide a cost estimate for construction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until funding for construction is found, the corps will not launch more 
detailed studies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we hear otherwise, or we find other funds to do more, we are not 
authorized to do more," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at Sepulveda Boulevard near the intersection of the San Diego and 
Ventura freeways, the path would run east about 10 miles, connecting at 
Griffith Park with the seven-mile riverside path to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 City transportation officials said they are preparing to hire contractors to 
build the first three-mile phase at the northern end of the $5-million bike 
path from Griffith Park to Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are no unforeseen hitches, construction of the 12-foot-wide bike path 
from Griffith Park to Downtown is expected to begin in June and be completed by 
early 1996.  
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle enthusiasts have predicted that up to 2,000 bicyclists will use the 
path to ride to work each day, with more pedaling commuters joining in when the 
corps' proposed extension is built. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 survey conducted by a commuter service company found that only two out 
of 500 Los Angeles County commuters rely primarily on bicycles to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But bicyclists say the number of cycling commuters is low because there are 
not enough paths, and most dread competing with motorists on the city's 
congested and often dangerous streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is money available we would like to see money used on bicycle 
transportation," Wedeen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A city bicycle plan calls for doubling the current 300 miles of bike paths and 
lanes in the city over the next 10 to 15 years, said Michelle Mowery, the 
city's bicycle coordinator. The path proposed by the corps had not previously 
been considered in the plan, he said.

DEFICIT COMPLICATES MAYOR'S LAPD PLAN; BUDGET: RIORDAN URGES DEPARTMENT HEADS 
TO HELP CLOSE $200-MILLION GAP WHILE HE EXPANDS THE POLICE FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan is sticking to a commitment to fully fund his Project 
Safety for beefing up the Los Angeles Police Department, even as the city 
prepares to deal with an estimated $200-million budget deficit in the next 
fiscal year, Riordan's top budget adviser said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in a meeting with the heads of city departments, Riordan 
reiterated his warning that the city faces a large deficit and said he is 
relying heavily on their inventiveness to close the budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Keeley, Riordan's chief financial adviser, said that the deficit 
assumes full funding of the second year of Project Safety, the mayor's plan to 
add 2,855 officers to the LAPD over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeley said "$200 million is our best guess of the size of the deficit now," 
but he acknowledged that Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton recently 
projected a $312-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most brutal recession we've had since the Great Depression," said 
City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie, commenting on the fact that the city 
has seen four straight years of declining revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the city is anticipating a slight upturn in the economy and in city 
revenues this year and officials are predicting a 2% increase in city revenues 
for the 1995-96 budget year, which begins July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the city will be facing $75 million in additional costs next 
year to pay for salary increases for city employees, including police, and new 
costs of about $40 million for Project Safety, Keeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's police plan, the city would have 1,435 new officers by the 
end of fiscal 1995-96. A recent Los Angeles Times review, however, found that 
expansion has proceeded at only half the pace sought under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how we're going to balance this budget," Comrie said. "We're 
bringing in some outside consultants to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 City department heads submitted their plans for 1995-96 belt-tightening to 
Comrie this week. But he said Friday that it is too early to asses their 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan repeatedly has urged city executives to help him make city government 
more efficient.

VISITING EXPERTS TO ADVISE L.A. ZOO ON RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three U.S. zoo directors will come to Los Angeles next month in an effort to 
jump-start long-delayed plans for renovating the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors of the Atlanta, Cincinnati and Seattle zoos have agreed to tour 
the zoo in December and to recommend how the city should spend $23 million from 
a special zoo improvement fund that has languished in the city treasury for 
more than two years, according to an announcement Friday by Mayor Richard 
Riordan and City Council President John Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 The action comes more than a year after the city rejected the original plan by 
zoo administrators that would have put the bulk of the money into a new 
veterinary hospital, an educational center and a refurbished front gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Zookeepers, animal rights activists and others protested that the original 
spending plan was tilted too heavily toward the comfort of zoo visitors instead 
of toward improving the animals' quality of life. They called for more to be 
spent on upgrading the outdated quarters of chimpanzees, orangutans and other 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has struggled, though, to find advisers to help it draw up a new 
improvement plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Ferraro had first called for hiring a retired zoo expert, who they 
suggested would come to Los Angeles for free to help draft the zoo improvement 
plan and mediate in the thorny relationship between zoo employees and zoo 
director Mark Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several months, the city conceded that it could not find anyone who 
wanted to take the six-month job without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan next persuaded the City Council to budget $75,000 to pay a consultant 
to work with Goldstein and Les Schobert, the zoo's chief curator, on a 
renovation plan. But even the salaried position did not attract qualified 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, two animal welfare organizations collaborated on the plan to bring 
the three zoo directors to Los Angeles. The Ark Trust and the American Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals lined up the zoo directors, and the 
city agreed to pay each $5,000 plus expenses for their work, said Robert Flamm, 
head of the Western Region of the Assn. for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The three directors are expected to take less than a week to examine the zoo 
and submit recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will make it better for the animals," Flamm said. "Our organization's 
goal is to eliminate the pain, fear and suffering of animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretchen Wyler, president of the Ark Trust said, "It is very important to the 
taxpayers of this city that this money be spent to benefit the animals. We 
believe this plan will assure that happens."

HIGH SCHOOL ELITE GO HEAD TO HEAD IN ACADEMIC DECATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were hunkered down Friday, focusing on what will soon be the most intense 
11 hours of their high school careers. 
</P>
<P>
 In last-minute cram sessions across the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
hundreds of competitors were readying themselves for what has become one of the 
most hotly contested and widely watched high school rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a basketball tournament. It's not a football game. It's a test. 
</P>
<P>
 During today's 14th annual Los Angeles Unified Academic Decathlon, 495 
students from 55 teams will be burning up their memory banks and racking their 
brains in response to an overwhelming battery of exams, speech and essay 
contests, and interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to coaches and students, the pressure to excel is extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't believe the psychological warfare that goes on," said David 
Roberson, coach of El Camino Real High School's team. "I've coached football 
and golf and they're nothing like this. Nothing comes close to preparing for 
the pressure of the decathlon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that pressure stems from the rampant, behind-the scenes handicapping 
of teams among coaches, who make a hobby of trying to predict the outcome by 
studying the results of scrimmages and practice tests. They analyze the 
significance of the number of returning team members, and even the number of 
years the coach has led the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-time winner Taft High School took the city, state and national 
championships last year and is favored by many to win for a third consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's coach, Arthur Berchin, is described by other coaches as obsessive. 
On Friday, he refused to be interviewed about his team's preparations and kept 
his "players" equally off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That even convinces me more that Taft is going to win," said Dan Speltner, a 
former decathlon coach from Dorsey High School. "It's that competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 But with five Marshall High School students returning from last year's 
second-place team, some believe they may have the upper hand. Returning 
students often bring perspective, experience and insight that benefit 
first-time team members, veteran coaches said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools consistently in the running have been El Camino Real, Venice, 
University and Palisades high schools. And some say that North Hollywood, 
Canoga, Van Nuys and Garfield are dark horse candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Each nine-member team at the decathlon is handpicked from the brightest 
members of the student body in three categories, grouped according to 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend up to five hours a day preparing for the tests in 10 academic 
events: including economics, fine arts and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz, to be held today in the cavernous Los Angeles Convention 
Center, is the only event open to the public, and it attracts raucous boosters 
from every school. The topic this year: biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although winners from the Super Quiz are announced immediately, the overall 
winning team will be announced at a banquet Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the district champions will compete in a statewide decathlon in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the city, students prepared Friday in a variety of ways. Many were 
pulled out of classes and spent all day brushing up on weak events. At 
Chatsworth High School, team members took the day off to study at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino Real team, wearing elegant dark-blue "1994-95 Aca Deca Squad" 
(short for academic decathlon) jackets, took a short break from their studies 
Friday afternoon to hear last-minute advice from speech coach Sharon Markenson. 
Then they ate strudel from the team's well-stocked classroom refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous as hell," said Arabella David, a junior. "This is the culmination 
of eight months of studying. Our only thought is to beat Taft." 
</P>
<P>
 Another El Camino Real team member, junior Dale Shuger, said the weeks of 
stress and staying at school until 10 p.m. were too much. She will not be 
coming back next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once is understandable, but twice is kind of stupid," Dale said. "It's just a 
lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino Real team said they deal with pre-competition jitters by using 
deep breathing exercises. "It helps keep you calm and focused," Arabella said.

CASE VERSUS FLEISS RESTS AFTER JURY VIEWS TAPE; COURTS: PROSECUTION FINISHES 
ARGUMENTS AFTER VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY FROM ALLEGED PROSTITUTE. WOMAN SAYS SHE 
WORKED FOR DEFENDANT.

 The prosecution in the Heidi Fleiss pandering case rested Friday after 
testimony from a young woman who said the alleged Hollywood madam sent her to a 
hotel to engage in sex for money. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony videotaped for the jury earlier in the day because of illness, 
Kimberly Burch said Fleiss called her in June and told her to go the Beverly 
Hilton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You expected to engage in sex for money, didn't you?" Burch was asked on the 
tape by Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I did," the young woman said. "I knew what was expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to Burch and three other reputed call girls, the "clients" that 
evening were undercover police officers posing as businessmen. Burch testified 
that one of the officers, speaking in fractured English, counted out $1,500 in 
$100 bills and asked what sexual acts she would perform for that fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, "about 20" law enforcement officers burst into the room and 
arrested Burch and three other alleged prostitutes -- Peggy Schinke, Samantha 
Burdette and Brandi McClain. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination by Fleiss attorney Donald Marks, Burch testified that the 
police officers at all times brought up the issues of money and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was (Beverly Hills) Detective (Sammy) Lee who first raised the issue of 
money," Marks said, referring to the leader of the undercover sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, Ms. Burch, you never said anything about money. . . . You 
never asked for any money and you never raised it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Burch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burch told Marks at the end of her testimony that she had never before been 
paid for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was the fourth day of testimony in the case. Defense attorneys will 
launch their case Monday. The prosecution called only four witnesses -- Burch, 
Burdette, Lee and another undercover officer who seized cocaine Burdette 
allegedly gave Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdette and Burch testified under immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was in recess Thursday, but during Wednesday's testimony, Burdette, 
a Colorado model, said Fleiss twice sent her to a Beverly Hills hotel suite in 
June, 1993, where Burdette was to receive $1,500 for having sex. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first encounter, Lee posed as a Hawaiian businessman. Burdette was 
secretly videotaped allegedly prostituting herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdette and three other reputed call girls returned the next night to the 
hotel suite, where Lee pretended to be entertaining three business colleagues. 
The four women were videotaped describing what sexual acts they would provide 
for $1,500 apiece and were arrested when they began to remove their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 For procuring the four women for those five acts of prostitution and a related 
narcotics charge, the 28-year-old Fleiss faces a maximum sentence of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorneys said Lee and his vice squad task force entrapped Fleiss. They 
also say she is the victim of selective prosecution and that police failed to 
arrest her wealthy clients even though their identities are known. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss and her 60-year-old pediatrician father, Paul, also are under 
indictment on federal charges of money laundering and fraud. In that action, 
set for a January trial, they face sentences of about five years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss returned this week to her Pasadena boutique that sells pajamas and 
T-shirts called Heidi Wear. She had been residing in a live-in drug treatment 
facility for violating bail conditions in the federal case, but was released 
Wednesday.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN RECEIVES FINAL CHECK FOR COMPUTER LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a troupe of Rockwell aerospace officials looked on, a robot arm in the 
automation engineering lab at Cal State Northridge reached out Friday to grab a 
mock $100,000 check, go through a series of gyrations and finally hand it over 
to a smiling CSUN President Blenda Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the robot, the scene was typical of corporate presentations. This 
one marked the final annual installment of a $300,000 grant by Rockwell's 
Canoga Park-based Rocketdyne division, which enabled the campus to get a modern 
computer-aided design and manufacturing setup. Rockwell, in turn, got a school 
lab bearing its name. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath the niceties was a hard reality, said CSUN computer science 
professor Larry Lichten, who directs the campus's automation engineering 
program. If public universities in these tight-money days hope to stay 
technologically current, they must depend on corporate generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is as good a lab as anybody among local universities has been able to 
put together, especially in the Cal State system, which is on a shoestring," 
Lichten said. Of the corporate partnership that made it possible, he said: "All 
the CSUs are trying to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, before the grant from the Rockwell Trust, Lichten said he had 
to apologize to students for having out-of-date equipment and computer 
software. With the grant, CSUN upgraded its 10 older computer design and 
manufacturing stations by linking them to 10 new state-of-the-art ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne Vice President Byron Wood said such giving benefits the company, 
because it enables CSUN to turn out engineering and computer science graduates 
who are technologically up-to-date. Rocketdyne likes to hire local talent, he 
said, and otherwise would have to retrain those new hires. 
</P>
<P>
 Although general hiring has slowed in recent years, Wood estimated Rocketdyne 
has hired about 140 CSUN graduates in the past seven years and has given other 
financial support to the university. "We've been very pleased with the quality 
of these students who have come out of the university," he said. JOHN CHANDLER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; LEADER FOR EVENING HIGH SCHOOL NAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Duncan, principal of Hoover High School, was selected Friday to head the 
new Evening High School that will open next September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale School Board voted unanimously to appoint Duncan, who expressed 
early interest in the innovative program that offers comprehensive classes for 
regular high school students in the late afternoon and evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than a dozen such programs exist in the country, and Glendale is one of 
the first among California school districts to test the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening High School will be based at Glendale High School, but will have an 
entirely separate identity. Administrators, staff members and students will 
share Glendale High's facilities and supplies, but will attend school just as 
others are ending their day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenges are, one, getting enough students to get it started and 
working with the daytime school," said Duncan, 60. "Putting all those things 
together and starting a school from scratch will be something frustrating but a 
real challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Unified School District is hoping to alleviate overcrowding, 
while avoiding unpopular year-round schedules and the addition of portable 
classrooms on already crammed campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Evening High School needs a minimum of 200 to 250 students to open the first 
year, district officials have said. One of Duncan's first duties is to help 
recruit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan will leave Hoover High after 21 years as principal. He began his career 
with the district as a teacher in 1957 and moved his way up through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 His position at Hoover High is one of three openings that will be available 
for school principals in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Biermann, principal of Crescenta Valley High School, was named as the 
district's director of student support services Friday. Lois Neil, principal of 
Rosemont Middle School, will become the district's director of instructional 
support services. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; BELATED DEDICATION SET FOR TRAIN STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metrolink station in Northridge has been in operation since February, but 
it has never been an official station on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all to be remedied today when the station -- built in just five days to 
relieve transportation problems caused by the Northridge earthquake -- is 
dedicated with a country western carnival, games and a "Metrolink Hayride." 
</P>
<P>
 The station was one of eight emergency stops throughout the San Fernando, 
Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys to be pressed into service within 60 days of 
the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, it takes eight months to build a station," said Peter Hidalgo, 
Metrolink spokesman. "Because of the incredible cooperation between the county, 
state and federal governments, many red-tape procedures were eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible what can be done when people are working together." 
</P>
<P>
 The belated dedication event will commence at 11 a.m. with public addresses 
from transportation officials. The country western carnival will feature pony 
rides, a merry-go-round, cowboy clowns and hay bales set up throughout the 
Northridge station parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In commemoration of the event, Metrolink will also be offering free "hay 
rides" during the morning and afternoon to the Northridge station from both the 
Van Nuys and Chatsworth stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to provide an opportunity to sample the clean, fast and safe train 
service at no cost," said Hidalgo. "This special weekend service is a treat to 
anyone who wants to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Metrolink Station is located at 8775 Wilbur Ave. ANTONIO OLIVO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; 2 BUSINESSES SEEK TO KEEP FREEWAY SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Calabasas business people ordered by the Planning Commission to remove 
nonconforming freeway signs say they will ask the City Council to overturn the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will appeal the case to the City Council and see what happens," said John 
Barkhordar, owner of Calabasas Mobil on Calabasas Road. "We have to work it out 
somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks Friday were echoed by Scott Soller, general manager of Red Robin 
Restaurant, next door to Barkhordar's station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mobil station, which has a 100-foot sign, and Red Robin, with a 60-foot 
sign, have been given 90 days to take down the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say both signs, which were installed about 20 years ago, have 
been non-complying since 1977, when the county adopted an ordinance setting a 
42-foot height limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkhordar and Soller argue they need the signs to attract business from the 
freeway and that under the state's business and professions code, they should 
be given 15 years to remove the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see how this is not going to (adversely) affect business," Soller 
said. "We've already spent $1,300 on permits. It's getting a little 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkhordar said he recently put up a temporary 42-foot sign to see if it would 
be visible from the freeway. He said it was not and that he plans to apply for 
a special permit to install a 60-foot sign to replace the 100-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the sign ordinance is designed to protect the scenic beauty 
of the city, not harass business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to establish that there is a city here and there are rules," said 
Planning Commissioner Dave Brown in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In Agoura Hills, 12 businesses sued the city for the right to keep their 
freeway signs, which were outlawed in 1985. A hearing has been set on the 
matter for Feb. 15 in Van Nuys Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley said she hopes the situation can be resolved 
amicably. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what concerns me is that we have no alternatives to offer businesses, 
such as logo signs," she said. "It would be my personal preference to spend the 
time and effort to push legislation to allow logo signs. I feel the business 
owners would then be happy to comply." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a measure before the Legislature earlier this year that would have 
permitted business logo signs along freeways, but the measure was defeated, 
some say through the efforts of freeway sign owners. FRANK MANNING

HIGH SCHOOL RIVALS CRAM FOR THE CITY'S SUPER BOWL OF SMARTS; EDUCATION: 
FOUR-TIME WINNER TAFT HIGH IS FAVORED BY MANY IN THE ACADEMIC DECATHLON, BUT 
OTHER TEAMS ARE STUDYING HARD FOR AN UPSET. IT'S WARFARE, SAYS ONE COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They were hunkered down Friday, focusing on what will soon be the most intense 
11 hours of their high school careers. 
</P>
<P>
 In last-minute cram sessions across the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
hundreds of competitors were readying themselves for what has become one of the 
most hotly contested and widely watched high school rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a basketball tournament. It's not a football game. It's a test. 
</P>
<P>
 During today's 14th annual Los Angeles Unified Academic Decathlon, 495 
students from 55 teams will be burning up their memory banks and racking their 
brains in response to an overwhelming battery of exams, speech and essay 
contests, as well as interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 And, according to coaches and students, the pressure to excel is extreme. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't believe the psychological warfare that goes on," said David 
Roberson, coach of El Camino Real High School's team in Woodland Hills. "I've 
coached football and golf and they're nothing like this. Nothing comes close to 
preparing for the pressure of the decathlon." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that pressure stems from the rampant, behind-the-scenes handicapping 
of teams among coaches, who make a hobby of trying to predict the outcome by 
studying the results of scrimmages and practice tests. They analyze the 
significance of the number of returning team members, and even the number of 
years the coach has led the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-time winner Taft High School, also of Woodland Hills, took the city, 
state and national championships last year and is favored by many to win for a 
third consecutive year. Coach Arthur Berchin is described by other coaches as 
obsessive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, he refused to be interviewed about his team's preparations and kept 
his players equally off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That even convinces me more that Taft is going to win," said Dan Speltner, a 
former decathlon coach from Dorsey High School in Los Angeles. "It's that 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 But with five students returning from last year's second-place team, some 
think Marshall High School of Los Angeles may have the upper hand. Returning 
students often bring perspective, experience and insight that benefit other 
first-time team members, veteran coaches said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools consistently in the running have been El Camino Real, Venice, 
the Westside's University and Palisades high schools. And some say that North 
Hollywood, Canoga, Van Nuys and Garfield of Los Angeles are dark-horse 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Each nine-member team at the decathlon is handpicked from the brightest 
members of the student body in three categories, grouped according to 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend up to five hours a day preparing for the tests in 10 academic 
events, including economics, fine arts and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Quiz, to be held today in the Los Angeles Convention Center, is the 
only event open to the public and attracts raucous boosters from every school. 
The topic this year: biotechnology. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the winners from the Super Quiz are announced immediately, the 
overall winning team will be announced at a banquet Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In March the district champions will compete in a statewide decathlon in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the city, students prepared Friday in a variety of ways. Many were 
pulled out of classes and spent all day brushing up on weak events. At 
Chatsworth High, team members took the day off to study at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino Real team, wearing elegant dark-blue "1994-95 Aca Deca Squad" 
(short for academic decathlon) jackets, took a break from their studies Friday 
afternoon to hear last-minute advice from speech coach Sharon Markenson. Then 
they ate strudels from the team's well-stocked classroom refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous as hell," said Arabella David, a junior who looks forward to 
competing again next year. "This is the culmination of eight months of 
studying. Our only thought is to beat Taft." 
</P>
<P>
 Another El Camino Real team member, junior Dale Shuger, said the weeks of 
stress and staying at school until 10 p.m. were too much. She won't be coming 
back next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once is understandable, but twice is kind of stupid," said Dale. "It's just a 
lot of work." 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino Real team said they deal with pre-competition jitters by using 
deep breathing exercises. "It helps keep you calm and focused," Arabella said.

OPPONENTS FEAR RENEWED PUSH FOR PRAYER IN SCHOOLS; CONSTITUTION: CONSERVATIVE 
REPUBLICAN TAKEOVER OF HOUSE AND SENATE IS EXPECTED TO FUEL BATTLE OVER 1ST 
AMENDMENT ISSUES. MOST RELIGIOUS GROUPS ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religion News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Religious organizations and 1st Amendment advocacy groups are reacting with a 
mixture of caution and outright hostility to the growing political push for 
some form of organized prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of strict separation of church and state expect the nation's public 
schools to become even more of a battleground over 1st Amendment issues now 
that conservative Republicans have gained control of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), the probable House Speaker in the next Congress, 
has indicated that he plans to push for an early vote on a constitutional 
amendment to permit prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton heightened the debate this week, first with a conciliatory 
nod toward the prayer amendment, then by backing away and suggesting that he 
might support a less divisive "moment of reflection" during the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Both scenarios are potentially problematic to religious groups that believe 
any form of organized prayer would erode students' constitutional rights to 
free expression of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that public school sponsored prayer violated 
constitutionally mandated church-state separation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, a Republican-led Senate rejected a proposal for a voluntary 
school prayer amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment requires a hard to get two-thirds approval in both 
the House and Senate, plus ratification by two-thirds of the states. 
</P>
<P>
 If a school prayer amendment gained the necessary two-thirds support, said 
Robert Boston, a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and 
State, it is likely that the required state approval would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the nation's current conservative political climate, he said, amendment 
approval would "tear through the states like a brush fire." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the prospect of a constitutional change that is raising the strongest 
objections in the church world. Gingrich backs a proposal, now before Congress, 
that would allow individual or group prayer in a public school if students are 
not required to participate and the government does not compose the prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result of a school prayer amendment would not be the protection of 
religious liberty, a value we all cherish, but imposition upon students of 
obligatory prayers or an embarrassing abstention," said Alfred H. Moses, 
president of the American Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing worse for religion than when the government gets too cozy 
with a particular faith," said Steve McFarland, director of the Christian Legal 
Society's Center for Law and Religious Freedom. "The power to endorse your 
faith will allow someone else to endorse their faith at your expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Various U.S. Supreme Court decisions have upheld the right of students to pray 
as individuals or in groups as long as the prayers are not organized by school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of organized prayer claim that under an organized system, peer 
pressure would intimidate students -- particularly adherents of minority 
religions such as Jews, Hindus and Muslims -- into praying even if they did not 
want to. And by choosing what prayers could be said, critics say administrators 
would be guilty of "establishment of religion" in violation of the 1st 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 But those opposed to the no-pray policy contend that some school districts 
have gone too far, unlawfully curtailing all religious expression. They want 
more guarantees of liberties for religious students written into the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to go back to how it was before 1963, when the school was 
setting prayers and Scripture readings," said Richard D. Land, executive 
director of the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. 
"But we also are not going to accept the dismal situation of the last 30 years, 
where we have had an attempt to actively or passively censor religious 
expression on the part of students in our public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools should not sponsor religious activities or give the appearance of 
either advocating or denigrating religion," Land added. But "our students are 
American citizens, and they do not leave their 1st Amendment rights at the 
boundaries of public school property." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about students' right to witness to each other, being able to 
wear religious jewelry, T-shirts with religious expressions, being able to 
carry a Bible, to pray over lunch," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his group's longstanding support for religious expression in public 
schools, Land was cautious in his support of any congressionally sponsored 
prayer amendment. Any support, he said, would "depend on what's in it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Land said, nevertheless, that he sees no problem with an amendment allowing 
public schools to offer students a short period -- say, five minutes a day -- 
for "a silent moment of prayer or meditation. Anything beyond that, I get 
exceedingly nervous with." 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Montgomery, counsel for the conservative National Assn. of Evangelicals 
based in Carol Stream, Ill., said the current proposal in Congress suffers from 
the same shortfall that caused his group to oppose a school prayer amendment 
proposed during the Ronald Reagan Administration in 1982: It would allow school 
administrators to decide what prayers would be said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have the same reservations about Caesar getting in the prayer 
composing business that we had in 1982," said Montgomery, in a reference to the 
biblical admonition to "Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's and unto God 
that which is God's." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the strongest school prayer support within organized religion appears 
to come from the American Center for Law and Justice, a legal action group 
founded by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Sekulow, lead attorney for the center, has called the drive for a school 
prayer amendment "almost unstoppable" and said it has been fueled by actions 
taken by authorities denying students their right to pray in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Sekulow said the amendment now in Congress needs to be revised to 
place more emphasis on student-led prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 If caution is the watchword of the school prayer debate, it was quite evident 
this week at a meeting of the interfaith Coalition for the Free Exercise of 
Religion, which spans the spectrum from the conservative Concerned Women for 
America to the liberal National Council of Churches and the Unitarian 
Universalist Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't find a single lawyer with a conservative organization that 
supports the amendment as drafted," Oliver Thomas, chairman of the coalition, 
said of the coalition meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal-designate William Keeler of Baltimore, president of the National 
Conference of Catholic Bishops, on Thursday expressed qualified support for 
some type of religious expression in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our conference has said that we would be interested in school prayer . . . if 
it is coupled with instruction in their (students') own faith," Keeler said. 
</P>
<P>
 He referred to a practice in many school districts in the 1940s and 1950s 
known as "release time" in which students received religious instruction -- 
either at their public school or some other place -- by priests or religious 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keeler declined to comment on the proposed congressional amendment. "We 
don't comment on legislation until we see the language it would take," he said.

<P>
 More than 300 Roman Catholics, led by Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, are expected 
to march in Downtown Los Angeles today to underscore the importance of families 
in encouraging their children to become priests, brothers and nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles archdiocese -- the nation's largest -- has been able to avoid 
so-called "priestless parishes" brought about in other jurisdictions by a 
shortage of priests. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 284 parishes and 11 missions in the area have full-time priests, 
and the archdiocese reports a gradual upswing in the number of seminary 
graduates ordained to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, church officials said there is a continuing need to promote awareness 
of the role that parents can play in encouraging their sons to become priests 
or brothers in religious orders, and their daughters to become sisters in 
religious orders. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 1,300 priests in the Los Angeles archdiocese, 210 brothers and 2,116 
sisters, according to Fr. Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is tied in with the International Year of the Family, proclaimed 
by the United Nations. "We felt this walk would be a great way to honor the 
family as the source of church vocations," said Sister Kathy Bryant, sister 
vocation director for the archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 The march will begin at 2 p.m. at St. Vibiana's Cathedral at 2nd and Main 
streets in Downtown Los Angeles, and proceed to Our Lady of Guadalupe parish 
several blocks away. Families are invited to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be refreshments and festivities, including mariachis. 
</P>
<P>

PRELATES ALSO URGE THAT MORE TOP JOBS IN THE CHURCH BE FILLED BY WOMEN DESPITE 
BAN ON ORDINATION. THEY CALL FOR 'MORAL REVOLUTION' TO COUNTER 'GROWING CULTURE 
OF VIOLENCE.'

 The nation's Ro man Catholic bishops ended their four-day annual conference 
Thursday with the adoption of a wide-ranging set of rules that will broaden 
local bishops' influence over the medical and business practices of Catholic 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The prelates, ending the annual fall meeting of the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops, also issued a statement sharply critical of the passage of 
California's Proposition 187, calling it "symptomatic of deeply rooted fear and 
frustration among our citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which would deny education and most health services to illegal 
immigrants, was approved by 59% of the state's voters last week, but 
enforcement was blocked Wednesday by a federal judge while the courts consider 
the constitutionality of its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In seeking to cure social and economic ills, this proposition strikes at the 
most vulnerable among us -- children, the sick and the needy -- without 
addressing the larger social and political causes for the problems, especially 
at the federal level," the bishops' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, Cardinal-designate William Keeler, president of the 
bishops' group, called that statement on immigration and one adopted earlier in 
the week on violence "the two most important actions" the bishops took. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which generated little controversy or debate, also found the 
bishops walking a tightrope between closer scrutiny of their actions by the 
Vatican and their efforts to broaden the participation of women in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a document aimed at easing tensions prompted by Pope John Paul II's 
statement this year that the subject of female ordination in the Catholic 
Church is no longer open to debate, the bishops declared their belief in "the 
fundamental equality of women and men" and urged that more top jobs in the 
church be filled by women. But they refused to challenge the Pope's 
declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bishops ruled out discussion of ordination, their statement 
acknowledged that sexism is still present in the church and suggested 
alternative ways women can exercise power in the nation's largest Christian 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can say with certainty that discrimination against women contradicts the 
will of Christ," the bishops said. "We are painfully aware that sexism . . . is 
still present in some members of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reject sexism and pledge renewed efforts to guard against it in church 
teaching and practice. We commit ourselves to make sure that our words and 
actions express our belief in the equality of all women and men." 
</P>
<P>
 The adoption of the statement, "Strengthening the Bonds of Peace," came after 
nearly two hours of debate, most of it directed at an amendment that liberal 
bishops feared would be used by opponents of feminism to undermine the drive 
for equality. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Archbishop John Roach of Minneapolis-St. Paul, those bishops prevailed 
in inserting substitute language, calling on the amendment to reject any 
"extreme position that impedes dialogue and divides the church." 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to enlarge the role of women, the statement calls on the bishops to 
look at ways women can fill more top jobs in the church at the parish and 
diocesan level and the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Kane, executive director of the National Council of Catholic Women, 
called the statement "a great affirmation" of the role of women and praised the 
steps the bishops have taken in putting women in top posts in the church's 
bureaucracy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican's oversight of the U.S. church was demonstrated in a small but 
important way during the brief discussion of the new rules for Catholic health 
care facilities. Bishop Alfred Hughes of Baton Rouge, La., chairman of the 
conference's doctrine committee, acknowledged that the Vatican had told the 
bishops to make about 50 amendments to the directives. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those Vatican amendments were aimed at eliminating any suggestion of 
differences among theologians or bishops on the issue of what kinds of medical 
treatment are ethically allowable. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules update a similar set of regulations issued in 1971 by taking 
into account changes in medical technology, such as in vitro fertilization, and 
the economically driven trend among Catholic hospitals to form partnerships and 
alliances with non-Catholic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "While we rejoice in the potential for good inherent in many of these (new 
reproductive) technologies, we cannot assume that what is technically possible 
is always morally right," the rules state. "Reproductive technologies that 
substitute for the marriage act are not consistent with human dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 The directives allow some forms of assisted conception but reject artificial 
insemination, surrogate motherhood, fetal experimentation, sterilization and 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a section on the care of the dying, the new rules reaffirm the church's 
longstanding opposition to suicide and euthanasia as "never . . . morally 
acceptable options." But the rules do allow painkilling medicines to be given 
to a dying patient "even if this therapy may indirectly shorten the person's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The most profound result of the new rules is that local bishops will be given 
the authority to approve or disapprove of new forms of partnership between 
Catholic and non-Catholic facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Such partnerships "can pose serious challenges" in carrying out Catholic moral 
principles, the rules state. "The risk of scandal cannot be underestimated when 
partnerships are not built upon common values and moral principles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The prelates also adopted a statement decrying what they called the growing 
culture of violence in America, and they heard an interim report by a committee 
on sexual abuse against children by priests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence -- in our homes, our schools and streets, our nation and world -- is 
destroying the lives, dignity and hopes of millions of our sisters and 
brothers," the bishops' statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops decried social trends that contribute to violence. They cited 
everything from aggressive driving and sensationalist talk shows to pornography 
and the easy availability of guns. What is needed, they said, is a "moral 
revolution" that would repair the nation's frayed social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops' statement, "Confronting a Culture of Violence: A Catholic 
Framework for Action," joins a growing chorus of concern that has included 
statements and workshops by such groups as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
America, the United Methodist Church and the National Council of Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Auxiliary Bishop John Ricard of Baltimore, chairman of the committee that 
drafted the statement, said the bishops "do not believe the traditional liberal 
and conservative answers are adequate responses to this crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a clear sense of right and wrong," he said. "We value things more 
than people . . . This is not about policies and politics, but life and death." 
</P>
<P>
 In an oral report on the efforts of the church to deal with sexual misconduct 
by pastors and other church employees, Bishop John Kinney of Fargo, N.D., told 
the bishops that "in most dioceses, strong, pastoral and effective written 
local policies" are in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I speak for all of us when I say that as bishops of this country, 
we are sorry for the pain and scandal caused by the actions" of pedophiles in 
the church community, "especially when they are our own priests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are also sorry for those times we have not handled these matters in the 
best possible way."

BIKE PATH PROPOSED ALONG RIVER; COMMUTING: ROUTE MIGHT ATTRACT AS MANY AS 2,000 
WHO COULD AVOID RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC ON A LINK FROM DOWNTOWN L.A. TO THE SEPULVEDA 
BASIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Under a plan being drafted by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, bicyclists 
would be able to pedal past traffic gridlock on a bike path winding about 17 
miles alongside the Los Angeles River from the Sepulveda Basin to Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of decreasing traffic congestion and expanding recreational 
opportunities, the corps is drafting plans for a bicycle path along the access 
road that borders the river, for the first time connecting the bikeways of the 
San Fernando Valley to Downtown Los Angeles, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly proposed bike path would hook up at Griffith Park with a seven-mile 
bikeway that the city plans to build from the park to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles River is an ideal route for a path," said Nancy Wedeen, a 
North Hollywood cycling instructor and member of the League of American 
Bicyclists. "We think it's a good investment to improve the health and sanity 
of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Although federal officials provided only $200,000 to draft the plan, a 
spokeswoman for Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) said he plans to 
talk with other federal and local officials about allocating additional money 
for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been very interested in doing things to rehabilitate the river," said 
Beilenson's spokeswoman, Melissa Kuckro. "We'd love to keep the bike path 
project going." 
</P>
<P>
 A draft report and environmental study by the corps will be completed in 
January. It proposes a 10-mile link that would run south along the west side of 
the river and connect with a previously approved path from Griffith Park to 
Elysian Park, just blocks north of the city's Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps' plan will provide only a general outline of the track to be 
followed by the bicycle path and offer some options for routing the path under 
or over street crossings, freeways and other obstacles, said Juan Villalobos, 
project manager for the corps. The plan will also provide a cost estimate for 
construction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But until funding for construction is found, the corps will not launch more 
detailed studies to begin construction of the path, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we hear otherwise, or we find other funds to do more, we are not 
authorized to do more," Villalobos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting at Sepulveda Boulevard, near the San Diego and Ventura freeways, the 
path would run eastward about 10 miles, meeting up at Griffith Park with a 
seven-mile river-side path to Elysian Park near Downtown that has already been 
approved and funded by city and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 City transportation officials said they are preparing to hire contractors to 
build the first three-mile phase at the northern end of the $5-million bike 
path from Griffith Park to Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If they do not run into any unforeseen hitches, construction of the 
12-foot-wide Griffith Park-to-Downtown bikeway is expected to begin in June, to 
be completed by early 1996 and dubbed the "Los Angeles River Bike Path." 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle enthusiasts have predicted that the path will attract as many as 2,000 
bicyclists commuting to work each day, with more joining in when the proposed 
extension is built. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 survey conducted by a commuter service company found that only two out 
of 500 Los Angeles County commuters rely primarily on a bicycle to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But bicyclists say the number of pedaling commuters is low because there are 
not enough paths and most dread competing with motorists on the city's 
congested and often-dangerous streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is money available we would like to see money used on bicycle 
transportation," Wedeen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A city bicycle plan calls for doubling the current 300 miles of bike paths and 
lanes in the city over the next 10 to 15 years, said Michelle Mowery, the 
city's bicycle coordinator. The path proposed by the corps had not previously 
been considered in the plan, he said.

REP. BEILENSON CLAIMS WIN; SYBERT CHARGES VOTER FRAUD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) declared victory Friday over 
Republican candidate Rich Sybert, but Sybert said he may ask Congress to deny 
Beilenson his seat on grounds of election fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 With some ballots still uncounted in the 24th Congressional District race, 
Beilenson campaign manager Craig Miller said he expects the nine-term 
congressman to maintain or increase his lead of 3,206 votes -- just five more 
than when election officials finished the first tally of ballots on election 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, 42, a former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, acknowledged that the vote 
totals so far favor Beilenson, 62, but refused to concede the election. Sybert 
said he and his campaign staff are examining the possibility of suing Beilenson 
or petitioning the GOP-controlled House of Representatives to refuse to seat 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said poll-watchers for his campaign reported that ballot boxes were 
left unlocked at some Encino polling places and that absentee voter lists were 
not maintained, raising the possibility that some voters cast two ballots in an 
area he described as a Beilenson stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert also charged that brochures distorting his positions had been mailed to 
Republican voters the day before the election by two groups falsely purporting 
to represent the GOP.

 REPAIRED CHURCHES: Ten months after the Northridge earthquake, two San 
Fernando Valley churches that each sustained about $500,000 damage are about to 
return to their customary worship surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:30 a.m. Sunday, the congregation at St. Stephen's Lutheran Church, 15950 
Chatsworth St., Granada Hills, will proceed from the church's fellowship hall 
to its refurbished sanctuary, loosing helium-filled balloons as they go. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Kapp Johnson, who became pastor of the 450-member congregation the day 
before the Jan. 17 quake, said the church's recovery has been aided by a Small 
Business Administration loan for half the damages plus more than $150,000 from 
religious and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Stephen's received $40,000 from the national disaster fund of its parent 
denomination, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday at 5 p.m., the parishioners at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic 
Church, 18115 Sherman Way, Reseda, will gather for the first Mass in the church 
since the completion of repairs. The African-American Choir from Sacred Heart 
Catholic Church in Altadena will sing and Nigerian-born Father Mike Ume from 
St. Genevieve Church in Van Nuys will preach. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,300-family parish, which typically has about 2,700 people at weekend 
Masses, was covered by earthquake insurance except for a $100,000 deductible, 
said Father Sean Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Both congregations met in tents for services in the period immediately after 
the Jan. 17 earthquake, then used their social halls. 
</P>
<P>
 JOINT MEAL: Members of the Valley Outreach Synagogue and Kirk O' the Valley 
Presbyterian Church will meet at the Reseda church Tuesday night for a 
Thanksgiving meal and worship service. 
</P>
<P>
 The interfaith service, which starts at 7:45 p.m., is open to anyone who wants 
to attend, said Chet B. Gean, pastor of the church at 19620 Vanowen St. Members 
of the two congregations will bring canned goods and non-perishable foods which 
will be donated to a food pantry in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 INTERFAITH SERVICE: The fifth annual Thanksgiving service of the Santa Clarita 
Interfaith Council will be held at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at St. Clare's Catholic 
Church, 27341 Camp Plenty Road, Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants have been asked to bring a donation of food or money for use by 
the Santa Clarita Valley Food Pantry, according to council President Pete 
Falbo, pastor of Valencia United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 GREGORIAN CHANT: The Chapel of Charlemagne choir will sing Gregorian chants in 
a concert at 7:30 p.m. today to raise funds to replace a quake-damaged pipe 
organ at St. John the Baptist de la Salle Church in Granada Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 The group is based at Cal State University Los Angeles and directed by Robert 
Fowells. Requested donations are $10 for adults and $7 for senior citizens and 
students. The church is at 16545 Chatsworth St. 
</P>
<P>
 ALTERNATIVE GIFTS: Granada Hills First Presbyterian Church is hosting an 
"alternative Christmas market" today for those who want to buy presents that 
raise money for donations to Third World relief, medical and shelter needs of 
the homeless, and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old market, which benefits 20 relief and development agencies, 
will be held at the church, 10400 Zelzah Ave., from 10:30 a.m to noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The market will also be held at 10:30 a.m. on Dec. 4, 11 and 18 at Burbank 
First United Methodist Church, 700 N. Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about Alternative Gift Markets, Inc., Lucerne Valley, call

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEWHALL SCHOOL DISTRICT PREPARES FOR 
TRANSFERS; EDUCATION: PARENTS CHOOSE NEIGHBORHOODS BASED ON CAMPUSES THERE, 
OFFICIALS SAY. BUT NEXT FALL, 500 STUDENTS WILL BE MOVED TO NEW STEVENSON RANCH 
ELEMENTARY. 
</P>

<P>
 School officials are bracing for public reaction to changes they plan in 
attendance boundaries in the Newhall School District that will require the 
transfer of 500 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfers will be from the district's six existing schools to Stevenson 
Ranch Elementary School when it opens next fall, said Supt. J. Michael McGrath. 
 
</P>
<P>
 About 275 students live in the Stevenson Ranch housing complex west of Santa 
Clarita, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boundary changes are typically an emotionally charged issue, with parents 
stating they moved to a particular neighborhood so that their children could 
attend a specific school, McGrath said.  
</P>
<P>
 But McGrath said parents and students usually adapt to the changes. "Once all 
of the fur has flown and the smoke has cleared they're happy with their new 
schools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of parents have shown up at board meetings to protest the planned 
changes, which will be unveiled Dec. 6. Others say they won't be concerned 
unless their children's education will be substantially affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids started at this school and they're used to it, but at the same time 
my son likes the idea of going to a new school," said Gloria Slavenwhite, 
waiting to pick her son up from Wiley Canyon Elementary School. "He's in fifth 
grade now . . . so he would be the first to graduate from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavenwhite, who lives at the edge of the city limits adjacent to Stevenson 
Ranch, said she would object to her son being transferred only if the new 
school lacks the gifted student program in which her son is now enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said he will complete as many as 10 alternative plans by Thanksgiving 
and probably submit the best three or four to the board of trustees, who must 
approve a plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to remain a secret until the meeting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three public meetings will be scheduled after the plans are unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said the alternatives vary by emphasizing different factors, such as 
achieving ethnic balance and minimizing the number of students bused. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing students to go to a school within walking distance and accepting 
parental input on school decisions were the most important factors cited in a 
mail-in survey returned by 1,218 parents -- about a third of those who received 
it. Other factors, such as spreading special education programs evenly among 
schools, were also favored by a majority of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The only category a majority of parents considered not important was achieving 
ethnic and socioeconomic balance among schools, with 53% stating the district 
should not make it a priority when drawing boundaries. McGrath said the 
district is required by law to make a reasonable effort to achieve ethnic 
balance.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW SCHOOL PROGRAM LEADS TO 2ND ARREST; 
LITTLEROCK: EDUCATION OFFICIALS SAY STUDENT IS HELD AFTER PEERS REPORT HIM AS 
PART OF CASH-FOR-CRIME-TIPS PLAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Authorities have arrested a 17-year-old Littlerock High School student, found 
with a 9-millimeter handgun, in the second arrest stemming from a new 
cash-for-crime-tips program, school officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested the junior in his business class Thursday, with a 
semiautomatic handgun in his waistband and a loaded clip in his pocket, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two students who reported the boy each received $25 rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schoolmates told (a teacher) that he was carrying a gun," said Sgt. Bob 
Denham of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. The minor, whose name was not 
released, was charged with possession of a concealed firearm and taken to 
juvenile hall in Sylmar, Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new anti-crime program -- approved this week by the Antelope Valley Union 
High School District -- offers $25 rewards to high school students for 
information about peers who paint graffiti or bring weapons and illegal drugs 
into school. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the money, the student tips must lead to an arrest, according to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, sheriff's deputies arrested a Littlerock High School student 
found with a BB gun. The student was charged with a misdemeanor firearms 
violation and was released to his parents, Denham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock High School Principal Jeffrey E. Foster said on Friday: "Our 
message is clear . . . this is a weapon- and drug-free zone, and we are going 
to make sure it stays that way." 
</P>
<P>
 School trustees voted unanimously to institute the program at the district's 
five high schools Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the names of students who come forward remain confidential. 
They can give a tip to a teacher, a school administrator or call a telephone 
hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has received mixed reactions from students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say they believe it will reduce crime and keep campuses safer. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said the "snitch program," as some called it, could result in 
retaliation if students are identified. They said $25 is not enough to risk 
putting their lives in jeopardy by tattling on armed classmates.

SMITH TAKES IT TO BANK AS LAKERS WIN AT BUZZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pressure? The Lakers had played poorly the previous four games, three of which 
were losses, and now, after holding Cleveland to 31 points in the first half 
and leading by 12 at the start of the fourth quarter, they trailed by one in 
the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure? The final shot belonged to Tony Smith, a defensive specialist, the 
guy Coach Del Harris had chosen to play down the stretch ahead of Cedric 
Ceballos, Eddie Jones and Anthony Peeler. This was an option, only not the 
first or second. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith made it work, banking in a three-pointer from the left side at the 
buzzer to give the Lakers an 82-80 victory over the Cavaliers on Friday before 
10,177 at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was an easy shot, I'm sure he would have felt the pressure," Nick Van 
Exel said. "But a shot like that, it was a prayer." 
</P>
<P>
 The shot, over a charging John Williams, the Cavaliers' 6-foot-11 center, was 
also huge for the Lakers no matter the expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was on the line," Smith said after making the first game-winning 
shot of his NBA career. "You've just got to do what comes naturally. You've 
just got to throw the ball up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had started the play -- after a full timeout and a 20-second 
timeout in succession -- with 2.6 seconds to go when Smith threw the entry pass 
to Sedale Threatt. Smith got the ball back with time running out and Williams 
running at him. Another defender, Chris Mills, was approaching from the right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith fired high to avoid Williams and banked it off the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see it," said Smith, who made three of four shots, including two 
of three three-pointers, en route to eight points in nine minutes. "John 
Williams was all over my face. I couldn't see it until it was coming off the 
glass." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harris: "I could see it all the way. But I didn't think it was going in." 
</P>
<P>
 When it did, the Lakers had a shot in the arm as much as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of game a young team is not supposed to win," Harris said. 
"We were outscored early in the fourth quarter. Usually, when one is taken away 
from you like that, a young team won't snatch it back. That's what makes you 
feel so good about this one." 
</P>
<P>
 In the low-scoring affair, the Cavaliers missed several close shots while 
shooting 34.8% in a 19-point opening quarter . . . and then started to 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the night after an 81-80 victory at Portland, Cleveland lurched 
through the second quarter at 25%, good for only 12 points, the fewest given up 
by the Lakers in a quarter this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for Coach Mike Fratello, who wanted to slow down his Cavaliers to 
conserve energy during the latest rash of injuries to key players, this was an 
extreme: 31 points by intermission, only five better than the all-time Laker 
record for defense in a half, set Nov. 15, 1991 against Houston. The top three 
Cleveland guards -- Mark Price, Bobby Phills and Terrell Brandon -- were a 
combined two of 15, with seven assists and six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers weren't much better, only 37.5% in the first half, but that was 
worth a 41-31 lead. Van Exel had 15 of the points, making all three of his 
three-point tries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers cut that to a one-point deficit, 46-45, with a 14-5 run to open 
the third quarter, but could not claim their first lead of the game. The Lakers 
withstood the pressure, even as late as 55-53, then pulled away again for 67-55 
advantage at the end of the quarter. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel scored 22 points, making four of five three-pointers. . . . 
George Lynch began the night having made only 23.3% (seven of 30) of his shots 
the previous five games, but he has lost more than his shooting touch since 
being replaced as the starting power forward. Lynch said he has lost some of 
his confidence, an opinion seconded by his play of late as he looks out of sync 
with the offense and lacking his usual aggressiveness in going after rebounds. 
"Things have changed for me," he said. "My minutes, a different spot in the 
rotation. And we're not trapping and pressing as much as we did at the start, 
when I was at the top of my game. But I'm just going to keep working hard and 
fight through it." Lynch played only 16 minutes in Wednesday's blowout loss to 
the Knicks, after playing 14 against the Clippers and 16 against the Warriors 
last Saturday in what was his final start. He played 11 versus the Cavaliers, 
getting three points and one rebound as Elden Campbell started for the second 
game in a row.

ANOTHER CLIPPER DEBACLE; PRO BASKETBALL: OFF TO WORST START EVER, THEY LOSE 
EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE GAME, 94-83, TO THE 76ERS. 
</P>

<P>
 When will the Clippers win their first game of the season? 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be soon if they continue to play the way they did Friday. In losing 
for the eighth time in as many games, the Clippers fell behind by 25 points and 
were beaten, 97-83, by the Philadelphia 76ers, before 11,259 at the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to the worst start in franchise history, the Clippers unveiled their 
point-a-minute offense, trailing, 34-12, at the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible," said Clipper Coach Bill Fitch, who watched his team miss 14 
of its first 17 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The only winless team in the NBA, the Clippers could threaten the record for 
most losses in a season, set by the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers, who had a 9-73 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were 9-1, we wouldn't be a headline," Fitch said. "The only reason 
we're a headline is because were 0-8. And that's how things magnify to a team, 
and I'm just not going to let it get in that locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing is losing, whether it's eight in a row or seven out of eight or seven 
out of nine. The fact that we've got a streak going and we broke a record (the 
1982-83 San Diego Clippers lost their first seven), OK we're in the record 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the last guy that's going to crawl on them and say they're a bunch of 
garbage. They're not. They're working hard. They don't have it collectively and 
individually right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The hecklers behind the Clipper bench weren't as kind to the Clippers as they 
mocked the NBA's worst team. Even some of the players on the Clipper bench 
laughed at the taunts. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Clippers trailing, 26-7, a fan yelled: "It looks like you guys have 
as many points as losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another fan: "I don't think this is an expansion team, but it plays like 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another fan held up a piece of paper and screamed at Fitch: "Hey, Bill, I've 
got your resignation typed up right here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made 7-foot-6 center Shawn Bradley of the 76ers look like an 
all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, who began the game averaging 6.9 points, 6.3 rebounds and 3.13 
blocks, established career highs in points (28), rebounds (22), field goals 
(12), field goals attempted (20), offensive rebounds (nine) and defensive 
rebounds (13) and tied his career high for blocked shots (nine). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be like this every night, but I can work on it," said 
Bradley, who had 18 points, 10 rebounds and five blocks at halftime. "I saw the 
statistics and the 22 rebounds surprised me. I think any player needs a night 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't the Clippers try to make a trade to improve the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "We missed making a big move this week," Fitch said, referring to the 
Clippers' unsuccessful pursuit of forward Chris Webber, who was traded from the 
Golden State Warriors to the Washington Bullets on Thursday. "You're not going 
to go out and get well making deals until these guys get some youth gone from 
them and play well together and gain some credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been there, it's no fun losing, but we'll play our way through it. 
Nobody's going to come in. Webber's not coming. You've got to do it yourself." 
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bill Fitch kept rookie forward Lamond Murray, the Clippers' top draft 
pick, on the bench until the fourth quarter. "I told him that he's not in 
shape," Fitch said. "Who do you play him ahead of? Do you play him because of 
where he was drafted (seventh), then you make the same mistake as the people 
who draft them (all rookies) and pay them more than they're worth."

ROSE BOWL SHOWDOWNS; ANYTHING GOES, BUT WILL THE TROJANS?; A NOT-TOO-CIVIL WAR; 
THERE WILL BE NO NEUTRAL CORNERS IN OREGON TODAY WHEN DUCKS AND BEAVERS MEET 
WITH A PASADENA TRIP ON THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fathers and sons stop speaking. Friends eye each other warily. All over the 
state, in coffee houses and bars, in restaurants and book stores, Oregonians 
rekindle allegiances forged in their cradles and savor an old rivalry that has 
taken a new twist. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the football teams of Oregon and Oregon State first met in 1894, their 
annual game has been called the "Civil War." It's said without a hint of 
exaggeration. Who you root for says who you are. You're us or you're them and 
there's no room for neutrality today. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unlike any rivalry in the nation," Oregon guard Eric Reid said. "We hate 
each other. We're two way different schools. We're a liberal school and they're 
an agricultural college. They hate everything we do; we hate everything they 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sleeping less and less each night. I go to sleep and wake up in a cold 
sweat, dreaming I'm out there on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duck flanker Cristin McLemore: "It's different from USC-UCLA because 
there's a limited population here (and) everyone focuses on this. It's for the 
year after, who has the bragging rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to me, this week is not so much the Civil War as the Beavers standing in 
the way of our destiny. It's going to be a war, and it's not going to be 
civil." 
</P>
<P>
 That destiny, he says, is the Ducks' first trip to the Rose Bowl since 1958. 
To get there, they must fend off the resurgent Beavers today at Parker Stadium 
in Corvallis. It might be only a pit stop on the road to Pasadena, or it might 
turn out to be a U-turn back to a past replete with failure. 
</P>
<P>
 If they win -- or if they lose and USC loses, or if they tie and USC loses or 
ties -- the Ducks will win the Pacific 10 championship and a Rose Bowl berth. 
If the Ducks (8-3, 6-1 in the Pac-10) lose to the Beavers (4-6, 2-5) and USC 
wins, it won't matter to the Ducks that they'll still go to a bowl game. For 
them, it will be a lost season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up a Duck fan and I've been watching the Civil War since I can 
remember," said free safety Jeff Sherman, who grew up here in Eugene, home of 
the Oregon campus. "Nobody appreciates this more than me." 
</P>
<P>
 He's the Ducks' top tackler and linchpin of their conference-leading "Gang 
Green" defense, which has yielded only 95 points in Pac-10 play. 
</P>
<P>
 "When teams in the past six or seven years would start out good, people would 
start saying, 'Rose Bowl,' and they'd go 6-7," Sherman said. "Until this week, 
nobody on the team would even say the words Rose Bowl. Now, we can finally say 
it. We're tired of not talking about it. We want to put it out there. Everybody 
has been hesitant, but we're not hesitant anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rich Brooks, who was urged to quit after the Ducks' 1-2 start and still 
might resign after the season, understands the doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there's a theory out there that we'd find a way to screw it up," said 
Brooks, who played for Oregon State and was also an assistant coach there. "We 
haven't finished the job yet, so we may still find a way to screw it up, but I 
think we're past the point where we can screw it up now. If we don't get it 
done, it will be because Oregon State outplayed us and took it away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers would love to do precisely that. Running back J.J. Young took 
offense when he heard friends talk about watching the Ducks in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Hold on, don't waste your money,' " Young said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle linebacker Rico Petrini also wants to complicate the Ducks' travel 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a little kid, you always dreamed of playing in the Rose Bowl," he said. 
"We don't have that opportunity, but we've got the next best thing. We're 
playing a team with a chance to go to the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time in 30 years the game will determine the Rose Bowl 
representative. It last happened in 1964, when the Ducks lost to the Beavers in 
Corvallis, 7-6. Oregon State, coached by Tommy Prothro, went to Pasadena and 
lost to Michigan. Neither has been there since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to beat Oregon (today) and I'd like UCLA to beat USC so Oregon 
can go to the Rose Bowl," said Oregon State Coach Jerry Pettibone, who is 2-1 
in previous Civil War matchups. "Having an Oregon school in the Rose Bowl is 
healthy for both our programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of Portland, which remains fixated on the NBA's Trail Blazers, fans 
talked of little else this week besides the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools are so close -- we're only 30 miles apart -- and most grads stay 
in the state, so that adds spirit," Pettibone said. "It touches families. The 
husband is a Beaver and the wife is a Duck. Brothers and sisters go to opposite 
schools. It becomes a matter of pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Every other week of the year, James Daily and his co-workers at Sandino's, an 
espresso bar on East 13th Avenue here, enjoy a pleasant camaraderie. But this 
was Civil War Week, and Daily, who grew up in Corvallis, was ridiculed for 
defending his hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a die-hard Beaver fan, and I'm living in the wrong territory," Daily 
said. "There's so much hoopla, with the 'Gang Green' signs and T-shirts and 
everything else. Emotions are running very high around here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If neither side wins a game all year long, as long as the Ducks beat the 
Beavers or the Beavers beat the Ducks, they say they had a winning season." 
</P>
<P>
 At Guido's, a bar-restaurant here, Tuesday is 25-cent beer night and Thursday 
is Mug Night. But every night leading up to today's skirmish was special, as 
fans began to believe the Ducks might be headed to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole town is just ecstatic," said Becky, the manager and sometime 
peacekeeper who wouldn't give her last name. "We've been packed and everyone is 
really jazzed. They're a good team and everyone thinks they can do it this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 She's glad for the business, but also glad the game is in Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had a home Civil War and that was not pretty," she said. "The 
testosterone level was a little bit high." 
</P>
<P>
 Spirits were high all week in Corvallis, where fraternities stood 24-hour 
watch on the bronze Beaver mascot at Parker Stadium in case a Duck fan tried to 
steal it. At a pep rally Friday, Clodfelters, a restaurant, served black, 
orange and white hors d'oeuvres labeled "Beaver spread." T-shirts with black 
and orange Beaver logos brightened store windows, including one that read, "My 
two favorite Pac-10 teams are Oregon State and whoever beats the Ducks." 
</P>
<P>
 Civil? Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of hate between these two teams," Duck tailback Dino Philyaw 
said. "It's a love-hate kind of thing. You love to hate them and you love it 
when they hate you. It's going to be a game where you're fighting for every 
inch."

BASEBALL PLAYERS SEE CAP IN TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the baseball players' union continued to explore the full impact 
of the owners' new tax proposal Friday, but it is clear they will not accept it 
in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the formula by which payrolls would be "taxed" under the plan, 
union lawyer Eugene Orza said, "It's obvious they are punitive rates. The 
numbers will not fly. The question is: Is there a system there that will lead 
to future talks?" 
</P>
<P>
 Orza seemed to believe there is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to believe the numbers are negotiable," he said. "I'm confident that 
at some point, we'll make a counterproposal." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a positive development, putting owners and players within the 
framework of the same concept. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides met for two hours Friday with special mediator William J. Usery in 
Herndon, Va. Union head Donald Fehr called it a question-and-answer session 
relating to the 102-page tax proposal. Fehr said it was civil and businesslike, 
adding, "We have to make sure we fully understand the impact of what they've 
proposed before we can respond to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the union basically considers the current formula a salary cap in 
disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 It works like this: For every $500,000 that a club would spend on salaries and 
benefits above the average of the 28 payrolls -- which last year was $36 
million -- the club would be taxed 1% of its total payroll. That formula would 
apply up to the point that a club goes $5 million over the average, at which 
time it would be taxed 1% of its total payroll for every $250,000 spent on 
salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had a 1994 payroll of about $38 million. By going $2 million over 
the average, they would have been taxed $1,490,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact seems clear: Clubs will recoil from signing high-salaried free 
agents who would cost them almost as much in taxes as in salary. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners and players will meet again today, but it's unlikely that the union 
will be ready with a counterproposal.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT'S USC-UCLA WEEK, BUT IT'S NOT TOO EARLY TO GET IRISH UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Former UCLA quarterback and current radio commentator David Norrie, and former 
USC quarterback and current Prime Ticket commentator Craig Fertig were guest 
speakers at Thursday's Bond Club luncheon at the Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Norrie: "Craig remains popular at these kinds of things because I think 
he was the last USC quarterback to beat Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What three drivers competed in both the Indianapolis 500 and 
unlimited hydroplanes? 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look: UCLA Coach Terry Donahue, paying tribute to the 1954 national 
champion Bruin team, many of whose players were on hand Friday to be honored at 
the 45th UCLA-USC Rotary Club luncheon:  
</P>
<P>
 "I asked some of the guys from '54 if they'd play for me tomorrow, but they 
all said no, because they couldn't play with facemasks on. And to look at most 
of them, they sure did play without facemasks." 
</P>
<P>
 Irish logic: Former Notre Dame basketball player Tommy Hawkins, auctioning off 
signed footballs at the Rotary luncheon: "We have two footballs here, signed by 
all the UCLA players. We were supposed to have two signed by all the USC 
players, but they aren't here. Apparently, they couldn't finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Big battle: In the Pacific Northwest, they call the Oregon-Oregon State game 
the "Civil War." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time it had a bearing on the Rose Bowl was 30 years ago, when the 
Ducks (7-1-1) traveled to Corvallis to face the Beavers (7-2), with the winner 
going to Pasadena. Oregon State won, 7-6, when Al East blocked Herm Meister's 
extra-point attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers, coached by Tommy Prothro, went to the Rose Bowl and lost to 
Michigan, 34-7. It was the last time either Oregon school has played in the 
game, but the Ducks will go to Pasadena if they win today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Optimist: ESPN's Lee Corso, on Auburn Coach Terry Bowden: "Most coaches 
think the plane is going to crash. He not only thinks it'll land but that his 
baggage will get there too." 
</P>
<P>
 No changes: When Jimmy Sills, Chuck Gurney, Steve Kent and Stan Fox finished 
1-2-3-4 at Sacramento in a U.S. Auto Club Silver Crown race last month, it was 
the first time in 160 races over 24 years that the first four drivers finished 
in the order they started. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot item: The Charlotte Hornets' newsletter reports that the rights to eight 
season tickets were recently sold at a bankruptcy auction for more than 
$160,000. But the buyer still needs to buy the tickets for another $21,648. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks anyway: On the day the Chicago Cubs honored former players on the 
team's Walk of Fame, the Wrigley Field message board read, "Congratulations Cap 
Anson." 
</P>
<P>
 Cap has been dead for 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bill Cantrell, Eddie Sachs and Salt Walther. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Tommy Heinsohn, Hall of Fame basketball player and former Boston 
Celtic coach, on life in the NBA: "Players today expect coaches to be their 
chauffeur. Coaches have to drive the way the players tell them to drive, or 
else. It's ridiculous." SHAV GLICK

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; LATE BLOOMERS GIVE LIFE TO SECOND HALF OF SEASON 
</P>

<P>
 Surprised by that Cincinnati quarterback with the gold hoop earring and 
shotgun arm? 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to one of Jeff Blake's teammates: 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear, the first time I heard his voice was when I looked up in the huddle 
during the middle of the Cleveland game," veteran offensive lineman Bruce 
Kozerski said. "We had absolutely no idea who he was. None." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised by that Chicago quarterback with the ugly arm, awkward gait and 
checkered resume? 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to one of Steve Walsh's coaches: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you look at a guy and just physically, you write him off," said Ron 
Turner, offensive coordinator for the Bears. "But then you look closer. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised by that Lake Erie bunch with a surly coach, nasty defense and two 
castoff quarterbacks? 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to the Cleveland Browns' owner: 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this year, nobody knew the Browns were still alive," Art Modell said. 
"If the owners had any sense of decency, they would call off the season right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise. Thanks to the likes of Blake, Walsh and the Browns, an autumn filled 
with meaningless games and mindless posturing has suddenly turned interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 With six weeks remaining in the NFL's regular season, the league has been 
struck with surprises resounding like summer raindrops on a tin roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have been pleasant. Others have been a pain. 
</P>
<P>
 A checklist: 
</P>
<P>
 JEFF BLAKE 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: He is the Bengals' greatest quarterback prospect since Ken 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: The real deal. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little wonder a Cincinnati judge was willing to embarrass himself by 
writing a song entitled "Shake 'n' Blake." 
</P>
<P>
 In three starts, Blake has energized the city by leading the Bengals to their 
first two victories while throwing for 988 yards and six touchdowns, with one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 He began the season as a third-stringer, a New York Jet castoff who had thrown 
nine passes in two NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today? 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes into the huddle and looks at the receivers and tells them exactly 
who is going to get the ball if certain coverages are played," Kozerski said. 
"And then under pressure, he gets it to them. Throws off the run. Throws 
against a blitz. He's like nobody I've seen in a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of David Klingler? Write him off as another quarterback from a 
run-and-shoot college program who couldn't make the pro adjustment. Perhaps you 
remember Andre Ware. 
</P>
<P>
 EMMITT SMITH 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: Years of constant work on the field, combined with little work in 
the weight room, have made the Dallas Cowboy running back slow and susceptible 
to hard-hitting defenses. Note that the San Francisco 49ers held him to 10 
yards in his final nine carries Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Compared to Detroit's Barry Sanders, Smith indeed looks 60 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Cowboy Coach Barry Switzer actually challenged Smith, saying, "I 
question him in the weight room. He doesn't work in the weight room like he 
should. Emmitt hasn't reached his full potential physically this year. He 
hasn't been 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Smith: "The man's entitled to his opinion. I'm on a pace, as you put 
it in the press, to get 1,500 yards and 20 touchdowns and you're talking to me 
like I really got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But after gaining more than 100 yards only twice in the last seven games, yes, 
it seems the three-time rushing champion has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: Headed for their first Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: A New Year's Day wild-card playoff game on Lake Erie. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Browns (8-2) survive in Kansas City on Sunday, they should finish with 
at least 12 victories after completing a schedule that includes games with the 
New York Giants, Houston Oilers and Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't laugh. The Browns have yielded the fewest points and are the only team 
that has not allowed a 100-yard rusher or receiver. And no team, other than the 
Cowboys and Chiefs, has an active Super Bowl most valuable player available at 
quarterback, like Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already called the convention bureau here, and apparently nobody from 
the south of France comes to Cleveland in January, so we have rooms," said 
Modell, whose team hasn't been to the playoffs in five years. "My wife is now 
talking to me. The talk shows aren't being so mean." 
</P>
<P>
 And people have finally stopped talking about your release of quarterback 
Bernie Kosar? 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest with you, we could have handled it better," Modell said of last 
season's firing of the Browns' hero. "The end result would have been the same, 
but I miscalculated the timing of it. It was my fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean people should stop hating Coach Bill Belichick for that move? 
</P>
<P>
 "Belichick is so charming these days, he could host a daytime show," Modell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVE WALSH 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: He will lead the Bears to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: We haven't seen the last of Erik Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 Since signing with the Bears this summer as the "other" free-agent 
quarterback, Walsh has outplayed anointed starter Kramer from Platteville to 
Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his chance after an early-season injury to Kramer, Walsh has responded 
by going 5-0, completing 64.1% of his passes, throwing only two interceptions 
in those five starts and not being sacked in 16 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer, in his five starts, went 1-4 with seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve has a great awareness and presence out there," said Turner, the Bears' 
offensive coordinator. "He makes great decisions. He throws to the right guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Bear system that stresses defense and ball control, a smart guy from the 
University of Miami like Walsh would seem to be the perfect quarterback. Having 
played in only 31 games in five previous pro seasons, he is also fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kramer, who has struggled to learn the new system, is the quarterback with 
the 99.2 postseason quarterback rating. Few enjoy pressure as he does. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears should make the playoffs, but we bet Kramer will be their 
quarterback when they do. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLIE GARNER 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: He will be the league's next great running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Get real. 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming only the seventh player in NFL history to rush for 100 yards in 
his first two NFL games, Garner has vanished behind a cloud of nagging injuries 
and charges that he can't block. 
</P>
<P>
 He has carried the ball only six times in the last 10 quarters for the 
Philadelphia Eagles while recently complaining about a lost fingernail. 
</P>
<P>
 ARIZONA CARDINALS 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: With four of their last six games at home, and road games against 
Houston and Atlanta, they have a chance to fulfill Buddy Ryan's prophecy of a 
playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: With Jay Schroeder at quarterback and Mark Higgs at running back, 
they have no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Life in Tempe is as messy as always. Just when Steve Beuerlein had regained 
his confidence with one interception in his last four games, he suffers torn 
knee ligaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder, with three interceptions in his last start, is in. Jim McMahon, the 
backup who hasn't played in two months, is spitting venom on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, man, I don't care," McMahon told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The running backs also are angry because Ryan signed Higgs from the Dolphins 
and promised to play him Sunday against the Eagles. Higgs played for Ryan at 
Philadelphia in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just goes to show you, he takes care of his guys who have played with him 
in the past," running back Larry Centers said. "He's a coach who has a plan in 
mind. And we'll just have to wait around and see what it is. I don't know what 
it is right now." 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 GUS FREROTTE 
</P>
<P>
 Perception: He is the next Mark Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Heath Shuler will be given at least a dozen more chances to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Redskins have lost 27 regular-season games in the three seasons 
since they won the Super Bowl in 1992, the worst collapse for a Super Bowl 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Frerotte suddenly looks like Billy Kilmer. Particularly since his 
583 yards passing and five scoring passes are the best numbers for a Redskin 
rookie quarterback after three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 But first-round draft pick Shuler is making several million dollars more than 
Frerotte. And Redskin coaches are already trying to figure out ways to get him 
back in the lineup, particularly with five of their last six games against 
teams with losing records. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing Frerotte can hope for is a trade to Jacksonville.  
</P>
<P>
 CORRALLED AND BRANDED 
</P>
<P>
 A source who ventured inside Troy Aikman's hotel room on the eve of the 
Cowboys' game in San Francisco last week offered this medical opinion: 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's thumb was the size of a pickle. There were two trainers there with 
him, icing the thumb, hooking it up to electrical stimulation gadgets, working 
on him like mad." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Cowboys didn't deem it necessary to report the injury to the league? 
And avoid the potential for club employees to sell this inside information to 
gamblers? And uphold the integrity of the game? 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on them. 
</P>
<P>
 We're thrilled that the league hit owner Jerry Jones with a $10,000 fine 
Friday. We wish it had been more. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * YOUNGER EVERY DAY: Still don't believe that San Francisco's Steve Young is a 
different quarterback this season? A more complete quarterback? Even a 
championship quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to teammate Brent Jones: 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have thrown for 400 yards and not gained the respect that he has 
this year. In the last four or five weeks, ever since that so-called 
Philadelphia incident, he's taken on a leadership role that he never had taken 
on before. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it did was, it made him realize he's going to stand up and start being a 
leader. He definitely has earned the respect of the guys by his play and his 
toughness and his overall demeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE SO-CALLED PHILADELPHIA INCIDENT: Jones was referring to what has become 
the watershed moment in the 49er season. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred in the third quarter of an eventual 40-8 whipping by the 
Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 2. After being removed from the game in the middle 
of a drive, Young stormed to the sidelines and loudly berated his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time anyone had seen him show any emotion stronger than a 
shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the 49ers are 5-0, having outscored their opponents, 168-75. Young 
has thrown nine touchdown passes and only one interception in that span. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEXT TIME 49ERS ARE IN TOWN, THEY'LL BE SEATED WITH RAIDER FANS: The 49ers' 
new aggressive attitude apparently extends beyond the playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Faulkner, the venerable director of pro personnel for the Rams, was in 
San Francisco last weekend to scout the 49ers in their game with Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But 49er officials stuck him in a corner of the press box where he could see 
nothing inside the north 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 * CUT LEFT AT THE GARBAGE CAN: How unusual was the Chicago Bears' fake 
field-goal play last week against Miami? The one in which receiver Curtis 
Conway took the snap on one side of the field and threw the ball to a group of 
players on the other side of the field, with the pass eventually being 
deflected into the hands of tight end Keith Jennings for a touchdown? 
</P>
<P>
 It was so unusual that Coach Dave Wannstedt huddled with officials before the 
game and actually diagramed the play for them so they wouldn't panic and begin 
throwing flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the previous time he ran it. 
</P>
<P>
 * STRANGE BUT TRUE: With 1,319 yards rushing, Barry Sanders of the Detroit 
Lions is on a pace to gain 2,111 yards and break the mark of 2,105, set by Eric 
Dickerson with the Rams in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not his outstanding statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has four of the NFL's five longest runs from scrimmage this season, of 
85, 84, 69 and 62 yards -- yet did not score on any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * WAYNE'S WORLD: Coach Wayne Fontes of the Lions has announced that if Sanders 
is within striking distance of the rushing record during the season finale 
against Miami, Sanders will break it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's close, in that last Miami game, I'll give him the ball 50 times, 
maybe 60," Fontes said. The single-game record for rushes is held by Jamie 
Morris of the Washington Redskins, who carried 45 times in an overtime game 
with the Cincinnati Bengals in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, he is the best runner that's ever touched the football," Fontes 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 * BAD-TIMING AWARD: Two weeks ago, linebacker Byron Evans and agent Bert 
Kinerk turned down an offer for a contract extension from the Philadelphia 
Eagles for about $1.7 million a year, including an $800,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted $2 million a year and a $2-million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 In an instant last Sunday, Evans lost it all. 
</P>
<P>
 He was carted from the field after suffering a career-threatening knee injury 
when teammate Bill Romanowski fell on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Rehabilitation could take a year or longer and his contract, which expires at 
the end of the season, probably will not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 * QUOTE OF THE WEEK: "Daddy, are you playing dinosaur?" 
</P>
<P>
 That was spoken by Michael Tofflemire, 2 1/2-year-old son of Seattle Seahawk 
center Joe Tofflemire. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Tofflemire was writhing on his garage steps, having tripped over 
a pair of work boots and chipping a bone in his right wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't playing dinosaur, and he wasn't able to play last Sunday in Denver.

 One in and one out for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Gerald Perry, who has sat out four games because of a broken 
right ankle, will return to the starting lineup Sunday against the New Orleans 
Saints at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Jenkins, who filled in for Perry, will return to his backup role. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel Washington, who started at right cornerback last week, will be forced 
to give way to James Trapp because of a bruised calf muscle. Trapp, who started 
several games last season as a fifth defensive back in nickel coverage, will be 
making his first start this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, who sat out practice all week, might play some Sunday, but Coach 
Art Shell wasn't optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look good," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had been in the starting lineup in place of Albert Lewis, who will 
sit out his second consecutive game because of a sprained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler, who jammed three toes in last Sunday's game 
against the Rams, seemed almost fully recovered Friday, planting his left foot 
and throwing the ball as if he had not been hurt. Hostetler had been limping 
noticeably earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of disadvantaged youngsters will attend Sunday's game as part of 
Touchdown For Youth, a program jointly sponsored by the Raiders and the Los 
Angeles Sports Council. Each $40 contribution gives a youngster transportation 
to the game, a ticket and refreshments. Anyone interested in donating to the 
program can call Darryl Dunn of the Sports Council Foundation at (213) 
482-6333. STEVE SPRINGER

THE BOTTOM TEN / STEVE HARVEY: THEY DIDN'T PUT HIGH IN OHIO

<P>
 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Who says there's no college championship playoff? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bottom Ten has one this year because of a scheduling coincidence that 
should delight connoisseurs of the crummy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Akron (0-10) plays host to Ohio U. (0-10) today, it will be a meeting of 
the only major schools in the nation that have lost every game. It will be a 
dream matchup of a team with an uncommonly porous defense (Akron gives up 39.4 
points a game) against one with a particularly bumbling offense (Ohio scores 
7.2 points a game). 
</P>
<P>
 For the loser, the game will mean the Bottom Ten championship. For the 
winner--well, all those missed tackles, dropped passes and fumbled handoffs 
this year won't mean a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor has it, by the way, that Gerry Faust's status as coach of the Akron Zips 
is in doubt. Hence the cry of his supporters: "When One for the Zipper?"

 Rout of the Week: USC over UCLA (USC defeated Cal by 61, which defeated 
Arizona State by 4, which defeated Oregon State by 6, which defeated UCLA by 9. 
Hence, USC is at least 80 points better than UCLA.) CLOUDY CRYSTAL BALLS

</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey Giants (3-7) have clearly become the worst team in pro 
football. But here's the bad news for the Giants: Everything didn't come apart 
until the second month of the season. So, their opening three victories could 
be an insurmountable obstacle for Bottom Ten title consideration even if they 
finish 3-13, which is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, the Giants' strategy to ditch Phil Simms, the veteran quarterback 
who led them to an 11-5 record, in favor of two panicky understudies deserves 
special mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor should the non-accomplishments of the Grampa Bay Buccaneers (2-8) be 
overlooked. They just cinched a 12th consecutive non-winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, the leader is relentlessly inept Houston (1-9), which is 
staging one of the all-time turnarounds after a 12-4 finish in 1993. Say, 
wasn't the firing of offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride a slap in the face?

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; ANDERSON TO WAIT AND SEE ON THIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson, who has been listed as probable on the Ram 
injury report because of a thigh bruise, said he won't know until Sunday if he 
can play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, there is a doubt," Anderson said. "It doesn't feel too good today. They 
want me to come over to the stadium early to see how it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson did not practice Wednesday and, after doing some work Thursday, he 
reported more pain Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty sore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, the team's leading receiver with 29 catches for 636 yards and four 
touchdowns, injured his thigh early against the Raiders, but continued playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season he suffered a small fracture in his back, missed practice 
time, but did not sit out a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is different; this is my leg," Anderson said. "I could cover my back, 
but I need my legs for what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said the team will wait until Sunday morning to determine the 
effectiveness of Anderson, backup quarterback Chris Chandler (ankle) and guard 
Leo Goeas (abdominal muscle). Knox said Darryl Ashmore will start once again at 
right guard in place of Goeas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams listed center Bern Brostek, tackle Ronald Edwards, linebacker Henry 
Rolling and running back Johnny Bailey as inactive for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, who could sit out the rest of the season while recovering from eye 
surgery, considers himself fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got hit, I thought I lost my eye," said Rolling, who hopes to play 
again this season. "When the doctor finished with the surgery, he told me 98% 
of the people who have suffered the damage I had lose their eye. I consider 
myself very, very lucky to be part of that 2%." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling was poked in the eye during practice a few weeks ago and suffered a 
"blowout fracture." He had surgery, which included a silicone implant, and has 
been instructed to wait for it to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary; I asked the guys around me if I still had my eye after getting 
hit," Rolling said. "When they did the surgery, it was worse than what they 
first thought, but the surgery was very successful and I'll be back." T.J.

RAMS GAMBLED ON NEGOTIATIONS, NOW MAY HAVE TO PAY THE PHIFER; PRO FOOTBALL: THE 
TEAM DECLINED TO SIGN THE DEFENSIVE STANDOUT TO A LONG-TERM DEAL, AND AFTER 
THIS SEASON HE'LL BE FREE TO NEGOTIATE WITH ANY TEAM.

<P>
 The Rams want to move, and quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roman Phifer won't let them. 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer, an outside linebacker who has displayed star qualities while becoming 
one of the team's most productive performers, has ignored the team's persistent 
overtures to sign a new deal before he becomes a free agent at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the Rams didn't go ahead and pay the man when they had the 
chance," defensive end Robert Young said. "It was probably a dumb move on their 
part. I just hope we don't lose him." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season began, both Phifer and Young were unsigned. Each was 
beginning his fourth year with the team and, although they were restricted from 
going elsewhere, at the end of 1994 they were going to be free to negotiate 
with 29 other NFL teams, including the two expansion franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took Young off the market with a three-year, $3.6-million contract 
but chose to gamble with Phifer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gotten hurt or had a down year, but I really had no option," 
Phifer said. "They didn't throw out any number and there wasn't really any 
negotiation, so I had to accept what they offered." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were required to offer him at least $649,000 or lose him to another 
team for a third-round draft pick. Phifer had to accept the $649,000 or look 
for another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rams announced his signing last summer, they suggested that the 
one-year deal would buy them a few weeks to work out a long-range deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clearly expressed that we wished to do something during the season," 
said Jay Zygmunt, senior vice president, who is also working to extend the 
contract of center Bern Brostek. "Our interest remains the same." 
</P>
<P>
 But Phifer's agent, Marvin Demoff, has been unwilling to discuss his client's 
future with the Rams, and now, months later with the free-agent deadline 
approaching, the Rams are left to wonder if they will lose one of their top 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly a possibility," said Ram President John Shaw. "We were hopeful 
of getting something done, but it appears we're now on his timetable." 
</P>
<P>
 Demoff, who did not return a phone call to discuss Phifer's situation, also 
represented former Ram linebacker Kevin Greene. The Rams told Greene and Demoff 
they wanted to re-sign him, and the Rams were told they would have the 
opportunity to make their best offer, should Greene be courted elsewhere. 
Greene signed with Pittsburgh, and the Rams were the last to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be in Roman's shoes," said Shane Conlan, who surprised the 
Buffalo Bills two years ago by signing with the Rams. "He's going to break the 
bank. I'm sure the team wants him back, but it's smart on his part not to sign. 
He should go out and test it and see what his worth is. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a blow to our defense to lose him, a big blow. He does a lot of 
things for our defense. He's our best cover guy. He's just a good athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 The Carolina Cougars and Jacksonville Jaguars will be looking to stock their 
rosters with good athletes, and they will have the money to boost the bidding 
on certain players. A personable 26-year-old outside linebacker with Carolina 
roots might get an offer he cannot refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had family members talking about Carolina all the time," said Phifer, 
who grew up in Pineville, N.C. "It's been kind of a joke. . . . My loyalties 
right now are with the Rams, and that's all I'm concerned with at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Phifer, a second-round draft pick from UCLA, has shown the versatility to 
remain on the field in all defensive situations. He led the team in tackles a 
year ago, and had the Rams enjoyed more success as a team, his name might have 
drawn Pro Bowl attention. He has played with a hyper-extended elbow this 
season, yet continues to be one of the team's most aggressive players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured I really had to come hard last year because my contract was up, but 
now it's the same type scenario," Phifer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference this year, however, is that Phifer has the leverage. A year ago 
the Rams had it, and used it to their advantage in paying Phifer almost $1 
million less than Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what Robert got and I looked over there a few times knowing he had the 
money in his pocket," Phifer said. "I was happy for him and I'm sure he doesn't 
have any stress now, wondering what's going to happen this year. For whatever 
reason, my situation was different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now there's a little anxiety in me. I love my teammates and the coaches here, 
but this thing could take so many turns, it's crazy. Will the Rams make me an 
offer? Will I be here? Will the Rams be here or playing in St. Louis next year? 
There are a lot of things going on right now, and for the time being I have no 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a matter of weeks control will swing to Phifer. And if the Rams 
hope to regain control of the situation, they will have to pay, and probably 
pay handsomely.

EARLY VOTE: U.S. AGAINST THE WORLD (TOUR); GOLF: COUPLES, OTHERS SAY IT HAS TO 
BE DONE WITH COOPERATION OF PGA TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What's a World Golf Tour without Fred Couples and the rest of the top American 
players? 
</P>
<P>
 "An international tour," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after it was announced, the World Tour bogeyed Friday at Sherwood 
Country Club when it seemed clear that most, if not all, of the U.S. players 
won't play on the World Tour if the PGA Tour doesn't approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, the most prominent American player, decided to comment after 
remaining silent Thursday, when the $25-million tour, apparently bankrolled by 
the Fox television network and, supposedly, featuring the top 30 players in the 
world, was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to play against Nick Price and Ian Woosnam and Nick Faldo and 
Seve Ballesteros every week, but I will not do it unless the PGA Tour is 
involved and makes it OK," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best answer I can say is that if it's not, I won't play the World Tour." 
</P>
<P>
 He probably found his answer Thursday night. PGA Tour Commissioner Tim 
Finchem, who took a hard line against the World Tour on Tuesday, flew from 
Jacksonville, Fla., and met with the players Thursday night in Westlake 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples is one of 16 U.S. players who would be eligible for the World Tour, 
which is to be based on the top 30 players in the SONY rankings. Couples is the 
highest-ranking American at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples said he likes the concept of the World Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing," he said. "I just don't quite see how it's going to work. 
I think Greg (Norman) may have rushed into it, but I'm not going to say it's a 
bad idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Faxon, Couples' partner in the Franklin Funds Shark Shootout and a member 
of the PGA Tour policy board, said Norman might have miscalculated the 
commitment of U.S. players to the World Tour when they held a meeting Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg thought he had the support of all the (U.S.) players," Faxon said. "He 
has the support of the players if he does it by the rules of the PGA Tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Faxon said he isn't sure Norman heard the part that began with if.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he wanted the press conference to look like this was coming off," 
said Faxon, who praised Arnold Palmer's comments that the PGA Tour had to be 
involved in the new tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Arnold Palmer talked, people listened," Faxon said. "I don't know if 
Greg really did." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Tour is supposed to begin in late March of 1995, probably with an 
event in south Florida. Three other World Tour events would be played in the 
United States, and one each in Canada, Scotland, Spain and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Each tournament would have a $3-million purse with $600,000 going to the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new tour was suggested in part because of the PGA Tour's 
restrictive tournament policies for players, with which U.S. players generally 
don't agree, the World Tour must have involvement of U.S. players to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there were four (tournaments), that would be the perfect number," Couples 
said. "Eight or 10, that's unrealistic, unless something real major happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's up to Greg Norman and Tim Finchem. It's not up to Nick Price or Jose 
Maria Olazabal or Nick Faldo or anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Tour has to go through the proper channels," Lanny Wadkins said. 
"You've got a couple of guys doing this. That's not the proper channels." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The team of Wadkins and Andrew Magee shot a six-under-par 66 and took a 
two-stroke lead in the first round of the Shark Shootout. Playing the 
alternate-ball format, Wadkins and Magee had four birdies in seven holes on the 
back nine. They lead Couples-Faxon and Chip Beck-Jeff Maggert, who shot 68. Ben 
Crenshaw and Mark Calcavecchia are at 69. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10 two-player teams will compete in a best-ball format today and a 
scramble Sunday. The winning team splits $300,000.

DE LA HOYA WINS, AVOIDS SOME ROAD WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya's road map to stardom and a major boxing championship will 
not leave him stranded on a dark desert highway after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Having promised to walk back to Los Angeles if his opponent so much landed one 
punch, De La Hoya nearly lived up to pre-fight bravado Friday night when he 
scored a third-round, technical knockout victory over Carl Griffith at the MGM 
Grand Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Mitch Halpern stopped the fight at 1:02 of the third shortly after a 
De La Hoya left hook dropped Griffith for the second time in the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya (15-0, 14 knockouts) retained his World Boxing Organization 
championship with a victory that, as predicted, left him unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Griffith (28-4-2) did manage to score a glancing blow in the 
first, forcing De La Hoya to compromise on his boast. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I'll walk one mile," De La Hoya said. "I must say he hit me with one 
punch. I'll walk to the Excalibur (hotel)." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought Griffith, a tough fighter if nothing else, would test De La Hoya 
with his inside strength. But it was clear from the outset that Griffith was no 
match for the speed and power of De La Hoya's punches. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya's only regret was that the bout did not last long enough to make 
the trip worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a difficult call," De La Hoya said of the referee's decision. "If he 
would have let him go, he would have gotten hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya has made short work of his last two opponents, having scored a 
second-round knockout against Jorge Paez on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating," De La Hoya said of his lack of ring time. "But I have 
another fight Dec. 10 (against Johnny Avila)." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith complained that he did not have enough time to warm up after the 
preceding fight ended in a quick knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 He could have warmed up for a week and it would probably not have changed the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya jumped on Griffith early, dropping him with the second of two left 
hooks landed in succession. He staggered Griffith with another hook in the 
second, then called it a night in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hits hard," Griffith said. "He surprised me with his power. He is good. I 
see him going far." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya's victory marked another step on a far-reaching and calculated game 
plan that ultimately leads to a much-anticipated showdown against International 
Boxing Federation lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas on May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya will fight two times before then, Dec. 10 at the Grand Olympic 
Auditorium and then in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plan is going on schedule," De La Hoya said. "I'm climbing up the ladder. 
Two steps to go. I'm ready for the world champions, bring on whoever. Rafael 
Ruelas is a good one, but I'll win that one too." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Alcazar, De La Hoya's trainer, said the best is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruelas will be one of his easiest fights," Alcazar predicted. "He hits too 
hard for Ruelas. He's just too much. No way a human can take that kind of 
pounding."

JONES' SPEED ENDS TONEY'S VICTORY STREAK; BOXING: CHALLENGER WINS THE IBF 
SUPER-MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP BY A UNANIMOUS DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end, James Toney was swollen, exhausted and dazed, limping around the 
ring. Speed kills. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 punishing rounds, Roy Jones Jr. used his quick hands to slash and rock 
Toney at will for an unexpectedly dominant victory by unanimous decision in 
front of 8,520 at the MGM Grand Garden Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Jones, who won Toney's International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight title and gave Toney his first professional defeat, did not 
lay claim to the title of best pound-for-pound fighter in the world -- mostly 
because everyone else already had conceded it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands were so fast, my feet were so quick, that all I had to do was box," 
Jones said. "To use my foot and hand speed was to give myself the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 And as he stood propped on the throne, the 25-year-old Jones made sure to keep 
boxing's high powers just as off-balance as he had kept Toney by emphasizing 
that, though Bob Arum promoted this fight, no single promoter held him under 
sway. 
</P>
<P>
 "My promoter? I don't know. Arum, (Don) King, whoever," Jones said with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is the one who pushed for this bout to be put on pay-per-view, risking a 
$4.5-million combined purse for the chancy prospects of pay-per-view revenue. 
But for Jones, from Pensacola, Fla., the outcome was never at risk from the 
opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' left hook found Toney early and often -- knocking him down in the third 
-- and Jones' footwork rendered Toney's trademark inside attack moot and mute. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the bout, Jones (27-0) put together blinding five- and six-punch 
flurries at moments of his own choosing. Toney appeared to be dazed by a 
combination that ended with a short right in the second, then went down in the 
third after taunting Jones and catching a Jones left on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney wobbled backward with the blow, then appeared to be pushed backward into 
his own corner and was up quickly. But though he wasn't hurt by the knockdown, 
Toney clearly was struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 According to CompuBox statistics, Jones landed 263 power punches -- more than 
150 more than those landed by Toney (44-1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 No judge gave Toney more than three rounds -- John Stewart had it 119-108, 
Glen Hamada 117-110, and Jerry Roth 118-109. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say, he lost the fight," said Toney's trainer, Bill Miller. 
"(Jones did) nothing unusual; it was nothing we didn't expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toney: "Roy Jones did a great job of running away from me. He kept 
running the whole fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, who was over 200 pounds before he began training for this fight, was 
upbeat after the defeat. He said that he had simply grown out of the 168-pound 
division and that it was past time for him to move up to light-heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't get off," said Toney, who weighed 182 hours before the fight 
after making 167 for Thursday's weigh-in. "I felt sluggish because of my weight 
loss -- drained a little, I guess. I'll never fight at 168 again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a true champ, I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who gave up his IBF middleweight title and moved up eight pounds to 
challenge Toney, said he knew Toney wouldn't be able to keep up with his pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he'd struggle to come down when he was 200," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney's best opportunity came in the fifth round, when the two fighters began 
the final minute in the middle of the ring, trading bombs. Jones started it 
with a hard left hook-right-left hook combination, and Toney answered with a 
hard right to the chin that shook Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never in trouble," Jones said, "but Toney's got some strong punches, 
and you could feel the power of his punches because he's a strong puncher, a 
very strong puncher. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was taught to counter." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones ended the exchange with another sizzling combination that sent Toney 
backward. Toney rallied in the round's final moments with a fancy, spinning 
left to the jaw, but Jones was unhurt.  
</P>
<P>
 By the seventh, Toney looked unsure. And though it was Jones' durability and 
endurance that was questioned before this fight, it was Toney who seemed to 
wear down under the barrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney hunted for the knockout he needed, but never scored with a punch that 
had Jones close to toppling. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, Jones opened up with more than 20 unanswered shots. Toney 
looked ready to rally at the end of the round, but referee Richard Steele 
stepped in prematurely for the second time in the fight, mistaking the 
10-second warning for the bell. 
</P>
<P>
 By the ninth, Jones had begun to flash around the ring -- keeping well away 
from danger but dancing in with brief flurries and moving out before Toney 
could pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bell rang to end the fight, Jones was carried into the air by his 
trainer. Toney raised his arms, but he was alone, and obviously tired. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones began his big night in odd fashion -- he sat ringside for an earlier 
fight on the card to cheer on stablemate Derrick Gainer, who lost a decision to 
Roberto Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when it was his turn in the spotlight, Jones ambled into the ring 
wearing a white tuxedo and tails, gesturing with his hips right before climbing 
through the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before anyone else, he knew it was time to celebrate. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In other bouts of interest, Roberto Garcia (17-0,13 KOs) of Oxnard scored a 
decision victory against Derrick Gainer (12-3,6 KOs) in a featherweight match, 
and Danny Romero (21-0, 19 KOs) of Albuquerque retained his North American 
Boxing super-flyweight tile with a first-round knockout victory over Domingo 
Sosa (26-4, 18 KOs).

ROSE BOWL SHOWDOWNS; ANYTHING GOES, BUT WILL THE TROJANS?; USC-UCLA: ONLY USC 
HAS SHOT AT ROSE BOWL, BUT SERIES HAS A HISTORY OF THE UNEXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 USC is 7-2, 6-1 in the Pacific 10; UCLA is 4-6, 2-5 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 USC leads the series, 34-22-7, but UCLA has won the last three meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 USC can go to the Rose Bowl, given help at Corvallis, Ore., but UCLA is going 
nowhere after today. When they can go to the Rose Bowl and UCLA cannot, the 
Trojans are 3-0-1 against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider all of those numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then throw them away. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a series that defies numbers and defines heroes. Heisman Trophy 
winners have played against one another, but the game has also produced Norman 
Dow and John Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA receiver Bryan Adams is trying to come back from an injury and play, but 
Coach Terry Donahue has his doubts. Still, "he could play and, who knows, he 
could catch a pass and be a hero," Donahue said. "It's that kind of series." 
</P>
<P>
 To cut through the lore to the facts, USC has won five consecutive games since 
losing to Oregon, 22-7, on Oct. 1. That loss could come back to haunt the 
Trojans. If Oregon beats Oregon State in Corvallis today, the Ducks will go to 
the Rose Bowl as the Pac-10 champion, no matter what USC does. Also, if USC 
loses, Oregon goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon last played in the Rose Bowl in 1958, with end John Robinson. Now the 
coach at USC, Robinson won't have his head or his heart in Corvallis today, 
wondering about the fates of his alma mater and his employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of fatalistic about that," Robinson said. "I like the idea of just 
playing this game and giving the game the credit it's due. It's that game 
that's important, and if you win that game, that's enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last five games, the Trojans have shown continued improvement, 
blending newcomers such as wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson with a nucleus that 
is led by quarterback Rob Johnson and tackle Tony Boselli. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis has been on the offense, particularly since USC hammered 
Arizona's vaunted defense a week ago, 45-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I've been most impressed by the improvement in their defense," Donahue 
said. "I think the defense has made the most improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling in early games against Washington and Penn State, USC's 
defense has become respectable, still giving up points but proving 
opportunistic, with 15 interceptions. Johnson has thrown only three. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw them early in the season, I said, 'This is a defense I would like 
to throw against,' " Bruin quarterback Wayne Cook said. "Now, I'm not so sure." 
</P>
<P>
 He has become more sure of himself, though. Cook and the Bruins struggled 
through a six-game losing streak that ruined their season, but UCLA has won two 
in a row, including a 59-23 victory at Arizona State last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And in his last four games, Cook has completed 70 of 114 passes for 1,191 
yards and nine touchdowns, without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are on a roll, but so is USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are peaking," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson has sat out two of the last five games because of an ankle injury, 
but in the three others he completed 52 of 76 passes for 826 yards and seven 
touchdowns, with only one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 15 in a row in the second half against Arizona before re-injuring 
the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the thought that he would like to make amends for last season's 
UCLA-USC game, when his pass into the end zone was intercepted by Marvin 
Goodwin with 50 seconds to play, preserving a 27-21 UCLA victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The pass has haunted Johnson, but not Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got us down to the goal line, got us in a position to win and I called a 
lousy play," Robinson said. "I told him after the game, 'Hey, I don't feel 
sorry for you. You're the luckiest guy in the world to get a chance, and when 
you get in the NFL, you're going to get more chances. If you're a big-time 
player, you screw up in key things . . . but if you're there often enough, you 
make the play. That's how you measure greatness.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, it measures 6 feet 5. That's J.J. Stokes' height, and his return to 
the lineup after a nagging leg injury is the major reason for the Bruins' 
resurgence. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all of their passing potential, Donahue says that the Trojans 
are still the traditional Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to consider SC's desire to control the line of scrimmage," he said. 
"Deep down inside, they want to maul you." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, UCLA still thinks run first while on defense. Because the 
Bruins have been porous against the run, USC's Shawn Walters, with his 890 
yards, has to be eager. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to shut that off and make Johnson beat us," linebacker Rod Smalley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson isn't buying anything UCLA has to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA has the kind of defense to get you all out of whack," he said. "They 
send eight or nine guys (after the quarterback). They send Terry Donahue. 
They're all trying to get in the quarterback's face." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Cook and receivers Stokes and Kevin Jordan, USC also has to deal with 
the Bruins' Sharmon Shah, who has rushed for 1,092 yards, including 180 last 
week against Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 A shootout in Pasadena? Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the defenses of both teams, you have to think that both can 
move the ball against the other," Donahue said. "In looking at the SC game, we 
have to hope we can generate enough offense to offset their offense. If our 
offense gets shut down, with what they can do offensively, it's going to be a 
long day." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for that, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an even game, and I don't think there's a favorite, not because 
of emotion or any of that stuff, but because I think both teams are about the 
same," he said. "Both have good passing and good running. Both have wide 
receivers who can become the dominant players in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 So who will step up? Will it be Cook or Rob Johnson? Stokes or Keyshawn 
Johnson? A defender? Or somebody who has the day of his life? It's UCLA-USC, a 
game that always seems to produce a hero.

EVEN AT 50, DONAHUE REMAINS EVERYBODY'S ALL-AMERICAN BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just imagine the TV teasers. "Donahue exposed! Next on . . . Donahue." 
</P>
<P>
 It'll never happen. At least not to the Donahue who has been head football 
coach at UCLA for the past 19 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends who knew him as a teen-ager say any dirt on Terry Donahue is best 
captured under a water slide. He wouldn't spark enough controversy for a tell- 
all talk show to hold a viewing audience until the first commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
 What you see is what you get. Impeccably well-groomed and trim, his angular 
face invariably tan, Donahue is, at age 50, impossibly fit and youthful in 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry always looked like the All-American boy," a friend says. "Still does." 
</P>
<P>
 Looks the part, acts the part, lives the part. Donahue, who sends UCLA against 
USC today at the Rose Bowl, grew up in North Hollywood. He is a 1962 graduate 
of Notre Dame High, which then was an all-boys' school of 1,200 where his 
father was a personal physician to the school brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Terry was not a natural athlete. Cut from the Notre Dame basketball 
team, he also dabbled with distance running and pole-vaulting without much 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 As a high school freshman, Donahue packed all of 115 pounds on a gangly frame. 
Wearing football gear, he resembled a toy replica of a player -- the kind with 
a bobbing head occasionally seen resting on a car's rear shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a string bean," says Tom Vessella, who was Notre Dame's football coach 
from 1960-66. "It was almost impossible to fit him he was so small. Terry's 
helmet looked like it would have spun around his neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Vessella, now an assistant principal at Toll Middle School in Glendale, 
initially attempted to discourage Donahue from playing football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Terry, get a little bigger first,' " Vessella says. "He wouldn't 
hear of it. His heart and his size were two different things. I couldn't 
measure the size of his heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, the coach didn't do a real accurate job on size, either. 
</P>
<P>
 A check of the school's 1961 varsity football roster shows Donahue listed at 
180 pounds, a considerable exaggeration. 
</P>
<P>
 At weigh-in prior to the season, a couple of buddies covertly slid two 
10-pound weights into the back of Donahue's baggy shorts. When he climbed onto 
the scale, Notre Dame coaches couldn't believe the reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were shocked," says John Cicuto, a teammate who helped orchestrate the 
spoof. "But all they knew is that he'd been lifting weights all summer. They 
said, 'Way to go, Donahue. You've really been working hard.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Donahue nodded, smiled . . . and kept his mouth shut. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say Donahue survived Notre Dame football on guts and guile. He played 
two years on the varsity and cracked the team's lineup as a senior. He started 
at offensive guard and also played linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue describes himself as "a solid little high school player," adding, "I 
played more on emotion and desire than talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Former teammates define Donahue in terms such as "scrappy," "committed" and 
"hard-nosed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry was the classic over-achiever, a guy who got the absolute maximum out 
of his ability," says Cicuto, who is the football coach at Glendale College. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Vessella: "He would compete over the flip of a coin." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Stifter, Notre Dame's quarterback in '61, remembers Donahue as "tough as 
nails, determined, persevering, a guy who wouldn't quit on anything. The 
tougher it got, the more he loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 On and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declines to provide specifics, Cicuto says Donahue was somewhat of 
a roughneck outside of the school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys would try to pick on him because he wasn't quite as big as us other 
guys," Cicuto says. "He never went out looking for trouble, but he was never 
one to run away from a happening, either." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed for details, Cicuto says, laughing, "Those things aren't printable. It 
wouldn't be good for Terry." 
</P>
<P>
 Stifter allows that Donahue was "no saint," but adds, "He knew his boundaries. 
Notre Dame would not have put up with poor behavior, and neither would his 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's tenacity enabled him to compete in high school football's upper 
echelon, but it wasn't enough to earn him the attention of major-college 
football recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Notre Dame's players earned Division I football scholarships, but 
Donahue wasn't among them. He enrolled at San Jose State, where his older 
brother, Dan, went to school, and tried out for the football team as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that he didn't fit into that team's plans, Donahue left San Jose 
after redshirting as a freshman. He attended Valley College for one year, then 
was accepted by UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 After earning a football roster spot as a walk-on, Donahue did not play his 
first season with the Bruins. But by the time his playing days were over, he 
was a starter on the defensive line in 21 consecutive games. UCLA had a 17-3-1 
record in his final two years, including an upset victory over Michigan State 
in the 1966 Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's playing weight: 197 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 His former high school teammates could hardly believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry was probably the biggest surprise (of the Notre Dame players who played 
in college)," says Stifter, who earned a football scholarship to Washington. 
"But that just goes back to his determination and work ethic. He's just a very 
strong-willed guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue and UCLA might have earned yet another Rose Bowl victory were it not 
for the effort of Jim Sartoris, another former Notre Dame teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, Donahue's senior season, the Bruins' chances for a second consecutive 
trip to the Rose Bowl and a shot at a national championship were foiled by 
Washington, which upset UCLA, 16-3, in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins led, 3-0, early in that game until Sartoris sparked the Huskies by 
returning a kickoff 87 yards to set up Washington's go-ahead touchdown. "He 
(Donahue) couldn't believe I would do that to him," says Sartoris, who preceded 
Cicuto as football coach at Glendale and is now that school's athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Donahue informally introduces Sartoris as "the guy who knocked us 
out of the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 As a coach, Donahue has guided UCLA to four Rose Bowls, winning in 1983, '84 
and '86. His 143 victories places him 13th among active Division I coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into this season, Donahue had developed 32 first-team All-Americans, 
dozens of professional players and a quick wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if any of his players have reminded him of himself he replies, "Not any 
that I kept on the team. I cut those guys."

WESTLAKE HAS NO PROBLEM WITH KEPPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Keppel High football team's first clue that it was outclassed against 
Westlake on Friday night might have been when Billy Miller jumped over a Keppel 
tackler. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Aztecs probably knew it long before that play, which came midway 
through the first quarter of Westlake's 55-14 drubbing in the first round of 
the Southern Section Division III playoffs at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, after all, started the playoffs as the No. 1 team in the 
division, and Keppel made the playoffs by winning a coin toss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs probably wish they would have lost it . 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the most explosive team I've ever seen," Keppel Coach Tony Sumida 
said. "They have five guys who can break one from any place on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got too many weapons. I don't know how anyone is going to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake (10-1) gained 418 yards. Keppel (4-7) managed 248, but only 125 
against the first-string defense in the first half. Most of those yards came on 
a 73-yard touchdown pass play during a Westlake breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors will face Diamond Bar, a 36-28 winner over Buena, in the 
quarterfinals next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake quarterback Scott Spruill completed eight of 10 passes for 172 yards. 
Miller caught seven passes for 125 yards and two touchdowns, playing only in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was fun," Miller said, "to get the game taken care of in the first half 
and then watch the sophomores in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 After holding Keppel to three plays and a punt on the game's first possession, 
Westlake's fun began. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake scored on all but two of its possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 There were rushing touchdowns: a two-yard run by Jamal Harris, a one-yard dive 
by Craig Walendy and a 53-yard run by Jason Victor. 
</P>
<P>
 There were passing touchdowns: a 75-yard scoring play on a screen from Spruill 
to Harris, 26- and 27-yard passes to Miller and a 40-yard scoring play on a 
screen from Steve Aylsworth to Walendy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth also returned his eighth interception 70 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake began substituting before halftime. In the second half, the Warriors 
rotated three quarterbacks -- Spruill, Brian Shubin and Aylsworth -- on every 
offensive play. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth completed all three of his passes for 81 yards. Shubin completed 
three of four passes for 59 yards.

SYLMAR TAKES OFFENSE, PUNCHES OUT UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Engilman, Sylmar High's football coach, said a friend told him that 
University Coach Marshall Jones was happy about drawing the top-seeded Spartans 
in the first round of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs because San 
Fernando Valley teams are not very physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Jones actually said it or not, Sylmar players bought the story and 
took offense -- literally. 
</P>
<P>
 While Sylmar's unyielding defense limited University to just 41 yards, the 
Spartan offense ran wild for 500 to fuel a 46-0 victory over the Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated by the perceived insult, junior running back Durell Price rushed for 
226 yards and four touchdowns in 14 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't forget about it all week," said Price, who scored on runs of 22, 
95, 17 and two yards. "(Engilman) kept talking about it every day at practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (11-0), which will face Banning in a quarterfinal game Wednesday, 
opened the scoring just 14 seconds into the game when Davon Young picked up a 
squib kick and raced 77 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Price recovered a University fumble, then he converted the 
turnover himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a handoff from Greg Marquez on a draw play, Price scored on a 22-yard 
run, dragging two University defenders with him the final five yards. 
</P>
<P>
 After forcing a punt, Sylmar struck again when Price shrugged off a few 
defenders at the line of scrimmage and raced 95 yards for his second touchdown, 
giving the Spartans a 21-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The play) was designed to go outside," Price said. "I got hit but I stayed 
up and saw open field after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing without Marco Pleas, a back who rushed for 1,455 yards in the regular 
season, University (7-4) didn't come close to scoring. Jones would not say why 
Pleas did not play.

HART PASSES PUT TORRANCE ON RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Hart literally threw Torrance out of the Southern Section Division 
II football playoffs, trouncing the Tartars, 42-13, Friday night at College of 
the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McKeon, Hart's junior quarterback, threw four touchdown passes as Hart 
(11-0) gained 313 of its 458 yards in the first half to forge a 35-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Torrance had unofficially gotten the heave-ho 2 minutes 38 seconds into 
the second quarter, when McKeon hit J.B. Nelson (three receptions for 69 yards) 
with a 14-yard scoring pass to make it 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
 It was set up by linebacker Marc Zimmerman's sixth interception and an 11-yard 
return to the 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very good coming out -- very confident," said McKeon, a junior who had 
been battling flu. "I was throwing terribly during the week, but I felt really 
strong out here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed 10 of 19 passes for 295 yards. Torrance's Dave Lechman 
intercepted two of his throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tartars blitzed McKeon but couldn't stop him with man-to-man coverage. He 
threw for 222 yards in the first half, including scoring plays of 31 and 14 
yards to Nelson and 21 and 27 to running back Ted Iacenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda, who entered the game with an area-best 31 touchdowns, had four more. 
He also scored on runs of 80 and eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tartars ran three plays and punted on their first possession and missed a 
47-yard field goal on their next drive. Then it was an interception, punt, 
touchdown after Lechman's first interception, then punt, punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Hilliard caught a 16-yard pass from Babak Farrokh-Siar and ran through 
Ryan Riske for the first Tartar score. Riske got a tongue-lashing on the 
sideline, but there were few of those, because the Tartars couldn't stop Hart's 
aerial attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our Achilles' heel all year has been our pass defense," Torrance Coach Rock 
Hollis said. "We were praying for a little wind. We knew they were going to 
pass the ball if they saw the films we gave them." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Hart two plays to cover 41 yards on its first drive with its 
no-huddle, run-and-shoot offense. A 31-yard pass play from McKeon to Nelson to 
the corner of the end zone capped it. 
</P>
<P>
 When they got the ball back, the Indians marched 64 yards in seven plays. 
Iacenda lined up in the slot, ran a post route and pulled in a 21-yard pass at 
the goal line to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda made the pass play look easy, just as he did with his 80-yard run on 
the only play of Hart's next drive. He took a handoff at the line of scrimmage, 
darted toward the Torrance bench and steamed up the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God," Torrance Coach Hollis said when asked about Iacenda, a 6-foot-1, 
215-pound junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda had 309 yards rushing and receiving. He rushed for 122 yards, which 
gives him 1,249 for the season. He had five receptions for 187 yards, including 
a 73-yarder on a shovel pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps his most impressive plays were the eight-yard run and his 27-yard 
reception that capped the first-half scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda bulled up the middle and broke three tackles on the scoring run and 
made a fingertip catch in the end zone on the pass play.

BIG SHOTS OUTSHOT IN SHOOTOUT; GOLF: LIKE CHEMISTRY CLASS, SOME EXPERIMENTS

 Tear up the periodic table of the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Players in the Shark Shootout often talk about the importance of chemistry and 
symbiosis in team golf events. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure thing, guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity, commonality and friendship had precious little to do with 
anything in Friday's opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sport where players compete as solo acts all year, the team concept can 
make grown men cringe. Players who have known each other for years struggled 
mightily. Guys thrown together in the 11th hour played well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some twosomes set Sherwood Country Club course records for most high-fives 
exchanged in an 18-hole round, while others half expected their teammates to 
seek immediate annulment. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemistry? As long as teams keep the ball out of the water, a dog and cat 
could win these crazy dog-and-pony shows. Putting players together often makes 
guys think, not to mention perform, in strange ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to do so well for your partner," Ben Crenshaw said. "Boy, I'm about 
as embarrassed as I can be for the way I played." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the first-round format, players each hit from the tee, then selected the 
best of the two shots and alternated thereafter. Finding a rhythm is difficult. 
Finding the rhyme or reason for why the format works, or fails to, is even 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw and partner Mark Calcavecchia seemed the perfect blend of power and 
finesse. Calcavecchia hits it into the stratosphere and Crenshaw is one the 
sport's legendary putters. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo combined for a solid three-under 69, good for fourth place in the 
10-team field, yet Crenshaw was hanging his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can actually find yourself trying too hard," Crenshaw said. "It's a very 
elusive thing. We never found that niche." 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity doesn't mean much. For the past two years, best pals Greg Norman 
and Nick Price have won a vault of cash, yet when the Shootout begins, the 
greatest players on the planet can't seem to find a fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they birdied the final two holes to finish with a 72, Norman and Price 
were in last place. Send either of them out alone and they'd shoot 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, sponsor of the event, has never won his own tournament, which is 
carrying the gracious host treatment a little too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, a small spark can ignite a moribund team. Chip Beck and Jeff 
Maggert were two-over after the front nine, but Maggert knocked a wedge within 
a couple of feet of the pin on No. 10, Beck converted the birdie putt and the 
feeding frenzy was on. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair birdied seven of the first eight holes on the back nine to 
temporarily take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, sometimes players can out-think themselves. Golf is not meant to be 
played by committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On No. 18, Maggert/Beck elected to use Beck's drive since Maggert had been 
knocking down flagsticks with his irons all day.  
</P>
<P>
 They were all set for a glorious landing . . . that turned into a splashdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggert promptly dunked a nine-iron into a greenside lake. The pair finished 
with a double bogey and a share of second place at 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemistry? Uh-huh. Maggert was the last player added to the 20-man field. He 
replaced Tom Lehman, who backed out because of another commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a good team," Beck said. "We brother-in-lawed it really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lanny Wadkins and Andrew Magee birdied four of the last five holes to finish 
at 66, good for the first-round lead. Neither played in last year's Shootout.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray Floyd and Steve Elkington, the 1993 champions, are tied for last at 73. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's because you're trying for someone else," Crenshaw said. "You don't 
allow yourself to be yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. Calcavecchia hit a majestic three-iron shot from 240 yards on the 
par-5 16th that came to rest three feet from the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, as close to a lead-pipe cinch as there is on the greens, missed the 
putt for eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, we didn't jibe," Crenshaw said. "We weren't the only 
ones."

 Better postpone Chick Epstein's retirement party for another few days. 
</P>
<P>
 After announcing earlier in the week that he will step down at the end of the 
season, Birmingham High's 17-year head coach saw the campaign extended Friday 
night when the Braves upset Reseda, 22-6. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regents (7-4), ranked No. 1 in the 3-A playoffs, were stifled on offense 
and could only score on an 89-yard kickoff return by Michael Oxx late in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Birmingham's Courtney Blunt shredded Reseda for 190 yards in 36 
carries and Marvin Powell scored on a 32-yard run out of punt formation to lead 
the Braves (5-5-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our game plan to run the ball and if they stopped us, well we'd pass 
too," said Epstein, who was involved in an angry exchange of words with Reseda 
coach Joel Schaeffer after the game over Epstein's comments about the game 
earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein placed his faith in Blunt and the senior tailback touched the ball on 
22 of Birmingham's 31 plays from scrimmage in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt scored on one-yard plunges midway through the first and second quarters 
and Salguero Lewis added a 26-yard field goal with 36 seconds to play in the 
half to put the Braves up, 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxx, who did not start due to a knee injury, lost three fumbles and had only 
38 yards in 11 carries.

TAFT STOPS COMEBACK JUST IN TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taft High dominated Garfield in the first half of a City Section 4-A Division 
football playoff opener Friday, scoring the game's first 28 points and making 
it look easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought the Toreadors would end up hanging on for dear life? 
</P>
<P>
 As unlikely as it seemed, the Bulldogs held Taft scoreless in the second half, 
scored three touchdowns, recovered two late onside kicks, and came up just 
eight yards short of the end zone as time expired in the 34-27 thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started slowly, but conditioning-wise, we knew that Taft had too many 
players going both ways," Garfield Coach John Aguirre said. "We felt the second 
half would be ours." 
</P>
<P>
 It was. Garfield (7-4) outscored the City's second-seeded team, 20-0, after 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the fourth quarter, running back Edgar Soto caught a screen pass from 
quarterback Eddie Hermoso and weaved his way for scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The final touchdown, a 14-yard play, came with 33 seconds left. After 
recovering the onside kick -- its second in a row -- Garfield drew a 
pass-interference penalty on Taft and had the ball at the Toreador 23 with five 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, the Bulldogs opted to go with the screen to Soto one final 
time. He caught the ball and picked his way toward the goal line, but was 
tackled at the eight by Taft lineman Juan Madera. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft Coach Troy Starr appeared furious with his team after the game, ordering 
players straight to the locker room following the post-game handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor second half overshadowed a brilliant first half, which saw Taft 
(10-1) score almost at will. Running back Jerry Brown, who finished with 266 
yards in 19 carries, had touchdown runs of five, 22, and 86 yards. Quarterback 
Dayon Shaw threw two scoring passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hermoso passed for 352 yards and three touchdowns for Garfield. Rudy Burruel 
had eight receptions for 179 yards.

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; ONLY OREGON STATE CAN DETER OREGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody can con Stanford Coach Bill Walsh into believing in the Stanford 
football team the way Bill Walsh can. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of Stanford's football fortunes had himself convinced that the 
Cardinal was going to knock Oregon out of the Rose Bowl last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 That conviction even brought a couple of unhappy thoughts for Walsh. Oregon 
Coach Rich Brooks is a close friend. And, as Walsh told a reporter, "My gosh, 
I'm about to put USC into the Rose Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said he continued to think Stanford would win even after learning that 
Scott Frost, not Steve Stenstrom, would be his quarterback. Stenstrom had 
surgery for a broken finger. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shadows started to close over Stanford Stadium in the first quarter 
last Saturday, Walsh realized he had sold himself a bill of goods. The Cardinal 
wasn't able to repeat its performance against Washington and the Ducks weren't 
about to let down. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Stenstrom probably couldn't have stemmed the Oregon tide. Duck 
quarterback Danny O'Neil had his finest game, throwing for six touchdowns, and 
completing 21 of 37 passes for 339 yards in a 55-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the statistics won't show it, Danny has become a better 
quarterback," Brooks said. "This, of course, was his best game, but he has 
improved rapidly since coming back from (an) injury. Where he has improved the 
most is in decision-making. He no longer makes mistakes in judgment. He always 
could pass about as well as anyone and now he's a complete quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing between Oregon and the long-awaited trip to the Rose Bowl is 
the Civil War -- the always bitter battle for supremacy in the state of Oregon 
-- against Oregon State today. Seldom has the game meant so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State won a wild 15-12 game at Eugene last year. This one, in 
Corvallis, will be big for the Beavers too. Not only could they win their fifth 
game of the season, they would be beating a nationally ranked team for the 
second week in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't won five games in a season since 1971," Beaver Coach Jerry 
Pettibone said. "When we beat Washington State last week, it was our first win 
over a ranked team in years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers are eager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to come here high as a kite," running back J.J. Young said. "They 
have to come through us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the last full weekend of the Pacific 10 Conference season, so maybe 
it's time to name the player of the year. There have been some good ones -- 
Napoleon Kaufman of Washington, Rob Johnson of USC, Oregon's entire defensive 
backfield, and countless other defensive stars, such as UCLA's Donnie Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this writer's opinion, the best player has been Stanford's Stenstrom. 
Although his broken finger cut his season short, Stenstrom had a fabulous one. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh wasn't conning anyone when he said before the season that Stenstrom, the 
senior from El Toro, was the best college quarterback. Against strong odds, he 
has been just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom took a beating in every game. And he played on a team unable to stop 
the opposition. He lost his best running back, Mike Mitchell, after the first 
game. Nevertheless, he was responsible for Stanford's producing 462 yards a 
game. When he had the time to throw, he simply didn't miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Alex Molden of Oregon summed up the feelings of the Ducks when he 
said, "It was a huge break for us when he couldn't play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I watched him on film, he kept getting better and better. Not 
having him really hurt Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the injury in the middle of his eighth game, Stenstrom already had 
thrown 14 touchdown passes. He had completed almost 65% of his passes and was 
averaging 314 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sad that he didn't get a chance to finish," Walsh said. "He would have 
had at least 800 more yards. With three more touchdowns, he would have broken 
John Elway's record (77)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of October, the college football excitement in the Northwest was 
in Washington, not Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Huskies, despite having no place to go because they were on 
suspension, were flying high. In convincing fashion, they had ended Miami's 
record-breaking home winning streak and they had overwhelmed Ohio State and 
UCLA. Kaufman was in the running for the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was another goal. The Huskies were going to knock some teams out of 
the Rose Bowl race. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state, Washington State had established itself as one of the best 
defensive teams in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars were ready for the showdown with Arizona that would put the winner 
in the lead for the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Cougars and Huskies meet today at Pullman, it will be just another 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars are out of the Rose Bowl race and probably will go to the Alamo 
Bowl. Kaufman is no longer in the running for the Heisman, and the Huskies, 
after yielding 46 points to Stanford, can only wait till next year. Pac-10 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't turn out to be the year of the quarterback, as had been anticipated, 
but last week was the week of the quarterback. Five of them threw for more than 
300 yards -- USC's Rob Johnson with 390, Pat Barnes of Cal with 389, Wayne Cook 
of UCLA with 380, Dan White of Arizona with 370 and Danny O'Neil of Oregon with 
339. They passed for 18 touchdowns.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFF ROUNDUP; QUARTZ HILL TAKES FIGHT OUT OF MUIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quartz Hill High scored four touchdowns in the second quarter and stunned 
Pacific League champion Muir, 33-9, Friday night in a Southern Section Division 
II first-round playoff game at Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first loss for Muir Coach Mike Harrison since taking over the team 
in the fourth game of the season.Five Muir players were ejected in the fourth 
quarter for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first quarter, Quartz Hill (6-3-2) opened the scoring on a 
one-yard run by Jeff Diamond. Moments later, Matt Adranga blocked a punt and 
Dion Finley returned it 32 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond (14 carries, 49 yards) scored two more touchdowns in the quarter on 
runs of two yards and one yard. Finley set up one score with an interception 
and picked off two passes in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel quarterback Damein Kendrid completed five of 15 passes for 140 yards, 
including a 66-yarder to Raul Gomez to set up Diamond's third touchdown with 13 
seconds left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels racked up 259 yards in offense. Jeremiah Harris had 14 carries for 
43 yards, and Brian Pereira added 36 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (8-3) were held to 177 yards in offense and were penalized 10 
times for 95 yards. Muir's top running back, Shaun Haslip, was held to 34 yards 
in 10 carries. DARIN ESPER

THE RIVALRY WITHIN A RIVALRY; ROBINSON HOLDS A 5-3 ADVANTAGE OVER DONAHUE, BUT 
UCLA COACH HAS WON THREE OF THEIR LAST FOUR MATCHUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once, they were rookie head coaches, thrown together into one of college 
football's great rivalries. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years after their first meeting, UCLA's Terry Donahue still looks 
like the preppy guy who on that 1976 November afternoon battled USC's John 
Robinson for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson leads in the Robinson-Donahue series, 5-3, but Donahue, 50, can claim 
the same waistline he had in '76. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, 59, has taken on the appearance and manner of a courtly, affable 
bank president. 
</P>
<P>
 In Robinson's first term at USC, 1976-1982, his teams were 5-2 against 
Donahue's. In the first USC-UCLA game of his second term, which began last 
season, UCLA won, 27-21.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, since Robinson won the first four Robinson-Donahue matchups, Donahue 
has won three of the last four and two in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, at 40, became a head coach about three months before Donahue.  
</P>
<P>
 When John McKay announced during the 1975 season that he was moving on to the 
NFL, Robinson, an assistant with the Oakland Raiders, was named to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue was 31 when he was promoted to head coach at UCLA in February of 1976. 
He replaced Dick Vermeil, who had left to coach the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the eight Robinson-Donahue games in the USC-UCLA series: 1976 -- USC 
24, UCLA 14 
</P>
<P>
 There were few bigger games in the series than the first Robinson-Donahue 
meeting. UCLA was 9-0-1 and had scored 35 or more points seven times. USC was 
8-1, having lost only its opener, to Missouri, 46-25.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was ranked second nationally, USC third. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, USC cornerback Dennis Thurman -- now on Robinson's staff 
-- picked a second-quarter fumble by Theotis Brown out of the air and returned 
in 47 yards for a touchdown. The Trojans never looked back, building a 24-0 
lead. 1977 -- USC 29, UCLA 27 
</P>
<P>
 A controversial pass-interference call on UCLA defensive back Johnny Lynn in 
the final minute set up USC for a game-winning field goal -- with two seconds 
left -- by Frank Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had an early 10-0 lead, but USC scored 26 unanswered points. The Bruins 
went ahead with less than three minutes left on an 80-yard drive with a 
fourth-down touchdown from USC's one. That gave the Bruins a 27-26 lead, but 
Jordan's kick knocked them out of the Rose Bowl. 1978 -- USC 17, UCLA 10 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans carved a 17-0 halftime lead, then stuffed UCLA's vaunted running 
game in the second half. The Bruins went into the game averaging 264 yards 
rushing but finished with 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, USC's junior tailback, Charles White, ran for 145 yards and the 
Trojans went on to beat Notre Dame, then Michigan in the Rose Bowl. 1979 -- USC 
49, UCLA 14 
</P>
<P>
 In the most lopsided game of the series since 1950, the fourth-ranked, 9-0-1 
Trojans were merciless against a 5-5 UCLA team. 
</P>
<P>
 This one was over after two quarters. USC had a 35-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who was about to become USC's third Heisman Trophy winner, led a Trojan 
assault that accounted for 27 first downs and 539 net yards. White scored four 
touchdowns and gained 194 yards. 1980 -- UCLA 20, USC 17 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50th USC-UCLA game, Robinson's four-game winning streak against Donahue 
ended in improbable fashion.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had the ball on its 42-yard line when quarterback Jay Schroeder threw 
deep to his tailback, Freeman McNeil. Trojan cornerback Jeff Fisher leaped high 
to defend on the play . . . and deflected the ball into the hands of McNeil, 
who then sped past a startled Dennis Smith on a 58-yard touchdown play with 
2:07 left.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Winning Tip," a headline writer called it. 1981 -- USC 22, UCLA 21 
</P>
<P>
 USC assistant coach Marv Goux had observed in game films that a UCLA guard 
stepped slightly to the outside on placement kicks. So the Trojans had nose 
guard George Achica shooting the gap on key kicks.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, UCLA was lining up for a game-winning, 39-yard field goal with 
four seconds left. Achica's block saved USC and kept UCLA from the Rose Bowl.  
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Allen, soon to win the Heisman Trophy, had 40 carries and 219 yards. 
1982 -- UCLA 20, USC 19 
</P>
<P>
 Zeros on the clock and one team ahead by a point -- a typical game-ending 
situation, it seemed, for USC-UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Not typical was the site. For the first time since the series began in 1929, 
the schools were not playing in the Coliseum, but in the Rose Bowl, UCLA's new 
home field. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had driven 66 yards to a fourth-down touchdown as time ran out. Trojan 
quarterback Scott Tinsley, searching in vain for an open receiver in the end 
zone on the two-point conversion try, was sacked by Karl Morgan. 1993 -- UCLA 
27, USC 21 
</P>
<P>
 No one would have dared predict the finish of this one. Junior USC quarterback 
Rob Johnson, who had just set a Pacific 10 single-season record for the lowest 
interception rate -- he had thrown only four in 369 passes -- would lose a Rose 
Bowl-decider on an interception.  
</P>
<P>
 USC had a first down at UCLA's three with 1:16 to go and trailed, 27-21. Two 
runs gained a yard. Then UCLA's Marvin Goodwin came up with the theft when 
Johnson threw to tight end Tyler Cashman in the end zone.

BELL-JEFF PLAYOFF GAME MOVED BECAUSE OF SNOW AND COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Snow and cold weather have forced Bell-Jeff's Division X playoff game against 
host Big Bear to be relocated to San Bernardino Aquinas High School at 7 
tonight. 
</P>

 The usually potent passing attack of Granada Hills High never got untracked 
Friday night as the Highlanders fell, 14-0, to Dorsey in the first round of the 
City Section 4-A Division playoffs at Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills quarterback Brian MacLean, who averaged more than 200 yards 
passing a game during the regular season, completed six of 26 passes for 81 
yards and had three interceptions.The Highlanders (6-4-1) managed only two 
first downs and 63 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Both touchdowns for Dorsey (9-2) came after interceptions deep in Granada 
Hills territory. John Watkins intercepted MacLean's pass in the second quarter 
at the Highlander 34 and returned it 24 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Roderick Brown's subsequent one-yard bootleg gave Dorsey a 7-0 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the third quarter, linebacker Juan Jimenez picked off MacLean's pass 
at the Granada Hills 20. Three plays later Antwain Wilson scored from one yard.

FONTANA ELIMINATES EDISON, 30-7; PLAYOFFS: NEXT UP FOR STEELERS AFTER OPENING 
VICTORY IN DIVISION I IS BISHOP AMAT.

 Life doesn't seem fair sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana High played brilliantly Friday night in defeating Huntington Beach 
Edison, 30-7, in the opening round of the CIF Southern Section Division I 
football playoffs before about 2,500 at Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the Steelers' reward? Only a second-round meeting with La Puente 
Bishop Amat, The Times' No. 1 ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, we've got to play (Bishop Amat) sometime, we might as well play them 
now," Fontana Coach Dick Bruich said after the No. 17 Steelers improved their 
record to 8-3, while ending 12th-ranked Edison's season at 8-3. "If we can't 
beat them now we won't beat them later." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana running back Art Gipson, who rushed for 169 yards and two touchdowns, 
including a game-breaking 84-yard run in the fourth quarter, is ready for the 
Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about playing the No. 1 team in the nation," said Gipson, 
referring to Bishop Amat's ranking in at least one national publication. "We 
know if we play well, we will have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers' defense came to play against a pass-happy Edison team, which put 
the ball in the air 34 times. Charger quarterback Patrick Markovsky, who was 
harassed in the backfield and in the secondary, completed only 15 passes for 
159 yards. He had two passes intercepted. He was also sacked four times for 
minus 33 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do anything right on offense," said Edison Coach Dave White. "Their 
defense dominated the football game." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite dominating for much of the first three quarters, Fontana led by only 
seven points, 14-7, heading into the final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lucien Robinson gave the Steelers a 21-7 cushion early in the fourth 
quarter when he found room over the right side and ran 53 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana added a safety when Oskar Reyes blocked an Edison punt out of the end 
zone with 9:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers closed out the scoring with 7:38 remaining on Gipson's long 
touchdown run.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Phoenix Suns were barely able to beat the Portland Trail Blazers earlier 
this week, even though they were playing without Kevin Johnson and Charles 
Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 With Johnson back in the lineup Friday, it wasn't close as Phoenix beat 
Portland, 124-111, bolstered by a 17-8 fourth-quarter run. Dan Majerle had a 
three-point play and a three-pointer during that stretch to carry the Suns at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning, who also had a three-point play during the surge, scored 26 
points. Majerle finished with 24, and Johnson, back after sitting out four 
games because of sore ribs and a sprained knee, had 20. Buck Williams had 25 
points and 12 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who outrebounded Phoenix, 43-27, 
but were hurt by 24 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix started Portland's slide with a 96-93 upset on Tuesday in Oregon. 
Barkley spent his mandatory fifth game on the bench after being put on the 
injured list. The Trail Blazers were without Clyde Drexler and Rod Strickland. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 97, Atlanta 93 -- A big victory in overtime and a big night from No. 
1 draft pick Glenn Robinson gave the Bucks a confidence boost against the Hawks 
in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Mayberry's off-balance, 12-foot shot broke a tie with 28 seconds left in 
overtime. Mayberry had 14 points and 10 assists. Robinson, in his first start, 
led the Bucks with 26 points, including a basket in overtime. Grant Long led 
the Hawks with 27 points and 10 rebounds, both season highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 121, Detroit 96 -- Jeff Hornacek scored 21 points and the Jazz held the 
Pistons to 15 of 42 shots in the second half for the victory at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah, which led by 16 points at halftime and by 25 points by the end of the 
third quarter, held Grant Hill to four second-half points and Joe Dumars to one 
free throw. Hill led the Pistons with 16 points and Dumars added 13. Felton 
Spencer, Karl Malone and Tom Chambers each scored 16 points for the Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 94, Seattle 87 -- Coach Larry Brown was unimpressed with his team's 
performance in the first six games of the season. The seventh game may have 
changed his outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Miller scored 16 of his 22 points in the first half as the Pacers 
defeated the SuperSonics at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in terms of effort, ours was great," Brown said. "When it really 
counted in the fourth quarter, our defense was excellent. I was proud of the 
team and their effort, and I hope they feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the SuperSonics to 0-3 on a four-game road trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 115, Miami 111 -- Dominique Wilkins scored 24 points, including four in 
the final minute, as the Celtics held off the Heat at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who scored two points in 11 minutes during the third quarter, had a 
big fourth quarter with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins' final basket with 16 seconds remaining gave Boston a 114-109 lead 
after Miami had tied it, 109-109, on a three-point play by Glen Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 113, New Jersey 103 -- Nick Anderson scored nine of his 25 points in 
the final 4:08 as the Magic pulled away from the Nets at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson also had 12 rebounds and six assists, and Anfernee Hardaway led a 
third-quarter defensive stand that turned the game around while Shaquille 
O'Neal was on the bench in foul trouble.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; AFTER SHORT PAUSE, TABASCO CAT TRIES TURF IN HOLLYWOOD DERBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since the Hollywood Derby was moved from the main track to the turf in 
1981, a large field has been all but guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the race was split into divisions for seven consecutive years and 
eight of 10. Last year, 14 3-year-olds started and 16 were entered Friday 
morning for Sunday's 54th running of the Derby. However, only 14 will be 
allowed to run. Mighty Forum and Psychobabble are the also-eligibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a full field was expected, Tabasco Cat didn't seem a likely 
participant. After all, the Storm Cat colt is only two weeks removed from a 
neck loss to Concern in the Breeders' Cup Classic, his 11th start in a 
memorable year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being highly successful with five victories and $2,164,334 in 
earnings, 1994 has also been strenuous for Tabasco Cat. The Preakness and 
Belmont Stakes winner has run at seven tracks in four states. And Tabasco Cat 
has never set hoof on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the most accomplished member of the Hollywood Derby cast will almost 
certainly be favored in a race that wasn't in trainer Wayne Lukas' plans until 
after the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Lukas was going to give Tabasco Cat three-four weeks off before 
preparing him for the final two legs of Santa Anita's three-race Strub Series 
-- the San Fernando and Strub Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 He changed his mind after seeing how the colt looked after his narrow loss at 
Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came out of that race better than he had any race all year," Lukas said 
Friday. "A lot of astute horsemen have told me that they've never seen him look 
better. He bounced out of the Classic in beautiful shape. He's heavier now by 
about 60 pounds than he was at Saratoga (during the summer). He's really 
starting to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been dying to put him on the grass. It's a 3-year-old race for $400,000 
and it's a Grade I. Instead of three or four weeks off, he'll have two weeks. 
He's doing absolutely super and, if he runs well on the grass, it gives us 
another option for next year. We really have nothing to lose and quite a bit to 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat's pedigree suggests he should handle the grass and there are other 
reasons Lukas thinks he will make a successful transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got the action and the right style of running and he's got the flat foot 
that is so typical of good grass horses," he said. "He's got that daisy-cutting 
stride where he kind of shuffles when he runs and he's nifty and handles turns 
well. I think he'll take right to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that remains to be seen and Tabasco Cat is giving away a lot of 
turf experience. The other 15 entrants have combined for 41 victories in 113 
grass starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, the colt to beat is Dare And Go, who has the same connections as 
Kotashaan, the 1993 horse of the year. Owned by the La Presle Farm of Gerard 
and Alain Wertheimer and trained by Richard Mandella, the Alydar colt lost by a 
head to Vaudeville in the Secretariat on Aug. 28 at Chicago's Arlington 
International in his American debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Dare And Go won four of eight in France. He will be ridden by 
Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani, who rode Explosive Red to a 22-1 upset in last year's Derby, 
will ride Eagle Eyed, one of two horses trainer Bobby Frankel will start. Eagle 
Eyed had trouble in the Del Mar Derby, was disqualified from third and placed 
seventh after bumping Marvin's Faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel didn't get any breaks when post positions were drawn. Eagle Eyed is 
stuck in Post 14 and right next to him is Frankel's other colt, Torch Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field, from the rail out, are Marvin's Faith, Yokohama, Powis 
Castle, Signe Divin, Fadeyev, Lahint, Numerous, River Flyer, Pollock's Luck and 
Unfinished Symph, who finished third in the Breeders' Cup Mile as part of the 
mutuel field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 College Town, who made a comfortable living running second a lot before his 
surprising victory in the California Cup Classic, is the 3-1 favorite for 
today's feature, the $100,000 Lazaro S. Barrera Handicap at 1 1/16 miles on the 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by David N. Brown and trained by Mel Stute, College Town had only a 
maiden victory and eight second-place finishes in his first 18 races before 
shocking heavily favored Kingdom Found at 33-1 in the Classic. Teamed with 
Laffit Pincay for the first time, the 3-year-old Snow Chief gelding rallied 
along the inside to win the $250,000 race by two lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Pincay will be aboard again today in the Barrera and there are 10 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the others, Powis Castle has the most class, but he is also entered in the 
Hollywood Derby and he seems more likely to show up there. Vann Belvoir is 
named on the Rare Brick colt today, but he is also scheduled to ride eight 
horses at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 However, three of Powis Castle's four victories have been on dirt and he was 
also second behind Tabasco Cat in the San Rafael and second to Polar Expedition 
in the Jim Beam. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the field are Flying Sensation, who has earned close to $300,000 
while winning only once in 12 starts; Hello Chicago, Luthier Fever, Sharp 
Phase, Puzar, Warning Label, Just Java, Alphabet Soup and Tajo. A Treek For 
Roses, Jacques Aboard and Barbarian were scratched Friday. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park began offering simulcast betting on races from Hong Kong Friday 
night. The simulcasts from Sha Tin Race Course began at 9:30 p.m. and continued 
until 1 a.m. and there were separate California pools for trifecta, quinella, 
exacta and win, place and show betting. Future simulcast dates are Nov. 26 and 
Dec. 2, 10 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur jockeys will be riding in the 10th race on today's card, part of a 
24-race series the riders have been participating in around the country. The 
race drew a field of 10 and will be run at 1 1/16 miles on the turf. Scott 
Fileccia, who won the 1993 race at Hollywood Park aboard Whisk Spree, will ride 
Bojay Dawn today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will simulcast the $400,000 Hawthorne Gold Cup between the 
third and fourth races today. . . . The Hollywood Derby will be simulcast on 
ESPN between noon and 1 p.m. Sunday. The race is scheduled to be run at 12:40 
p.m. . . . The other stakes on the card Sunday are the $250,000 Citation 
Handicap at 1 1/4 miles on the turf and the Hollywood Turf Express at 5 1/2 
furlongs.

GRANADA HILLS, TAFT CHART NEW TERRITORY; CROSS-COUNTRY: BOTH SCHOOLS COULD WIN 
FIRST GIRLS' CHAMPIONSHIPS IN CITY SECTION FINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Granada Hills and Taft, two high schools with strong boys' cross-country 
programs, will attempt to produce their first girls' champions when the City 
Section finals are held today at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills junior Brooke Page and Belmont senior Delfina Martinez are 
co-favorites for the individual title, with Palisades and Taft expected to 
battle for the team championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two teams in each race and the top five individuals not on a 
qualifying team will advance to the State Division I championships in Fresno 
next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Page and her twin sister Brandi competed for North Hollywood High during the 
1992-94 school years before transferring to Granada Hills in September.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, they almost enrolled at Taft before making their final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, we thought they were coming here," Taft Coach Mel Hein said. 
"We figured we had a pretty good chance at winning City if that had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 When that scenario failed to materialize and top returning runner Noemi 
Sanchez was lost for the season with a lung infection, Hein figured Taft was a 
year away from contending for a City title.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Toreadors improved throughout the season and narrowly lost to 
Palisades, 41-42, in a qualifying heat in last week's City preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping that we can put it all together (today)," said Hein, who guided 
Taft to the 1989 City boys' title.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the girls are just beginning to feel like they are a strong team." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Michelle Klein, who has a personal best of 19 minutes 34 seconds over 
Pierce's three-mile course, leads a Toreador squad that has no seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get two or three runners in the high 19s and another two or three 
in the mid-20s, we should be in pretty good shape," Hein said. "I don't see two 
teams beating us if that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Page posted the fastest time (19:31) in the prelims, but Martinez (19:33), 
Chatsworth's Melinda George (19:37) and Wilson's Lizette Zermeno (19:38) also 
appear capable of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 George could be particularly dangerous if the race comes down to a kick as she 
has run 2:21.75 for 800 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Page can give Granada Hills its first individual City cross-country title 
since Ian Alsen's victory in 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders won the last of five boys' team titles in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades, led by Peter Gilmore, is tabbed to win its first boys' title since 
1977 in today's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield appears to have the best chance of upsetting the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore is an overwhelming favorite after running 15:12 in the preliminaries.  
</P>
<P>
 The second-fastest time was posted by Richard Martinez of Garfield at 15:44. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's Juan Cortes, who ran 15:54 in the preliminaries, and Birmingham's 
Alejandro Tinajero, who timed 16:05, appear capable of finishing among the top 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet starts at 8:30 a.m with the girls' junior varsity race, followed by 
the boys' junior varsity event at 9 and the boys' frosh-soph competition at 
9:30.  
</P>
<P>
 The girls' varsity race begins at 10 with the boys' varsity at 10:30.

THOUSAND OAKS SWINGS WITH MARSDEN; CROSS-COUNTRY: HIS RACE WILL DETERMINE 
WHETHER LANCERS ARE GREAT, OR MERELY VERY GOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When he runs well, the Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team is a great 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 When he runs so-so, the Lancers are merely very good. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Marsden is the unpredictable member of an otherwise consistent Thousand 
Oaks team that is favored to win its third consecutive Division I title in 
today's Southern Section championships at Mt. San Antonio College. 
</P>
<P>
 The meet will begin with the Division I boys' race at 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden, a senior, placed fifth in last year's State Division I championships, 
but has yet to regain that form after missing the first two meets of the season 
with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his return, he has been on a performance roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Lancers' No. 2 runner in the Southwestern University (Tex.) 
Invitational on Oct. 1 and their No. 3 scorer in the Mt. SAC Invitational three 
weeks later. However, he dropped to fifth in the Ventura County championships 
(Oct. 28) and the Marmonte League finals (Nov. 4) before finishing third behind 
teammates Keith O'Doherty and Jeff Fischer in a heat of the section 
preliminaries last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin is our swing guy," Coach Jack Farrell said. "When he swings back toward 
(fourth- and fifth-runners Todd Disney and Josh Carolan), we're a good team, 
but when he swings toward Keith and Jeff, we're very, very tough. . . . My hope 
is that one of these races, he and Jeff will swing right up to Keith. If that 
happens, we have a chance to be the greatest team in state history." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Lancer squad was regarded by some experts as the best team in 
California in more than 20 years, but this year's edition could be better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' top five runners cruised to a cumulative team time of 78 minutes 
32 seconds in the prelims and their 77:56 course record set in last year's 
section finals appears within reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope we get good weather for the finals," Farrell said. "If we do and 
everyone is healthy, it'll be interesting to see how fast we can run." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Thousand Oaks boys will be the toughest team, several competitors 
from the region will contend for individual or team titles. Eleazar Hernandez 
of Camarillo, Brett Strahan of Hart, O'Doherty and Adalberto Sanchez of 
Capistrano Valley are expected to contend for the Division I individual title. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez ran 15:02 to win the team sweepstakes race in the prestigious Mt. 
SAC Invitational, but Sanchez posted the fastest time (15:08) in the prelims, 
followed by Strahan (15:13), O'Doherty (15:17) and Hernandez (15:19). 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale, led by individual favorite Antonio Arce, should battle Mater Dei for 
the Division II boys' team title. Agoura's John Greene, the defending Division 
II champion, and Temple City's James Liu, the individual sweepstakes winner at 
Mt. SAC, should give Arce his toughest competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The tightest team battle of the meet could be waged in the Division III boys' 
race as defending State champion Nordhoff, St. Francis, El Modena, La Habra, 
San Marino and Corona del Mar all appear capable of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff's Javier Ramirez is favored to win his second consecutive individual 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura and Thousand Oaks head the list of local performers in 
the girls' meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, the defending State Division I champion, is heavily favored to win 
her third consecutive title in the Division II race. She finished a distant 
third in the individual sweepstakes race of the Mt. SAC Invitational, but 
followed that with victories in the Ventura County and Marmonte League 
championships before posting the fastest time (17:45) in the prelims. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, led by junior Kim Mortensen, is tabbed to win the Division I 
title with defending State champion Irvine, El Toro and Esperanza its closest 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza's Courtney Pugmire, who ran 18:12 in the prelims, Mortensen (18:25) 
and Irvine's Jessica Corbin (18:33) are expected to vie for the individual 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be interesting to see how fast Kim runs when she's in a race where 
she's pushed for the entire distance," Farrell said. "She's run some good times 
behind Amy this season, but she's always been by herself in that gap between 
first and third." 
</P>
<P>
 The Division III girls' race will feature the top two freshmen in the section. 
Heather Garritson of Buena Park ran 17:49 to win the Division III sweepstakes 
race in the Mt. SAC Invitational and Elaine Canchola of team favorite Nordhoff 
timed 17:53 in last week's prelims. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaluinn Fullove of Louisville is a slight favorite to defeat Mission League 
rival Melissa MacPherson of Flintridge Sacred Heart in the Division IV race. 
</P>
<P>
 The top four teams in each race and the top five individuals not on a 
qualifying team will advance to the State championships in Fresno on Nov. 26.

VENTURA'S PRESS SMOTHERS PORTERVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Ventura College men's basketball team goes to press, it's usually not 
good news for the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates swarmed Porterville from baseline to baseline with a relentless 
full-court press that helped them cruise to a 114-75 victory in a nonconference 
home opener Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (2-0), ranked sixth in the state, forced Porterville (2-2) into 27 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ventura Coach Philip Mathews thought his young team -- 10 of 12 players 
are freshmen -- could have deployed the press even better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting beat (with) long (passes) too much," Mathews said. "When we 
get sharp and (the players) understand what we are trying to do here, we are 
going to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura used its size advantage -- Porterville has only two players 6 feet 6 
or taller to the Pirates' five -- to control the boards. They outrebounded 
Porterville, 63-31, and had 38 offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Damian Cantrell, a freshman from Santa Clara High, grabbed a game-high 
17 rebounds for Ventura and scored 15 points. Center Curtis Gaines had 10 
rebounds and 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates led at the half, 54-35, then extended their lead after 
intermission, scoring numerous baskets after Porterville turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Hakeen Ward scored eight of his team-high 16 points in the second half 
and forward Gerald Zeimmerman scored nine of his 11 points in the final 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura had eight players who scored in double figures, including guard Lance 
Fay with 11 points and forward Charles Woodard with 13. Guard Jamal Cobbs (9 
points) and guard Shannon Taylor (11 points) each had three three-point baskets 
for the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Porterville center Brian Hagens led all scorers with 21 points and teammate 
Antonio Bias scored 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates counterattacked with fast breaks, but they free-lanced on offense 
a bit too much for Mathews' taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the team's second 100-point performance this season -- Ventura 
defeated Imperial Valley, 116-82, last Saturday -- Mathews said there's room 
for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a young team," he said. "We made numerous mistakes, but the good thing 
about that is we are going to get better."

DON'T DEVALUE CSUN ATHLETICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recent events at Cal State Northridge should not devalue the football team and 
athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must put aside the political correctness of the anointed who oversee 
the fantasy world of academia and get to the hard facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The football and men's basketball teams are the quickest way to garner 
recognition, interest and support from communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The present administration should not be allowed to make a decision with such 
long-term effects. President Blenda Wilson has been at CSUN only a short time. 
Her resume leads one to believe her main concern is public relations. Wilson is 
by past history a short-timer. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic department had no choice but to play lineman Jonathan Beauregard 
(who stands accused of two counts of attempted murder). The presence of 
Beauregard on the field should only embarrass himself, not the athletic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The players who walked out (of practice last week) are wrong, but their 
concerns about the football program always getting the short end of the stick 
are valid. How can football, which draws 2,000 to 3,000 people, be given 14 
scholarships, while women's volleyball, which may draw 100, gets 12? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the players who walked are constantly being jerked around by 
self-centered minority-student groups that won't care one bit about them once 
graduated. It's a shame these players don't have the character to stand up on 
their own two feet. They are certainly capable of it.

CHILDREN TO SEE CSUN'S HOUSE THIS TIME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: KIDS FROM SHRINE 
HOSPITAL WHERE THE MATADORS VISITED WILL ATTEND SCRIMMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge basketball team, a contingent which knows a thing or 
two about heartache and tragedy, will have some special guests in attendance 
for a scrimmage tonight at 7 against Race Express in the Northridge gym. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen children undergoing treatment at the Shrine Hospital in 
Hollywood will be returning a visit made last weekend by Northridge players to 
their rehabilitation facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors spent almost two hours with the children, talking, providing 
basketball tips, and entertaining the group with an impromptu slam-dunk contest 
and scrimmage on portable baskets set up on the roof of the three-story 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the best few hours I've spent in a while," said Peter Micelli, 
Northridge's 6-foot-8 center and the organizer of the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom McCollum, an assistant coach who made the trip along with 14 players, said 
the chatter and cheer provided by the Matadors echoed through the halls of the 
entire facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lobby of the place is like an atrium -- open-air," McCollum said. "Even 
downstairs you could here the kids cheering. The sound was resonating all 
around the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children are recent amputees and burn victims who have only 
partially completed reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough duty," McCollum said. "Some of those kids have gone through 
catastrophic things. But our guys neither blanched nor shied away. They seemed 
very comfortable and happy talking." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip helped provide perspective to a team which in recent years often has 
been struck by misfortune -- from a car accident that ended the career of one 
top recruit, to deaths among family members, to the confusion and inconvenience 
caused by January's earthquake that interrupted last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli, whose father died shortly after the earthquake, was initially shocked 
by the severity of the injuries to some of the children. However, he soon 
recognized the joy they were getting from his visit. "They were so 
appreciative, so happy we came to see them," Micelli said. "I think everybody 
is really happy we went." 
</P>
<P>
 Micelli planned the visit in response to a edict made by Coach Pete Cassidy 
over the summer that the basketball team become more involved in community 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 That mission accomplished, it's time for the Matadors to get down to business. 
The game against Race Express is the first of two scrimmages Northridge will 
play in preparation for its Nov. 26 opener against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, 8-18 last season, play host to the New Zealand National Team on 
Nov. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Race Express is a Daly City, Calif.-based team of former college players who 
tout themselves as the "scoring wizards of ahhhs." The club's motto: "We run 
and gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said he is approaching the scrimmages as "shakedown cruises." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see what we can do, see where we're at, and find out which five players 
play best together," he said.

WHERE WILSON GOES, GLENDALE WILL FOLLOW; CROSS-COUNTRY: VAQUERO RUNNERS MUST 
STAY CLOSE TO MOORPARK ACE FOR TEAM TO WIN STATE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 How well will the Glendale College men's cross-country team perform in the 
State junior college championships at Fresno's Woodward Park today? 
</P>
<P>
 It could depend on how high Moorpark's Jeff Wilson finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, formerly of Newbury Park High, is expected to contend for a top-five 
finish. Glendale Coach Eddie Lopez figures that if the Vaqueros' Nacho Delgado 
and Jacques Sallberg can stay within 20-25 seconds of Wilson, his team will 
stand an excellent chance of winning its first major division state title. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale won State small schools titles in 1974, '76 and '80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need two guys to run 20 minutes or faster (over the four-mile 
course)," Lopez said. "And we need our fifth man to be around 20:20. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is, we have to get out well. We can't get boxed in like we did at 
(the Johnie O Invitational on Oct. 29). I've been telling the guys all week 
that they have to come through the first mile in 4:40 to 4:45. They need to 
have Wilson in sight at the mile mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson ran conservatively for the first mile while winning six of seven races 
this season, but Moorpark Coach Manny Trevino says his charge plans to stick 
with the leaders from the start today before trying to make a move after 2 1/2 
miles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we owe it to him to do that," Trevino said. "He might sacrifice some 
places later in the race if the first mile is really fast, but I think he'll 
feel better about the race afterward if he runs to win instead of running to 
place in the top five." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm Gidabuday of Riverside, second in last year's meet, is a heavy 
favorite. The Tanzanian is undefeated against junior college competition this 
season and had a 27-second margin of victory over Moroccan teammate Abderrazak 
Merchoud in the Johnie O Invitational, a meet that serves as unofficial 
Southern California championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riverside deserves to be the favorite, but I think it's going to a close race 
between them, us, El Camino and (Mt. San Antonio College)," Lopez said. 
"They'll go 1-2, but what happens after that will determine who wins." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenyan Cosmos Nguku and Cruz Gallegos, a sophomore from Corona Centennial 
High, are capable of finishing in the top 10 for the Tigers, but their overall 
success will depend on where their fifth runner finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's between 50th and 60th, Coach Ted Banks figures Riverside has a good 
chance of winning its second title in four years. If he's 70th or worse, 
however, the Tigers' title hopes could be doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Riverside, Glendale's strength is depth. The Vaqueros' top five 
runners finished within 27 seconds of each other in winning the Western State 
Conference finals Nov. 8, and they will try to finish among the top 30 
individuals today. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark and Antelope Valley, led by Manuel Perales, will also be among the 28 
teams in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, paced by WSC champion Josephina Sanchez, is expected to be the top 
local team in the women's meet. 
</P>
<P>
 College of the Canyons will be led by Heidi Tisovic, Antelope Valley by Nicole 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale failed to qualify as a team, but the Vaqueros did advance three 
individuals, topped by Tanya Janet, runner-up in the WSC finals.

<P>
 Ten wrestlers from Moorpark College, which traditionally has one of the finest 
teams in the state, will participate Sunday in the Southern California regional 
tournament at Bakersfield College. 
</P>
<P>
 They will try to qualify for the state championships scheduled for Dec. 2-3 at 
Rio Hondo College in Whittier.The top eight individual finishers in each weight 
division advance to the state tournament, where the team champion is determined 
by the points garnered by individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the leading Moorpark wrestlers are John Jimenez at 134 pounds and Tim 
Bonebright at 142 pounds. Jimenez is 22-10 and Bonebright is 20-9. Others 
include Jeremy Pratt (14-9) at 167 pounds, Dan Burdis (14-9) at 177 pounds, 
Jason Lewis (13-9) at 190 pounds and Kyle Plummer (11-5) at 158 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (10-1-1) won the Western State Conference title with a 5-0 record 
for their 17th conference championship, all under Coach John Keever. They 
finished fifth in the state last year. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

VALLEY AND MOORPARK DO THEIR BIDDING; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: BOTH SCHOOLS SEEM 
HEADED FOR BOWLS, BUT CANNOT ACCEPT INVITATIONS UNTIL SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although neither school can officially accept a bid until Sunday, the day 
after the regular season ends, Valley College and Moorpark appear headed for 
bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley (8-1) is almost assured of playing Rancho Santiago in the Orange County 
Bowl at Orange Coast College and Moorpark (7-2) apparently will face Cerritos 
in the Strawberry Bowl at Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Those two games, and nine other junior college bowls throughout the state, 
will be held Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams end their Western State Conference seasons tonight. Valley, 4-1 in 
the Southern Division, plays host to Santa Monica and Moorpark, 4-0 in the 
Northern Division, is at home against Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Ferrero, Valley athletic director, said the Monarchs have been 
approached by the organizers of the Orange County Bowl but the final decision 
cannot be made until Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 He said the invitation also possibly hinges on whether Valley defeats the 
Corsairs (5-4) tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 He speculated that a Monarch loss might send the bowl committee looking for a 
team with a better record. But the Monarchs are one of nine teams in the state 
going into games today with eight or nine victories. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keever, Moorpark athletic director, said the Raiders are practically 
guaranteed to play in a bowl for a seventh consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most likely, we'll be in it (Strawberry Bowl) no matter what happens (against 
Santa Barbara)," Keever said. 
</P>
<P>
 With Valley and Moorpark out of the picture, and Bakersfield (8-1) apparently 
prepared to accept an invitation to meet Long Beach City (9-1) in the Potato 
Bowl at Bakersfield, the task of playing host in the Western State Bowl would 
fall to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviva Kamin, Western State Conference commissioner, said Hancock (6-3) 
probably will be the conference representative in that game. In last year's 
game, Valley defeated Moorpark, 21-19.

L.A. BAPTIST'S SEASON LACKS ONLY THAT PERFECT ENDING; VOLLEYBALL: KNIGHTS PUT 
19-0 RECORD ON THE LINE IN SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION V FINAL AGAINST BRENTWOOD.

<P>
 From the beginning of the season, L.A. Baptist High Coach Sue Newcomb expected 
her girls' volleyball team to make the Southern Section Division V final. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't expect the Knights to have an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, second-seeded L.A. Baptist (19-0) will face by far its toughest test of 
the season against Brentwood at 1 p.m. today at Cypress College. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Brentwood (17-1) is defending Division V state champion and played 
a demanding schedule against several higher-division powers, including and 
Calvary Chapel, top-seeded in Division IV, and Harvard-Westlake. Brentwood's 
only loss was to La Mirada early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitters Kelly Gentile and Katherine Kuchenbecker, middle blocker Erin 
Hawkins and setter Sarah Neal lead the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside hitter Darcie Frazier has 94 kills over 14 games in four playoff 
matches for L.A. Baptist, many on passes from setter Tundo Hrotko.

FRANKLIN THE FINAL ROADBLOCK IN SYLMAR'S 3-A TITLE QUEST; GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL: 
ABSENCE OF VAN NUYS HAS HELPED SPARTANS ADVANCE TO CITY FINAL.

<P>
 When Van Nuys High successfully appealed to the City Section to move its 
girls' volleyball team from the 3-A to the 4-A division for the playoffs, 
Valley Pac-8 Conference rival Sylmar became an unlikely benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys won the last two 3-A championships and would have been an 
overwhelming favorite to win a third, but the switch has enabled second-seeded 
Sylmar to reach the 3-A City finals for the first time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans will face top-seeded Franklin (16-0) at Occidental College today 
at 6:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were in (Van Nuys Coach) Dave Bessler's shoes I probably would have done 
the same thing," Sylmar Coach Bob Thomson said. "His girls really wanted the 
chance at the 4-A and the state tournament. But it did open the door for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (15-1) advanced to the final with a four-game victory over Canoga Park 
on Tuesday. The Spartans have won 10 matches in a row since being swept last 
month by Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans are led by outside hitter Mayra Ariza and middle blocker Deanna 
Turner.

ONLY PALISADES STANDS IN WAY OF CHATSWORTH; GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL: CHANCELLORS FACE 
DAUNTING CHALLENGE IN CITY 4-A FINAL AGAINST PERENNIAL POWER.

<P>
 The Chatsworth High girls' volleyball team should be able to handle the 
pressure of playing for the City Section 4-A championship tonight against 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 The players say they have already played under championship-type intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Chancellors (11-4) defeated Van Nuys, 16-14, 15-10, 15-12, in 
the second round of the playoffs. Van Nuys was undefeated entering the match, 
including a five-game victory over Chatsworth in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "That didn't feel like a second-round match, it felt like a championship 
match," outside hitter Jennifer Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth, seeded second, will face tougher conditions against the top-seeded 
Dolphins in the 8 p.m. match at Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades (14-1) is used to championship matches, having won the City title 
the last four seasons and 18 times in 20 years. The Dolphins' only loss was to 
Southern Section power Marlborough. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chatsworth will again have revenge as a motivating factor. Palisades 
defeated Chatsworth in four games in a preseason match. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth middle blocker Jennifer Hodges has been outstanding in the 
playoffs. She had 12 kills and 13 blocks against Van Nuys and had 10 kills and 
10 blocks in a semifinal sweep over San Pedro.

</P>
<P>
 With Mai, Dong and Bolden the only players with any varsity experience, 
Brodowski acknowledges this season might be a struggle for Bolsa Grande. But 
he's hoping it won't be as bad as last season. Unlike last year, though, the 
Matadors have some height with sophomore James at 6 feet and six others above 
5-7. There's also Mai, a shooting guard who averaged 8.2 points and is a 
three-year starter. Dong is also expected to help out at the guard position, 
where she is a two year starter. Brodowski is still cautious. As far as a 
silver lining, a few players coming up from the freshman (Petrie and Vito) and 
junior varsity teams (James, Tantardini and Fierro) might be factors. And 
there's also the return of Duong, who sat out her junior season. But Brodowski 
is a realist; he thinks Rancho Alamitos and Garden Grove will battle for first, 
and that La Quinta and Santiago will contend for the final playoff berth.

 "Transition year" seem to be the operative words for the Aztecs, who lost some 
of their bite--and size--to graduation and transfers. Linda Rodriguez's 
graduation will hurt the team. But more than that, the departure of last year's 
top player, Rhonda Gondringer, to Mater Dei will undoubtedly leave a big hole 
at guard and in team leadership. Also graduated is center Carrie Ogilvie, who 
transferred from Bethel Baptist last year. This season, the Aztecs have the 
dubious distinction of being one of the shortest teams in the county. And with 
no top returners to speak of, Tubbs is relying on Danyal and Shum to provide 
leadership and points. He's hoping for strong performances from players coming 
from the junior varsity. There might be some spark from freshman Rains at 
guard. But like any transition year, Tubbs realizes that you have to wait to 
see who rises to the top. In addition, if Tubbs can't find someone to play 
center, the Aztecs will be in for a long season. But make no mistake, the 
desire is there, Tubbs said. But lack of size, and a limited roster might be 
too much to overcome this year.

 Foster thinks that the key to a successful season lies in the Argonauts seven 
returning players. Some of the Argonauts' strength will come from junior 
varsity players--Moore and Boose--stepping up. Foster said Moore (6-2) will add 
strength inside and should be helpful on the boards. Foster is also hoping 
Shaw, who at guard averaged 10 points and was first-team all-league selection 
last season, will provide strong leadership and scoring. Patterson, who was a 
second-team all-league pick, will also contribute at forward, where she 
averaged seven points. Foster thinks the Argonauts could have a high-scoring 
offense, but whether anyone can fill the scoring hole left by the graduation of 
last year's ace, Michol Murray, remains to be seen. And though Foster 
acknowledges that Garden Grove might be a favorite this year, she is quick to 
point out that there are other good teams in the league, including Santiago and 
Pacifica. But unlike last season, when inexperience was a big factor, Foster is 
counting on experience and team unity.

 Bettencourt hopes he can bring a little stability to Pacifica. Last year, the 
team finished sixth after finishing as undefeated league champions in 1992-93. 
But there's hope for Bettencourt, who says the team has some good size and 
enough varsity experience to make the Mariners competitive. While first-team 
all-league selection Pilar Surch will be missed, Bettencourt hopes he'll get 
good performances from returning starters Kiyomura, Pawlowski, Jones and Green. 
He's also counting on Hupf, a transfer from Long Beach St. Anthony, who will 
probably play guard. Also expected to contribute is Pawlowski at forward and 
center and Gilley at guard. Though Bettencourt has only been with the team 
since October and has been busy preparing for the season, he still thinks he 
can develop the team's style and be ready for league play in January. 
Bettencourt thinks Garden Grove and Rancho Alamitos will be the teams to beat, 
but that the Mariners can keep up with the rest of the league. "The team has 
talent," Bettencourt said. "It now needs to develop the confidence and a belief 
that it can go to the playoffs."

 Attempting to win his fifth consecutive league title, Pyle is optimistic about 
this season despite not having any returning starters. With plenty of speed and 
strong outside shooting, Pyle is counting on Vickers and Howard to lead the way 
in points and leadership. Pyle thinks Lopez, a junior, is ready to step up a 
level and run the offense. He also looks at his nine-deep roster to be another 
contributing factor. With the junior varsity team finishing 14-0 last season, 
he's confident they will be able to fill the gap created by the nine graduated 
seniors. For the first time in seven years, Pyle said there does not appear to 
be a clear-cut league favorite or marquee player. Though he listed his team 
among the favorites, he thinks nearly every team has a chance for the league 
title. "We've had a lot of transfers in the league this year and that balances 
the league outlook," Pyle said.

 Loftis said the Lobos are strong in all areas of the game, and with some good 
players returning, he thinks the ingredients for a winning season are there. 
"Our main goal is to put Los Amigos on the map for working hard and never 
quitting," he said. "And if we get the wins, well, that's just icing on the 
cake." Back at guard is first-team, all-league selection Zavala, who averaged 
16 points and is being counted on as one of the team leaders. Also returning is 
Nguyen, a good shooting guard. Loftis says because there doesn't seem to be one 
dominate team in league this season, it might be a good year for Los Amigos to 
make a statement. But the coach knows if any gain is to be made, it will 
require hard work and dedication. "Our success will depend on how hard we work 
and our attitude on and off the court," Loftis said. "For us, every team and 
every game will be a big game."
