O.C. THEATER REVIEW; 'RAISIN IN SUN' ENLIGHTENS BUT LOSES SUBTLE SHADINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Lorraine Hansberry's "A Raisin in the Sun" did not win the Tony Award for best 
play when it premiered on Broadway in 1959. It wasn't an easy year to win a 
Tony. Tennessee Williams' "Sweet Bird of Youth" couldn't even get nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers also had some stiff competition. Sidney Poitier, who had returned 
from Hollywood to star in Hansberry's play, was up for best actor against Jason 
Robards Jr. (in Lillian Hellman's "Toys in the Attic") and George C. Scott (in 
Saul Levitt's "The Andersonville Trial"). All three lost to Melvyn Douglas (in 
Gore Vidal's "The Best Man"). 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia McNeil, who co-starred with Poitier, was up for best actress against 
Irene Worth and Maureen Stapleton (both in "Toys") and Geraldine Page (in 
"Sweet Bird"). All three lost to Anne Bancroft (in William Gibson's "The 
Miracle Worker"). 
</P>
<P>
 And what won for best play? Gibson's famous tear-jerker about Helen Keller, of 
course, over the Hansberry, Hellman and Vidal plays and Paddy Chayefksy's "The 
Tenth Man." Now, more than three decades later, ask yourself: When's the last 
time you saw a revival of "The Best Man" or "The Tenth Man" or "Toys in the 
Attic"? Probably never. 
</P>
<P>
 Even "A Raisin in the Sun," which has become the stuff of both social history 
and theatrical legend, isn't revived very often. It sometimes takes a special 
event to stir new interest in it: a musical remake ("Raisin," which did win the 
Tony in 1974), or a commemorative staging on a major anniversary of the 
original or a "definitive" restoration using scenes and dialogue that Hansberry 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The stimulus for the amateur Alternative Repertory Theatre's storefront 
production was twofold: nationally designated Black History Month (February) 
and A.R.T.'s idea at the outset of its season to offer a full schedule of work 
by women playwrights. So, for the sake of a worthy cause and a noble effort -- 
and just in case you need an intimate reminder of the play -- you might 
consider catching this production. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raisin" lays out the story of the Youngers, a poor black family living on 
Chicago's South Side in a ghetto "rat trap," as matriarch Lena describes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the family has a dream. Lena wants to move out and buy a home in a 
decent neighborhood. Son Walter Lee, who works as a white man's chauffeur, 
wants to be his own boss and get rich by investing in a liquor store. Daughter 
Beneatha, a college student, wants to go to medical school. Daughter-in-law 
Ruth (Walter's wife) just wants to keep her marriage together. 
</P>
<P>
 All their hopes are hinged to the imminent arrival of a $10,000 check for 
Lena, the payout of her recently deceased husband's life insurance policy. But 
when the money comes, the dreams are not so easily realized. Conflicts arise, 
largely between Walter and Lena but also among the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Lena abhors the notion of Walter opening a liquor store, hardly the sort of 
business investment that matches her Christian values. She also hates Walter's 
grandiose belief in money itself. "Once upon a time freedom used to be life -- 
now it's money," she says in rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
 But their conflict goes beyond money. Walter feels trapped psychologically. He 
lashes out at the matriarchy of wife, mother and sister, as though it is the 
root cause of disenfranchised black manhood. "We are a group of men tied to a 
race of women with small minds," he says with vicious contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 What raises Hansberry's play above ordinary kitchen-sink drama is its unusual 
evocation of the American dream. All the social forces of the '50s -- and even 
some of the nascent ones of the '60s and '70s -- seem to converge on this one 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 In the play's climax, moreover, Hansberry addresses the overriding issue of 
racism, which has become more pressing than ever. She shows the transformation 
of Walter's self-hatred into dignity and racial pride. And though the play has 
flaws as art (chiefly cliches and minor stock characters), it remains a 
triumphant example of the theater's power to educate. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The A.R.T. production begins with great promise. But apart from Robyn 
Hastings, whose portrayal of Ruth always has a persuasive texture, the cast 
tends to give increasingly monochromatic performances as the play unwinds. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Lee Wilson Jr. shows flashes of skill in an energetic depiction of Walter. 
But Jacquelyn Levy plays Lena in a phlegmatic style that seems no more than 
serviceable, and Stefanie Williamson gives Beneatha a childish whine that 
grates. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, Barbara Covington's direction keeps things moving at a reasonable 
clip; even with two intermissions, the production does not seem overlong. 
Technically, the show also works well. Setting, costumes and sound design all 
have the proper touches.

MOVIE REVIEW; POIGNANT 'SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA'; THE CANNES WINNER UNDERSCORES 
THE DECORUM OF PREWAR VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Scent of Green Papaya," a film as delicate and evocative as its name, 
recognizes that out of illusion can come reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Though its re-creation of the streets and houses of prewar Vietnam is 
ravishing, "Papaya" (selected theaters) was shot exclusively on a sound stage 
outside of Paris. And though its actors are all Vietnamese, almost every one 
had been tainted by French culture and had to be freshly tutored in the 
graceful gestures and body language of their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet so well did all of this artifice succeed that "Papaya" managed a number of 
remarkable firsts. It won the prestigious Camera d'Or at Cannes as best first 
feature for its writer-director Tran Anh Hung, is Vietnam's first official 
submission for the best foreign language Oscar and is the first film to present 
a look from the inside at a culture and a sensibility we think we know but 
don't, that of the once-divided country that was simultaneously our enemy and 
our friend. 
</P>
<P>
 And though there is no lack of incident or emotion in "Papaya," it is 
primarily a fable-like memory film, an idealized tribute to the spirit of 
Vietnam's beautiful prewar days and the concern with textures, colors, tastes 
and smells that made the simple acts of everyday life into a complete aesthetic 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolizing the tranquil, unhurried pace of Vietnam past is Mui, first 
glimpsed as a 10-year-old girl (Lu Man San) arriving in Saigon in 1951 to 
become a servant for a well-to-do family. Innocent but curious and 
hard-working, with a surprisingly broad and cheery smile, Mui stands for the 
grace and beauty invested in ordinary things by a culture where women did the 
meaningful work but were constrained to remain in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 Two kinds of knowledge come to Mui as she quietly works, and what turns out to 
have lasting value are not the behind-closed-doors secrets of her employers but 
an understanding of what it means to perform ordinary tasks (like the preparing 
of unripe papaya as a breakfast vegetable) with delicacy and grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Mui's mistress (Truong Thi Loc) not only runs the house but also the family 
cloth business, while her husband (Tran Ngoc Trung), distraught over the death 
of their daughter, rarely leaves the house and mostly ignores his two youngest 
sons. His own mother, a premature widow, rarely even leaves the second floor, 
much to the concern of Mr. Thuan (Nguyen Van Oanh), a discreet elderly admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the points of Tran Anh Hung's film is to underline this discretion, the 
decorum and restraint that was the rule in most strata of Vietnamese society, 
qualities that have become natural to Mui by the time the film jumps forward 10 
years and becomes something of a Cinderella story. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a beautiful young woman (played by Tran Nu Yen-Khe), Mui finds herself 
working for Khuyen (Vuong Hoa Hoi), a wealthy classical composer and friend of 
her original family, a young man she has felt an attraction toward from the 
beginning. Still, she goes on as before, smiling and preparing savory 
Vietnamese dishes that cinematographer Benoit Delhomme photographs as if they 
were clusters of diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 It really can't be overemphasized how exquisite everything is in "The Scent of 
Green Papaya," not only the food, but also the vases and screens that decorate 
the houses, even a drop of sap dripping onto a thick green leaf. Just as the 
film's story is a series of small incidents that build almost imperceptibly to 
a dramatic climax, so it is visually, as all the careful, unhurried shots of 
domestic rituals and objects end up supplying an unexpected quiet sensuality to 
Mui's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Tran Anh Hung, who was 12 when his family moved to France in 1975, 
attempted to shoot in Saigon, but logistical difficulties made Paris 
inevitable. Even though Nguyen Anh Hoa, who plays the old servant woman, had to 
be brought over from Vietnam to tutor the mostly amateur cast in correct 
behavior, the director's sureness of vision and remarkable control of the 
medium ensured that his native country's singular way of seeing the world would 
be done justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes it all the more unsettling, as the roar of a presumably military 
jet reminds us near the end, that the time was not far off when this most 
delicate civilization would be crushed to dust in a ruinous war. In addition to 
everything else it does, "The Scent of Green Papaya" is intended as a cultural 
memorial, and a fine and poignant one it turns out to be.

 The San Juan Capistrano Regional Library on Monday announced a gift of $1,000 
from the Newport Beach-based Fieldstone Foundation in support of the library's 
threatened Multicultural Performing and Visual Arts Series. Having lost county 
underwriting of the series of Saturday night jazz and ethnic performances, the 
library has turned to the public, which has responded with enough money -- 
$27,911.20 so far -- to keep things going through this year. "We're here to 
fill a cultural niche, and that's what we're going to continue to do," said 
librarian Jose Aponte, the series coordinator.

MUSIC REVIEWS; HOLZMAIR LIVES UP TO BILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before his Los Angeles debut Monday at the University Synagogue in Brentwood, 
Austrian baritone Wolfgang Holzmair had been heralded as a major talent in San 
Francisco, where he sang in the Brahms Requiem in September, and in his U.S. 
debut in a New York recital at the Frick Museum last January. 
</P>
<P>
 The tall, handsome Austrian, who is in his early 40s, amply confirmed that 
impression in offering a youthful and virile -- and uninterrupted -- 
interpretation of Schubert's "Die Schone Mullerin." 
</P>
<P>
 The voice showed strength, vibrancy, flexibility and focus. There was evenness 
of warm tone throughout the range and at all dynamic levels, and while it was 
not always deeply nuanced, his interpretation of character and text usually 
proved intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
 The progress from exuberant youthfulness to final catastrophe was carefully 
calibrated, although Holzmair may have misjudged his own power in his harsh, 
vigorous projection of jealousy and anger in "Der Jager" and "Eifersucht und 
Stolz." 
</P>
<P>
 But his restraint in the ensuing "Trockne Blumen," the lovely, differently 
lighter voices in "Der Muller and der Bach" and the gentle benediction of the 
closing "Des Baches Wiegenlied" made generous amends. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a muddy-sounding Steinway, pianist Thomas Palm generally provided 
Holzmair with sensitive and supportive accompaniment. CHRIS PASLES

MUSIC REVIEWS; HARRIS AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soprano Brenda Harris, who sang Monday night in Ambassador Auditorium's Gold 
Medal Series, is clearly a gifted young talent. 
</P>
<P>
 She owns an amply weighted and powerful voice, fluent and clear from top to 
bottom.Her rich and pure upper register can sustain the softest, floating 
pianissimo or tormented forte. There are yet some rough spots in her technique 
-- an unevenness of tone, a labored trill -- but, generally, she has the 
makings of a first-rate opera singer. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not a particularly resourceful singer, however, and her recital tended 
to lay this bare. Harris, who comes to us with considerable operatic experience 
(at the Minnesota Opera, Washington Opera and Opera Pacific, among others), 
proved not to be an especially compelling recitalist. 
</P>
<P>
 She was at her best where vocal fortitude and/or virtuosity could carry the 
burden. She twittered brightly through the coloratura bravura of Rossini's 
"D'amor al dolce impero" and projected forcefully and daintily in Verdi's "Ad 
una stella." 
</P>
<P>
 Songs such as Ravel's "Piece en forme de Habanera" and Berlioz's "Villanelle," 
however, revealed a lack of musical subtlety or feeling for elegant line. Her 
juxtaposition of Brahms' simple, unaccompanied Ophelia settings with Strauss' 
more acerbic and urbane ones was a good idea, but her straightforward accounts 
tended to obscure their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of an engrossing musicality -- as opposed to vocal gifts -- her 
play-acting seemed a distraction. A more stylish and purposeful accompaniment 
than that provided by Elizabeth Hastings would have been, no doubt, a great 
help. Things being as they were, she needed more works such as Handel's showy 
"alma mia," where her voice simply conquered, and fewer like Weill's "One Life 
to Live" and Debussy's "Mandoline," where grace and nuance are the key. TIMOTHY

TV RATINGS; SUPER BOWL GIVES NBC SOMETHING TO BRAG ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MARGULIES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NBC, running third in the prime-time ratings all season, finally got to crow 
Tuesday about being No. 1, thanks to the highest-rated Super Bowl telecast in 
seven years. The NFL championship game attracted two-thirds of the people 
watching TV during that period Sunday and sent NBC's weekly ratings average 
through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 For the season as a whole, however, the network continues to trail CBS and 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co., the Super Bowl 
XXVIII victory by Dallas over the Buffalo Bills--led by running back Emmitt 
Smith and quarterback Troy Aikman--attracted the largest audience in history 
for a commercially sponsored broadcast, more than 134 million people. The 
reason the telecast could reach more viewers than previous games without 
necessarily having a higher rating is that as the U.S. population grows, the 
number of homes represented by a rating point increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "The Critic" premiered to big numbers on ABC last week. The 
animated series about a frumpy movie critic won its time period Wednesday night 
and ranked No. 16 among the week's 92 prime-time network programs. Southland

ROBIN ABCARIAN: OF COURSE JURIES ARE CONFUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It may be too early to write the history of the early 1990s, but I wouldn't be 
surprised if this time comes to be known as the "The Era of Confounding 
Juries." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, two Los Angeles juries could not agree on what crimes Erik and 
Lyle Menendez committed -- first-degree murder? second degree? voluntary or 
involuntary manslaughter? -- when they killed their parents. The defense 
contended that a long history of abuse by the parents led to the shotgun 
killings, while prosecutors contended that the brothers acted out of hatred and 
greed. 
</P>
<P>
 And a Virginia jury deemed Lorena Bobbitt, who cut off her husband's penis, 
not guilty of any crime by reason of temporary insanity because of years of 
abuse. What's more, another jury in an earlier trial found her husband not 
guilty of raping her on the night she grabbed the knife. 
</P>
<P>
 These are two cases in which the victimization of the defendants was presented 
as a defense for extremely violent behavior. And although I think most people 
agree that such issues must be considered in the courtroom, the notion that 
juries have lately extended too much sympathy toward defendants is under 
discussion almost anywhere you go: on talk radio, on newspaper Op-Ed pages, at 
dinner parties. 
</P>
<P>
 We're confused -- about the jury process, about family violence, about how to 
weigh claims of abuse against crimes committed. 
</P>
<P>
 So why shouldn't juries be confused as well? 
</P>
<P>
 They are, after all, only a reflection of society. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only been in recent years that battered women and children have been able 
to successfully defend themselves against murder raps by showing that killing 
an abuser -- usually a husband or father -- was perceived as the only way to 
avoid sure death. 
</P>
<P>
 We know so much more about abuse than we used to, so much more about the cycle 
of violence, so much more about why the abused take the law into their own 
hands to end it. These days, you might think only an ignoramus would ask why a 
battered woman doesn't just leave .  
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is, you hear the question asked all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 And we wonder why juries are mixed up? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, there may be a limit to society's compassion for victims who 
attack their abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 This worries Denver psychologist Lenore Walker, a pioneer of the Battered 
Woman Syndrome defense, who is often called to testify on behalf of women who 
kill their abusive partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is part of me that is very pleased that the issue of abuse against 
women and children is now being understood better by the general public because 
of the media's fascination with these cases," she said. "On the other hand, I 
am worried about backlash because many people say, 'Well, victims are getting 
away with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Letting victims off the hook, she says, has never been the intent of 
introducing abuse as a mitigating factor in a violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intention when I introduce this (kind of) testimony is to allow the 
context within which a criminal act was committed to be fully understood by a 
jury -- and then the jury makes up its mind," Walker said. "I have always felt 
it was not justice to only give part of the story. For women and children, the 
context is something the legal system has often discounted and invalidated. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our country, one of the things we like to do is personalize gore and 
violence," she said. "We learn about abuse through people's tales. That is, of 
course, what happened in the Menendez and the Bobbitt cases, and I predict it 
is going to happen in Tonya Harding's case." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, who has studied hundreds of battered women, thinks ice skater Tonya 
Harding, whose domestic disputes have been chronicled in police reports, could 
easily fit the profile of a battered woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can conceptualize her as a woman who is being battered by her husband and 
(the attack on Kerrigan) was his attempt (to control Harding). It was not just 
Kerrigan's leg being smashed. I can just hear a batterer saying to Tonya 
Harding, 'If you don't do what I say I will smash your legs or your knees.' 
Maybe it was a warning to her." 
</P>
<P>
 This is either an excellent insight or a ridiculous leap. Such is the burden 
we lay at the feet of juries. 
</P>

 Twenty years ago, I was a freshman at the University of California when a 
young newspaper heiress who lived a few blocks away was kidnaped by terrorists. 
The whole episode seemed unreal -- and until a deadly shootout in Los Angeles 
-- the terrorists like a dangerous joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old kidnaping victim, christened "Tania" by her captors, was 
blindfolded, kept in a closet for almost two months and then was dramatically 
photographed in guerrilla garb, toting a gun during the robbery of a San 
Francisco bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, as we spoke about the Menendez case at lunch, a friend asked if I 
didn't find it amazing that Patty Hearst was convicted and sentenced to seven 
years in prison. Hearst's claim that she was brainwashed by the Symbionese 
Liberation Army didn't sway her jury, although President Jimmy Carter commuted 
the rest of her sentence after she served nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I feel guilty?" she told an interviewer in 1988. "They kidnaped 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to imagine a jury convicting Hearst of anything today. 
</P>
<P>
 And easy to imagine a confounded public's distress.

 Quakes we have known: Marie Harvey -- "Mom" to your Only in L.A. columnist -- 
has withstood the big Southern California quakes of 1933, 1952, 1971, 1987, 
1991, 1992 and 1994. And she narrowly missed a couple of out-of-town jolts on a 
1925 family automobile outing that could have inspired the movie "National 
Lampoon's Vacation."

 En route to Montana, she and her father and her brother passed through Santa 
Barbara a few days before a 6.3 quake flattened that city.

 Then, outside the little town of Coyote near San Jose, their car had a head-on 
collision. No one was injured but, by coincidence, she had been suffering a 
nosebleed at the time. "The little girl has blood on her face!" an onlooker 
screamed. 
</P>

 It took a week to repair the car. The family set out again, only to hear that 
a 6-plus-magnitude earthquake had struck Montana. Her father could take a hint 
or three.

 Commemorative condom: A nationwide chain of condom boutiques has introduced

President Adam Glickman said the historic condom was developed partly because 
"the people of Los Angeles need something to laugh about." All proceeds, he 
added, will be given to the Red Cross, which hopefully can purchase some

LEGISLATURE KNIFES GUN CONTROL IN THE BACK; BOMBAST ON "THREE STRIKES"; 
WIMPINESS ON KATZ BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bill was endorsed by no less than California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 By Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
 By L.A. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 By the California Police Chiefs' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 By the California State Sheriffs' Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 By the Professional Peace Officers Assn. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 By the California Assn. of Highway Patrolmen. 
</P>
<P>
 And the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would have made it easier for authorities to prevent crime and to 
crack down on convicted criminals. It would have raised penalties and resulted 
in more prison time for more criminals. Passage should have been a no-brainer. 
But Monday, the state Assembly, in another dispiriting victory for the gun 
lobby, defeated the legislation in a 34-40 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 1105, sponsored by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), was simple: It 
would have increased the maximum penalty for illegally carrying a concealed gun 
to close to the maximum penalty for illegally carrying a concealed knife. 
Although not all gun control measures are, in practice, crime control measures, 
AB 1105 clearly was. Why, after all, would someone illegally carry a concealed 
firearm unless that person contemplated using it illegally? 
</P>
<P>
 To add insult to injury, the same day the Assembly buried Katz's bill, it 
passed, with blinding speed, no less than five measures aimed at locking up 
habitual criminals for life, sending those so-called "three strikes and you're 
out" bills on to the Senate and what looks like legislative passage. 
</P>
<P>
 There is perhaps no clearer picture of California's -- and indeed the nation's 
-- backward response to the escalation of violent crime than that offered 
Monday by the Assembly, where a gaggle of lawmakers outdid one another with 
ever-tougher proposals to lock up repeat criminals and throw away the key -- 
while at the same time defeating a measure that actually could have prevented 
some of those crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 Legislators, law enforcement officers and an overwhelming number of private 
citizens rightly are frustrated over the revolving door in the state's 
overcrowded prison system, a door that sometimes allows violent criminals back 
onto the street well before they complete their prison sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 We share that frustration; we support the impulse behind these proposals. 
However, we are concerned about unintended effects: the cost of building new 
prisons to house these offenders, the cost of maintaining a large population of 
prisoners until they die and the question of appropriateness in, say, 
imprisoning a nonviolent, three-time-loser drug dealer for life but not a 
first-time murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't deterring criminals from committing their initial -- let alone repeat 
-- offenses make more sense? Illegal possession of a concealed gun is currently 
a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail. Katz's legislation would have 
permitted the filing of felony charges in such cases; conviction would have 
been punishable by up to three years in state prison.  
</P>
<P>
 Summary defeat of this measure by a Legislature that regards itself as now 
focused on gun crime as never before is, to quote Assemblyman Katz, "pathetic." 
And disgraceful.

RECOVERY WATCH; ALL TOO MOBILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mobile home has become a major category of housing in the United States. 
Born as vacation housing and later popular as retirement housing, the mobile 
home now is permanent housing for millions of Americans.In California, with its 
mild climate, the percentage of mobile homes among single-family dwellings 
always has been large. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, earthquake is as permanent a part of California life as 
sunshine, and mobile homes are particularly vulnerable in a temblor. A classic 
trailer, ready to roll down the road behind an automobile, may just bounce on 
its tires in a quake. Ironically, the larger, stationary, "double-wide" mobile 
homes are considered more vulnerable. Their floors are supported by I-beams 
that rest on simple tripods. In an earthquake, those beams can hop off the 
tripods, causing tens of thousands of dollars' damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Technical fixes for this problem are available both at the manufacturing stage 
and, for the mobile home owner, at the retrofit stage. Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan was right when he said during a visit to a quake-damaged mobile 
home park, "Most of this could have been avoided with some common-sense 
measures." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the available measures is modest when amortized over the life of a 
mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 We urge the Golden State Mobile Home Owners League, the manufactured-housing 
industry and the state Department of Housing and Community Development to 
formulate and implement a common set of remedies for this eminently solvable 
problem.

THE VALIANT EFFORT AT CSUN; EDUCATIONAL GEM STRUGGLES TO SHAKE LOOSE FROM QUAKE 
DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California college campuses are exempt from earthquake safety standards, a 
fact that allows college officials to keep using dozens of old, sometimes 
historic buildings like UCLA's Royce Hall. That policy is sure to be 
reconsidered in light of the damage that the Jan. 17 Northridge quake inflicted 
on several colleges, particularly the California State University campus 
nearest the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, whatever else California's leaders decide to do about college 
earthquake safety, a primary order of business must be to get Cal State 
Northridge rebuilt and back in full operation. This is vitally important not 
just to the San Fernando Valley but all of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of CSUN -- where the start of the spring semester has been delayed 
because of the quake -- estimate damage at between $250 million and $350 
million, the heaviest loss on any Cal State campus in the system's history. 
Virtually all of the 53 buildings were damaged; even some relatively new 
structures will have to be razed. Still, CSUN officials are making a valiant 
effort to resume classes by Feb. 14, ordering about 300 modular buildings for 
use as classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, before any decision to rebuild is made, a detailed analysis of the 
stability of the ground beneath CSUN must be done. If it is deemed unwise to 
rebuild in Northridge, another site in the Valley, or close to it, must be 
used. Most of CSUN's 25,000 students come from the Valley or nearby, as do most 
of its 2,000 employees. Moving CSUN to a distant site would be another economic 
and psychological blow to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it lacks the visibility of older, better-known schools like UCLA and 
USC, CSUN is cherished as a regional gem by Valley residents and alumni. The 
Northridge quake has only deepened their appreciation of a campus that now is 
gasping for breath as the damage grows with every aftershock. CSUN must not be 
allowed to die.

KEEP LEAVING, DON'T STOP; MARINES SHOOT BACK AS MARCH 31 PULLOUT DATE DRAWS 
CLOSER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Marines' clash with Somalis on Monday reveals anew the shape of the chaos 
that will imperil the East African nation after the United States' deadline for 
withdrawal of its troops. Renewed civil war, though not unavoidable, is likely 
as the clans vie again to lead what remains of their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the U.S. pullout must proceed apace. President Clinton announced the 
March 31 deadline last October after 18 Americans were killed in Somalia and 
U.S. troops became the target of intense hostility there. The early warning 
gave Somali leaders time to negotiate a lasting peace. They tried, sort of, but 
peace remains elusive, as the latest violence shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace talks -- sponsored by the United Nations with the help of the leaders of 
neighboring Ethiopia and Eritrea -- have led to an unstable cease-fire and a 
limited peace agreement negotiated in Mogadishu by clan elders. Sporadic 
hostilities among the factions continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Intensified fighting inevitably would mean the return of banditry and the 
fight for scarce resources. A new round of civil war would also cripple the 
physical rebuilding. It's a little known fact that the presence of U.N. 
peacekeepers has kept violence from interrupting the reconstruction of many 
roads and the repair of public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the American departure and the ongoing exodus of Europeans will 
severely hamper the U.N. peacekeeping effort; U.N. troop strength is expected 
to drop from 25,000 to about 15,000. Weakness in the U.N. operation surely will 
allow Somali clan leaders to regain control in some areas. However, the West 
cannot be expected to risk the lives of its military personnel forever in order 
to police Somalia. The Americans, who went in after 350,000 Somalis died, never 
intended to stay permanently. Washington is right to insist that Somalis 
determine what happens to Somalia next.

 * I disagree with the suggestion by some that a monetary settlement by Michael 
Jackson is the same as an admission of guilt (Jan. 25). What does a settlement 
say about the boy and his family? If the allegations were true and sexual 
molestation really did occur, as a parent, no amount of money would be enough 
to silence me.A financial settlement of any amount should be viewed as 
indicative of Michael Jackson's innocence.

 * We may never know if Jackson is guilty of child molestation, but what 
disturbs me the most is the apparent lack of interest by the father in pursuing 
criminal charges and his obsession with civil litigation. He seems to have the 
attitude that everything has a monetary price, including his son's innocence. I 
don't know who's worse, a person who would molest a child, or a parent who 
sells his son to a child molester.

But without question, the parents of those boys are guilty of contributing to 
the delinquency of a minor and they should be held accountable and thus 
prosecuted.

<P>
 Parents who willing and knowingly allow such a relationship between a 
35-year-old man and their young son are largely responsible for the 
consequences of the relationship.

 When are we going to place responsibility where and on whom it belongs?

DMV HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A recent 4-3 decision by the California Supreme Court represents another 
step toward the police state which the majority (Justices Armand Arabian, 
Malcolm Lucas, Marvin Baxter and Ronald George) endorses. Justices Joyce 
Kennard, Edward Panelli and Stanley Mosk dissented from a shocking decision 
which grants to Department of Motor Vehicles bureaucrats greater power to make 
legal decisions than the judges of our trial courts. 
</P>
<P>
 When a person is arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol, 
the privilege to operate a motor vehicle is suspended by the DMV effective 30 
days after the arrest. This administrative action is separate and apart from 
the consequences of criminal prosecution in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist has a right to request a hearing at the DMV to challenge, among 
other things, whether the peace officer has legal cause to effect a detention. 
The motorist can also ask a judge to determine the legality of the detention in 
the criminal proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has had the misfortune of participating in a DMV hearing knows the 
futility of that process. The DMV employees who conduct the hearings present 
themselves as advocates for the police, lack any semblance of objectivity, 
treat motorists with sarcasm and inevitably rubber-stamp the police officer's 
action. They do not recognize fundamental principles of due process of law. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gikas vs. Zolin, the 4-3 majority of the court decided that a judge's 
determination in the criminal prosecution that a motorist had been illegally 
arrested can be ignored by the DMV hearing officers, who are free to make a 
contrary determination. Once again, the men appointed to the Supreme Court by 
Govs. George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson have demonstrated that the ends justify 
the means. Removing impaired drivers from the highways is a laudable societal 
goal, but we continue to pay a heavy price in the erosion of the constitutional 
protections against arbitrary action by government employees.

POST-QUAKE COMMUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for "Shaking Up the Way We Work" (Jan. 22). Prior to the 
devastating quake on Jan. 17, only 10% of full-time employees said their 
employer offered an opportunity to telecommute -- to work at home or at a 
nearby facility -- on a part-time basis. 
</P>
<P>
 We join Mayor Richard Riordan's plea to large employers to institute the 
creative measures that made traffic nonexistent during the 1984 Olympics. Old 
commuting habits must change. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to a popular misconception, telecommuting does not necessarily 
require sophisticated computer and communications technology to be quickly 
implemented. Aspects of almost all jobs are "telecommutable." Examples of tasks 
include writing, designing, drafting, editing, data processing, planning, 
reading and telephoning.  
</P>
<P>
 Commuter Transportation Services and the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District have created technical assistance teams to help employers set up 
telecommuting and variable work-hour programs. These services are offered free 
of charge. These strategies can deliver immediate benefits to employers for 
disaster recovery, to employees living in earthquake impacted areas, and to the 
community through less severe traffic congestion in areas of freeway collapse.

 * Conrad's cartoon (Jan. 26) depicting a demolished freeway with a graffiti 
message from the Pacific Red Car ("We told you so!") surfaced in me, and I'm 
sure in Angelenos who have been around for more than 40 years, the frustration 
we experienced when GM and Standard Oil made a "deal" with Los Angeles to get 
rid of the most efficient mass transit system in the world for its time and 
replace it with buses. As a result, Los Angeles is practically the only major 
metropolitan area without a minimal rapid transit system in place. Even the 
poorest of Third World countries are more advanced than we are in this regard! 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God we are finally getting the light! The Red, Green, and Blue lines are 
all a step in the right direction! Mayor Riordan's insistence that the Alameda 
freight corridor be built finally has the "green light" after ridiculous and 
prolonged politicking. The Metro Rail . . . well, it ain't so bad after all, 
plus two hours closer to work (and cheaper to operate than a car!). 
</P>
<P>
 The worst disaster in the U.S. may just prompt us to "get L.A. moving again" 
-- this time efficiently! I congratulate those leaders whose vision is 
translated into action, and who are intelligent enough to turn our mistakes of 
the past into opportunities for the future.

important role the state is playing in these recovery efforts.

 In the area of transportation, the one in which I am most familiar, Caltrans 
and its contractors were working to clear earthquake damage within hours of the 
quake. Within 24 hours crews were at work at every road closure.  
</P>
<P>
 Since I arrived in Los Angeles four hours after the initial temblor, I've 
observed the extraordinary efforts of the state's Office of Emergency Services, 
I've seen the governor make more than 200 portable classrooms available to 
quake-damaged schools, and I've seen hundreds of state workers volunteer to 
help their fellow citizens cut through the red tape and receive the assistance 
they require. 
</P>
<P>
 I sincerely appreciate the interest taken by the federal government. But while 
its contribution is primarily financial, it's California citizens and state 
departments like Caltrans and the Highway Patrol that are doing the "heavy 
lifting."

 * "An Attack in an Alley, and Then in the System" by Leonard Bustos 
(Commentary, Jan. 23) illustrates one of the reasons for the wide support for 
the voucher system: the gutless administrators who forget their responsibility 
to always take the fundamental, right action, even if not politically correct 
at the moment. They must teach, by their actions, that each person is 
responsible for his or her own misdeeds and will be punished accordingly.

 If the next school voucher proposition maintains the separation of church and 
state, I will now, for the first time, support and vote for it.

CLINTON SHOULD SHELVE MFN AS A WEAPON; CHINA: THE 'BULLY PULPIT' AND OTHER 
PRESSURE TACTICS WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE ON HUMAN RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDELL L. WILLKIE II, Wendell L. Willkie II was general counsel of the 
Department of Commerce in the Bush Administration. A visiting fellow at the 
American Enterprise Institute, he is the editor, with James R. Lilley, former 
U.S. ambassador to China, of Beyond MFN: Trade with China and American 
Interests, to be published in March by AEI Press. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The continuing denial of human rights in China, vividly described in a State 
Department report released in Washington on Tuesday, presents an increasingly 
serious dilemma for President Clinton. In the next few months, he must finally 
resolve the most important and most difficult question in America's relations 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential campaign, Bill Clinton denounced President Bush 
for "coddling tyrants in Beijing" because Bush refused to withdraw 
most-favored-nation status from China. Last May, Clinton issued an executive 
order threatening withdrawal of MFN in June, 1994, unless the last remaining 
communist power made "significant progress" in respecting human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Secretary of State Warren Christopher and senior Administration 
officials, the Chinese have so far failed America's human-rights test. Indeed, 
if the decision were made today, they say, the President would have no choice 
but to withdraw MFN. What would this mean? 
</P>
<P>
 It would mean, almost immediately, dramatically higher prices for 
cost-conscious consumers, who will be surprised to learn of billions of dollars 
of new import taxes on goods manufactured in China. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also mean Chinese government retaliation against numerous American 
firms now seeking access to the world's fastest-growing and third-largest 
economy. Billions of dollars in exports of aircraft, computers and other 
products could easily be lost to Japanese and European competitors, thus 
jeopardizing tens of thousands of high-tech American jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, China experts argue, withdrawing MFN would seriously harm the 
rapidly emerging private sector in China's coastal provinces. This emerging 
market economy vitally depends on exports and represents the greatest internal 
force for liberalization and personal freedom in Chinese society today. 
</P>
<P>
 However, aging reactionaries in Beijing will consider only modest, cosmetic 
human-rights gestures to keep MFN. Serious concessions that would pose a real 
challenge to their political authority are out of the question. Further, the 
Marxist old guard would seize upon MFN denial as justification for new 
repression at home and anti-American initiatives abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Clinton's advisers have painted him into a corner. If he now 
keeps MFN simply by pointing to the inevitable, purely cosmetic human-rights 
gestures in the months ahead, such as the release of a small fraction of 
China's political prisoners, he risks serious political embarrassment. A 
coalition of strange bedfellows -- liberals committed to human rights, labor 
unions threatened by cheap Chinese imports and anti-communist conservatives -- 
stand ready to condemn Clinton, as they did Bush, for caving in to dictators. 
Journalists and partisan critics will criticize him for reneging on yet another 
campaign promise. And foreign despots, following Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, may 
again perceive Uncle Sam to be "backing down." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton must now take command of this issue. Congressional Democrats 
used MFN effectively to embarrass President Bush for failing to express 
American outrage over the crackdown in Tian An Men Square. But it is sheer 
folly to believe that the threat of trade sanctions can force a tough-minded 
nationalist regime, governing an ancient, proud, enormous country lacking any 
democratic traditions, to give more than lip service to human rights. It is 
time to be honest and explicitly shelve a weapon that, if used, would only hurt 
the wrong parties. Brandished but unused, it only makes Clinton appear weak and 
hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when presidents demonstrate real leadership by explicitly 
changing their positions. President Clinton should announce that he will 
forcefully promote human rights through other, specific measures and sanctions. 
He should also employ the "bully pulpit," powerfully engaged by President 
Reagan, to condemn political repression. And, Clinton should use his great 
rhetorical skill to explain why he will not threaten to withdraw trade but 
rather fight aggressively to expand market opportunities in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The path to real freedom in China over time is through its extraordinary 
economic opening to the West. It is time for Bill Clinton to lead America, and 
the Chinese people, on that journey.

PERSPECTIVE ON EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS; IF THE NEXT ONE HITS AT RUSH HOUR . . . 
; HOSPITALS MAY BE FULL -- OR DESTROYED. WE NEED A PLAN FOR "MASH"-TYPE CENTERS 
TO DEAL WITH THOUSANDS OF EMERGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL SCHULTZ and KRISTI KOENIG, Dr. Carl Schultz is associate professor of 
emergency medicine at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. Dr. Kristi Koenig is

Oakland.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 57 dead, a few thousand injured, hundreds of them seriously enough to be 
hospitalized. Just four hospitals evacuated because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of one of the most destructive natural events to strike 
California in the 20th Century, it appears that once again we escaped 
catastrophe in the delivery of medical care. Proving the adage that "it's more 
important to be lucky than good," sufficient emergency medical care was 
provided despite the lack of a comprehensive medical disaster response plan. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not imply that those in the emergency medical services system are 
not doing their job. Quite the contrary, Los Angeles is blessed with an 
abundance of dedicated and skilled personnel. Rather, it is the assumption that 
hospitals should be the sole provider of "disaster medical care" that is 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there is only one medical disaster response plan: Take the injured 
to the hospital. But we know that there may be no hospital, or no way to get to 
it. Many people won't survive the 72-hour wait until sufficient help arrives 
from outside the area. We know that within six hours following an earthquake, 
people with serious but treatable medical problems will begin dying if they do 
not receive advanced care. If untreated, in 24 to 48 hours these potential 
survivors will perish.  
</P>
<P>
 This is exactly what will happen unless alternatives to traditional 
centralized care facilities are developed. 
</P>
<P>
 As can be seen in the Northridge quake, hospitals are vulnerable. A closer 
look at what happened illustrates how fortunate we were. On first inspection, 
the delivery of medical care seemed adequate. No one died waiting in line at 
emergency rooms. Patients with serious problems got prompt care. Damaged 
hospitals transferred their patients without serious incident. So why the 
concern? 
</P>
<P>
 If the upheaval had occurred instead at 4:30 p.m., the sheer volume of injured 
victims would have drastically increased. The freeways, parking structures, 
shopping centers and office buildings that collapsed would have been swarming 
with people. Many thousands would have been trapped and critically injured. 
Hundreds more would have less significant injuries requiring immediate care. 
</P>
<P>
 There wouldn't be nearly enough resources to handle patients already 
hospitalized -- who would have to be evacuated -- and the new quake victims. 
Delays would kill people. This wasn't the "Big One," but had it struck 12 hours 
later, it would have been big enough. 
</P>
<P>
 A practical solution is possible. Clearly, hospitals are crucial, but they 
must be supported by an additional form of medical response that can be 
activated within the first hour and function even if the hospitals are 
destroyed. Concerned emergency physicians have devised such a plan, relying on 
the pre-positioning of advanced medical equipment in community disaster 
medical-aid centers staffed by doctors and nurses trained in the 
"out-of-hospital" management of disaster victims. The money to implement the 
plan hasn't been found. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for putting stores of medical supplies in facilities most 
likely to survive earthquakes, such as fire stations and schools. Most of these 
structures are within an hour's walk of everyone, so they are accessible even 
if the transportation system fails. The supplies would be periodically 
exchanged with hospitals to prevent spoilage. Training for health-care 
providers is already available through a nonprofit corporation called Medical 
Disaster Response. 
</P>
<P>
 A disaster declaration would direct medical personnel not required at 
hospitals to the disaster centers. Patients with mild to moderate injuries and 
illnesses would be treated on location. Those seriously ill would be stabilized 
and, if hospitals are still functional, transferred there. If no hospital care 
is available, patients would be moved to predetermined "casualty collection 
points," and from there to facilities outside the disaster area. If the local 
hospital is intact, only the seriously injured are sent there. If it is not, 
valuable time is not wasted.  
</P>
<P>
 One city in the Los Angeles area, Santa Fe Springs, has already begun this 
strategy. It is divided into four areas, each having its own cache of 
equipment, to which citizens and trained personnel will report when disaster 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Our memory of this frightening event will begin to fade as the aftershocks 
diminish, but the threat remains. The state Department of Conservation predicts 
a magnitude 7.5 quake producing an estimated 100,000 casualties within our 
lifetimes. This time around, we dodged the bullet, but next time our luck may 
run out. Until a realistic disaster medical plan is in place, we remain at 
risk. One need not look too closely to see the emperor still has no clothes.

FOR CALIFORNIA, AN UNHEALTHY PLAN; RELYING ON MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SAVINGS HAS 
DIRE IMPLICATIONS FOR STATES WITH MANY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.

 President Clinton's health-care reform bill promises to revolutionize access 
to care for millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans. But the 
voluminous Health Security Act falls short of Clinton's promise of simple 
guidelines for health-care reform. It would take a task force of lawyers, 
insurance agents and management experts to explain the three major sections of 
the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without this cadre of experts, the weakness of this legislation is 
obvious. There is no solid financing mechanism to provide the array of health 
benefits. The enriched benefit package goes far beyond the benefits of most 
middle-class Americans who have insurance. The current employer-employee 
partnership of cost-sharing remains, but the bill requires coverage of all 
Americans. So where do the dollars for those millions who are uninsured and 
underinsured come from? Much of it is planned from Medicaid and Medicare cost 
savings. As reasonable as this may sound, it is hardly practical, given the 
current low rates of reimbursement, which often do not even cover costs. It 
also has dire implications for states such as California with large numbers of 
Medi-Cal (Medicaid) enrollees. If Medi-Cal rates of reimbursement are reduced 
or do not keep up with inflation, the cost-savings strategy from Medi-Cal could 
create enormous pressure not only on our state budget, but also on counties 
such as Los Angeles with large numbers of Medi-Cal enrollees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are additional funds generated from "sin" taxes on alcohol and 
cigarettes and a 1% tax on private-sector purchasing pools, or health 
alliances, these are decreasing sources of revenue. The latter tax should 
induce most companies to enroll their employees in regional alliances. The net 
winners would not be consumers, but large corporations that can shift their 
rising costs of health care to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major problem in the Clinton proposal is that consumer choices of 
providers will be curtailed. With the concentration of buying power through the 
health alliances, there will be a greater concentration of providers. This is 
because providers will have to assume all the risk of caring for their 
patients. Now, both providers and insurers share risk for health outcomes. But 
health alliances will assume no risk, forcing providers into larger delivery 
systems -- mega-HMOs. Over time, traditional fee-for-service providers will be 
eliminated. The net effect will be a decrease in consumer choice.  
</P>
<P>
 And, while the bill authorizes money to speed the coordination of 
community-based health systems into established health plans, it does not 
guarantee appropriation of funds. What if Congress decides to pass the law but 
not provide money for linking our public hospitals and county and community 
clinics? For Los Angeles, this could undermine a public-health safety net that 
could not be duplicated in the private sector. Emergency care must still be 
provided at the county level for all, and this requires adequate support both 
from the federal and state governments. 
</P>
<P>
 These major financing pitfalls, combined with the implications for consumer 
choice, have shifted significant support away from the bill. Even Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.), who is co-sponsoring it, has been at best lukewarm with 
her endorsement.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the most popular of the competing plans is the Chafee/Thomas bill, 
which relies on the current system with no employer mandate. This proposal is 
leaner in health benefits and allows for restriction of benefits if funding is 
not available. There are no restrictions based on citizenship or specific 
limits on co-payments, deductibles or out-of-pocket costs. As in the Clinton 
proposal, financing relies on the Medicare and Medicaid cost savings as well as 
caps on tax deductibility of employer-provided health benefits. A more 
fundamental problem of this bill is that it does not guarantee universal 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other challenges to the overwritten and underfunded Clinton proposal are 
springing up. If Clinton is to seriously push forward, he must begin to pare 
down his bloated benefits package, provide choice of providers to the middle 
class and develop real means of funding for states like California. Clinton's 
package will falter if it does not answer these issues soon. Few can quibble 
with the need for universal and affordable health care, but we must provide a 
solid financial base for equitable reform.

ALEMANY REMAINS COOL UNTIL RIGLEY IS RIGHT IN VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even undefeated teams have nights when nothing seems to go right. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key to Alemany High's unbeaten record, said Coach Melissa Hearlihy, 
has been resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: The Indians' 52-45 Mission League victory Tuesday night over 
rival St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Alemany's "home" game was played at Bell-Jeff High because the 
Indians' gym has been unusable since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 And their best player, junior forward Samantha Rigley, picked up her third 
foul in the first quarter. That gave Rigley three more fouls than points 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Then things got worse. St. Bernard (18-5, 5-3) embarked on a 9-1 run and took 
an eight-point lead after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we got a little rattled," Hearlihy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Indians (19-0, 7-0 in league play), they had the real 
McKay -- guard Kelly McKay. The 5-foot-7 senior scored 14 of her 16 points in 
the first three quarters to keep Alemany within striking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kelly had the game of her life," Hearlihy said. "I think that's what is 
special about this team. If some people are having a bad night, another one 
steps up." 
</P>
<P>
 McKay's smooth jump shot and calming influence steadied Alemany until the 
second half, when Rigley got into the flow. The 5-9 junior forward, who directs 
the attack and plays like a point guard on offense, scored 13 of her 16 points 
after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lack of confidence in myself at first," Rigley said. "Sometimes I put 
too much pressure on myself, and say, 'If I don't do well, then it will be a 
close game,' and tonight was an example." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany opened the third quarter with an 11-4 run to take a 30-29 lead. The 
lead then changed hands five times before Rigley took over with the score tied, 
41-41, with three minutes left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On three consecutive Viking possessions, she rebounded a missed shot and was 
fouled. Each time it was the opposing player's fifth foul. And each time Rigley 
made both free throws. When the stretch was over, Alemany had a 47-41 lead with 
under two minutes to play. Rigley made 11 of 13 free throws.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: VOLUNTARISM ALIVE AND WELL AT SAUGUS HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saugus High football Coach Jack Bowman won't soon be forgotten by the Santa 
Clarita chapter of the Red Cross. As soon as he decided the damage to his house 
from the Jan. 17 earthquake was minimal, he called to check on each of his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who assured Bowman that all was OK instantly were called to duty. Bowman 
and 46 of his varsity players sprang into action as Red Cross volunteers. Their 
tasks were varied, but the strong-armed Saugus contingent mainly assisted at 
the Saugus gymnasium, which served as a Red Cross shelter, or transported food, 
water and supplies to various sites in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought it was neat," Bowman said. "They thought they had met some 
interesting people who responded to the tragedy in different ways. I've never 
been in a catastrophe quite like this. And since we didn't have much damage at 
my place, volunteering just seemed like a natural thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman and his wife, Christine -- who coaches the Centurions' award-winning 
dance team -- worked for about a week as relief volunteers. More important, 
said Bowman, was that 10 of his players logged five days, working eight-hour 
shifts, assisting the Red Cross. NORTHWEST VALLEY 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKING HOLTZ 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Holtz wore a funny look. 
</P>
<P>
 If expressions can be translated into the written word, Holtz was thinking 
something along the lines of, "Why in the heck would you want to stay in L.A. 
to play football?" 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, the football coach at Notre Dame, dropped by the home of San Fernando 
High quarterback Leon Blunt two days after the Northridge quake. Of course, the 
Valley was still shaking periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was still here when some of the aftershocks hit," Blunt said. "I don't 
think he's been in many earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Blunt, who earlier had orally committed to play at Notre Dame, has had the 
Golden Domers a little concerned. While Blunt has maintained all along that he 
intends to sign a letter of intent with Notre Dame today, the first day of the 
NCAA's winter signing period, published reports have indicated that the option 
quarterback was still considering attending USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Blunt continued to take recruiting trips after he committed to Notre 
Dame, a fact that was hardly lost on Holtz and Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've called me almost every day," Blunt said of the Notre Dame staff. "I 
think they're a little worried." 
</P>
<P>
 USC tried until the very end. Trojan Coach John Robinson and assistant Charles 
White, a San Fernando graduate, also visited Blunt at home. MID-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 READY TO RALLY 
</P>
<P>
 City Section basketball returns today and Monroe Coach Paul Graber couldn't be 
happier. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe, which finished 23-4 and was 3-A Division runner-up last season, is 
winning very few games a year later, but Graber and star player Kenyatta Niles 
insist it's not too late for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have a feeling that my team is going to turn it around," Graber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe's last game (Jan. 14) boosted Graber's hopes. Monroe (4-10) led Grant 
by three points with 90 seconds left before the Lancers rallied for a 76-72 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Graber was energized by his team's performance against a 
Grant (12-3). So was Niles, who scored 12 points, grabbed eight rebounds and 
had eight assists in 14 minutes. Niles, an All-City selection last season, has 
been slowed because of strained ligaments in his left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Niles, however, said the ankle is fine and the Vikings are ready to rally. 
"We're gonna win the 3-A," Niles said. "We will not lose any more." 
NORTHEASTERN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what the media have been reporting, the Verdugo Hills High gymnasium 
was not structurally damaged by the recent 6.6 earthquake, according to 
basketball Coach Scott Kemple. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, the Verdugo Hills basketball team has been without a gymnasium 
since Nov. 13 -- the day workers began to strip, re-paint and re-finish the 
hardwood floor. Incidentally, the City basketball season officially started 
Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's supposed to be done (by next week)," Kemple said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons expect to play their entire 21-game season on the road. Around the 
leagues . . .

PARACLETE PARLAYS ZEROS INTO VICTORY

 Paraclete High's 46-34 victory over Rosamond in a High Desert League boys' 
basketball game Tuesday night began as zero hour.

<P>
 At the end of the first quarter: Paraclete 0, Rosamond 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosamond (8-11, 2-7 in league play) lost to the Spirits (9-10, 6-3) by 40 
points in their first meeting, so they slowed the pace this time. After 
Rosamond missed a shot and Paraclete missed two free throws, the Roadrunners 
held the ball for the last six minutes of the first quarter.

 "It was like a standoff in the sun, who's going to blink first," Paraclete 
Coach Andy Gavel said. "We didn't care because we had the possession arrow to 
start the second quarter."

 Canyon High boys' basketball Coach Greg Hayes apparently is delivering on the 
promise he made to his players last week after the Foothill League decided to 
cancel one-third of its league games. Hayes said he would find some nonleague 
games to make up for the four-game loss and here's what he has scheduled: 
</P>
<P>
 * A nonleague game at Foothill League rival Burbank on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * A nonleague game at home against L.A. Baptist on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * A nonleague game at league rival Burroughs next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon also plays host to a league game Saturday against Burroughs.

 Saugus and Hart are scheduled to play a Foothill League game Friday at The 
Master's College. Burroughs and Burbank scheduled a nonleague game Feb. 10.

million in the fourth quarter, a significant drop from a year ago when profit 
was boosted by an asset sale.Profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 amounted to 
61 cents a share. A year ago, Eastman Kodak Co. earned $299 million, or 92 
cents a share, in the same period. Revenue was $4.54 billion, down 2% from

the year-ago quarter.

 Oklahoma Gun Battle: Reba McEntire is taking some heat in Oklahoma for her 
program offering concert tickets to those who trade in guns. To counter 
McEntire's plan, the Tulsa Gun and Pawn has come up with its own program -- 
offering a 10% discount on firearms to anyone bringing in one of McEntire's 
compact discs, cassettes or a concert ticket. "She hasn't thought the problem 
through," the shop's owner, Buck Dickinson, said of McEntire. "We don't have a 
gun problem. We have a criminal problem." So far, McEntire's exchange program 
has brought in 49 guns in conjunction with her Feb. 19 show in Tulsa.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BOY HOWDY'S BLAND-NEW HABITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hail the conquering heroes. Orange County's Boy Howdy returned on Monday to 
the Crazy Horse, where it has spent countless nights as a faceless house band 
-- and this time it had a national hit of its own to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, at the early show, it immediately was apparent that along with its 
newfound commercial success, Boy Howdy has picked up some of the same bad 
habits that hamper countless other hit bands' performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though this was a hometown crowd, with members' wives, children and 
numerous friends in the packed house, lead singer Jeffrey Steele indulged in a 
series of generic greetings ("How ya doin' tonight?" "We need you to clap your 
hands on this one!" "Anybody see the Super Bowl yesterday?"). To paraphrase an 
old saw: "If you don't have anything fresh to say, don't say anything at all." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not as though this band doesn't have anything of interest to share 
with its fans. The Boy Howdy saga has all the elements of a humdinger TV movie 
of the week. After years of playing other people's hits at the Crazy Horse and 
other country clubs in the Southland, the quartet attained modest chart success 
with its first album, "Welcome to Howdywood," and first single, "A Cowboy's 
Born With a Broken Heart." Then, just as the momentum was building, tragedy 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Hugh Wright was hit on a freeway after stopping to help another 
motorist. Proving that a little five-month coma can't keep a good man down, 
Wright fought back and recovered while the band hung together, primarily for 
his sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Its reward? Even greater fan and radio acceptance. The band's current single, 
"She'd Give Anything," has reached the Top 5 of Billboard's country chart. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing from this tale is an unqualifiedly triumphant ending. 
But then, this tale is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boy Howdy's favor are its strongly melodic songs, its rich, sometimes 
unexpected three- and four-part vocal arrangements and, especially, not one but 
two stunningly talented lead guitarists, brothers Larry and Cary Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With a house-afire version of "If This Is Love," a set-closing cover of the 
Kinks' "You Really Got Me" and a Bill Monroe bluegrass instrumental, the Parks 
evoked memories of nothing less than Emmylou Harris' standard-setting Hot Band 
at its peak (though the Monroe number lacked the mandolin that Cary has used in 
the studio to great effect). 
</P>
<P>
 What the group needs most is concentrated effort on its lyrics. The first 
album's songs hinged on commonplace visual images and turns of phrase that were 
salvaged, partially, by unpretentious vocal enthusiasm. But on the new six-song 
mini-album, the tendencies toward form-molded sentiment are more pronounced. 
There is little concrete sense of time, place or character in the original 
material, most of which was written or co-written by bassist Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 In one unrecorded song that Steele dedicated to his wife, he sang, "There's 
something about her/I can't put a finger on." The best songwriters take the 
time to figure out exactly what it is, and share it with their listeners. The 
best songs make you feel as if the writer has lived your life. Too often, 
Steele's are vague enough to fit everyone's life -- and consequently they fit 
no one's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steele sings in a clear, attractive tenor but doesn't exploit whatever nooks 
and crannies it holds. Both Park brothers, in their respective turns in the 
vocal spotlight, were more distinctive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, personality doesn't always develop instantly, and with only two albums 
(one and a half, really) behind it, Boy Howdy has plenty of time to bring its 
potential to fruition -- as long as it doesn't get seduced by the dark side -- 
the play-it-safe side -- of commercial success.

MANNING'S ALL-STAR PLAY WASTED IN CLIPPER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper forward Danny Manning soaked his aching body in a whirlpool. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning had every right to be exhausted after getting 26 points, a career-high 
18 rebounds, nine assists and blocking five shots in a 108-106 loss to the 
Phoenix Suns Tuesday night before a sellout crowd of 19,023 at America West 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Named to the NBA All-Star team for the second consecutive year earlier in the 
day, Manning played like an All-Star as the Clippers scored 15 consecutive 
points at the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth to overcome 
a 13-point third quarter deficit against the defending Western Conference 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Suns, who trailed 94-91, scored nine points in a row to take a 
100-94 fourth-quarter lead, the Clippers outscored Phoenix, 10-2, to take a 
104-102 lead with 2:29 remaining on a layup by Ron Harper, who had 28 points 
and a season-high 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 106-104 after Sun center Oliver Miller, who had eight points and a 
career-high 18 rebounds, sank back-to-back jump shots, Manning tied it, 
106-106, when he sank a jumper from the left corner with 1:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked as if the Clippers had a chance to win it when guard Frank Johnson 
threw the ball away as he tried to pass it into Cedric Ceballos, underneath the 
Suns' basket with 24 seconds remaining. But referee Paul Mihalak called a foul 
on Harper and Ceballos sank a free throw to give the Suns a 107-106 lead. 
Replays seems to indicate that Ceballos elbowed Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Ceballos was stunned by the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't touch me," said Ceballos, who had 37 points and 11 rebounds. "I 
didn't even know that he called a foul. I was running down the court to go play 
defense and then they told me I had to shoot two free throws." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper didn't complain after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit here and cry," Harper said. "That ain't what I do. He 
made the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a catch-22. Sometimes you wish they didn't call that foul, but if 
you're the offensive player you'd think they would call that foul. But I ain't 
going to sit here and say that the man made a bad call and (complain) and all 
that. I'll let him make the call. I can't make the calls, I ain't got a striped 
shirt on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers called a timeout to set up a play, but center Elmore Spencer 
missed a shot with four seconds left and Harper fouled Miller as they fought 
for the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made one of two free throws with 3.5 seconds remaining to give the Suns 
a two-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers used their last time out to set up a play, but Gary Grant, who 
had 14 points and seven assists, missed a desperation shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers actually had two chances. Harper inbounded the ball to Grant, who 
was fouled by Johnson before he took a three-point shot from the left side with 
2.1 seconds left. But the Suns had a foul to give and the Clippers had to 
inbound the ball again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to try to foul me and I think it was a tie," Grant said. 
"I think I should have been at the line. But that's the call and you can't look 
back at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper threw it to Grant, but he didn't get a good look at the basket as he 
shot it. Manning tried to tip it in but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers (15-27), who beat the Seattle SuperSonics last Tuesday and took 
the New York Knicks down to the final seconds before losing by two points last 
Thursday, have proved they can play with the elite teams in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always knew that we could play with (good teams), now it's just a question 
of taking it to the next level and beating these teams on a consistent basis," 
said Clipper guard Mark Jackson, who had 16 points, nine assists and nine 
rebounds. "It's a good feeling to be playing well, but now we have to take it 
to the next level." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper spokesman Joe Safety denied a report in the Washington Post that the 
Disney Company is in serious negotiations to buy the Clippers from owner Donald 
T. Sterling. "The Clippers are not for sale," Safety said. "I can't say it 
strongly enough." . . . . Clipper forward Loy Vaught sat out the second half 
because of stomach flu after playing only nine minutes in the first half . . . 
. Clipper forward Danny Manning credited his teammates for helping him make the 
All-Star team for the second season in a row. "It's definitely a nice 
accomplishment," Manning said. "I'm just fortunate to play with some guys that 
put me in a position to make it again. I'm very thankful for it." NBA All-Star

LACK OF FIREPOWER HURTS WORTHY, LAKERS IN LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The gun's chambers may look empty to those who have seen him fire at a 20% 
rate the last four games and 28.8% the last 11, but James Worthy knows better. 
He has traveled this road before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the lift is missing," he was saying Tuesday night. "Sometimes they're 
short. Sometimes they go in and come out. I don't think I have given a whole 
lot of attention to the mechanical. I just want to shoot, shoot, shoot my way 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 So he will try to do just that, even when it looks bad, bad, bad. Like at the 
Alamodome, where his slump continued with a three-for-13 showing in the Lakers' 
112-97 loss to the San Antonio Spurs before 17,397. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been this way since Jan. 4 at Denver, save the night he scored 22 
points to help in the upset victory against Phoenix at the Forum. Otherwise, 
two for 10. Two for eight. One for 11. One for 11, again. Four for 13. The ones 
that come close to respectable are the eight for 18, the four for nine. 
</P>
<P>
 That brings Worthy to the halfway point of his 12th season shooting 38%, lower 
than the 44.7% the last two years that were lows for his career. Those numbers 
begin to spell. . . . . . . . D-e-c-l-i-n-e? 
</P>
<P>
 But, apparently, not p-a-n-i-c. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know you can't stop shooting," he said. "That's when it is the worst. 
It's tough when they are not going down, but it's worse when you hesitate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers need his scoring more now than any time this season. They need the 
10.3 points every night because Doug Christie and Anthony Peeler are injured. 
To that end, Worthy has played fewer than 19 minutes only once in the 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've talked, and we continue to experiment with some options and we will 
continue to do that," Laker Coach Randy Pfund said. "I'm not giving up on James 
Worthy at all. He's been through tough stretches before and found his way 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthy was hardly the only problem as the Lakers' two-game winning streak was 
snapped. The team shot 43.2% and was outrebounded by 17. Dale Ellis had 
season-highs with 32 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, and David Robinson 
had 30 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Lakers stayed close until midway through the third quarter, 
trailing by 10 points. But San Antonio, winner of 12 of its last 15 games, took 
control for good with an 8-2 run that was worth a 76-60 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The only spark that remained was the scuffle that got Elden Campbell and Terry 
Cummings ejected with 2:23 remaining. Cummings was bothered by Campbell, who 
was trying to clear some room for an outlet pass with his elbows, and Campbell 
was surprised when Cummings pushed him in the back. But this encounter will 
probably best be remembered for Cummings taking a quick swipe . . . while 
backpedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great fight," Spur Coach John Lucas said. "Sleepy (Floyd) told T.C. 
he didn't need to worry about being suspended because that punch wouldn't merit 
a fine." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least Campbell was on the court in part of the fourth quarter, after 
riding the bench down the stretch the two previous games. Even with the early 
exit, he finished with 13 points and a team-high 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel led the Lakers in scoring with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers signed guard Reggie Jordan to a second 10-day contract before the 
game. When this one is up, they must sign him for the rest of the season or 
release him. . . . Vinny Del Negro made two free throws to set a Spur record 
with 48 consecutive trips to the line without a miss. James Silas had the old 
mark from 1975-76. . . . Nick Van Exel's eight assists while playing 41 
minutes, including all of the fourth quarter, Friday against Detroit at the 
Forum was all the more impressive, considering the state of his right calf. Van 
Exel was kneed earlier in the game and probably wouldn't have been used late, 
except the Lakers needed him when the Pistons went to a three-guard alignment.

MORNING BRIEFING: AIKMAN'S FLIGHT PLAN DOESN'T INCLUDE TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of Cowboy fans, returning to Dallas from the Super Bowl Monday, 
thought they were seeing things when they checked in at the crowded Atlanta 
airport for their flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that really Troy Aikman in the standby line? 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it was. 
</P>
<P>
 So why wasn't the star quarterback on the team charter? The answer was never 
quite clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known I would be leaving Atlanta today, believe me, I would have 
been on (the charter)," Aikman told Maryln Schwartz of the Dallas Morning News. 
"But I have my reasons for taking this plane. I'm just not talking about them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Troy: Aikman wasn't actually traveling standby. He was waiting for most of 
the passengers to board before taking his seat in first class, according to an 
airlines clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last add Troy: As for Aikman's flight to Dallas, Schwartz wrote: "People left 
him alone for the most part, although an enormous amount of coach travelers 
tried to use the first-class bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Say it ain't so: The country that claimed the most famous figure skater in 
history will not have a figure skater in its own Winter Olympics next month. 
Norway, who gave the world Sonja Henie, says it just doesn't have anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pity," Arild Gjerde, general secretary of the Norwegian Skating Assn. 
told the Chicago Tribune. "But we haven't had qualified figure skaters for this 
sort of competition since the days of Sonja Henie." 
</P>
<P>
 Norway hasn't had an Olympic competitor in the sport since 1964 and only six 
since World War II. Its best finish since Henie was a 22nd by Marit Henie, 
Sonja's cousin, in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: How many Olympic singles titles and world titles did Sonja Henie 
win? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Henie: Upon retiring from amateur skating in 1936, Henie became a 
multimillionaire star of films and ice shows and popularized the sport in the 
United States. She became a U.S. citizen by marriage in 1940 and, until her 
death in 1969, lived in Holmby Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First, the movie: Tonya Harding has decided she would love to see herself 
played by Meg Ryan in the inevitable movie about the attack on rival skater 
Nancy Kerrigan, a neighbor says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'No way, she's too old,' " Alan Skarica told the Associated Press of 
Harding's casting preference. "And she says, 'No, no, I like Meg Ryan. I loved 
her in 'Sleepless in Seattle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, the neighbor added, also has someone in mind to play her best friend, 
Stephanie Quintero -- Jennie Garth of the television show, "Beverly Hills 
90210." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a boxing career: Sunday, Skarica was with Harding as she clowned with 
John Quintero, who was holding a big silver balloon and pretending to be former 
bodyguard Shawn Eckardt while Harding punched the balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This girl does not hit like a woman; she hits like a man," Skarica said. 
"John is a big guy, and she knocks him across the room." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Close to the earth: John Madden, recounting some of his cherished memories 
with CBS, said there was a time he and the crew piled into Pat Summerall's 
pickup and went out for Mexican food, with Summerall at the wheel and everybody 
else -- including Madden -- riding in the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this is what it's all about," Madden said, "sitting in the back of Pat 
Summerall's pickup truck going to a Mexican restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Close to home: The passing of Jim Callanan on Jan. 21 recalled his appearance 
as a USC end in a game against College of Pacific in 1943, along with his two 
brothers, halfbacks Howard and George, a most unusual sibling occurrence at the 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 George threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Howard for the game's only score as 
the Trojans won, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: A record three Olympic titles (1928, '32 and '36) and a record 
10 consecutive world championships (1927-36). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Jimmy Connors, playing in the AT&T Pebble Beach Golf Pro-Am this 
week: "I'm actually a little nervous, like it's my first pro tournament. That 
first swing might be a little scary." MARYANN HUDSON

NHL ROUNDUP; PANTHERS' UNBEATEN STREAK ENDED BY PITTSBURGH, 2-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Murphy had a goal and assist Tuesday night, helping the Pittsburgh 
Penguins end the Florida Panthers' nine-game unbeaten streak with a 2-1 victory 
at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh allowed only one goal while playing shorthanded for nearly 12 
minutes in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, which holds the record for longest unbeaten streak expansion 
franchises, had been 5-0-4 since Jan. 7.  
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, San Jose 4 -- Benoit Hogue's second goal of the game, 
late in the third period, helped the Islanders break a five-game losing streak 
at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Flatley picked up the third hat trick of his career as New York gained 
only its third victory in 15 games. The victory snapped the Sharks' road 
unbeaten streak at five games, a franchise record. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 2, Quebec 1 -- Alexander Godynyuk scored with 4:41 to play to give 
the Whalers a victory at Quebec and end their nine-game winless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford, which entered the game with only two ties in its last nine games, 
took the lead for good when Godynyuk fired a wrist shot from the right faceoff 
circle past goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Sutter, who was obtained last week in a trade with St. Louis, scored his 
first goal for the Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 4, Toronto 4 -- Mark Greig and Doug Gilmour scored in a span of 47 
seconds late in the third period as the Maple Leafs rallied to a tie at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto, unbeaten in its last 11 games, had to overcome three goals and an 
assist by the Blues' Brett Hull.

NBA ROUNDUP; MILLER LEADS PACERS AFTER ALL-STAR SNUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reggie Miller, whose scoring was not enough to earn him a spot on the All-Star 
team, showed that he can do more than put the ball in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller had nine assists and five steals, along with 25 points, as the Indiana 
Pacers beat the Washington Bullets, 116-96, Tuesday night at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller leads Eastern Conference guards in scoring, averaging 21.5 points per 
game. Still, he was left off the All-Star team in selections by fans and 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone just knows me for my scoring but there are other things I can do out 
there on the floor," Miller said. "I look to try to pass first, try to get 
everyone in it, and at the same time try to get the looks here or there for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller took over in the second quarter, when the Pacers expanded the lead to 
as many as 18. He scored 10 of his 16 first-half points as he dueled with 
Bullets rookie Calbert Cheaney, who finished with 22. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 104, Seattle 103 -- Rookie P.J. Brown made two free throws with 19 
seconds left and the SuperSonics botched a final shot to give the Nets a 
victory at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics, who have lost five of their last six games, lost their chance 
to win in the final seconds when Ricky Pierce bounced the ball off his foot 
near the top of the circle and had to throw up a hook shot from halfcourt that 
missed badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson led New Jersey with 26 points. Kevin Edwards added 19 and 
Derrick Coleman had 17 points, 14 rebounds and a career-high nine blocks. Shawn 
Kemp had 26 points for Seattle and Gary Payton added 23.  
</P>
<P>
 New York 114, Boston 79 -- Patrick Ewing scored 23 points to lead the Knicks 
to an easy victory at New York and snap the Celtics' season-high, seven-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, which has won five consecutive games, had seven players score in 
double figures and held Boston to just 56 points after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Smith scored 14 points, Greg Anthony and Rolando Blackman had 13, and 
John Starks, Derek Harper and Anthony Mason each added 12 for New York. Kevin 
Gamble led Boston with 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 88, Milwaukee 82 -- Steve Smith sparked the Heat to its franchise-record 
11th road victory of the season by scoring nine of his 19 points in the fourth 
quarter to lead Miami over the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who made a 68-foot shot at the first-period buzzer, scored seven 
consecutive points to give Miami an 84-78 lead late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heat played without guard Harold Miner, who missed the game due to an 
injured back and right knee. Glen Rice led Miami with 23 points. Blue Edwards' 
18 points led the Bucks, who have lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 118, Denver 98 -- Scottie Pippen scored 28 points and Horace Grant and 
B.J. Armstrong had 19 each to lead the Bulls over the Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, who have won nine of their last 10 games and 26 out of their last 
31, shot 59% and had only six turnovers, compared to Denver's 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Rodney Rogers came off the bench to lead Denver with 18 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 104, Houston 88 -- Karl Malone scored 29 points, including 15 in the 
fourth quarter, and the Jazz held the Rockets scoreless for nearly the final 
five minutes at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Elie's basket brought the Rockets within 92-88 with 4:56 remaining, but 
they did not score again. Utah beat Houston for the first time in three tries 
this season and broke a six-game losing streak to the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stockton added 26 points and 13 assists for Utah. Hakeem Olajuwon led 
Houston with 23 points, but did not score in the final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 102, Portland 97 -- Wayman Tisdale scored 30 points and Mitch 
Richmond 21 as the Kings surprised the Trail Blazers at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings broke a seven-game losing streak and rebounded from an embarrassing 
loss at Dallas on Saturday when the Mavericks ended a league record 19-game 
home losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland, playing without suspended All-Star Clyde Drexler, shot just 37% in 
losing to the Kings, who are last in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexler was suspended without pay for one game Tuesday and fined $2,500 by the 
NBA for bumping an official Sunday in a game against New York.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MICHIGAN OVERCOMES PURDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michigan center Juwan Howard put back an offensive rebound with 21.1 seconds 
to play and Purdue missed three shots in the final seconds, allowing the 
13th-ranked Wolverines to overcome an 11-point deficit and defeat the No. 8 
Boilermakers, 63-62, Tuesday at West Lafayette, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate that we can't block out, and that's what beat us," Purdue 
Coach Gene Keady said after his team was outrebounded, 52-40, with Howard 
grabbing 17 to go with his 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (14-4, 6-2 in the Big Ten Conference) overcame a 36-point 
performance by Glenn Robinson to win a game for first place in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two teams playing awfully hard defensively led to an ugly looking game at 
times," said Michigan Coach Steve Fisher, who watched his Wolverines shoot 
38.1% and Purdue 38.5%. "It was two tough defensive efforts that you saw from 
the offensive end." 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (17-3, 5-3) took its biggest lead of the night, 53-42, on a jump shot 
by Robinson with 8:31 to play. But poor free throw shooting cost Purdue dearly 
down the stretch. The Boilermakers missed 10 of 15 in the second half. Purdue 
made only eight of 20 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Syracuse 108, No. 5 Connecticut 95 -- Lawrence Moten scored 31 points 
and John Wallace added 25 as the Orangemen matched their highest point total 
for a Big East Conference game in defeating the Huskies at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a team, we played a perfect game tonight," said Moten, who also had 10 
rebounds. "We couldn't have played any better. I would never have believed we 
could score 108 points on Connecticut." 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse (14-3, 7-3) moved into a second-place tie with Boston College by 
ending a 10-game winning streak by the Huskies (18-2, 8-1), who played their 
second game without Coach Jim Calhoun, who has been hospitalized with 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Donyell Marshall had 30 points to lead Connecticut, which pulled to within 
92-88 on Nantambu Willingham's basket with 3:39 to play. But Syracuse went on 
an 11-2 run to lead 103-90 with a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most difficult thing about the game is giving up 108 points," Marshall 
said. "We prided ourselves on being a good defensive team. But, we're still No. 
1 in the conference. Everybody still has to catch us." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Arkansas 89, Vanderbilt 76 -- Roger Crawford and Scotty Thurman scored 
three baskets each during a 19-0 run that helped lead the Razorbacks to victory 
at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Seckar's fourth three-point basket in six attempts cut the Arkansas lead 
to 46-43 before the Crawford-Thurman spree. The Commodores (10-7, 3-5 
Southeastern Conference) suffered four turnovers during the five-minute period. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went on a UNLV-type run of a few years ago, which put them ahead for 
good," Vanderbilt Coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. "We haven't played a team 
that has gone on runs like they did, and it is hard to prepare for these runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Corliss Williamson led Arkansas (15-2, 6-2 Southeastern Conference) with 24 
points, while Crawford added 16. Ronnie McMahon led Vanderbilt with 26, with 
Billy McCaffrey scoring 17. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Temple 84, Rutgers 45 -- With leading scorer Aaron McKie on the bench 
because of foul trouble, Eddie Jones matched a career high with 30 points to 
lead the Owls to a blowout victory over Rutgers in an Atlantic 10 Conference 
game at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I threw up seemed to fall in," said Jones, who was 11 for 15 from 
the field, including three of five from three-point range. "I kept getting the 
ball in my sweet spots. The shots were just dropping for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones personally outscored Rutgers, 18-3, immediately after McKie sat down 
with two personal fouls in the first half. Jones finished with 25 in the half, 
one short of the home-court record set last year by McKie against Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple (14-2, 7-1) posted its eighth consecutive victory and is second in the 
Atlantic 10 behind Massachusetts. Rutgers (6-11, 2-6) was led by Charles Jones' 
16 points.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: GAS PUMPS IN BAJA: NOT A REAL FILL'ER UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As travelers in Baja California have long suspected, they are being 
overcharged at the gas pumps along Highway 1. 
</P>
<P>
 David Eidell, conducting a test for the Imperial Beach-based Mexico Travel 
Associates and using a California-certified calibration unit, visited eight 
stations along Highway 1 in northern and central Baja recently and was 
overcharged at each. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the tests were published in Mexico Travel's January newsletter. The 
highest overcharge was 14% at San Quintin, south of Ensenada, when Eidell 
filled the unit with 19 liters and the pump registered 21.6. The lowest 
overcharge was 2% at Catavina and Vizcaino. At a station in Ensenada, Eidell 
filled the unit with 19.0 liters (5 gallons) and was charged for 20.6, an 8% 
overcharge. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mexico Travel, the governor of Baja California Norte has been 
notified of the results of the test, but has not yet responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part about it is that the Mexicans who can least afford it are 
paying the same price, so they're in the worst position," said Carolyn Files, 
Mexico Travel publisher. 
</P>

 Given the amount of trophy-sized largemouth bass landed at Castaic Lake 
recently, it was no surprise that Allan Cole pulled in a 15-pound 8-ounce 
lunker last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Cole, a painting contractor, who spends more than 100 days a year on 
the water, was surprised by his catch Saturday afternoon -- two largemouth bass 
on one lure, both pushing 10 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hooked up and thought, 'This one is really huge,' " Cole said. "I was 
getting really nervous; I didn't want to lose it. It came up once, and all I 
could see was a flash. Then when I got it to the boat I looked down and 
couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Coles catch was seen by an almost-firsthand witness on a nearby boat. Vincent 
McGuire was fishing less than 100 yards from Cole and was watching as Cole 
netted his fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within a minute, he was over to show me what he had caught," Vincent said. 
"They were fresh-looking, one was bleeding from the lips. They looked like they 
were caught at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said he has landed nine bass in the past week at Castaic, the smallest a 
seven-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Top catch: Jan Isley of the Ascension Bay Bonefish Club off Mexico's Yucatan 
Peninsula south of Cancun recently caught what is believed to be the largest 
permit ever taken on rod and reel. The permit, which is a species often caught 
while seeking bonefish and took 1 hour 20 minutes to land, weighed 53 pounds 
and measured 52 inches from nose to the fork in its tail. Isley enticed the 
strong-swimming fish with a fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Pendergast of the Santa Clara-based Fishing International, Ascension Bay's 
West Coast representative, said Isley released the fish after weighing it, and 
was not sure whether it will be submitted for International Game Fish Assn. 
approval as a world record. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-tackle world record for permit is a 51-pound 8-ounce fish caught in 
1978 off Florida. The largest permit ever taken on a fly rod is a 41-pound 
8-ounce fish landed off Key West in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most unusual catch: The IGFA, in its latest newsletter, said John Malandra of 
New Jersey recently hooked into a 179-pound bluefin tuna while fishing in the 
surf . 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd gathered on the beach near Atlantic City and watched as Malandra tried 
to bring the giant bluefin in. Malandra's line broke near the end of the fight 
and he ran out into the surf with a towel and wrestled with the fish for 15 
minutes before wrapping the towel around it and dragging it in. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 SALTWATER -- Rock cod and rockfish remain the main fare for most Southland 
anglers, though L.A. Harbor-based vessels have been returning from San Clemente 
Island with impressive numbers of calico bass, and Santa Barbara-based boats 
have been doing the same from the kelp-rich waters north of the landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabo San Lucas: The recent full moon is being blamed for a lull in the action, 
but fishing remains steady for striped marlin off the peninsula, and for tuna 
and dorado inside the gulf. Jig Stop Tours in Dana Point reported that Peter 
Maxwell of Los Angeles caught and released an estimated 170-pound striper while 
fishing off Red Hill.  
</P>
<P>
 La Paz: When the northerlies blow, fishing is slow. But pargo are teeming 
around Cerralvo Island, and fishermen are regularly catching 20- to 50-pounders 
and losing the larger snappers as they dive to the safety of the rocks. There's 
not much fishing pressure offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 SHOOTING -- Tom John of Acton became only the second person to post a perfect 
100 during a U.S.-registered sporting clays competition. John, 37, broke 128 
targets before missing during Sunday's competition at the Moore and Moore range 
in San Fernando. Medardo Canales of Thousand Oaks became the first U.S. shooter 
to break 100 in a row last year. Canales was John's shooting partner this time. 
</P>
<P>
 HONORABLE MENTION -- The Los Angeles Rod & Reel Club will not present 
qualifying members with trophies at its annual awards banquet, but will instead 
donate $1,500 -- and food baskets generally used at the banquet -- to the 
Salvation Army for earthquake relief. 
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- The Southern California Boat Show, largest on the West Coast, 
will be held Feb. Saturday through Feb. 13 at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center. Cost is $8 for adults. . . . The Society for the Conservation of 
Bighorn Sheep is seeking volunteers to help construct a water guzzler for 
Nelson bighorns in the Sheep Hole Mountains east of Twentynine Palms Feb. 
12-13. Details: (213) 256-0463. . . . The California Wildfowl Arts Festival, 
featuring top carvers of decoys and "anything that flies" will be held Feb. 
19-20 at the Sheraton Industry Hills Resort. Cost is $5 for adults.  
</P>
<P>
 FLY FISHING -- Professional fly-tyer A.K. Best will demonstrate how to make 
flies that look like insects next Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. at Rio San Gabriel Park 
in Downey. Cost is $5. Details (310) 425-7936. . . . The San Gabriel Valley Fly 
Fishers' eight-week tying course for freshwater and saltwater patterns begins 
Feb. 15 at 7 p.m. at Sorensen Park Community Center in Whittier. Details: (818) 
961-0122.

FISHING REPORT: RAIN BRINGS FOOD TO TROUT, TROUT TO ANGLERS AT IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's rain is being credited with triggering a steady bite of rainbow 
and German brown trout at Irvine Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials there said runoff from the rain carried worms, so those using 
nightcrawlers and red worms had little trouble catching their five-fish limits. 
The largest fish of the week, a 7 1/2-pound rainbow trout, was caught by Craig 
Schlisct of Glendora.

LOS ALAMITOS; CROGHAN FINDS SUCCESS COMES EASIER WHEN HE CAN TAKE THINGS EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ANDERSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Croghan has several reasons to be smiling these days. 
</P>
<P>
 The harness driver, who is back on the track at Los Alamitos for the first 
time since the fall of 1992, was tied with Frank Sherren for the lead in the 
standings with 13 victories through Saturday. Last week, Croghan won five races 
in 17 drives, his best week of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan is training only six horses, down considerably from the 40 he had in 
the late 1980s and early '90s. Included in his current small stable is Romantic 
Music, the leading 4-year-old filly pacer at Los Alamitos. Last winter, Croghan 
changed his approach to racing. He temporarily quit driving because of back 
trouble and began cutting down his stable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I needed to get away from doing it so much," Croghan said. "I was 
driving in training from 8 a.m. to midday nonstop six days a week, 40 miles a 
day. Now it's just six miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got rid of a lot of complaining owners that expected to win every week, and 
with them went the headaches and the back pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan trained a small stable during the 1993 winter-spring meeting at Los 
Alamitos, winning 20 of 56 starts, which ranked him second among trainers. Last 
summer, he split his stable into three divisions, sending some horses to 
Sacramento, others to Hazel Park and Kentucky. In the fall, most of them, with 
the exception of a few California-breds, were reunited at Hazel Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan did not drive at Los Alamitos in 1993, but resumed during the summer 
at Hazel Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drove in a couple of stakes at Lexington and pretty much was full time by 
July," Croghan said. "My back has been real good. I haven't had any trouble 
with it. I think it's a combination of things, but it's definitely (helped by 
a) lesser workload. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did very well in Detroit. Happy Star Bo won the invitational, and we won a 
lot of races. (At the end of the season) we weren't sure if we'd be racing (in 
California), so I sold everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Romantic Music won the $26,640 Electioneer Futurity for her age group Friday. 
It was her 16th victory in 23 starts and pushed the earnings for her career 
past $94,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Croghan has trained Romantic Music throughout her career. Last year, she won 
10 of 13 starts and didn't race after the Sacramento meeting ended in August. 
Friday's race was one of her easiest. Croghan guided her into the early lead 
and won by a length over Sinali in the slow time of 1:59 1/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Romantic Music is owned by Doug and Laurette Odney of Granada Hills, whose 
home was severely damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houses in our neighborhood were condemned," Doug Odney said. "I believe ours 
is repairable. We got lucky. We have a lot of cracks. A crystal vase, which was 
Romantic Music's trophy from Sacramento, was our worst loss. It's got a chunk 
out of it, but it's back up on the mantle. It's got more character now." 
</P>
<P>
 Romantic Music has raced against her own age group and against older mares in 
invitational events this year. Both of her 1994 victories have come in races 
for 4-year-olds. Against older horses, she was second to Brilliant Colors on 
Jan. 8 and was a troubled fifth behind Greta Lobell on Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Romantic Music will race in filly and mare invitationals on a regular basis 
for the rest of this season. This may be her last season before being sent to 
the breeding shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's as good as the other mares, but I don't think she's better," Croghan 
said. "After this season, it's probably broodmare time. (She has) legs you 
don't look at because if you did, you would never enter her. She's never been 
lame; she just looks like she should be." 
</P>
<P>
 The future is also a question mark for Croghan. The 40-year-old Australian 
native was at Hollywood Park last fall, assisting a thoroughbred trainer. A 
switch to the more lucrative thoroughbred circuit is an option he is 
considering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent a month there learning," he said. "I wanted to see if I could do it. 
It's a possibility at this point. I enjoy Southern California too much to think 
of moving back to those other places." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sacramento attorney Ron Zumbrun filed suit in Sacramento County Superior Court 
against the California Horse Racing Board and members of the quarter horse 
industry last month, alleging that those groups failed to provide parity and 
equality for harness racing at Los Alamitos in 1993 and '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Zumbrun and his wife, Ann, own a few horses in training at Los Alamitos. In 
the past, they have raced several stakes winners, including Exclusive Miss, Ms. 
Exclusive and Baroque. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the California quarter horse and harness racing industries consider Los 
Alamitos to be a home base. Zumbrun's suit contends that California racing law 
dictates that the CHRB is required to assure equality between breeds. It also 
contends that the 1990 sale of 50% of Los Alamitos to Edward Allred of Long 
Beach was made on the premise that equal racing opportunities would be made 
available to both quarter horses and harness horses. Allred, who is president 
of the Horsemen's Quarter Horse Racing Assn., which conducts quarter horse 
racing at Los Alamitos, is also named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Harness interests have not had many racing opportunities at Los Alamitos since 
Lloyd Arnold, 25% owner of the track, retired as a promoter of harness meetings 
in November, 1992. Chris Bardis of Sacramento, an owner of harness horses, also 
owns 25% of Los Alamitos. Neither is currently promoting race meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the harness industry has formed two groups of horse owners who have 
leased Los Alamitos for the past two winters to continue harness racing in 
Southern California. Last year, harness racing was held at Los Alamitos from 
mid-January to mid-April, with quarter horses, Arabians and thoroughbreds 
racing the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 calender isn't much different. Harness racing ends at Los Alamitos on 
April 2, and a quarter horse meeting is scheduled to begin on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 and '92, each breed spent about six months racing at Los Alamitos. 
Quarter horses also went to Bay Meadows in 1991 and to Hollywood Park in '92; 
harness horses also went to Sacramento in 1992 but didn't race at a second site 
in '91. 
</P>
<P>
 The current meeting was announced at a California Horse Racing Board meeting 
on Dec. 16 after last-minute negotiations between harness horsemen and Los 
Alamitos track owners. Zumbrun spoke to the board that day and asked for six 
months of harness racing at Los Alamitos, or for quarter horses to be 
restricted to the same number of racing days as the total allocated to the 
standardbreds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harness racing has not been treated fairly, and there hasn't been proper 
attention to our dates," Zumbrun said this week. "We are entitled to a full 
meeting in 1994. The quarter horse industry dictated our dates and we didn't 
get our April dates, which were our most profitable last year. With only three 
months of racing (this year at Los Alamitos), horsemen can't move here from 
Florida to race." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit comes at a time when harness racing once again faces an uncertain 
future for the remainder of '94. The Premier Harness Racing Assn., which is 
conducting the current harness meeting, has had disappointing mutuel handles in 
the first month of the season. The PHRA is not pursuing a meeting at 
Sacramento, although others are considering one. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 There were six stakes last week. Aside from Romantic Music, other winners 
included Heated Debate, 4-year-old trotting fillies; Hays My Game, 4-year-old 
trotting colts; Pip's Fonzo, 4-year-old pacing colts; Fast N Loose, 3-year-old 
pacing fillies, and Maxanali, 3-year-old pacing colts. . . . There is a 
twin-trifecta carryover of $17,749 for Thursday.

TENNIS ROUNDUP; NAVRATILOVA WINS TO BEGIN LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova began her last year of singles competition with a victory 
Tuesday, beating Japan's Mana Endo, 6-1, 6-3, in 59 minutes in the first round 
of the Toray Pan Pacific Open tournament at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova is the defending champion and said afterward that she wanted one 
more Grand Slam tournament victory before retiring.She has 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care which one," said Navratilova, who skipped the Australian Open 
but is looking ahead to Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. "My best chance will be at 
Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old former world No. 1 is now ranked No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she skipped the Australian Open because it started too early in the 
season, not giving her enough time to train. 
</P>
<P>
 With her customary net-charging style, Navratilova broke service in the first 
game against Endo. She broke again in the third and seventh games. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Pan Pacific winners Tuesday included Australian Open champion Steffi 
Graf and Gabriela Sabatini. 
</P>
<P>

 Boris Becker returned to the tennis circuit after a two-month layoff and 
showed no rustiness, beating Britain's Jeremy Bates, 6-2, 6-4, in the first 
round of the $538,000 Marseille Open in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker had been inactive since the beginning of December to devote time to the 
birth of his son, Noah Gabriel, who was born Jan. 18 in Munich, Germany.

SPURT IN INTEREST RATES ENDS DOW'S RECORD-SETTING RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks retreated from their record highs Tuesday as a spike 
in interest rates gave investors an excuse to take profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields jumped on fresh evidence that the robust economic 
expansion of late 1993 continued into 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silver prices rebounded sharply, and oil jumped again as cold weather 
gripped the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 After setting three successive all-time-high closes and surging 70 points, the 
Dow industrials fell 14.35 points to 3,964.01. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, falling issues topped winners by 6 to 5 on the Big 
Board in continued heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Goldman, analyst at brokerage A.G. Edwards, described the market's 
decline as a normal pause after the recent sharp advance. The Dow surged 6% in 
January, while the Nasdaq composite, Standard & Poor's 500 and NYSE composite 
indexes all rose about 3% for the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst for Tuesday's selloff, analysts said, was the sudden rise in bond 
yields, which followed Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's warning Monday 
that short-term interest rates are poised to rise with the strengthening 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also may have been hurt by the departure of Fed Vice Chairman David 
Mullins, who announced his resignation Tuesday. Some investors may fear that 
President Clinton will replace Mullins with someone less committed to fighting 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The market received little direction from overseas stocks. In Tokyo, the 
Nikkei 225-share average closed up 187.22 points at 20,416.34. But action 
stalled in Europe, where Frankfurt's DAX index finished at 2,179.67, up 2.22 
points, and London's FTSE-100 index lost 10.3 points to 3,481.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index inched up 5.95 points to a record 2,787.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit taking clipped Procter & Gamble, down 1 3/8 to 58 1/8; General 
Electric, down 7/8 to 106 7/8; Union Carbide, down 7/8 to 24 5/8, and 3M, off 1 
3/8 to 105 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telephone stocks also sold off. Bell Atlantic fell 1 3/4 to 55, BellSouth 
dropped 1 3/4 to 59 3/4 and US West sank 1 3/4 to 42. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel fell 5/8 to 64 5/8 after IBM late Monday waived its rights to 
manufacture Intel's new Pentium chip and other future computer chips for its 
own use. IBM was unchanged at 56 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among companies reporting earnings, Eastman Kodak rose 1/8 to 44 1/4 after 
it reported fourth-quarter operating results in line with expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, hospital management firm Humana rose 7/8 to 21 1/8 after reporting 
better than expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But software producer Aldus tumbled 4 to 22 1/4. Its quarterly results were 
below some analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gap lost 1 3/8 to 40 7/8 after an analyst at Sanford Bernstein cut its 
rating on the retailer, citing the stock's recent advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hotel and casino stocks jumped on positive reviews for many of the companies 
at a Montgomery Securities stock conference in New York. Hilton Hotels soared 3 
1/4 to 67 1/4, Caesars World jumped 2 to 57 1/8, Circus Circus gained 1 3/8 to 
38 3/8 and Promus rose 2 to 52 5/8. Credit  
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond soared to 6.31% from 6.23% on Monday, 
and shorter-term yields also jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month T-bills surged to 3.12% from 3.04% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors may have had a delayed reaction to Greenspan's warning 
that short-term rates will inevitably rise with the stronger economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a new economic report confirmed that the economy is sailing along: The 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management said its index of business conditions 
rose to 57.7% in January from 57.1% in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists had expected a 56% reading. An index that exceeds 50% 
indicates the manufacturing economy is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly worrisome to bond investors was the potential for higher 
inflation in the survey, which found that the rate of manufacturers' price 
increases rose in January for the second straight month to the highest level 
since November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors worry about inflationary conditions because higher prices in 
the economy diminishes the value of long-term bonds. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dropped to its lowest closing level against the Japanese yen in two 
months, with traders still nervous about the apparent lack of progress in 
U.S.-Japanese trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar finished at 107.70 yen, down from 108.63 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on the New York Comex, gold closed at $384.10 an ounce, up $2.50. 
Silver rocketed 15.5 cents to $5.28 an ounce, rebounding from a recent selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, energy prices jumped to a two-month high as a lingering period of 
cold weather forecast for the eastern half of the nation was expected to 
further shrink supplies of heating oil and natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 March crude oil futures soared 73 cents to $15.92 a barrel at the New York 
Merc, the highest closing price since Dec. 1.

 Stock index trends in native currencies and in dollars adjusted for currency 
fluctuations. The dollar-adjusted returns are what U.S. investors would 
realize. MEXICAN STOCKS *The Bolsa index hit yet another record Tuesday, adding 
5.95 points to 2,787.32 as foreign buyers continued to pour into Mexican 
stocks. So far this year, the Bolsa has surged 6.9%, overcoming a selloff 
sparked by the rebel uprising in Chiapas. *For phone giant Telmex, the market's 
bellwether stock, bad news has quickly turned into good news. Word that MCI 
Communications Corp. wants to enter the Mexican phone market in 1996 has 
spurred expectations that Telmex will make international alliances of its own, 
perhaps with AT&T. Telmex traded at a record $75 on the New York Stock Exchange 
on Tuesday and closed at $74, up 50 cents. Source: D.A. Campbell; Times wire

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; CAUTION WHILE TRAVELING SHOULD BE 
OF UTMOST CONCERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Personal safety is one of those areas business travelers know they should 
think about when planning a trip. But, preoccupied with the details of getting 
from airport to hotel to meeting, they all too often overlook it. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers are especially attractive targets for criminals, said Terry 
Riley, a psychologist and founder of Applied Psychology, a Santa Cruz-based 
company specializing in safety consulting for business travelers. Not only do 
they look like they might be carrying money, they are also unlikely to return 
to testify if they are from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity surrounding the killing of two German tourists in their rental 
car in Miami last summer served to heighten awareness about safety while 
traveling. Here are some practical suggestions from Riley and the American 
Hotel and Motel Assn. that can make your travel safer. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, a look at driving and staying in hotels. Next week, a look at 
taxis, safety on the streets and what to do if you are attacked. Rental Cars 
</P>
<P>
 Muggers and robbers look for their victims by staking out airport rental desks 
and hotel check-in counters. Therefore, these are the first lines of defense 
for business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, it's hard to tell who the criminals are," Riley said. Notorious 
serial killer Ted Bundy, for example, was a handsome man who disarmed his 
victims with charm before attacking them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you get into your rental car, you should know where you are going," 
Riley said. Get a map in advance and study it, or call for directions. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also ask the local police whether there have been any problems 
reported at the hotel where you plan to stay. Don't rely on the rental car 
agent to give you directions. Someone lurking nearby could get a preview of 
where you're going and how you plan to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cardinal rules apply everywhere: Don't travel at night and don't travel 
alone if you can help it. Keep your maps in the glove compartment so they don't 
advertise that you're from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals watch for people who look tired and could be caught off guard, Riley 
said. If you stop for coffee or a rest off the freeway, pull yourself together 
and look alert. 
</P>
<P>
 An attacker might attempt to pull you over down the road by signaling you that 
there is a problem with your car. Keep your wits about you at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 If your car has a phone, make sure it works and you know how to use it. Drive 
defensively and don't let yourself get boxed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Having some maneuvering room will give you a chance to drive away quickly if 
someone bumps into you in a fraudulent attempt to stop you. Hotels 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get to your hotel, never say your name at the desk, Riley advised. 
Put your credit card down and say, "I have a reservation." Once a criminal 
knows your first name, he or she has a powerful weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 He or she can approach you and say, "Carol, I haven't seen you in such a long 
time." That distracts you and lowers your guard, two things a person up to no 
good can turn to advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Riley recommends that people not put their first names on their 
credit cards at all. And when a woman makes a reservation, he suggests, she 
should put Mr. in front of her name. The less you stand out as a woman 
traveling alone on business, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 If the desk clerk or person helping with your baggage asks you what you're in 
town for or what you have planned, say something noncommittal, such as, "I'm in 
town on business, thanks for asking." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, you don't want to broadcast to anyone within earshot anything about 
your plans, or where you'll be and when. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember not to sign your name and room number on the bill when you go to 
the hotel's bar or restaurant. Those checks often sit by the register, and 
anyone can see what room you're in, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 If you order room service and you're alone, don't put your tray with its one 
plate, one set of silver and one glass out in the hall when you're done. It 
advertises the fact that you're in there by yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 When you get to your room, make sure it's in a hallway where there is foot 
traffic and where you can see other doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Always keep the doors locked and never open them to anyone. Although most 
people do this intuitively at home, they may not be as careful at a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 If someone comes to the door and says he is from maintenance and wants to 
check the plumbing, the American Hotel and Motel Assn. recommends calling 
security or the front desk to verify that the hotel sent someone and to get the 
person's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The association also recommends making sure when you check in that the hotel 
will not give out any additional keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Be cautious when you enter a room. If you are alone, put your bags down 
against the door so it can't close until you are sure the room is secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, make sure the phone works by calling the front desk and asking what time 
checkout is, Riley said. "That may be your lifeline." 
</P>
<P>
 When you go out, leave the TV on and always take your key. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, use the hotel's safe deposit box for valuables, said Kathryn Cochran, 
spokeswoman for the hotel association. Better yet, don't take them with you. 
For more information, contact Applied Psychology at (800) 492-5050 or the 
American Hotel and Motel Assn. at (202) 289-3132.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; LOW-KEY STYLE EARNS VICTORY FOR VALENCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia Coach Kelly Stephenson took the low-key approach. The less her young 
team knew about the ramifications of Tuesday's game against Western, the 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't like the pressure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Coach Ron Flores was up front. "It's a must-win game for us," he said. 
"They know how important this game is." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Stephenson knew she had taken the right approach. Valencia 
virtually clinched a playoff spot by beating Western, 57-39, in the Pioneer 
gym. The Tigers (11-7, 5-2) remained tied with Magnolia for second place in the 
Orange League, behind unbeaten Brea-Olinda. The top three teams get automatic 
playoff berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Western (9-13, 3-4) dropped to two games behind Valencia and Magnolia with 
four to play. The Pioneers need help to reach the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew this could be a turning point in our season," said Valencia's Cindi 
Judd, who scored 10 first-half points as the Tigers took a 35-20 lead. "We had 
to win this game to keep our playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just came in and did what we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 What they did, specifically, was play good defense. Trailing, 16-15, after one 
quarter, they held Western to 19% shooting in the final three quarters (seven 
of 37). 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia shot 52% from the field in the first half (15 of 29) and survived a 
festival of errors in the second. The Tigers outscored Western in the third 
quarter, 6-4, as the teams combined for 20 turnovers in eight minutes. They 
combined for 17 turnovers in the fourth. There were 60 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia's LaQuinta Alexander scored a game-high 17, with 12 rebounds and four 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabel Rojas scored 16 for Western, which made one of nine shots in the 
decisive second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 63, Savanna 15 -- Andrea Picchi had 16 points and 15 rebounds, and 
Whitney Torregano had a game-high 17 points for Magnolia (14-7, 5-2). Savanna 
drops to 4-14, 1-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 112, Anaheim 23 -- Kiyoko Miller had 20 points and reserve Dawn 
Metz added 16 for top-ranked Brea-Olinda (21-0, 7-0). Brea led 59-9 at halftime 
and got 54 points from its reserves. The 112 was a season-high for the 
Ladycats. Anaheim is 5-10, 0-6.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; PHILMAN, EDISON UPSET MARINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marie Philman had 30 points to help Edison to a 66-59 upset of Marina, the 
fifth-ranked team in Orange County, in a Sunset League girls' basketball game 
Tuesday at Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped Marina's 25-game home winning streak and also dropped the 
Vikings (16-6, 9-2) into a first-place tie with Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman, a sophomore forward, set an Edison single-game record by making 16 
free throws. She made 11 of 13 free throws in the fourth quarter. Edison (14-8, 
5-6) trailed, 28-25, at the half, but the Chargers increased their defensive 
pressure and outscored Marina 23-13 in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 58, Rosary 33 -- Farrah Magee had 16 points and Jennifer Tuiolosega 
11 for host Ocean View (18-4, 9-2). Magee scored eight points in the first 
quarter, when Ocean View outscored Rosary, 22-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 56, Huntington Beach 55 -- Lisa Feng's two free throws gave 
Fountain Valley a 56-52 lead with 12 seconds left. The Barons (16-6, 8-3) were 
led by Jen Ludwicki's game-high 18 points. Renee Kimoto had 16 points for 
Huntington Beach (7-14, 3-8). 
</P>

GIRLS' SOCCER ROUNDUP; TOP-RANKED MARINA HANDLES NO. 2 EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not easy being No. 1. Just ask Bobby Bruch, girls' soccer coach at Marina 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now everyone is gunning for us, so we have to be prepared for every 
game," Bruch said."We don't want anyone to sneak back into this thing and take 
the league title away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 But after Tuesday's 1-0 victory over No. 2 Edison at Marina, the top-ranked 
Vikings (22-0-1, 9-0-1) have a tight hold on first place in the Sunset League. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina's goal came with less than 10 minutes remaining, when freshman Megan 
Orach sailed a kick over Edison goalie Kim James' head. Orach began putting 
pressure on James midway through the second half, taking four shots in a 
five-minute span. One shot went off James' head and into the goal, but it was 
nullified because of a dangerous-play penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really trying hard to get around the defenders," Orach said. "I just 
kept kicking it and I finally got one to go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (18-4-2, 8-2), which lost to Marina, 2-0, earlier in the season, had a 
final chance to tie the score with about 10 seconds remaining. But Marina 
goalie Jennifer Simmons dived to her left to make the save and seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls wanted it badly," Edison Coach Kerry McGrath said. "We played with 
them the whole game. I had a feeling it would come down to one shot, and they 
got the golden opportunity." MELANIE NEFF

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / SCOTT MILLER: AFTER FADING IN '93, PARISI IS 
PUMPED UP ABOUT NEW SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As junior right-hander Mike Parisi stepped onto the mound at Stanford's Sunken 
Diamond on Friday ready to fling the Titans into 1994, several notions flashed 
through his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Notions such as losses, inconsistency, losing concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 Things he wants to avoid. Things he learned all too much about in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi was 7-0 last season when he hit the wall. He went 3-3 in his final six 
decisions and, although his 10-3 record was impressive, the season's last few 
weeks are what he remembers most. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 10-3, but I didn't feel like I had one of my better years," Parisi 
said. "This year is going to be a lot better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason is that I learned not to let down. I've got to keep working 
hard day in and day out. Maybe I relaxed a little bit and thought, 'OK, I'm 
7-0.' Maybe I thought I wasn't going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Any thoughts of that were scotched shortly after Big West Conference play 
started and Long Beach State swept three in a row at Titan Field. Parisi was 
the losing pitcher in two of the three games, losing one as a starter and one 
in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I wanted to start over," Parisi said. "I took things a little 
differently after that." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the season, Parisi was determined to work harder than ever 
during his time off and, as 1994 dawns, he thinks he has put himself in 
position to have his strongest spring yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the best shape of my life," he said. "I worked hard, lifted weights. . 
. . I wanted to gain weight, lift the proper way. I didn't want to run too much 
because I wanted to gain weight. I'm eating right -- staying away from fast 
foods and trying to eat pastas." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, 6 feet 3, weighs 195 pounds this spring, 10 more than last. He thinks 
it will help him stay stronger. He has already seen results. His fastball, he 
says, is now in the upper 80s. Last year, it was in the low-to-mid 80s. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Parisi was the winning pitcher as the Titans opened their season 
with a victory over Stanford. In seven innings of work, Parisi allowed eight 
hits, two runs -- both earned -- and walked five. He struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
 His second start is scheduled for Friday, when Arizona opens a three-game 
series at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd just like to get better as the season goes on," Parisi said. "You set 
goals, wins and losses and earned-run average (Parisi preferred to keep them to 
himself), but I just want to work hard and help this team get back to the 
College World Series." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Further proof that the Titan football helmets will see more mothballs than mud 
next fall: National signing day is today and still no word on the future of 
Fullerton football. There is still no coach and, by not signing any players 
today, there is still no team. 
</P>
<P>
 University President Milton Gordon said in November that he would not make a 
decision until he saw Gov. Pete Wilson's budget in mid-January, and that, too, 
has come and gone. Insiders say Gordon is simply not ready to make a public 
announcement but that it could come in the next 30 to 60 days. 
</P>

 Big shots: In three weeks, the Titans will play host to the Anaheim Hilton & 
Towers Baseball Classic that will feature, among others, No. 1 Georgia Tech. On 
Feb. 25, the tournament's first day, Georgia Tech will play perennial 
powerhouse Oklahoma and the Titans will face the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Double-headers are scheduled for all three days of the tournament.

 Big shots, part deux: UCLA managed to hold off the Titan women's gymnastics 
team Friday, 192.20-188.60, but the evening went well enough that Titan Coach 
Lynn Rogers remains optimistic for the rest of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering UCLA was ranked fourth in the country last year, for us to get as 
close as we did was good news," Rogers said. "We bettered our score from the 
week before by three points and we showed progress on the uneven bars. Knock on 
wood, if we can keep this club together, we can be pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans stayed close to the Bruins even though Cristi Clifford fell during 
her last event, the floor exercise. Still, Clifford finished second overall for 
Fullerton with a score of 38.3, behind Celeste Delia's 38.675. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same ol' same ol' for us," Rogers said. "We've got a shot at being 
pretty good, getting a couple of kids to the nationals and maybe sneaking our 
team in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule doesn't get any easier for the Titans. They are at Oregon State 
this week and play host to Stanford Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Score this: One thing Rogers and his gymnasts are dealing with is a revamped 
NCAA scoring system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It demands more difficulty if you want a higher score," Rogers said. "There 
were too many 9.9s and 10s." 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton students will be admitted free to all home basketball games this 
semester. When they voted to assess themselves an extra $14 fee per semester 
that will go to the athletic department, the agreement was that students would 
be admitted free to home events beginning next year. But Athletic Director Bill 
Shumard, as a token of appreciation, wanted to admit the students free 
beginning this semester. . . . Wrestler Jeff Maes is ranked eighth in the 
country at 126 pounds. . . . The status of the women's softball game scheduled 
Feb. 13 at Cal State Northridge is up in the air because of earthquake damage 
to the Northridge campus. . . . The baseball teams plays host to Arizona at 7 
p.m. on Friday and at 1 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. . . . The softball team 
opens its season Feb. 11 at home against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

POWELL GETS 6 RBIS, TITANS RIP RIVERSIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dante Powell drove in six runs and three pitchers combined on a two-hitter as 
Cal State Fullerton beat UC Riverside, 12-1, in a nonconference baseball game 
Tuesday at Titan Field. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the home opener for Cal State Fullerton (3-1), ranked sixth in the 
nation by Baseball America. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell had a two-run double and Jim Betzsold had a two-run homer as Fullerton 
scored six runs in the sixth inning to break a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell added a three-run homer in the seventh, when the Titans took an 11-1 
lead. He also had an RBI single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Fahs, a junior right-hander, allowed a run, one hit and struck out five 
in the first four innings. Mark Kotsay, a freshman right-hander, pitched three 
hitless innings. He walked the first two in the seventh, then struck out the 
next three. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Fetchel, a senior right-hander, allowed a hit and no runs in the final 
two innings. It was the first appearance for Fetchel since the 1991 season. He 
has been slowed by an elbow injury the last two years.

 ISSUE CLOSED? Cypress Mayor Richard Partin had a unique idea for this 
Saturday's special council meeting on the budget: Hold the whole thing behind 
closed doors. Uhn-uh, said City Atty. John E. Cavanaugh: To discuss the city 
budget in private would violate the Brown Act -- a misdemeanor. . . . Partin 
had an answer for that: A misdemeanor, the mayor said, was only "a slap on the 
wrist." But other council members considered a misdemeanor a little more than 
that: Saturday's budget meeting will be open.

 TRUCK 'EM IN: Huntington Beach Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard says 
Monday's turnout of almost 600 for a hearing on development plans for the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands was the largest he's seen in his 20 years with the city. But 
then, the word got spread pretty well for this one. . . . The Bolsa Chica Land 
Trust, a major development opponent, hired a truck to drive through city 
streets to urge residents to attend. Says a spokesman: "We got lots of 
attention from people eating outside of restaurants on Main Street."

 NEW SEASON: Track star Florence Griffith Joyner of Mission Viejo will be going 
to the Winter Olympics next week. Yes, she's a Summer Olympics gold medal 
winner. But she's going to Lillehammer, Norway, at the request of President 
Clinton -- as part of the official U.S. delegation headed by Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. Joyner is co-chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and 
Sports. She'll attend opening ceremonies Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 BRACING FOR SNOW: There was a time last year when skier Donna Weinbrecht 
contemplated retirement -- because of a bad right knee injury -- instead of 
defending her Olympic gold medal at this month's Winter Olympics. But she's 
back in form, winning four 1994 World Cup races. . . . And the knee? It's being 
held in place by a special brace developed by Innovation Sports of Irvine. 
Another Innovation Sports customer who has worn the special brace: Buffalo 
Bills quarterback Jim Kelly.

 REBUILDING: Commuters don't seek any reminders of the collapse of the Golden 
State (above) and Antelope Valley freeways -- every journey on alternate routes 
is frustrating enough. Yet construction work is proceeding quickly, and 
additional detours will open later this week (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD ADVICE: We have been saddened and deeply offended by the horrible 
behavior exhibited by newcomers to Metrolink (B1). So we decided to seek 
guidance from the capital of courtesy, New York City. "Behave civilly, just as 
you would on an elevator or in a library -- anywhere where a large number of 
people get together," said Jared Lebow, director of public affairs for the New 
York City Transit Authority. Works for them, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 TRASH TALK: Nothing like a quake to create trash -- lots of it. . . . The 
amount dumped into Valley landfills and gravel pits has increased between 15% 
and 20% since the Jan. 17 temblor. So sanitation officials will take a closer 
look at hauling the rubble to a 3,000-acre landfill in East Carbon City, Utah 
(B7). 
</P>
<P>
 FIRST PRACTICE: It's tough enough to play on the road, especially against an 
opponent with a better record. . . . But that's the least of troubles for 
Kennedy High School's basketball team (7-8), which will visit Cleveland High 
(11-6) Friday. Because of quake damage -- the school remains closed -- Kennedy 
will practice today for the first time in three weeks. (C8) 
</P>
<P>
 KEEP EMBARGO: Reports indicate that President Clinton may lift the 19-year 
economic embargo against Vietnam this week. . . . That possibility deeply 
disturbs relatives of soldiers still listed as missing in action. Said Albro 
Lundy III, whose father, a former president of the student body at Van Nuys 
High, was reported lost in Laos in 1970: "If Clinton lifts it, he will have 
lied. Vietnam has not accounted for the MIAs." Michael Arkush

 THIN ICE: The 300 students in Terry Tonius' ice-skating school have followed 
intently the Tonya Harding saga, including Tuesday's guilty plea by Harding's 
ex-husband (A1). "It's gotten crazier by the day," said the instructor at the 
Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center. . . . Tonius said he hopes that the sport has 
not been given a permanent black eye. "What it boils down to is that there are 
people who are not very ethical in this world, and some of them filter into 
this sport."

 SHADOW DANCE: Today is Groundhog Day, and once again the rodent is poised to 
pop out of the ground in search of his shadow to determine the duration of 
winter. But local weather watchers put little stock in the pre-spring ritual. . 
. . "I don't know if I've ever seen a groundhog," said Tom Johnston, who 
collects weather data in Ventura. "Do we even have groundhogs here?" 
</P>

 FIRST AID: Not even a major earthquake could stop the Sierra Vista Family 
Medical Center from opening a new health clinic to serve needy east Ventura 
County residents (B4). The Simi Valley clinic opened the day after the 
6.6-magnitude Northridge quake. . . . Across the county, the Centro de Salud 
Familiar de Fillmore wasn't so lucky. It has been operating out of a trailer 
since the quake damaged its building beyond repair. "We are a clinic without a 
home," program coordinator Al Limon said. . . . Next step for Fillmore: U. S. 
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown today kicks off a temporary shelter program for 
earthquake-damaged shops.

 SETTING SAIL: Oxnard's Pacific Corinthian Yacht Club is trying to raise its 
membership to pre-recession levels. The 18-year-old club currently has 325 
members compared to a high of 500 in 1985. . . . "The economy and all sorts of 
other things have brought that down," said membership drive chairwoman Josette 
Schaffner. "We didn't join right away because we thought yacht club people 
would be snooty. Now I think it's the best thing we ever did."

SIMI BOY, 14, IS SLAIN IN STABBING AT SCHOOL; VIOLENCE: A VALLEY VIEW JUNIOR 
HIGH SCHOOLMATE, 13, IS ARRESTED. THE VICTIM WAS ATTACKED WHILE BOARDING A BUS 
FOR HOME.

<P>
 A 14-year-old Simi Valley boy was stabbed to death as he was boarding a school 
bus for home at his junior high school Tuesday, and police quickly arrested a 
13-year-old schoolmate as the suspected killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-grader Chad Patrick Hubbard -- a popular, handsome boy who pitched for 
his school baseball team -- was about to board the bus at Valley View Junior 
High School as classes ended at about 3:20 p.m., when two classmates confronted 
him, student witnesses told his uncle, Bob Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 One pulled out a knife and, with a sweep of his arm, stabbed Chad in the 
heart, Miller said the students told him. Chad later was pronounced dead at 
Simi Valley Hospital after physicians tried unsuccessfully to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad's death, apparently the first slaying ever on a Simi Valley school 
campus, staggered school and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is in shock, just total shock," said Mary Beth Wolford, 
superintendent of the Simi Valley Unified School District, after talking to 
teachers about the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely saddened by this situation, of course, and we feel that it 
certainly is an isolated incident," Wolford said after district board members 
huddled for a closed-door briefing. "There is no trend toward this in Simi 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something that happens very often in Simi Valley," said Mayor 
Greg Stratton, who learned of the slaying Tuesday afternoon in phone calls from 
Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller and City Manager Lin Koester. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to find out what caused it and what went on," Stratton 
said. "We have the person in custody, and you can be sure that we'll prosecute 
to the fullest extent of the law." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hospital's emergency room waiting area, a group of Chad's friends and 
relatives consoled each other. Half a dozen teen-age boys and one girl sobbed 
openly, their faces twisted in sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Chad's mother came out of the emergency room sobbing, they surrounded 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm going to do without him," said Jackie Hubbard, a lab 
assistant at Amgen in Newbury Park whose husband Scott is a union drywall 
finisher. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got no say-so (in his death). He was just gone," she said. "He was here 
today and now he's gone. I don't know what I'm going to do without my baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Chad was stabbed just after school ended Tuesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball coach Chris Printz said he saw the tail end of the fight and 
witnessed the stabbing. Printz said he saw the 13-year-old and a friend flee 
the scene, chased by a group of four or five boys. The two ran into the 
principal's office because they feared for their safety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortally wounded, Chad managed to walk to the nurse's office at Valley View 
Junior High School, where he collapsed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Don Gaudioso said he came upon the wounded boy as an assistant 
principal and a school nurse were trying to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
 The wound "was in the abdominal area, and it looked like it must have hit an 
artery," Gaudioso said. "I think he probably just lost so much blood." 
</P>
<P>
 An ambulance summoned by school officials rushed Chad to Simi Valley Adventist 
Hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in full cardiac arrest upon arrival at the hospital, and the doctors 
were not able to bring him back," said Lt. Dick Thomas of the Simi Valley 
police. Chad was pronounced dead at 4:30 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police answering the emergency call quickly arrested the 13-year-old suspect, 
who is being held in Ventura County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of murder. The 
eighth-grader is not being identified because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaudioso said Chad and the suspect had a history of minor disputes beginning 
early this school year, but educators did not believe it would escalate into 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just two kids that didn't really like each other, but there was no 
indication there was any real problems between them," Gaudioso said. The boys' 
disagreements ranged from dirty looks to throwing a football at each other 
during a gym class, he said. "I don't understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 One Valley View teacher said trouble between the two began a few weeks ago 
when the younger boy felt Chad had insulted him in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were probably warned to stay away from each other, and so they 
did until today," said the teacher, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad, the oldest of four siblings, was the pitcher on Valley View's baseball 
team, a member of the ninth-grade basketball team and one of the most popular 
kids in school, said Miller, his uncle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very easy to get along with and friends with everyone," Miller said. 
"His smile would light up the room."  
</P>
<P>
 Chad "was always the protector for his friends, but he wasn't looking for a 
fight," Miller added. 
</P>
<P>
 At 165 pounds and nearly 6 feet tall, Chad dreamed of a college baseball 
scholarship that could lead him to a professional career, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could touch him, he was the best," Miller said. "He would have made 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hospital waiting area, several teachers and parents tried to comfort 
Chad's distraught friends as they passed around a small pink box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boys called friends on a pay phone. Another covered his face with a 
baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for Chad's parents, they sipped water and coffee from paper cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank DiPoma, 14, a friend of Chad's, said he was still wearing the oversized 
baggy jeans and oversized purple and tan plaid flannel shirt that Chad had 
loaned to him on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday I was over at his house, and now he's gone," Frank said. "I just 
can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Unified School District officials were briefed behind closed doors 
Tuesday night on the stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 District board member Judy Barry emerged near tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think it's going to happen in our town, but unfortunately it did," 
Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Wolford said she will meet this morning with the 1,000-student 
school's entire teaching staff. She said she will arrange for counselors to be 
made available to meet with students and staff to help them cope with the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just shocking," said Peggie Noisette, a foreign language teacher at 
Valley View and president of the Simi Educators Assn. "I'm still numb. I don't 
know what to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Noisette said she had received numerous phone calls from other Valley View 
teachers who took news of Chad's death hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible, it's terrible," she said. "It shouldn't happen. I would hope 
what happens in society wouldn't be reflected in our schools, but what happens 
in the world doesn't end at our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Noisette said that from what she knows of the fight, it was apparently not 
gang-related. "It was evidently two people that just got into a fight with each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 Noisette said there have not been any gang conflicts on the Valley View campus 
in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad's death was the first schoolyard slaying in Ventura County since Nov. 22, 
1989, when Manuel (Deadeye) Rodriguez shouted gang slogans outside Channel 
Islands High School and was shot to death by Arnel Salagubang, a rival gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's slaying also was the first slaying in Simi Valley in 18 months, 
since Jon Gregory Pearce, 39, a retired Los Angeles police officer, gunned down 
his estranged wife's boyfriend on June 22, 1992, as his children watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends, relatives and teachers described Chad as a handsome, popular, 
athletic kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always a polite kid, always a pleasant kid when you talked to him," 
said physical education teacher Richard Gillespie, who taught Chad in seventh 
and eighth grades. "He didn't always do what you asked him to, but he didn't 
give you any back talk." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie said he heard there had been prior "friction" between Chad and the 
suspect. But he said it seemed out of character for the slain student to fight 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see him as an antagonistic-type kid," Gillespie said. "I would not 
place him as the type of kid that would run with a gang." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie said Chad had wanted to play freshman football this year, but didn't 
have the C average needed to quality for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad was to have played Tuesday night with the ninth-grade Valley View Vikings 
basketball team, and Athletic Director Jamie Kogut planned to break the news of 
his death to them after the game, Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad had been very popular among girls in his class because of his outgoing 
personality and handsome looks, said Lynn Miller, his aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very outgoing, well-liked, ambitious, full of energy," Miller said. 
"He was worshiped by the whole family. He was a good kid."

CONCESSION MADE IN DEATH-PENALTY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first death-penalty case in Ventura County in more than two years opened 
Tuesday with a major concession: The defendant is guilty of killing the victim 
in the case, his lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher James Sattiewhite is charged with murder, kidnaping and rape in 
connection with the Jan. 26, 1992, slaying of Genoveva Gonzales, the mother of 
four and an alleged streetwalker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite's attorney, Willard P. Wiksell, said Sattiewhite put a gun to the 
victim's head and squeezed the trigger three times, killing her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting right to the point," Wiksell told the hushed courtroom, "the evidence 
will be that Mr. Sattiewhite did shoot Genoveva Gonzales." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell denied, however, that Sattiewhite kidnaped and raped the woman and 
said that the defendant should be found guilty of no more than second-degree 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have charged that Sattiewhite shot the woman in the commission of 
a rape and murder and should be found guilty of first-degree murder and a 
special allegation that could send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn told the jury of 
nine women and three men that Sattiewhite deserves to be convicted of the most 
severe charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn portrayed Sattiewhite as a callous man who helped abduct Gonzales off 
the streets of Oxnard and stood by as an accomplice repeatedly raped the woman. 
Glynn said Sattiewhite cruised the city in a Cadillac as the other man, 
Frederick Jackson, raped Gonzales in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who is in prison on a separate case, has not been charged in 
Gonzales' rape and slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Glynn's opening statement, Gonzales, who was 4-foot-10 and 105 
pounds, was accosted by Sattiewhite and Jackson somewhere in the city after she 
left a 5th Street bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said one of his main witnesses will be Bobby Rollins, a former friend of 
Sattiewhite. Rollins will testify that he saw Jackson raping and striking 
Gonzales, Glynn said, and that he saw Sattiewhite with the gun at the scene 
after shooting the woman and dumping her body. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that Sattiewhite's ex-girlfriend will testify that the defendant 
called her after the shooting and admitted the slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 "He said to his girlfriend, 'Fred raped the lady and (Sattiewhite) called out 
his name,' and Fred told him to kill her," Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell said the prosecution's theory of the case involving a rape and 
kidnaping "is just flat wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell said Gonzales was a drug addict and prostitute, well known in Oxnard 
for trading sex for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The night she was killed, he said, Gonzales went to the 5th Street bar. While 
at the bar, he said, she choked one man and had to be pulled from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was known to be very aggressive," Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said she got into the car Sattiewhite was driving because she knew Jackson. 
He said Jackson struck a deal to provide Gonzales with drugs in exchange for 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 After consenting to sex, Gonzales became upset when Jackson reneged on his 
promise to give her narcotics, Wiksell told the jury. The two of them fought, 
he said, and Jackson ordered Sattiewhite to shoot the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a crime, and I expect you will find him guilty of something," 
Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell also attacked the credibility of Sattiewhite's former friend, Rollins. 
Glynn had already told the jury that prosecutors agreed to allow 30 years to be 
shaved off a 50-year sentence Rollins could have gotten in a separate case in 
exchange for his testimony against Sattiewhite. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell said Rollins was in the car with Sattiewhite before Gonzales was shot. 
He said in addition to lesser sentence in the other case, Rollins is testifying 
in the Sattiewhite case because prosecutors did not charge him in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lied and distanced himself completely, so he could walk away from this, 
and they (prosecutors) bought it hook, line and sinker," Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Sattiewhite's brother-in-law, Wayne Walker, a 32-year-old 
former pro football player, complained about the makeup of the jury. There are 
no blacks on the jury. Sattiewhite is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, 2% of the population is black and 26% is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife, 'We don't have a chance,' " said Walker, holding his 
2-month-old daughter, Raven. "It's a no-win situation. That's prejudice right 
there. I don't see how my brother-in-law has a fair chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said only two blacks were in the jury pool. One asked to be excused 
for hardship reasons. The other was excluded by the prosecution. The defense 
said it filed a motion charging that minorities were systematically removed by 
the prosecution.

ROCKED BUT STILL PRINTING; MEDIA: FILLMORE'S HISTORIC HERALD AND NEWCOMER 
GAZETTE COMPETE FROM STAFFERS' HOMES AFTER QUAKE WRECKS OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the biggest story ever to hit Fillmore. But the earthquake Jan. 17 
almost wiped out the two locally owned weekly newspapers struggling to make it 
in this town of about 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The 87-year-old Fillmore Herald and its 5-year-old upstart competitor, the 
Fillmore Gazette, were forced into the homes of staff members because of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've both been knocked out of our offices, but we're still publishing," said 
Martin Farrell, the 55-year-old publisher of the Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 With its building condemned, the paper's staff of five has just finished its 
second post-quake edition from the crowded garage of its photographer, John 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tougher than you think in a small town," said Farrell after an 
exhausting 24-hour writing and paste-up session. "We compete for everything 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The competition to meet deadlines and scoop the Gazette has sent Fillmore 
Herald publisher and editor Doug Huff, 48, into his own round-the-clock 
schedule. Huff also was sure he would keep churning out the news, despite the 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Herald has survived for 87 years," Huff said. "We're not going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up to stress from both the quake and the competition, neither 
publisher seems to be anywhere near stopping the presses. Even with their 
offices in ruins, the only thing on their minds was getting out the news. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Gazette was located on the ground floor of the Masonic Building, which was 
damaged so severely that it probably will be demolished. In the few hours after 
the quake, Farrell and Stewart were able to pull computers out of the damaged 
office, along with enough equipment to set up shop in Stewart's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage at the Herald was much less extensive, but it forced the staff out 
of its office and into Huff's home a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a board propped on four milk crates to hold three computers, and a 
sliding glass door from his patio to paste up pages, the Herald is managing 
just fine, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But both papers, which come out each Thursday, were hard-pressed to meet their 
Wednesday night deadline after Monday's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we couldn't do anything on Monday because we had no power," Huff 
said. "And on Tuesday we had to move everything from the office to my home, so 
we didn't get started on the paper until Tuesday night. We had to work the next 
26 hours to meet that Wednesday deadline." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day the newspapers came out they were passed around at the City Council 
meeting as residents studied pictures looking for their own faces or those of 
acquaintances.  
</P>
<P>
 Both papers sold record numbers. Farrell said the Gazette sold about 4,000 
papers, while Huff said he sold about 6,000. Each paper normally has a press 
run of about 3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have about 50 left," Huff said of his earthquake issue.  
</P>
<P>
 News-hungry Fillmore residents, amazed that the two papers have survived the 
last five years of heated competition, are impressed that the papers are 
publishing after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how they've done it," said Jesse Segovia, owner of Segovia's 
Fillmore Market. "Really, there's not enough advertising for both of them, yet 
they continue to publish . . . and now it's going to be doubly hard with 
everyone knocked out of business by the quake." 
</P>
<P>
 While Farrell grew up on a ranch in Camarillo, he got most of his newspaper 
experience from running small-town papers in Idaho and Washington. He decided 
to come back to Ventura County a little over five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked Fillmore because it's changed so little since the 1950s," he said. 
"It's a beautiful place, and I decided I wanted to work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell tried to buy the Herald in 1988, an act Huff still hasn't forgiven him 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man had no business coming here," said Huff, who grew up in Orange County 
and managed newspapers in the Chowchilla Valley before coming to Ventura County 
in 1981. He bought the Herald in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only kicked someone out of my office twice, and both times it was 
Farrell. The proposition he made and the way he made it was so outrageous, you 
wouldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell shrugs this criticism off, saying he is just interested in putting out 
his paper.  
</P>
<P>
 While the Herald has been around since 1907, it stopped printing the city's 
legal notices two years ago because "we're not City Hall's puppy dog," Huff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people won't even look at the Herald anymore," said Ken Glenn, the 
president of the Fillmore Masonic Temple Assn., which owns the building where 
the Gazette was located. "I think they've rubbed people the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen McKinnon, who manages Fillmore Realty, said he likes the Gazette 
because it has a better layout and a little more class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gazette leans more toward niceness, while the Herald plays up their front 
page to sell newspapers," he said. "But I like the fact that we have two 
newspapers here. I love the competition, because I get a better price for my 
ads." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have said they are sticking with the Herald because it's the town's 
original newspaper. Both papers are fighting for every reader they can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to do the best we can do, but I don't suspect we'll both be here for 
the next five years," said Farrell. "The people of Fillmore will probably 
decide which paper survives."

COUNTY WANTS RADAR TOWER TO BE MOVED; OJAI: SUPERVISORS, CITING RESIDENTS' 
CONCERNS, PASS RESOLUTION SEEKING RELOCATION OF THE WEATHER SERVICE'S MOUNTAIN 
FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the urging of angry upper Ojai residents, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors passed a resolution on Tuesday asking the National Weather Service 
to relocate its giant radar tower on Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors said they believe that the federal government failed to 
address the health and environmental concerns of the residents when it built 
the 98-foot weather-tracking station last month on the mountain overlooking the 
rural Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of questions that have been left unanswered," said Supervisor 
Maggie Kildee. "People have major concerns about health and they have concerns 
about how it looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's caused a great deal of consternation. People feel their little community 
has been violated." 
</P>
<P>
 The tower, which resembles a large black ball balanced atop a scaffold, was 
built virtually overnight on a steep ridge off Sulphur Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service officials, who plan to use the radar system to 
predict the weather for the entire Los Angeles basin, informed the supervisors 
in 1992 that they would build the tower when they relocated their headquarters 
from Los Angeles to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents along the mountain road said they knew nothing of the plan until 
they saw the large structure -- dubbed the "black orb" -- looming above their 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 They have since sued the federal government for failing to properly notify 
them of the project or conduct adequate tests to determine the tower's safety. 
Although the residents had requested that the county join them in the federal 
lawsuit, the supervisors opted against the move, saying the resolution passed 
Tuesday would be just as effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is scheduled to be heard Friday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 While federal officials acknowledge that the system emits low-level radiation 
that some studies have linked to leukemia, they believe the tower will not 
cause any harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Donna Everett said the government stands behind its 
decision to build the station on Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a team of scientists from Stanford research this," Everett said. 
"There have been no findings of adverse effects on people and the environment. 
It simply is not there." 
</P>
<P>
 But area residents and members of the Board of Supervisors said Tuesday that 
they are not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cannot guarantee that our children will be safe," said David Hedman, 
co-chairman of the citizens' group fighting the project. "We do not want our 
community used as guinea pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Fuller, who lives next to the tower, told the board that she is scared 
to raise her children, ages 10 and 11, in the shadow of the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I planned on raising these children on this mountain for the rest of my 
life," she said, choking back tears. "I don't want to move." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors said they were surprised at the enormity of the radio tower, 
which is scheduled to be turned on next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When weather service officials appeared before the board in 1992, they told 
the supervisors the tower would be painted dark green to blend in with the 
trees. However, the station was made so large it can be seen from Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just dumbfounded," Kildee said. "The pictures that I see (of the tower) 
are not what I was envisioning there when we were told it would be unobtrusive 
and blend in with the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan K. Lacey added: "Maybe if we grew big, black trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee said she believes the board measure will send a strong message to 
federal officials to move the tower. She is also calling on the county to hold 
a public hearing so residents can express their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to feel that government can be responsive," Kildee said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STRONG GUSTS REPORTED IN PARTS OF COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blustery winds blew across Ventura County on Tuesday, with gusts of more than 
40 m.p.h. reported in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been blowing a good 20 knots and gusting to 30 knots most of the day," 
said Jim Chase, deputy harbor master for the Ventura Port District. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the winds and a small-craft advisory posted in the waters off 
Ventura as of 10 a.m., Chase said few ventured out of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a few fishing boats go out and they've returned," he said Tuesday 
afternoon. "There's not one boat to be seen outside the harbor now, they're 
just staying in." 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the wind caused city officials to close a temporary collection 
center set up outside City Hall so residents could drop off quake-related 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, there was just a lot of lightweight debris blowing onto people 
trying to drop things off and out into the street," Assistant City Manager Mike 
Sedell said. "The wind was so strong that we felt for safety reasons it would 
be best to close it down and refer people to the (Simi Valley) landfill." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Wofford, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard, 
said gusts of 43 m.p.h. were reported in Camarillo, with winds in the 30s 
reported across most of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong air currents were caused by the combination of a high pressure 
system parked over the Southwest and low pressure off the coast. As the high 
pressure system weakened late Tuesday, Wofford said, the winds were expected to 
die down. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter air service out of Oxnard Airport was not affected by the gusts, 
officials said, but many recreational fliers found themselves grounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody flying today, it's bumpy and it's just no fun," said Jack 
Felker, Santa Paula Airport manager. "We like to fly on nice, sunny days -- 
smooth days." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Sheldon, owner of Bob's Tree Service in Simi Valley, said the wind forced 
him to cancel many of his appointments because of safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could be working underneath a dangerous tree," Sheldon said. "The wind 
might torque a branch and it'll come down on top of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sheldon wasn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creates work for us in the long run, but it messes up our schedule for 
today," he said. "It's just too windy. My crew gets nervous with the gusty 
winds, so we don't get too much accomplished." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AMTRAK ADDS 3RD ROUND-TRIP TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to help ease traffic congestion caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
Amtrak has added a daily round-trip afternoon train to its San Diego-Santa 
Barbara route. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, which began service Tuesday, joins Amtrak's morning and evening 
service on the San Diegan corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying more than 1 million passengers a year, the line is the second-busiest 
intercity rail service in the country, spokesman Robert Kollmar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak's new afternoon train arrives in Simi Valley at 2:55 p.m., Moorpark at 
3:13, Oxnard at 3:33, Ventura at 3:47 and Santa Barbara at 4:35. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading toward San Diego, the train arrives in Ventura at 2:21 p.m., Oxnard at 
2:35, Moorpark at 2:58 and Simi Valley at 3:16. 
</P>
<P>
 The midday train is designed to meet the needs of travelers whose schedules 
don't match with Metrolink, the commuter train service that runs from Moorpark 
and Simi Valley into Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our patrons are the non-commuter travelers going shopping or to the 
zoo or to a special meeting," Kollmar said. "Our trains fit in with their 
schedules."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ANGRY TEACHERS TAKE PROTEST TO COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Venting their frustrations over stalled contract negotiations, scores of 
Ventura County's community college teachers angrily confronted district 
trustees on the steps of the district administration office Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at 6 p.m. for the closed portion of their monthly board meeting, the 
five trustees found they first had to fight their way through crowds of faculty 
members waving picket signs and demanding to know when their contract dispute 
will be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to let them know that there's not going to be any business as 
usual at this district until we settle the contract," said John Wagner, a 
Ventura College instructor. "We've seen chancellors and trustees come and go in 
this district when they don't treat their employees right. They're expendable." 
</P>
<P>
 College Trustee Gregory P. Cole dismissed the faculty protest as an 
insignificant factor in his outlook on contract negotiations. "I don't think it 
has any effect at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pete Tafoya, another trustee, said he hopes teachers and administrators 
will soon return to the bargaining table. "I respect their position," he said 
of the protesters. "I hear them." 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers and the district began negotiating the 1993-94 contract last 
April. The talks broke down early in the fall and the two parties have not met 
at the negotiating table since November. 
</P>
<P>
 The faculty, which has not had a raise since the 1990-91 school year, has 
asked for a 3% raise and a cost-of-living increase. The district wants to keep 
teachers' salaries at their present levels while cutting health benefits and 
asking for other job concessions.  
</P>
<P>
 With contracts talks at an impasse, the faculty union had also planned 
separate, informational pickets at each college for Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A fierce, cold wind, however, kept all but the most determined teachers 
indoors at Moorpark and Ventura colleges, teachers said. A protest at Oxnard 
College was canceled after the organizers got sick, union representatives said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to suffer for the cause," joked Richard Edwards, a Moorpark College 
English teacher, as he passed out pamphlets to students and shivered from the 
wind chill. 
</P>
<P>
 But while passionate instructors scuttled their coffee and lunch breaks to 
distribute flyers, many students at the colleges said they still did not know 
what the protests were about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to wait to hear the other side of the story," said Bobbie Lopez, a 
Moorpark College student holding a white and black pamphlet outlining the 
teachers' grievances. "This is the first I ever heard of it." CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ANIMAL SHELTERS OFFER ASSISTANCE 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County Humane Society and county Animal Regulation Department 
officials said Tuesday that they will clear space in their kennels for stray 
Los Angeles-area dogs and cats found during the confusion of the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Jenks, director of the county's Animal Regulation Department, said that 
because Los Angeles city animal shelters have been overwhelmed by stray dogs 
and cats found after the quake, she will make room for the animals at the 
department's facility in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are having to place three and four dogs in a cage built for two animals 
down there," Jenks said. "It's a really bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Ventura County Humane Society shelter director Jolene Hoffman said 
her Ojai-based facility will clear space for pets picked up by Los Angeles 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to help," Hoffman said. "But this really points out the need for 
pet owners to get tags on their animals. Often during an earthquake, animals 
will just take off running. They're often totally freaked." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles City Animal Shelter said shelter officials 
would meet today to decide whether to take up the Ventura County shelters' 
offers of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenks and Hoffman said their shelters helped reunite several dozen Ventura 
County pet owners with their animals after the quake, and only a few animals in 
each facility still remain to be claimed. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGES TALLY UP EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District sustained about $618,000 in 
damage from last month's earthquake, with the bulk occurring at Moorpark 
College's library and gymnasium, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money to pay for the repairs should come from federal and state disaster 
funds, district officials say. Until that money arrives, the district may have 
to dig into its $2-million reserves to pay the contractor bills, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the gym classroom space at Moorpark College reopened Monday after being 
cordoned off since the Jan. 17 quake, said Ray Di Guilio, the college's vice 
president for administrative services. The gym floor itself should be ready for 
use by Saturday, when Moorpark College's basketball team is scheduled to host 
Ventura College, Di Guilio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other Moorpark College building that received substantial damage was 
the library. Its classroom and lab space have been open since last week, Di 
Guilio said, but the library itself remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers are testing the stability of the stucco ceiling over the study 
cubicles and copying and typing centers, Di Guilio said. If the ceiling appears 
in no danger of collapsing, the college will hang plastic sheeting across it, 
allow students in the library and fix the cosmetic damage later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ceiling is more fragile, college officials will cover it with plywood 
and move the study center to a trailer, Di Guilio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst-case scenario -- that the college would close the library down 
entirely and, pending major repair efforts, remove books as well as the study 
center -- is unlikely at this point, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other significant building damage at the district is in the gym at 
Ventura College, where some concrete broke off and fell, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Though the building is still usable, the damage will cost about $50,000 to 
repair. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OIL SPILL CLEANUP NEARS COMPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State wildlife officials declared the cleanup of an oil spill at McGrath Lake 
to be 90% complete Tuesday. The only remaining question is the potential 
contamination of sediment at the bottom of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sediment samples are still being analyzed. But those samples are not likely to 
show enough contamination to warrant excavation, said Heidi Togstad, 
environmental specialist with the California Department of Fish and Game's oil 
spill prevention and response office. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials discovered on Christmas Day that a broken pipeline had spilled more 
than 84,000 gallons of crude oil onto the beach and wetlands and into the lake 
near McGrath State Beach. About 215 birds and other animals were found dead in 
the area after the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry Petroleum said in a report issued Jan. 21 that the cause of the spill 
was still unknown. But the Regional Water Quality Control Board has asked for 
further information. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, cleanup continued in the Santa Clara River east of Piru, where a 
pipeline that ruptured during the Jan. 17 earthquake spilled 214,000 gallons of 
crude. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup is about 25% complete, said Fish and Game spokesman Bob 
Schlicting. Atlantic Richfield, parent company of Four Corners Pipeline, still 
has 524 people working at the site to collect the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still places where there are pretty thick concentrations of oil," 
Schlicting said. "There are also some areas where the oil has seeped deep into 
the ground and possibly into the ground-water table." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup is expected to continue there for at least a few more weeks, he said. 
Wildlife officials have collected 645 dead fish, 31 dead birds and another 25 
oiled birds. JOANNA M. MILLER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA/OXNARD; SUPERVISORS RATIFY GREENBELT ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to ratify an 
agreement to establish a greenbelt between Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the plan an important step in preserving precious agricultural land, 
the supervisors signed off on the deal that would protect 4,575 acres along the 
coast between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will now be forwarded to the county's Local Agency Formation 
Commission for final consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Oxnard and Ventura officials decided to draft an accord to 
protect the land, now mostly used for farming. Both cities pledged not to annex 
the properties or allow development there. The move, however, required the 
approval of the supervisors, because the land is in an unincorporated county 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee told the board, "It's imperative that the 
policy-makers send a strong message to the public: Agriculture is very 
important to this county." TINA DAUNT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; GAY EMPLOYEE BACK AT WORK FOR NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An openly gay civilian employee at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station 
has returned to work, ending eight months of unpaid leave he took in response 
to alleged harassment and physical threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Swann, 35, accepted an agreement to return to the base reached last 
week by his American Civil Liberties Union lawyers and the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year base employee and a former Marine Corps sergeant, Swann voluntarily 
left his position as a program analyst in the Strike Systems Department after 
allegedly being harassed because of his sexual orientation and because of his 
support for lifting the ban against homosexuals in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 "I salute the Navy for accommodating my request to find a safe work 
environment," said Swann, a Port Hueneme resident.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to be back." 
</P>
<P>
 Swann's will be a program analyst in the base comptroller's office. He will 
retain his civil service rank and will earn between $35,300 and $46,200 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy spokesman Alan Alpers said Swann's return Monday was brought about under 
his rights guaranteed by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The act 
guarantees that employers must provide "reasonable accommodations" to employees 
suffering from certain physical or mental disabilities. Swann's doctors 
diagnosed him as suffering from a stress disorder brought on by the alleged 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy that he is back to work," Alpers said. "It's encouraging that he 
has agreed that this new work environment meets his needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Still to be negotiated, however, are issues of back pay, restoration of leave 
time, workers' compensation payments and medical and legal fees, said ACLU 
lawyer Alan Friel. J.E. MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving forward after months of delays, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday approved an agreement to purchase a building owned by Texaco for the 
new site of the west Ventura public health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that environmental concerns at the site would be addressed, the 
supervisors voted unanimously to purchase the building at 133 W. Santa Clara 
St. for $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Public works officials told the board on Tuesday that after extensive 
negotiations Texaco agreed to pay to remove asbestos ceiling tiles and clean up 
soil contamination from underground fuel tanks at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The building will serve as the new site for the West Ventura Family Care 
Clinic, now operating in tight quarters at 110 N. Olive St. in Ventura. TINA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDY ASKED ON NEON SIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reluctant to impose hastily drafted regulations on local businesses, the 
Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday decided to refer the issue of neon signs 
to a committee for further study. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members indicated their desire to regulate the number and size 
of neon advertising signs, which they said have proliferated over the last 
several years.But they agreed with Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski that a committee 
of citizens, business representatives and city officials should analyze the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing city codes contain no mention of neon signs. To date, the glowing 
advertisements have been considered window signs, which do not require permits 
and can be displayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 But, after studying one citizen's exhaustive list of 318 neon advertisements 
on three main roads, council members decided to consider adding new 
restrictions to the city's sign ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in favor of a whole lot of business regulation, but we need to have 
some uniformity," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said before the meeting. STEPHANIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; $10,000 DEAL WITH FORMER OFFICIAL OKD

<P>
 The city of Oxnard agreed Tuesday to pay its former city manager $10,000 to 
help plan a proposed new redevelopment area, despite objections from several 
residents who opposed the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the Oxnard Redevelopment Agency, the City Council approved the 
$10,000 agreement with Hazen Associates to assist the city in the early stages 
of evaluating a new project area north of downtown.The company is headed by 
Vernon Hazen, who retired as city manager late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Fernandez, one of several residents who opposed the contract, said a 
conflict existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Keni Hayes, another resident who objected to the arrangement, questioned why 
Hazen did not stay as city manager to finish the project himself. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Thomas Frutchey said the decision to hire Hazen was a simple 
matter of saving money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking advantage of his expertise," Frutchey said about his 
predecessor. "This will be a short-term involvement by someone of high skill 
who can help us out without hiring someone full time." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gary Gillig said there was no conflict of interest. PATRICK

CONTROL OVER LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1957, Ayn Rand said: "The only power any government has is the power to 
crack down on criminals . . . when there aren't enough criminals, one makes 
them. One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for 
men to live without breaking laws. . . . But just pass the kind of laws that 
can neither be observed nor enforced nor objectively interpreted, and you 
create a nation of lawbreakers. . . . And then you cash in on guilt."Read 
"Atlas Shrugged" from the perspective of what the government is doing to us 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the installation of the radar weather station on Sulphur 
Mountain Road in Ojai is more far-reaching than it appears. The decision will 
affect the nation, not just the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so many laws being enacted to control every aspect of our lives that 
our freedom is being insidiously eroded. Unless we stand up to government 
agencies that are functioning for their convenience, rather than our benefit, 
we are going to find that all our rights have been legislated away. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Sulphur Mountain have had to blockade, hire attorneys and beg 
representatives for their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was the project done in secrecy? Why has the government flaunted its power 
with such blatant disregard for the concerns of the residents? What moral and 
ethical right does a government have to confiscate property for such a purpose? 
And why should I feel fear in writing a letter such as this? 
</P>
<P>
 This situation will become a political tool. How our representatives handle it 
should be remembered at election time.

SIMI PUBLIC HEALTH CLINIC MOVES TO BIGGER, MORE ADVANCED SITE; MEDICINE: THE 
NEW CENTER, WHICH BOASTS 17 EXAM ROOMS, AN URGENT CARE FACILITY AND AN ON-SITE 
LAB, TENDS TO THE NEEDY.

<P>
 After two decades of cramped quarters, short hours and near-closure, the Simi 
Valley public health clinic has moved to a state-of-the-art site, promising 
prompt and thorough care to an escalating number of needy east Ventura County 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 More than twice the size of its predecessor, the 8,000-square-foot Sierra 
Vista Family Medical Center opened recently in an airy storefront at Alamo and 
Tapo streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the clinic, which boasts 17 exam rooms, an urgent care center and 
an on-site lab, said they hope to boost the yearly patient load from 2,400 to 
24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're facing is a growing number of poor people who can't get basic 
care," Dr. Nat Baumer said. "Our goal is to help people get better care closer 
to home." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumer, who heads the emergency room at Ventura County Medical Center, will 
oversee operations at the new clinic, along with his wife, Dr. Joanie Baumer. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 patients sought treatment at the clinic in its first week of 
operation, although only eight of the clinic's exam rooms were in use and a 
some stretchers were still wrapped in plastic.  
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with demand, Baumer said he plans to hire another physician within 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of the clinic's patients are on Medi-Cal, the state health program 
for the poor and elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't anybody in the east county taking people in Medi-Cal," said 
Dr. W. Stanley Su, one of two family practitioners at Sierra Vista. "It's a 
much-needed service out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Lynn Firla, 41, heard about the clinic from her doctor at 
the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Firla, who is on Medi-Cal, said she had been traveling to the Ventura hospital 
to avoid the overcrowding at the old Simi clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was small and dirty," said Firla, who brought her 10-year-old daughter, 
Melanie Minetti, to the new clinic for a strep throat exam. "By the time you 
were able to get in, you were either so sick you just went to the hospital or 
you didn't bother to go at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Vista, which provides prenatal care, checkups and general medical 
treatment, is the only clinic of its kind in the east county. A tiny part-time 
Moorpark clinic closed in November after it suffered severe water damage when a 
pipe burst. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Simi clinic, originally opened as a full-time center, was cut back to 
a part-time schedule in the late 1970s when health funds came up short. Then, 
during a health budget crisis in 1987, community outcry saved the clinic from 
shutting down for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of Medi-Cal recipients in the east county mushroomed 
from fewer than 1,000 to more than 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, as part of a larger effort to improve health care for poor 
residents, the Board of Supervisors gave Sierra Vista $528,000 to help get the 
new Simi clinic up and running 45 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing comprehensive health care, the clinic plans to offer 
health and nutrition education classes and free immunizations to infants and 
schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, the county has opened similar family care clinics 
in Oxnard, Ventura and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 A 5,000-square-foot clinic is under construction on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in 
Thousand Oaks and a smaller clinic is being planned for Moorpark on Los Angeles 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make sure that we provide care for the poor with dignity," 
county hospital Administrator Pierre Durand said. "There's no reason why we 
could not have a place we could all feel very proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the clinics, which are funded largely through Medi-Cal, 
turn a profit by operating under contract to physician groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the leaseholder, the county sets up the clinic and does the improvements," 
Supervisor Vicky Howard said. "The physicians accept some of the liability." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics operate independently as satellites of Ventura County Medical 
Center. Physicians from the clinics form a pool to answer calls during 
off-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Monday morning, Su said he was already worn out -- he was on call all 
day Sunday and ended up delivering three babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be tiring, but it's good because you are giving care to people who 
really need it," Su said. "And it's comprehensive, so we take care of 
everything." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Vista Family Medical Center is at 4531 Alamo St. in Simi Valley. It 
is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. For more information, call 
584-4885.

OFFICIAL DOUBTS THAT COUNTY MEDICAL CENTER NEEDS A NEW WING; HEALTH: SPOKESMAN 
FOR A PRIVATE VENTURA HOSPITAL SAYS THE $46-MILLION PROPOSAL IS A PLOY TO 
COMPETE FOR PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spokesman for a private Ventura hospital has questioned the need for a major 
new wing at the nearby Ventura County Medical Center, insisting that the 
proposal is part of an aggressive county plan to compete for patients and not 
just treat the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no legislative mandate for the county to engage in the private 
practice of medicine," said Donald L. Benton, spokesman for Community Memorial 
Hospital's board of trustees. "If the private sector can provide what is 
necessary, then I would rather see tax dollars go to libraries and fire 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
 Benton said the county is pushing a $46.7-million renovation and expansion at 
the medical center even though beds in local private hospitals are only half 
full and despite the possibility that universal health care proposed by 
President Clinton could make the current public system obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much change in the air, "what we're saying is that there should be 
more investigation of how to meet the county's needs with facilities that 
already exist . . . instead of rushing into an expenditure of this kind," he 
said in an interview Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton's comments echoed his statements Monday at a hearing before the county 
Public Facilities Corp. That agency's approval is required before the county 
can sell bonds to pay for improvements at the aging county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Supervisors approved the construction program in concept 
last month. But county officials said the supervisors are not expected to 
approve the sale of bonds to pay for much of the construction until mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillipp K. Wessels, head of the county Health Care Agency, said the county 
has never sought private patients and has no plan to compete for them against 
private doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a chart that Benton released, which outlines possible expanded county 
hospital services to patients with private insurance, is not a county document. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've thoroughly researched this personally, and no one in the Health Care 
Agency or the (county) hospital created that chart," Wessels said. "I have no 
idea where it came from. It did not come from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels said he thought this week's dispute -- which has simmered behind the 
scenes for months -- is the result of enormous financial problems in the 
private health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments to hospitals and doctors are down dramatically, as much as 50% for 
some physicians, because of the pressure from health maintenance organizations 
to keep costs down, Wessels said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going through a shakeout in this industry very similar to the shakeout 
in the airline and savings-and-loan industries," he said. "So what we're 
hearing from other hospitals is that we should fill up their beds and pay them 
millions of dollars. I would do the same thing if I was in their shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 The rumble is loudest from Community Memorial, which is just three blocks away 
from the county medical center in central Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hospitals have quietly coexisted for years, with Community Memorial 
treating relatively few Medi-Cal and indigent patients, which make up the bulk 
of those cared for at the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial's Benton said the county hospital and its network of 
clinics have provided an effective safety net for the county's poor. But he 
took exception to what he sees as a rush to build costly new structures in an 
era of shrunken public budgets and nationwide change. 
</P>
<P>
 "There exists in the city of Ventura more bricks and mortar (in existing 
clinics and hospitals) than are possibly going to be needed in the future," he 
said. But no long-term arrangements to share private facilities have been 
studied by the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the $38-million cost of a new 100,000-square-foot outpatient 
clinic and parking garage at the medical center is far too high. Memorial 
recently spent just $16.5 million for a facility three-fourths as large, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the 70% state funding county officials are counting on for the 
new clinic is anything but a sure thing, and no funding for such projects is in 
Gov. Pete Wilson's next budget, Benton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels said his agency could pay the $3.8-million annual payment on new 
construction out of operating revenue if state reimbursements dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the county rushing to build, he said. It must submit engineering 
studies for the new facilities to the state by July 1 to qualify for state 
funding, he said, but no construction could begin for at least a year after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 So county supervisors will have the next 18 months to decide whether Clinton's 
proposed reforms will have much effect on California's Medi-Cal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Wessels said the Clinton package, even if approved, will have almost no effect 
on Medi-Cal, since the President's reforms focus on providing health care to 
the working poor, not those already covered by Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's construction plan includes a five-story, $8-million parking 
garage and three new buildings with 144,000 square feet of space -- the 
$29.5-million outpatient clinic, a $6.8-million, 48-bed mental health hospital, 
and a $2.4-million coroner's office and morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 Of that $46.7-million package, funding exists for $13.2 million but the rest 
would have to be financed through the sale of bonds, with a probable 70% 
reimbursement from the state, Wessels said.

PRAISE FOR STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to publicly thank all of the employees, physicians and auxiliary 
members who gave so generously of themselves Monday, Jan. 17, following the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a true testimony of commitment and selflessness when those you work with 
leave their families and homes to come to the aid of those in need. 
</P>
<P>
 We were fortunate. The hospital suffered no structural damage. Our emergency 
generators kicked in immediately. There was no panic. Our staff reacted to the 
disaster in the most professional way. 
</P>
<P>
 Our emergency room saw five times the number of patients as seen on a typical 
Monday. Physicians in all specialties simply showed up. Not one needed 
physician or employee was called in to help -- they were already here.

WETLANDS LAW NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks must have a new wetlands ordinance, and that proposed by Mayor 
Elois Zeanah is our best chance. When this ordinance came before the City 
Council late last year, it was the subject of inappropriate and inaccurate 
comments by council members Frank Schillo, Judy Lazar and Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 This was difficult to understand because these council members claim they 
trust their staff, and staff pleaded strongly in support of the ordinance. 
Instead of supporting the draft ordinance, Schillo, Lazar and Fiore berated it 
as another layer of bureaucratic red tape. I believe it would have the opposite 
effect, and would clarify for developers what they can and cannot do on a given 
piece of land before they have spent time drawing plans that will not be 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 I was also surprised by Councilman Fiore's statements that wetlands in 
Thousand Oaks have never been impacted by development. Mr. Fiore should take 
another look around his city. By way of example, one only needs to look at the 
northeast corner of Lynn Road and Wendy Drive. A lovely stream once ran along 
Wendy with trees and riparian wildlife. It is now 20 feet under concrete and 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Zeanah's new ordinance is overdue. Other cities already have 
similar ordinances. It is in line with Gov. Wilson's wetlands policy for the 
state of California, which calls not only for no further loss of wetlands but 
for wetlands restoration. Developers must respect the concerns of our community 
regarding these sensitive areas.

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; 6 TAKE OUT NOMINATING PAPERS, MAKING NOVEMBER 
RUNOFF LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six people have taken out papers to run for the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors seat being vacated by Maria VanderKolk, setting the stage for a 
hotly contested race that could force a runoff between the two leading 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if only three or four candidates compete in the June election, it would 
probably force a runoff between the two top vote getters in the November 
general election, said Bruce Bradley, the county's chief election official. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a foregone conclusion," Bradley said. "Anytime there is three or 
more candidates in the race, it's hard for one to get 50% of the vote. And in 
this race you have some very well-known, very viable candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bradley cautioned that it is very early in the campaign and that those who 
have taken out nomination papers still have the option of not entering the 
race. The candidates have until March 11 to file the forms, which require 2,582 
signatures from registered voters or a filing fee of $645. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said some of those who have pulled papers may simply be testing the 
waters to see if they have a real shot at the supervisorial seat representing 
the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme. VanderKolk announced in December that she 
would not seek a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The six candidates who have taken out nomination papers are Thousand Oaks 
Councilman Frank Schillo, former Ventura County Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer, 
taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings, Corrections Officer David Goodman and Oak 
Park Municipal Advisory Council members Ron Stark and J. Paul Fredericks. 
Dennis Gillette, vice president of administration at Cal Lutheran University, 
had picked up nomination papers but has decided not to enter the race, he said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he does not expect all of those who pulled nomination papers to 
stay in the race. And even if they do, he said, "I'm not going to worry" about 
getting in a runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Schillo and Robings said a runoff would mean a costlier campaign. In 
order to win, both said a candidate would have to raise about $100,000, and 
they were each capable of doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer, Stark and Fredericks were unavailable for immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, a resident of Port Hueneme making his first bid for public office, 
said that the crowded field of candidates only boosted his long-shot chances at 
the supervisor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more people who run, the better it is for me," he said. "The vote is 
going to be split." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Goodman said he may drop out of the race if his issues are being 
addressed by one of the other candidates. He said his main concern is that Port 
Hueneme is not adequately represented, and that more attention is paid to the 
wealthy Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lack of representation for Port Hueneme," he said. "It's not an 
equitable situation." Goodman said he would probably make a decision about his 
candidacy in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Robings and Schillo said that they were not surprised at the large number of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty common when you have an open seat to have quite a few 
candidates," Robings said. He was the first to announce his candidacy in 
November and this week opened a campaign office in Thousand Oaks. "But there 
are two or three candidates that I don't think are serious about it. I think 
some of them will drop out." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo had hoped to win the support of Stark and Fredericks. He said he 
recently talked to them about his candidacy, and Stark had said publicly that 
he was considering throwing his support to Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after I talked with them, I found out that they had pulled papers," 
Schillo joked. "So I'm not going to talk to anyone else about my candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Simi Valley City Councilwoman Barbara Williamson has pulled 
papers to run for the 4th District supervisorial seat, which is now held by 
Supervisor Vicky Howard. Howard has said she will seek reelection.

SECRETARY TESTIFIES KEYS FOUND IN PRIEST'S ROOM; CRIME: WOMAN IN PIROLI THEFT 
TRIAL SAYS LOCKS WERE CHANGED AFTER PARISHIONERS COUNTING MONEY MADE THE FIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Simi Valley parishioners counting money found in Father David Dean Piroli's 
room turned up a church master key that had been missing for a month, along 
with about 100 other keys, a church secretary testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli disappeared that same day -- five days after Hollywood police arrested 
him for embezzlement -- and soon thereafter, Father James McKeon ordered all 
the locks changed at the church, testified secretary Eileen Slavin. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two days to replace every lock in the church, rectory and priests' 
residence, Slavin told jurors in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners discovered the keys while sorting through thousands of dollars in 
cash and dozens of collection envelopes, Slavin told jurors in Ventura County 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a complete set of Father McKeon's keys for the church and the 
rectory and the residence, and a (master) key that had been missing since 
April, and a spare set of keys for a maroon (church) car that had been missing 
for months," Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin also testified out of the jury's presence that church employees found 
cigarette rolling papers, traces of marijuana and what appeared to be cocaine 
residue in matchboxes in the desk drawer in Piroli's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin then was allowed to testify to jurors only about the matchboxes 
containing white powder, after defense attorney Richard Beada held a long 
private conference with Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele and Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Mary Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin testified that Piroli's church-owned car was found in Burbank two weeks 
after his June 3, 1992, disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin said she had let some air out of the car's left rear tire in a failed 
attempt to stop Piroli from leaving the church. The tire was still partly 
deflated, and she had to refill it to drive it safely back to Simi Valley, 
Slavin testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Slavin testified she had found a note from her to McKeon in one of the 
money bags that parishioners had retrieved from Piroli's rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the church secretary appeared to grow weary under a painstaking 
cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Beada that lasted nearly five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Beada recalled grand jury testimony in which McKeon had spoken to Slavin after 
finding money while looking for his keys in Piroli's room two weeks before the 
younger priest's arrest, but she testified she did not remember making the 
statements before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you recall making the statement to Father McKeon, 'If you took your keys, 
why didn't you take the money?' " Beada asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not in those words," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you recall saying, 'What's he going to do to you?' " Beada asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Slavin replied.  
</P>
<P>
 " ' . . . You're taking stolen money, but he stole from us,' " Beada quoted 
from Slavin's grand jury testimony. " 'You know, take it back.' You remember 
making that statement to the grand jury?" 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin asked to see the grand jury transcript to refresh her memory, then 
admitted, "Yes, I said it." 
</P>
<P>
 Questioning went in fits and starts.  
</P>
<P>
 Beada repeatedly asked Slavin questions that spurred objections from Peace and 
warnings from Steele to reword the questions. At one point, Beada began to 
match Peace's objections during her questioning by protesting a string of 
simple questions on the same grounds she had cited during cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Peace late Tuesday whether she saw other matchboxes at the rectory, 
Slavin sighed, "It seems like I did, but I'm so punchy at this point, I don't 
remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavin was excused just before 4 p.m. Testimony is scheduled to continue today 
at 9:30 a.m.

FIREFIGHTERS, POLICE PROTEST PROPOSED MERGER; OXNARD: AT AN EMOTIONAL CITY 
COUNCIL HEARING, THEY CONTEND THAT ANY CONSOLIDATION WOULD NOT SAVE MONEY.

 Dozens of firefighters and police officers warned the Oxnard City Council on 
Tuesday that lives will be put in jeopardy if the city approves any form of 
consolidation of the police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting that continued late into the night, firefighters denounced a 
proposal by the city staff to merge the police and fire administrations and 
require firefighters to take some crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge you not to consolidate the police and fire departments," Oxnard Fire 
Capt. Michael O'Malia said. "Your firefighters are against it. Your police 
officers are against it. Many of your citizens are against it, and we have 
shown that it will not save money." 
</P>
<P>
 The often-emotional and raucous hearing, which attracted an overflow crowd of 
300 to the council chambers, climaxed a three-month campaign by firefighters 
against the proposed money-saving consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Oxnard police officers also went on record in opposition to the proposed 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Peace Officers Assn. President Bill Lewis said "an overwhelming 
majority" of the department's force oppose consolidation of management. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it once and it didn't work," Lewis said, referring to a previous 
decision by Oxnard to unite the departments in the mid-1980s. "Crime being the 
No. 1 concern, we need a full-time police chief." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a door-to-door lobbying effort by firefighters that resulted in 
thousands of letters and phone calls to City Hall, the city had already backed 
away from an initial proposal to completely merge the two agencies. As 
originally planned, 80 of the city's police officers and 50 firefighters would 
have been cross-trained by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fire stations would have been staffed with a single officer who would 
drive equipment to a fire or emergency scene and be met by other officers in 
patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the scaled-down proposal, the departments would share a common 
administrative staff, while department personnel would receive cross-training 
in only limited areas, such as crime or fire prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimated that Oxnard could save $185,000 a year by merging the 
administration of both departments in a new Department of Public Safety. Such a 
move would also allow more efficient operations in recruiting, personnel 
processing, business office and clerical support, Oxnard Police Cmdr. Tom Cady 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional savings of nearly $500,000 could be achieved if firefighters are 
trained to take crime reports, investigate crime scenes and practice crime 
prevention, according to the staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposals called for firefighters to train in code enforcement 
inspections, while code enforcement officers would be trained to look for fire 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposes that the city study formation of an emergency medical 
dispatching program that would set priorities for the most serious calls for 
emergency medical care received by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally proposed in June as part of a plan to reduce the number of city 
departments, a Department of Public Safety was strongly opposed by the Oxnard 
Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The council postponed a hearing on the merger last month after several city 
officials accused firefighters of lobbying against the proposal on city time. 
Association leaders denied the allegation.

LAND DEAL CLEARS WAY FOR GRAND ENTRANCE TO ARTS PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearing the way for a grand entrance to the Civic Arts Plaza, Thousand Oaks 
officials announced late Tuesday plans to purchase a long-coveted strip of land 
owned by Robert Heggen. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal -- reached after months of contentious negotiations -- will allow the 
city to build a wide driveway into the Civic Arts Plaza along Oakwood Drive, by 
paving over part of Heggen's half an acre of property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had been prepared to build retaining walls roughly two stories high 
around Heggen's property to hide his home and maintenance yard from public 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the city has agreed to pay Heggen $600,000 for his rectangular lot, 
which until recently was cluttered with earth-moving equipment and construction 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Heggen, a general contractor, will receive an additional $10,000 if he 
fulfills his pledge to clean up his unkempt yard. By March 1, he must clear 
away his heavy equipment, tear down his two-story home and cleanup toxic 
patches of dirt created when oil dripped into the soil in the maintenance yard, 
City Atty. Mark Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 After issuing several city ultimatums, negotiators agreed to a price between 
Heggen's most recent demand of $1 million and the city's standing offer of 
$420,000. At an estimated cost of $300,000, building the retaining wall would 
have been cheaper than buying Heggen's property. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials had been reluctant to erect imposing concrete block walls 
right next to their $64-million facility, which will house both a performing 
arts center and government offices.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would have looked pretty ridiculous to have walls up all around that 
property and his house sitting in the hole there," Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo, who helped negotiated the settlement, flashed a 
thumbs up sign upon hearing the news at Tuesday night's City Council meeting. 
"We're sure going to have a beautiful entrance," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Heggen, who had floated grand plans of building a restaurant or retail shops 
on his narrow property, said he could not comment on the negotiations. "I'm 
glad it's over -- I can't say any more at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials signed a written agreement with Heggen on Tuesday and Sellers 
said he expects escrow to close within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The city faces a tight schedule for constructing the Oakwood Drive entrance by 
next fall, when the Civic Arts Plaza is scheduled to open.

DRUNK DRIVER IS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man who caused a fiery Christmas-week crash that took the life 
of a 26-year-old Thousand Oaks woman received the harshest possible sentence on 
Tuesday -- 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen James Paton had been convicted of vehicular manslaughter and felony drunk 
driving after pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for 29-year-old Paton had asked Superior Court Judge Charles W. 
Campbell Jr. to give his client a six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell noted the gravity of the offense and the toll it has taken on the 
family of the victim, Samantha Huntley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge did what he thought was the proper thing to do," Deputy Public 
Defender Joseph P. VillaSana said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing ended an emotional hearing during which Patricia Huntley, the 
mother of the victim, broke down halfway through a statement she was reading 
about the impact of the loss of her daughter. Her son finished the statement 
for her, VillaSana said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntley graduated from North Hollywood High School and received a bachelor's 
degree in animal science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. She had applied for 
veterinary programs all over the country and was working as a technician at the 
American Veterinary Hospital in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Paton's behalf, his wife spoke about how her husband seems genuinely 
remorseful and has learned his lesson, VillaSana said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he is sorry about what happened. I think he also wants, in some way, 
to make known his actions and tell other people not to do this," VillaSana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paton was on three years' probation for drunk driving at the time of the wreck 
that killed Huntley. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said he had a .22 blood-alcohol level -- nearly three times the 
legal limit -- when his pickup truck rear-ended Huntley's car on Tierra Rejada 
Road just east of the Moorpark Freeway in the early hours of Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare early plea, Paton pleaded guilty just eight days later at his 
arraignment in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 His plea marked the first time a Ventura County defendant in a 
vehicular-manslaughter case had entered a guilty plea so early, according to 
officials from Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 VillaSana said he had hoped that because of the early plea -- which spared the 
Huntley family the agony of a drawn-out court case -- the judge might give 
Paton the shorter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Paton is a construction worker who moved to Simi Valley from Canada three 
years ago. He is expected to serve about five years. California prison inmates 
typically serve half their actual sentence with time off for good behavior.

LAWYER CALLS SHOOTING BY POLICE AN OUTRAGE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: WOMAN WHO WAS 
KILLED AFTER ALLEGEDLY THREATENING OFFICERS WAS HIT IN THE BACK BY SEVEN 
BULLETS, CORONER SAYS. HER FAMILY'S ATTORNEY DEMANDS AN EXPLANATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A young woman who died in a fusillade of Los Angeles police gunfire in 
December after allegedly threatening officers with a butcher knife was hit in 
the back by seven of the bullets, according to a coroner's report. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy also indicates that Sonji Danese Taylor, 27, was not under the 
influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of her death on a hospital rooftop, 
although police reported that she had been acting strangely and that they 
feared for the life of her 3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Police Department said that the findings of the Los 
Angeles County coroner's office, which were released Monday, came as no 
surprise and that a departmental investigation has been under way since shortly 
after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction is that there is certainly nothing there that we didn't expect," 
said Lt. John Dunkin. "It will become part and parcel of the investigation, 
which will ultimately be submitted to the chief of police." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who represents Taylor's family, compared 
the shooting to the Eulia Love case of 1979, in which a black woman who wielded 
a knife was shot to death by LAPD officers. Taylor was black and the two 
officers who shot her -- Sgt. Michael Long and Officer Craig Liedahl -- are 
white. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is worse" than the Love case, Cochran said. "She (Love) was facing the 
officers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an outrageous shooting that cries out for some immediate 
explanation, and so far we haven't gotten anything," he continued. "It would be 
very hard for me to believe that in Los Angeles in 1994 that two white officers 
would shoot a white woman seven times." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin denied that race was a factor in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not an issue," he said. "I know the policemen involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin did not know when the department's investigation, which examines 
whether the two officers acted in accordance with LAPD policy on shootings, 
will be completed. Such investigations are done after all officer-involved 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office also is investigating, which is also routine. 
Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for that office, refused to comment on the 
investigation but said she hoped it would be concluded soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coroner's report will obviously assist us," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who lived in El Monte, was killed Dec. 16. Security officers at St. 
Vincent Medical Center called police when they discovered the woman on the 
facility's helipad. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was holding a butcher knife in her left hand and her young son in her 
right hand while she shouted "For the blood of Jesus!" security officers told 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, an 18-year LAPD veteran, and Liedahl, a 15-year veteran, answered the 
call and attempted to persuade Taylor to release the child, according to 
police. When Taylor refused, an officer doused her with pepper spray in an 
attempt to subdue her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor then released the child and advanced on the officers, waving the knife 
"in a threatening manner," police said. When Taylor ignored their commands to 
drop the knife, the two officers fired nine rounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy report indicates that Taylor suffered 10 gunshot wounds: one to 
the abdomen, one to the left hand, one to the left forearm and seven to the 
back. It is unclear whether the bullet that passed through Taylor's hand caused 
another wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the incident, Taylor's mother, Geri Dixon, also of El Monte, 
said she did not believe the police version of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said her daughter loved her son too much to threaten him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear why Taylor was at St. Vincent Medical Center, but she apparently 
had been Christmas shopping that day. Shoppers sometimes park at the center 
while in nearby stores.

JUDGE BLOCKS DEMOTION OF HOSPITAL CHIEF; HEALTH: COURT FINDS THAT OFFICIALS 
VIOLATED GUIDELINES IN REMOVING DOCTOR AS CHAIRMAN OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE AT 
KING MEDICAL CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Superior Court judge Tuesday blocked the removal of Dr. William Shoemaker 
from his post as chairman of emergency medicine at Martin Luther King/Drew 
Medical Center on the grounds that hospital officials had not followed Civil 
Service rules in demoting him in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical center officials contend that they reassigned Shoemaker to meet the 
demands of an accrediting agency that has threatened to shut the hospital's 
training program for emergency physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert O'Brien granted Shoemaker's request for a preliminary injunction, 
stating in a written order that his demotion "may or may not be deserved, but 
must be accomplished in a proper manner, if at all." The judge found that 
Shoemaker was appointed in 1991 to a six-year term and was removed without 
being given a reason or an opportunity to challenge the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling may present a hurdle for county health officials trying to 
save the training program that now enrolls about 40 resident doctors who staff 
the hospital's emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education threatened in 
November to revoke certification of the program because the hospital has failed 
to correct substandard conditions during the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency criticized the qualifications and commitment of the emergency 
department's senior supervising physicians. They pointed out that Shoemaker is 
an excellent surgeon but not a board-certified emergency specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Reed Tuckson, president of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and 
Science, has said that he removed Shoemaker in direct response to the agency's 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Tuckson nor Deputy County Counsel Stephen R. Morris was available for 
comment Tuesday. Shoemaker's attorney, Rees Lloyd, hailed the order as a 
victory and said Shoemaker feels "very gratified." 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Center officials had appointed Dr. H. Range Hutson, a board-certified 
emergency specialist at County-USC Medical Center, to replace Shoemaker while a 
nationwide search is undertaken for a new chairman. But O'Brien blocked that 
move too.

EPICENTER MOVES TO RESEDA, NAME STAYS IN NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH and JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The name is not going to change, scientists at Caltech and the U.S. Geological 
Survey insisted Tuesday. It will go down in history as the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest epicenter, based on at least the sixth set of coordinates that 
scientists have issued since Jan. 17, is actually in Reseda, a little more than 
a quarter of a mile outside the Northridge boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech seismologist Egill Hauksson, who with colleague Kate Hutton plots such 
things, cautioned that positioning could still change, depending on new 
seismographic evidence and continued study of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauksson said being exact is difficult with scattered seismographic 
instrumentation, and further study may move the epicenter back under 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But, officially for now, the "best epicenter" issued by Caltech is at 34 
degrees 12.68 minutes north and 118 degrees 32.25 minutes west. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech does not list street locations, but Jim Kamenick, database manager for 
Area Location Systems Inc. in Chatsworth, plotted those coordinates and put the 
epicenter in the middle of a block bounded by Reseda Boulevard on the east, 
Elkwood Street on the south, Yolanda Avenue on the west and Arminta Street on 
the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main point is that most of the fault surface is beneath Northridge," 
Hauksson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mori, director of the Geological Survey's Pasadena field office, said: 
"The quake is not a point. It represents a whole area, roughly 10 miles by 
eight miles, and Northridge is more representative of the area the fault 
broke." 
</P>
<P>
 But as critics asserted and the scientists acknowledged, naming an earthquake 
can involve sometimes emotional issues beyond just pinpointing an epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine M. Rodrigue, a geography professor at Cal State Chico, has contended 
that Caltech officials gravitated toward an "upscale community" in Northridge, 
ignoring Reseda, which is poorer and more working class. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, she suggested, Northridge may do far better than Reseda in 
receiving emergency funding and resources for post-quake recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrigue, who has a home in Reseda, was there the morning of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech officials deny such considerations have been part of their 
motivations, and Hauksson and Mori characterized the decision on naming the 
quake as informal. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Mori said, the inclination of the small group of Caltech and 
Geological Survey scientists who hold public briefings was to name the event 
the San Fernando Valley earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we had already had a San Fernando quake in 1971, and that might have led 
to confusion," Mori said. "Northridge seemed to us to be the closest area to 
this earthquake, so we named it that." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, state authorities started using Northridge earthquake too. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reseda, some residents have been pushing to have the quake named the Reseda 
quake. But Hauksson said he and the other scientists have difficulty 
understanding that notion.  
</P>
<P>
 "We could have named the Big Bear aftershock to the Landers earthquake (in 
1992) the Sugarloaf Mountain quake because it was actually closer to that 
geographic feature," Hauksson said. "But we decided to name it Big Bear, and 
I'm afraid as a result there was considerable adverse economic impact that 
winter on the ski resorts." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, scientists at the U.S. Geological Survey 
office in Menlo Park purposely avoided naming it after a city in order to 
lessen the negative economic impact, Hauksson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such reasoning, there appears to be some resentment over the quake's 
name in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors, politicians and local newspapers have received complaints that 
Reseda, the original Hub of the Valley, has been snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Rose, a deputy to Councilwoman Laura Chick, said the office received a 
complaint from a constituent worried that Reseda "would be overlooked in the 
recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the man was assured that Reseda would get its fair share of any 
recovery resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Canfield, manager of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, said that, on 
balance, she thinks naming the quake after Northridge is "a positive." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the identification with Northridge has brought numerous phone calls. 
People nationwide wanting to make donations call Northridge to offer items such 
as plastic sheeting, diapers and tents. 
</P>
<P>
 Would she like it to remain the Northridge quake? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess, if there's no other way to do it, we will make as much positive out 
of it as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 It is only fair, she added, "because of the tremendous destruction to the 
Northridge Fashion Center and Cal State Northridge." New Starting Point 
Caltech's latest coordinates for the epicenter of the Northridge earthquake 
place it in Reseda. But scientists say further scismographic evidence might 
lead to another change. And they are sticking with Northridge as the name of 
the quake.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SWIFT FREEWAY RETROFITS URGED; ROADS: CALTRANS'

 California's program to fortify freeway bridges and overpasses against major 
earthquakes should be carried out on an emergency basis, the state's chief 
transportation engineer said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through three major earthquakes in my career," said James E. 
Roberts, chief engineer for the California Department of Transportation and a 
41-year veteran of the agency. "I'd like to get all this finished, frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,033 bridges scheduled for seismic reinforcement, Caltrans has 
retrofitted more than 250. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels said that a court 
dispute with a union representing Caltrans employees had to some extent delayed 
the buttressing of freeway structures. Caltrans, responding last year to a 
judge's rulings in the ongoing case, postponed entering any new 
design-engineering contracts with private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have disruption, you lose momentum," Roberts said. "Let's face 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans employees filed the lawsuit in Sacramento Superior Court, seeking to 
preserve state jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the employees union took sharp issue with the assertions 
of Roberts and Van Loben Sels, accusing the pair of seeking to divert attention 
from what he called their department's slow progress in retrofitting freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to cover their fannies," said Richard T. Baker, executive 
assistant for the Professional Engineers in California Government. Baker said 
that the rulings did not prohibit Caltrans from continuing to hire consultants 
for the retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels disputed that, saying that there were constraints on outside 
contracting and that they did have some impact on the seismic work. He said he 
could not quantify the amount but added: "It's not a big impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts and Van Loben Sels noted that two bridges that failed along the 
heavily traveled Santa Monica Freeway had been scheduled to be reinforced, 
beginning later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bridges or overpasses collapsed at the interchange of the Antelope 
Valley and Golden State freeways near Sylmar, at a site two miles north on 
Golden State Freeway called Gavin Canyon and on the Simi Valley Freeway, where 
it crosses San Fernando Mission Boulevard. Except for the Simi Valley Freeway 
overpass, all of the structures that fell were scheduled to be reinforced.  
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, asked about the Simi Valley Freeway collapse, retreated from his 
earlier statements that Caltrans had not scheduled the overpass for 
reinforcement partly because the fault that caused the Northridge earthquake 
was uncharted. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts told a hearing of the Assembly Transportation Committee last week that 
one of the reasons the Simi Valley overpasses were not placed on the list of 
structures to be reinforced was because engineers had no knowledge of the 
fault's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberts, while noting that Caltech seismologists had said immediately 
after the Jan. 17 quake that the fault was unknown, acknowledged Tuesday that a 
1990 map, prepared for the department's internal use, appears to show a fault 
at near the quake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Roberts said that the Simi Valley overpass would not have been 
included on the statewide retrofitting list solely on the basis of seismic 
risk. Caltrans selected candidates for retrofitting based on numerous factors, 
including the age and design of the freeway, soil conditions and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 As for completing the $750-million retrofitting program on an emergency basis, 
Roberts said he would like to see an expansion of the emergency contracting 
procedures authorized by Gov. Pete Wilson for reconstruction of the bridges 
destroyed by the earthquake. A contract has been awarded for reconstruction of 
the I-5 bridge at Gavin Canyon and rebuilding is to begin immediately on Santa 
Monica Freeway overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Loben Sels said he is not convinced that an expansion of emergency 
contracting is necessary for the earthquake retrofitting program. Although the 
expedited process would streamline permitting and competitive bidding, Van 
Loben Sels said normal procedures are designed to guarantee fairness to 
competing contractors and protection of public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure whether we need any extraordinary measures from the governor 
(for earthquake retrofitting) but I can certainly tell you that I'm going to 
use everything in my power to press forward," he said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; RULES MEAN MANY BRICK CHIMNEYS WON'T RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 Thousands of homeowners who lost brick chimneys in the Jan. 17 earthquake will 
be forced to rebuild them under stringent new guidelines that are likely to 
lead to the use of substitute materials, Los Angeles building officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordinance approved by the City Council requires homeowners to hire an 
engineer, use steel reinforcement and anchor their chimneys to the frames of 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this is going to do, for all practical purposes, is outlaw (the 
rebuilding of) brick chimneys in this city," said Warren O'Brien, general 
manager of the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. "It's just not 
practical in earthquake country." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday also took a series of other earthquake-related 
actions: requiring that damaged buildings be rebuilt to current seismic safety 
standards, imposing stricter construction reviews for outdoor brick walls, 
ordering the retrofitting of about 2,100 warehouse-style tilt-up structures, 
and asking that Los Angeles County firms get a preference in bidding for 
cleanup and other contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the toughened scrutiny of chimneys, though, that will have the most 
widespread impact on Angelenos. Los Angeles building and safety officials 
estimate that 15,000 brick chimneys might have been damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of chimneys that require more than a 10% repair will be forced to 
comply with current codes that call for steel reinforcement. They will also be 
ordered to hire an engineer to design a method of anchoring the chimney to the 
home's frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Most wood frame houses are not substantial enough to provide an adequate 
anchor for a brick chimney -- and the structures can be dragged down or bricks 
can rain into homes, building officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said it will be difficult to win approval for a brick chimney without 
additional steel reinforcement in the home. "Your typical tract house will not 
be a candidate for a brick chimney," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners will be allowed to rebuild with less scrutiny if they choose 
lighter-weight chimneys consisting of metal flues and stucco. Composites or so 
called thin-bricks can then be attached to the exterior to give the appearance 
of a traditional chimney, building officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a brick chimney without the weight or the danger," O'Brien 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the masonry industry said that chimneys built since the 
mid-1940s included steel reinforcement and survived the earthquake well. They 
said the city would be better served by ordering older chimneys to be 
reinforced with steel, rather than trying to discourage the use of bricks 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are overreacting to an obsolete situation," said John Chrysler, a staff 
engineer with the Los Angeles-based Masonry Institute of America. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are hurting a big industry, and this is not the time to take away jobs," 
said James Amrhein, the organization's executive director, who planned to write 
a letter of protest to Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said alternative construction methods would be equal to, or less 
expensive than, traditional brick chimneys. But Amrhein said the alternatives 
would cost about 10% more. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the council: 
</P>
<P>
 * Voted to require building permits for outdoor brick walls, many of which 
also failed in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ordered seismic strengthening of about 2,100 older tilt-up buildings 
constructed before building codes were improved in 1976. The buildings are made 
of concrete walls poured on the ground and then propped up and attached to 
adjoining walls. They are most commonly used for warehouses and storage 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Required that the damaged portions of all buildings be brought up to current 
seismic standards, which generally provide for more secure attachments of walls 
to building frames and floors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Agreed that in cleaning up debris and performing other tasks for the city, 
Los Angeles County firms will be given top priority. The bids of local firms 
will be reduced by 10% before they are compared to proposals by firms from 
outside the county. Councilman Richard Alarcon said his proposal will help keep 
more rebuilding jobs in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a program that 
may give owners of damaged properties automatic property tax reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviving a plan first tried in the aftermath of the 1992 riots, County 
Assessor Kenneth Hahn's staff will automatically begin the paperwork for 
lowering the assessed value of damaged properties discovered in routine 
neighborhood inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn said he expects 150,000 to 200,000 applications from property owners 
seeking lower assessments. An additional 7,500 to 10,000 property owners could 
benefit from the plan to automatically reassess properties, Hahn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, property owners may seek lower assessments if the value 
of their home has dropped more than $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, total property tax revenues could drop $42 million to $56 million 
because of earthquake damage, Hahn estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor's office used automatic inspections after the 1992 riots and 
granted lower assessments to several hundred property owners who had not sought 
them.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; TIP FROM 
HOMELESS MAN LEADS TO STOLEN COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tip from a homeless man led police Tuesday to a house in South-Central Los 
Angeles where about $300,000 worth of stolen computer monitors were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers found the monitors throughout the house and in the back yard in the 
300 block of West 88th Place, said Los Angeles Police Detective Ray Allen.The 
monitors apparently were stolen from a truck parked near Indiana Street and 
Olympic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 A man pushing a shopping cart became suspicious when he saw what he thought 
was a large number of TV sets in the back yard, so he notified police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe that the thieves unloaded the truck and ditched it at 98th 
Street and Avalon Boulevard, where it was found by officers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: UNIVERSAL STUDIOS; MCA 
GIVEN UNTIL FEB. 10 TO SUBMIT SUBWAY ALTERNATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Transit officials have given MCA until Feb. 10 to come up with a final plan to 
relocate a proposed subway station closer to the entertainment giant's 
Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted unanimously to give MCA 
the Feb. 10 deadline to come up with its best offer for alternative funding for 
the station shift.At stake are tens of millions of dollars in federal funds 
that may be jeopardized if the MTA allows more delays on building the Metro Red 
Line extension to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, the MTA has planned to build a subway station in 
Universal City -- but about half a mile northwest of the main entrance to 
Universal Studios and its popular CityWalk shopping arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA President Larry Spungin said it makes more sense to put the station right 
at the tourist attraction because passengers could use the subway on nights and 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan as it stands now has no benefit and is, indeed, as it was 12 years 
ago when first planned, fatally flawed," Spungin told an advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA officials have threatened that if the site remains as planned, they may 
not pay the company's $6-million share of a benefit assessment district tax to 
cover the cost of building it. But if the station is moved closer, Spungin 
said, MCA will donate 4.9 acres of land and other benefits worth $30 million to 
the transit agency.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
QUAKE SPURS CITY TO STUDY HAULING DEBRIS TO UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Worries about the volume of earthquake debris filling San Fernando Valley 
landfills led members of a city ad hoc recovery committee Tuesday to instruct 
city officials to investigate the possibility of hauling trash to a dump in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Although area landfills are not in immediate danger of reaching capacity 
because of earthquake debris, sanitation officials said the quake has forced 
them to focus attention on long-term landfill alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of trash and earthquake debris has increased 15% at some Valley 
landfills and gravel pits and as much as 280% at other dumps, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of hauling local trash by rail to a 3,000-acre landfill in East 
Carbon City, Utah, has been studied by many public agencies in Southern 
California to avoid the trash crisis that would occur when area landfills reach 
capacity. It is the first time the city of Los Angeles has shown interest in 
the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the earthquake debris has been taken to landfills and gravel pits in 
the northeast San Fernando Valley.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CORONER TO TAKE MACABRE 
MARKETING INTO CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The merchandising of death, L.A. style, will soon go international under a 
deal approved Tuesday by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, over the objections of an outraged Supervisor Ed Edelman, approved 
a marketing deal between the county coroner's office and a Canadian retailing 
concern to sell macabre coroner's memorabilia north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there were plenty of giggles from officials listening to the debate, 
coroner's officials say they are deadly serious about the marketing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office has sold more than $150,000 worth of items such as beach 
towels with a chalk outline of a body, toe tags usually used to identify bodies 
but are also suitable as key chains, and T-shirts featuring the office mascot, 
Sherlock Bones, a skeletal takeoff on the famous investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Hernandez, interim director of the coroner's office, said the Canadian 
franchise deal could bring in an additional $40,000. All proceeds are used to 
fund the department's youth drunk-driving program. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the good cause, Edelman said the program may not be worth the cost to 
Los Angeles's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enough problems in a county known for its high death rates from gang 
violence," Edelman said. "By marketing the coroner's office we open ourselves 
up to losing more than we gain. It's continuing the idea that Los Angeles is a 
dangerous place." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hernandez said, "reaction to the program so far has been very 
positive." And, he pointed out for the benefit of the more squeamish board 
members, toe tags sold to the public are unused. FREDERICK M. MUIR

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: QUAKE DELIVERS KNOCKOUT 
PUNCH TO OKIE GIRL EATERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Promoting a restaurant in the remote Tejon Pass wasn't easy, but the "Okie 
Girl" went at it with aspirations higher than her hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lynn Chess, 54, who opened the Okie Girl barbecue restaurant and brewery 
in 1990 alongside Interstate 5 about 70 miles north of Los Angeles, could turn 
everything from a minor skirmish with a state agency to a local look-alike 
contest into a media event. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Christo "Umbrellas" art exhibition landed in the nearby mountains 
in 1991, television crews from around the world lined up to interview the 
Oklahoma-born entrepreneur with the towering beehive hairdo who could discuss 
moonshine and the latest in computerized restaurant equipment with equal 
aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing the tireless Chess could not stand was to be ignored. That is 
what has happened since the earthquake, and it has proved fatal for her Okie 
Girl restaurant in Lebec, on the Los Angeles-Kern County border. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess and her crew served their last "pasture and pond" special (barbecued 
beef ribs and catfish) and homemade blackberry cobbler a week ago Sunday. With 
freeway traffic disrupted by quake damage in the northeastern San Fernando 
Valley, business plunged to about three customers an hour, Chess said, and she 
had no cash reserves to weather the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess had 13 full-time employees, including a brew master who turned out 
"River Bottom Stout" and other beers amid the knotty pine and Old West-decor of 
the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess may be best known for her quarrel with Caltrans, which refused to allow 
her to advertise on state-controlled signs beside the highway, saying the 
restaurant's name insulted Oklahomans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody has a right to call themselves an Okie, I do," protested Chess, a 
native daughter of the Sooner State. "I'm proud of it and I always have been." 
</P>
<P>
 She clinched her argument when the Oklahoma governor wrote to Caltrans in her 
defense, officially declaring that, whatever Californians might think, 
Oklahomans wear the name "Okie" as a badge of honor, symbolizing their "strong 
work ethic, character and resiliency." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans not only backed down on the sign, a court later ordered the agency to 
pay her $32,000 in punitive damages. DAVID COLKER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LA PUENTE; ARGUMENT IN 
TATTOO PARLOR ENDS IN KILLING OF 2 MEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An argument between six men in a tattoo parlor escalated into a shooting that 
killed two of them, including a tattoo artist, and seriously injured a third, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2:30 p.m. Monday, three men entered Tattoo Land on Amar Road and started 
to argue with tattoo artist Nicholas Marquez, 43, Stephen Perez, 30, and an 
unidentified 38-year-old man who was in the store, said Sgt. Bob Olmsted of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.A short time later, three gunmen opened 
fire, Olmsted said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez and the 38-year-old man were shot in the upper body and died at the 
scene, the spokesman said. Perez was shot in the lower body and ran to a nearby 
shoe store to call for help, Olmsted said. Perez was taken to Queen of the 
Valley Hospital in West Covina, where he underwent surgery. He was in serious 
but stable condition today, said nursing supervisor Richardson Alyce. 
</P>
<P>
 The third man's identity was being withheld pending notification of 
next-of-kin, Olmsted said. Investigators do not know if the men knew each other 
and have not determined a motive, Olmsted said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 'I STILL 
LOVE L.A.' STICKERS TO BENEFIT SALVATION ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Korean American Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles will sell bumper 
stickers with a morale-boosting message to raise the spirits of 
disaster-ravaged Angelenos while raising money for victims.  
</P>
<P>
 The stickers pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of those who have overcome 
all manner of disasters in recent years and stayed in the area, said chamber 
executive director Harrison Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 The stickers carry the message, "After the Riot, Floods, Fires and 
Earthquakes, I Still Love L.A." They will sell for $1 apiece, with proceeds 
going to the Salvation Army's Operation We Care program, Kim said. The stickers 
will be sold through the mail and, if all goes well, at chain convenience 
stores and independent businesses, Kim said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stickers are available from the Korean American Chamber of Commerce of Los 
Angeles, 3350 Wilshire Blvd., Suite. 660, Los Angeles 90010. 
</P>
<P>
 Checks for money orders should be made out to "I Still Love L.A." and orders 
of fewer than 20 should include a stamped, self-addressed envelope. For orders 
of 20 or more, Kim said, the chamber will pay postage.

COMPROMISE ON HIRING FEMALE OFFICERS BACKED; EQUALITY: POLICE COMMISSION 
SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO INCREASE NUMBER OF WOMEN IN THE LAPD. PANEL STOPS SHORT OF 
ENDORSING AN ANNUAL QUOTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles Police Commission, eager to push the LAPD toward 
hiring more women but reluctant to create legal troubles for the city, approved 
a statement Tuesday that attempts to forge a compromise on the politically 
volatile issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Police Commissioners supports and encourages all serious and 
legitimate efforts to increase the number of women police officers through a 
vigorous recruiting program designed to increase the number of female 
applicants," the commission statement said. "The commission has been advised by 
the city attorney's office, however, that all legal ramifications must be 
explored before new hiring goals are pursued." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement falls short of demanding that 44% of the Police Department's 
annual hires be women -- a target urged by leaders of the Women's Advisory 
Council to the Police Commission -- but members of the commission said it 
reflects the difficulty in trying to mandate such a goal. It also sets the 
stage for an upcoming City Council debate on the proposed goal; the council's 
Personnel Committee is scheduled to take up that proposal in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city attorney's office has warned us that this is an area of danger," 
said Gary Greenebaum, president of the Police Commission, who says the LAPD 
needs to increase its hiring of women. "We don't want to get ahead of ourselves 
in terms of supporting a percentage figure that we can't reach, but I also 
believe strongly that if you don't set goals, you'll never reach those goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates of the 44% annual hiring goal were bitterly disappointed by 
what they considered the commission's halfhearted statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a Police Department that does not want to hire more women," said 
Katherine Spillar, national coordinator for the Fund for the Feminist Majority. 
"The liability issue is a total red herring." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 44% annual hiring goal for women in the department has stirred 
controversy since the idea was unveiled last year as part of a report by the 
Women's Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
 That report, only the latest to cite the need for more female police officers, 
found that the department values physical strength over negotiating skills and 
complained that it has been lax in investigating complaints of sexual 
harassment and domestic violence by its police officers. One of the report's 
central recommendations was that the LAPD increase the annual hiring goals of 
the department so that the representation of women in the department would 
match their presence in the work force -- roughly 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent women's organizations have lent their support to the 
proposal, but some council members are privately worried that approving the 
goal could expose the city to liability if it falls short of achieving it. At 
the same time, they are concerned about the political ramifications of voting 
against an ambitious hiring goal for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the plan received support from a December city Personnel Department 
report, which warned that the city could be hit with lawsuits if it establishes 
an annual 44% female hiring goal for the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Spillar said that is not true. She said more ambitious annual hiring goals 
would encourage the department to make faster progress in diversifying the 
police force and would reduce the city's potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, Police Chief Willie L. Williams pledged to pursue any 
hiring goal set by the city, but he emphasized the progress made in recent 
years in increasing the number of women on the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a court-approved consent decree signed 13 years ago, the LAPD pledged to 
make one out of every four new hires a woman. In addition, the city has adopted 
a more ambitious goal of annually hiring 30% women, a goal that it has met for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the percentage of female LAPD officers has climbed from 2.6% in 
1980 to about 15% today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pleased by that progress, supporters of a more ambitious goal say the 
department needs to move more quickly, particularly as it embarks on efforts to 
implement community-based policing, a style of law enforcement that emphasizes 
communication and community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not moving fast enough," Spillar said of the LAPD brass. "They're 
dragging their feet."

DAMAGED HIGH SCHOOLS PUSHING TO REOPEN EARLY; EDUCATION: STATE-ISSUED BUNGALOWS 
AND HUNDREDS OF DESKS ARE BEING BROUGHT TO EL CAMINO REAL AND KENNEDY CAMPUSES. 
OFFICIALS HOPE TO HAVE THE MAKESHIFT CLASSROOMS READY THIS MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Crews are working feverishly to install 150 state-issue classroom bungalows 
and hundreds of new desks at El Camino Real and Kennedy high schools in hopes 
of reopening the earthquake-damaged campuses this month, officials said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson said Monday that the two hardest-hit high schools in the 
Los Angeles Unified School District would not reopen before March, but Kennedy 
Principal Andreda Pruitt said she is determined to beat that date by two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll start as early as we can," said Pruitt. "I'm working on a daily basis. 
I'm hoping to open Feb. 15." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruitt said that parents have voiced strong criticism of the district decision 
to keep the two high schools-with a combined enrollment of about 5,000 students 
-- closed until March 7. Parents have said they want their children to return 
to the campuses rather than be scattered to schools around the city, and that 
the seven-week break seemed excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said resuming classes at the two high schools depends on obtaining 
the portable classrooms and new desks. El Camino has 20 bungalows already in 
place and is expecting another 60 in the next two weeks. Kennedy has 30 
bungalows and expects another 40 in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two schools will be bungalow cities," Thompson said at a news 
conference. "But they keep these young people at their school sites -- it's 
what they wanted and it's what their parents wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Brown, the district's facilities director, said the state is trucking the 
bungalows from throughout California and sending crews to install them. Brown 
said putting each portable classroom in place costs $100,000, but costs will be 
shared by the state and the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The portable classrooms will take up athletic field space at both campuses, 
requiring some sports teams to be relocated. Kennedy's basketball team has 
already been practicing at Porter Middle School and El Camino will move 
practices to nearby campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Although El Camino has no structural damage, classroom partition walls were 
loosened and could collapse. Kennedy's three-story Administration Building was 
damaged and will need reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruitt said that Kennedy's Granada Hills campus could reopen with protective 
barriers around the damaged Administration Building, which also includes about 
20 classrooms. Some records located in the administration offices might never 
be retrieved, but student cumulative records are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The district plans to hold interim tutorial classes at both campuses, and 
transportation will be provided for students bused from other parts of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet Sculley, president of the 31st District Parent Teacher Student Assn., 
which covers the San Fernando Valley, said she believes the district has the 
opportunity to develop creative programs for displaced students during the 
break. But she said the district should focus on the needs of all students, not 
just the high-achieving, college-bound group who in some cases have already 
been meeting informally in teachers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said buses will be provided for students outside the Valley to reach 
the distant campuses and attend programs to include college advisement as well 
as academic lessons. He said the district is also discussing the possibility of 
having some students attend classes in neighboring districts and in schools 
closer to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,700 students at El Camino, 900 are bused in. Of the 2,300 students at 
Kennedy, about 1,000 are bused to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say that all of this is being done for the youngster who is 
going to make it anyway," Thompson said. "We want to talk about the 
alternatives for the average student." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday, Thompson said the district will reopen five 
schools today: Cantara Elementary, Danube Avenue Elementary, El Oro Way 
Elementary, Encino Elementary and Frost Middle School. He also said the 
district has not firmly decided to abandon the Van Gogh Street Elementary 
School site, which has large fissures throughout the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Thompson said, the school's students will be relocated, probably to 
Frost, and an extensive geological study will be done.

BILL BOYARSKY: AL, DON'T PLAY GAMES WITH THE COLISEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Save the Coliseum. If it's broke, fix it. For once, let's not bulldoze our 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, don't let Al Davis, the Raiders' tricky boss, con us into 
building him a new stadium on the Coliseum site, some ugly football palace with 
a roof like the Georgia Dome, where Sunday's Super Bowl was played. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were my thoughts after reading Times reporter Ken Reich's account of the 
damage inflicted on the old stadium by the Jan. 17 earthquake. A huge crack 
extends from the concession area, halfway up the Coliseum, down to the 
foundation. Smaller cracks can be seen. Broken concrete litters the place and 
gaps separate sections of seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a real mess, bad enough for the city building inspectors to 
red-tag it, bad enough to cost many, many millions of dollars to repair. A 
first estimate was $35 million, but engineers now say the bill will be much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission that runs the Coliseum has neither earthquake insurance nor a 
cash reserve to pay for damage. The failure to insure a 70-year-old concrete 
stadium, located in the heart of earthquake country, is an unforgivable, but 
not surprising, oversight. The commission, dominated by local politicians, is 
famous for bum business decisions. But the Coliseum survived in spite of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission now is asking the federal government for money to repair the 
stadium. And this has upset a couple of the guys here at work. Spend the money 
on schools and hospitals, said Dean and Ted. 
</P>
<P>
 Tear it down, said Dean. Who needs it? Ted said it should stand as a ruin, 
just like the real Coliseum in Rome. It would be a plus for the city. The ruin 
of the Roman Coliseum draws more people than the Raiders do. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned my back on such cynicism. To me the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
symbolizes great L.A. events, a glorious past, the Olympics, the World Series, 
USC vs. Notre Dame, JFK accepting the Democratic presidential nomination there 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Henry Weinstein and I saw it when we covered the last great crusade 
to save the Coliseum, more than a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 We were two sports fanatics reporting on City Hall for The Times when the Rams 
of the National Football League moved from the Coliseum to Anaheim. We realized 
that the event was more than a sports story. It was a saga of urban affairs, 
another example of a big business, located on the fringe of a depressed and 
decaying portion of South-Central Los Angeles, moving to the suburbs. We saw 
the campaign to lure another NFL team to the Coliseum as a great illustration 
-- a microcosm of efforts to save the older portions of urban America. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering the story would also bring us into daily contact with famous sports 
personalities that we'd only read about. It was a sports junkie's dream. We 
grabbed at it. 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't disappointed. We were on the phone with Pete Rozelle, then the 
powerful NFL commissioner. Tex Schramm, the legendary football executive who 
made the Dallas Cowboys "America's Team" in the '70s, was one of our best 
sources. So were legendary owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
 But one famous sports figure eluded us, and he was the most important. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. political powers, headed by county labor chief Bill Robertson, were 
persuading Al Davis to move his Raiders from Oakland to the Coliseum. We had 
meticulously described Davis in a story -- his white and black clothes, his 
hair combed back in sort of a '50s ducktail, his resemblance to the outlaw 
Raiders fans. He wasn't flattered and Weinstein and I were relegated to talking 
to Davis' devoted aide, Al LoCasale, known as "Little Al." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obstacles put up by Big Al, we figured out his M.O. He was the 
meanest, toughest hardball player we'd ever seen. He bullied and bluffed his 
way into a favorable deal at the Coliseum, and along the way made millions from 
a lawsuit victory over the NFL. He persuaded the San Gabriel Valley town of 
Irwindale to give him millions more when he briefly hinted he might move to 
that city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davis never got the plush refurbishing of the Coliseum that he wanted. It was 
improved but remained pretty crude by the standards of other NFL teams. But 
don't underestimate the constantly scheming Davis mind. 
</P>
<P>
 By chance, on the day when the full extent of the damage became known, a 
report surfaced in the East (a Davis leak?) that the Raiders are talking about 
moving to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 I can see it coming. The old Al Davis squeeze play. Tear down the Coliseum, 
build him a stadium, the Al Dome, colored Raider silver and black, or he'll 
move to Baltimore or Hartford or Irwindale. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a better way. Send Al to Washington and have him squeeze the money 
from the feds to rebuild the Coliseum. That would be a real victory for the 
silver and black.

SOOTHING RELIEF; JUDGE'S RX FOR EATING A COUGH DROP ON BLUE LINE: DISMISSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man's sore throat can turn into another man's sore feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how the case of the trolley line lozenge seemed to end Tuesday in 
Compton Municipal Court as a charge of "illegal eating" was dismissed against a 
31-year-old Long Beach man. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Gonzales was accused of misdemeanor munching after Sheriff's Deputy 
Brandan Hinkle caught him standing on the Metro Blue Line's Florence Avenue 
passenger platform with a suspicious substance in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cough drop," claimed Gonzales. "Candy," contended Hinkle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales was in court to argue that he had the flu Nov. 23 when Hinkle noticed 
him sucking on a Halls Mentho-Lyptus Cough Suppressant Tablet. That's medicine, 
not food -- so he should not have to cough up a $250 fine for the offense, said 
the unemployed maintenance man. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinkle was there to urge Commissioner Ellen DeShazerr not to swallow that 
excuse. He had seen hard candy in Gonzales' mouth -- the kind of snack that 
leaves trolley seats sticky and floors filthy, said the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 But after conferring with Gonzales' volunteer attorney and Hinkle's 
train-patrol supervisor, DeShazerr came up with her own Rx. She agreed to 
dismiss the charge if Gonzales would visit a Blue Line equipment yard to see 
how workers struggle to keep the rail cars clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, both lawyer George Bird Jr. and Sheriff's Lt. Ted Siara claimed 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bird: "It's a win for Mr. Gonzales. I didn't want to see the sheriff with 
any more egg on his face -- I would have appealed a conviction to Superior 
Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Siara: "I think Mr. Gonzales has gotten the message. What the judge did 
was validate the law. Cleanliness conveys a sense of safety to passengers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling was more of a bitter pill for Hinkle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly know the difference between candy and a cough drop," he said 
outside the courtroom. "I'm certainly not going to cite someone for taking 
medication on the Blue Line. I saw him sucking on hard candy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinkle predicted that the dismissal would send a "mixed message" to Blue Line 
riders -- about 150 or so receive citations each month for eating candy, 
sipping beverages or snacking on the Los Angeles-to-Long Beach route. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly sent something of a mixed message to Gonzales.  
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, "I feel good they now believe it was a cough drop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the other, he said also feels another cold coming on. 
</P>
<P>
 Glancing toward Hinkle, he added: "I'm not going to take a cough drop on the 
Blue Line again."

SIMI VALLEY BOY STABBED TO DEATH AFTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 14-year-old Simi Valley boy was stabbed to death as he was boarding a school 
bus outside his junior high school Tuesday, and police quickly arrested a 
13-year-old schoolmate as the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-grader Chad Patrick Hubbard, who pitched for his school baseball team, 
was about to board the bus at Valley View Junior High School as classes ended 
about 3:20 p.m., when two classmates confronted him, student witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 One pulled out a knife and, with a sweep of his arm, stabbed Chad in the 
heart, the students reportedly said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pronounced dead at Simi Valley Adventist Hospital after physicians 
attempted to revive him.

MIKE PENNER: ANGELS' SQUEAKIEST HIP GETS ALL THE GREASE, ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tale of two left fielders, both from Chicago, both cast-adrift free agents, 
both signed by the Angels within the last three days: 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder A has a career batting average of .285. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder B has a career batting average of .247. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder A hit .300 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder B hit .232 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder A had 11 home runs, 35 RBIs, 17 doubles and eight stolen bases 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder B had 16 home runs, 45 RBIs, nine doubles and zero stolen bases 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder A struck out 51 times in 310 at-bats last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder B struck out 106 times in 284 at-bats last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder A turned 30 in November and is in excellent physical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder B turned 31 in November and has been a physical question mark 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you're the Angels' general manager. Which player gets the 
million-dollar contract? 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you're the Angels' field manager. Which player would you rather have 
in your lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you're the Angels' publicity director. Which player gets the major 
print, television and radio news conference at Anaheim Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 Perception and reality were realigned into separate leagues this week with the 
Angels' signings of left fielders A and B. Or, as they are more commonly known, 
Dwight Smith and Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who needs no introduction, received one anyway, his Anaheim arrival 
heralded with the most widely attended news conference the Angels have held 
since the signing of another Jackson, Reggie, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, meanwhile, became an Angel on Tuesday amid no pomp, no circumstance and 
only a few quick phone calls to the local beat writers. This is probably 
because Smith never won the Heisman Trophy, never played tailback for the 
Raiders, never hit the center-field tarp with an All-Star game-opening home run 
and never filmed any cleverly scripted shoe commercial aimed at making him a 
nationally beloved folk hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo knows publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight knows how to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference can be measured in the zeros following the dollar sign on their 
contracts, and the size of the headlines welcoming them to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Smith, you may or may not know, is one of the premier pinch-hitters in 
baseball. Last season, he batted .375 in that role, ranking him third in the 
majors behind Atlanta's Deion Sanders and the New York Yankees' Dion James. He 
also had the highest batting average among Chicago Cub outfielders with more 
than 100 at-bats, appearing in a total of 111 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bo played in only 85 games with the White Sox last season after sitting out 
all of 1992 following hip replacement surgery. But that was 80 to 84 games more 
than anyone else expected, and on that achievement alone, Bo was awarded the 
American League's 1993 comeback player of the year trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 As for 1994, the house is divided. The Angels signed Jackson as an insurance 
policy for young left fielder Eduardo Perez, whose throwing arm remains tender 
after off-season arthroscopic surgery. If Perez's elbow flares up, the Angels 
are hoping Jackson can fill in on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Schueler, the White Sox general manager, has his doubts, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's limited in his cutting and his ability to stop and start in the 
outfield," Schueler says. "We needed someone more versatile to play an outfield 
position. We didn't feel he could play enough to help us. We were looking for 
at least 100 games and we didn't feel he could do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also always worried that he could re-break or re-injure his hip. We took 
X-rays at the end of the season and they showed some wear and tear, some 
deteriorating." 
</P>
<P>
 Schueler says "Bo can help a team most as a DH . . . He still has that bat 
speed, he still has strength. (And) he still has a strong throwing arm. It 
would be tough to run on him if the ball was hit straight to him in left field, 
but we were really concerned with the stopping and cutting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels already have a designated hitter, a pretty good one, Chili Davis. 
"He's still there, isn't he?" Schueler asks. Yes, he is, coming off a 112-RBI 
season. If there's one thing the Angels don't need, it's another designated 
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Can Bo pitch? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that depends upon your definition. Right now, the Angels have games to 
be saved and tickets to be sold. Most likely, Bo won't be seen in the Angel 
bullpen anytime soon. But on billboards? Hey, the man can pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Angels sold 13,000 season tickets. This year, as of Feb. 1, 
season-ticket renewals are at 9,590. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Bo has come to the rescue in the nick of time, just in time 
for the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Bo, the Angels' most substantial off-season addition was Spike Owen. 
Now, on paper and promotional pamphlets, the Angels can return fire with the 
rest of the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland signed Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas signed Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle signed Greg Hibbard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels signed Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they need a left fielder whose bat can turn on a curveball, if not the 
turnstiles, whose hip is sturdy enough to go the distance, if not to the next 
photo shoot, they also have Dwight Smith.

TEAMS COULD BE ORPHANS; COLISEUM: RAIDERS, USC AWAIT ENGINEERS' REPORTS TO SEE 
IF THEY WILL HAVE TO FIND SOMEPLACE TO PLAY NEXT FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the final gun of the Super Bowl, 12 Raiders became free agents. Now, you 
might be able to add the franchise to that list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and USC are closely watching engineers' efforts to determine the 
damage to the Coliseum caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake, because of the 
possibility that both might have to play games elsewhere next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the Raiders and USC have been made aware of the damage," said Jay 
Hagerman, the Coliseum's general manager. "I received a phone call from Mike 
Garrett's office Monday, asking if USC should be considering an alternative 
stadium for next season. I told him that it was premature at this time, until 
we get an idea of damage and costs to repair from the engineers. That will be 
in 10 days to two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett, USC's athletic director, has remained mum about the subject 
throughout the past two weeks, since learning of the damage to the Coliseum, 
where the Trojans have played home games for 70 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we feel we will be back in the Coliseum," said Tim Tessalone, 
USC's spokesman. "Until we hear about engineering reports of structural damage, 
it's probably premature to talk to anyone about moving games." 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than the Raiders are saying. They are referring all inquiries to 
the Coliseum managers. 
</P>
<P>
 USC's schedule is set, though there is limited flexibility. The NFL schedule 
is not made until May, which gives the Raiders time to consider alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think either team has talked to anybody about moving games yet," said 
Cindy Rubin, public relations director for Sports Arena and Coliseum complex. 
"They've both been made aware, and I think they've both walked through the 
Coliseum. But to be honest, most of our efforts have been made to get the 
Sports Arena up and functioning. We don't have any events in the Coliseum for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 If ever. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary estimate of damage at the Coliseum was $35 million, but after 
viewing additional damage from Saturday's 5.0 aftershock, some regard that as 
too low, and the possibility has been raised that the facility is irreparable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Repairs will take six months to a year," said Nahih Youssef, head of Nahih 
Youssef and Associates of Los Angeles, the principal engineering firm retained 
by the Coliseum Commission to do the structural engineering report. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has been red-tagged (closed to people) by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Coliseum is not available to the Raiders and USC, there are 
alternatives, each carrying potential conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if they tell us there is no way that we can play there, we have to 
look elsewhere, and I think there are obvious sites in Southern California," 
Tessalone said. "This is a unique situation, and one thing to consider is that 
there aren't 20 teams competing for those sites." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those sites is the Rose Bowl, where UCLA has six games scheduled this 
fall, one of them against USC. Schedules of the two schools show two home-game 
conflicts -- on Sept. 3, when UCLA plays Tennessee and USC plays Washington, 
and Sept. 24, when UCLA plays Washington State and USC plays Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the Rose Bowl would be vacant for USC and Raider home games. But 
there is the added difficulty of dealing with the Arroyo Seco Ordinance, which 
prohibits more than 12 events with more than 20,000 spectators at the Rose Bowl 
in a calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the World Cup playing eight games there, there are 15 such events already 
scheduled in 1994, including the Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "it might be available," said Ann Erdman, a spokesman for the city of 
Pasadena. "We certainly would welcome conversations with the two teams, if the 
need arises." 
</P>
<P>
 Either team playing games at the Rose Bowl would need the acquiescence of the 
Pasadena City Council and neighborhood groups in the Arroyo Seco. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Stadium is another possibility. Dodger President Peter O'Malley said 
Tuesday that neither team has made an overture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several years ago, when the Coliseum was remodeled, it was the Dodgers' 
position that if the city and county officials asked us to accommodate a 
football team on a short-term basis, we would consider having them, providing 
it would not disrupt the baseball season," said Dodger spokesman Jay Lucas. 
"The Dodgers' position remains the same today." 
</P>
<P>
 USC would have two conflicts at Dodger Stadium, barring complications posed by 
the baseball postseason -- on Sept. 3, with the Washington game, when the 
Dodgers play the St. Louis Cardinals; and on Oct. 1, when the Trojans face 
Oregon at home and the Dodgers play the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 A third possibility is Anaheim Stadium, which also suffered earthquake damage, 
though minor in comparison to that of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that there have been discussions (with USC) in the past, when they 
were talking about renovations to the Coliseum taking perhaps a year," said 
Bret Colson of the city of Anaheim. "But I don't think that there have been any 
discussions yet on this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans would conflict with the Angels only on Sept. 24, with the Baylor 
game, when the Angels play the Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicts with the Rams at Anaheim would not seem to pose a problem for the 
NFL. The New York Giants and the New York Jets both play at Giants Stadium 
without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials are more concerned about their building than the tenants at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first priority is to get things repaired and to make the Coliseum safe," 
Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a damage assessment is made, funding must be secured, presumably from 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Coliseum is likely to fall 
behind hospitals and roadways in importance when federal funds are disbursed. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be one of the reasons for a delay in securing alternative sites -- to 
allow pressure to be brought on FEMA to award funding. The Coliseum and Sports 
Arena employ 8,000 full- and part-time personnel, making the buildings the 
second-largest employer -- behind USC -- in South Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in another development, Russell Lane, the city's chief building 
inspector, said his agency had yellow-tagged the 1932 Olympic swim stadium next 
to the Coliseum. A yellow tag allows operators of a facility to go inside with 
proper safeguards, but keeps the public out. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane questioned whether it is legal for the Coliseum Commission to meet today 
inside the gates of the red-tagged Coliseum in its regular meeting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't send the police down there to arrest them, but if they are inside 
even the administrative offices, they should certainly be wearing hard hats and 
safety shoes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Farnum, the commission's administrative officer, said, however, that 
the meeting would take place in the regular place, regardless. Participants 
will not be allowed to go into the stadium proper, she said.

DEVILISH CHIEF; CHEROKEE PARKS HAS ACQUIRED A NICKNAME AND SOME RECOGNITION AT 
NO. 1 DUKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his freshman year at Duke, Cherokee Parks admits he was "along for the 
ride," a wide-eyed youngster who took a back seat while Christian Laettner 
drove Duke to the NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks moved up to the passenger seat as a sophomore, but with Bobby Hurley at 
the controls and Grant Hill and Thomas Hill navigating, Parks could pretty much 
roll down the window and enjoy the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Parks is a junior, and while the 6-foot-11 center is not in the driver's 
seat -- that role clearly belongs to Grant Hill -- there are days when Coach 
Mike Krzyzewski hands Parks the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 There was last Saturday, when Parks scored 24 points and had 11 rebounds in a 
75-62 victory over Maryland. Or on Jan. 22, when Parks had 23 points and 10 
rebounds in a 106-79 victory over Florida State. Or Jan. 15, when Parks had 19 
points and 14 rebounds in a 66-58 victory over Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Jan. 10, when Parks scored 25 points and had 14 rebounds in an 
89-71 victory over Brown; and Dec. 11, when Parks had 23 points and nine 
rebounds in a 73-63 victory at Michigan; and Dec. 4, when Parks had 20 rebounds 
in an 82-60 victory over Xavier. 
</P>
<P>
 Get the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, the former Huntington Beach Marina High standout, has gone from a bit 
player as a freshman to Duke's best supporting actor -- and sometimes leading 
man -- as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 An almost timid freshman, Parks spent his first college season as Laettner's 
practice punching bag and averaged five points, 2.4 rebounds and 12 minutes. He 
is now the dominating center that most expected when he was coming out of high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks is tied with Hill for the team scoring lead, at 16.3 points per game, 
and averages 9.6 rebounds. He is shooting 62.6% and has 27 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had only one sub-par game this season, a five-point, seven-rebound 
effort in a 69-68 loss to Wake Forest on Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks is one of the primary reasons Duke is 15-1 and ranked first in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My role has increased each year, but it seems like there has always been two 
or three 'go-to guys,' so there's not that much pressure," Parks said. "Antonio 
(Lang) will have a great game one night, Grant Hill the next, then maybe me. 
Still, it's nice that I'm doing a little more now, getting some more 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Not if you're an opposing Atlantic Coast Conference coach. Florida State's Pat 
Kennedy saw Parks dissect his front line and came away with a new appreciation 
for the center, who is known as "Chief." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very impressed with Cherokee's development," Kennedy said. "Being 
able to go away from the basket and help them, I feel that's an added dimension 
for that team." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks has added a mid-range jump shot to his repertoire, but the main reason 
for his emergence has been his continued development in the post. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a few more inside moves, he has gained strength and a summer tour 
through Argentina and Spain with the U.S. Under-22 World Championship team 
helped put him in the proper frame of mind for this season. "It was a good 
chance to play against quality players, and the game abroad is very 
aggressive," Parks said. "That whole experience helped me out. I've been trying 
to be more aggressive from block to block. If you're aggressive on defense, it 
all translates to offense." 
</P>
<P>
 When you regularly play against 7-foot North Carolina center Eric Montross, 
there's no room for timidity. Parks and Montross will renew their rivalry 
Thursday in Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole Duke-North Carolina thing gets pretty wild here," Parks said. 
"Last year, our school papers were lashing out at each other weeks before the 
game. On the front page of ours, there was this huge, white block of nothing, 
and the caption read: 'This empty white space is here to remind you of Eric 
Montross.' 
</P>
<P>
 "They said something about my hair, that it was too long or bushy, that I 
needed a haircut. I can live with that. It's unbelievable how up the students 
get for this game, and I've never seen anything as intense as the rivalries 
between schools here." 
</P>
<P>
 Some thought Parks wouldn't be able to handle that ACC atmosphere and 
pressure. They thought he was the stereotypical Californian -- Parks once said 
his idea of a perfect day would be to sleep past noon and spend the rest of the 
day at the beach -- and that such an attitude would shape his on-court persona. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parks has dispelled that myth with his aggressive play. "All I heard when 
I got here was that I'm from California, I'm real laid back and I don't try 
hard," Parks said. "It's not like that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Parks heard a lot more that freshman year. As if the transition from 
the Sunset League to the ACC, from Beach Blvd. to Tobacco Road, wasn't tough 
enough, Parks had to do it with Laettner screaming in one ear and sticking his 
elbow in the other. Laettner, the former Duke All-American, decided to take 
Parks under his wing, but this wasn't your typical veteran-tutors-rookie 
relationship. It was more of a military academy plebe assault, complete with 
hazing of the physical and verbal variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always coming down on my game," Parks said in 1992. "I'd have a good 
game and he'd tell me, 'Oh, you just got lucky,' or 'Yeah, but their best 
player fouled out,' or 'You're lucky I got in foul trouble and you got some 
minutes.' . . . He tells you exactly what he thinks, and a lot of it's 
negative." 
</P>
<P>
 What was this, Duke or The Citadel? Parks wondered at times, but looking back 
on that freshman year, he realized that Laettner was just trying to make him a 
better, tougher player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on me hard, but he was like that with everyone -- that's just his 
personality," Parks said. "He beat me a lot in practice and rubbed it in, but 
it eventually wore off." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Parks almost a whole season to escape Laettner's shadow. Parks had a 
solid sophomore season -- a 12.3-point, 6.9-rebound average, a 65.2% shooting 
mark that was third best in the nation and 65 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But an eye injury sidelined him for eight weeks in the fall, and he injured 
his ankle in the first half of Duke's NCAA second-round game against Cal and 
didn't play in the second half of the Blue Devils' loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christian had a great sophomore season," Parks said, "and they were expecting 
the same from me." 
</P>
<P>
 That was not fair to Parks. Laettner was an all-around talent, who was as 
effective shooting three-pointers as he was in the post. Parks is more of a 
traditional center, who rarely wanders beyond the key, yet Duke fans expected 
him to do the same things Laettner did. "Last year, people said I needed to do 
this and that, but I haven't heard that this year," Parks said. "I've 
established myself down low. Christian did more on the perimeter, but I'm more 
of a center than he was." 
</P>
<P>
 He is also more of a conversation piece in college basketball in at least one 
way -- his name. His parents, Larry and Debe Parks, named his older sister 
Coreyshane and decided on Cherokee for their second child before they even knew 
it was a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' heritage includes a bit of Native American ancestry on his father's 
side, but there is another reason for his given name. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while, my family was kind of hippies," he said. He added that his 
mother once gave him a chance to change his name back to something more 
traditional, but he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like my name," he said. "Nobody has to say, 'Cherokee who?' "

MIKE DOWNEY: HARDING'S FALL REALLY BIG PUSH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And so this little crumb of a man, Jeff Gillooly, stands there in front of a 
judge, pleads guilty to doing his diabolical deeds and then has his hired 
mouthpiece tell us how the state of Oregon will at least get to keep the 
$100,000 fine should his client see any future money out of all this. 
</P>
<P>
 What Tonya Harding ought to be charged with is criminal taste in men. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, after she won a U.S. championship previous to her most recent one, 
Harding happened to mention her husband Gillooly by name. Somebody asked: "How 
do you spell that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Spell what?" Harding asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last name." 
</P>
<P>
 With a stare and a sneer, the skater replied: "H-A-R-D-I-N-G." 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of the rink are closing in around tiny Tonya, who edges ever closer 
to having her name replaced by a number. Oregon authorities are sweeping out a 
small cell to accommodate her sniveling spouse and a larger cell to reserve for 
that wide-body bodyguard of hers. But it could be curtains for Harding soon, 
too. If she ever in her life has exercised expert spin control, now is the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe him, she begged Tuesday. Gillooly's plea-bargain throwing her to 
the wolves is simply part of "a continued practice of abusive conduct" toward 
her, Harding said through her attorney. Don't believe this guy now after all he 
has done. Don't believe this guy after all you already know about him. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the same man Harding once complained to the police who yanked her around 
by the hair and ripped it out by the roots and slammed her skull repeatedly 
onto the bathroom floor. He is the same man, she said, who slammed a car door 
on her fingers, who chased her in his truck (in violation of a restraining 
order), who stole her coat, who struggled with her one night until a shotgun 
went off in her hands and the cops had to come slap handcuffs on Harding and 
read her Miranda rights. 
</P>
<P>
 More than once, she went back to the guy. Why? Who knows why anybody goes back 
to anybody? Maybe because misery loves company, or maybe because Tonya Harding 
was every bit as miserable a person as Jeff Gillooly. In any case, she did 
reconcile with this man with the poisoned mind who, when asked in court whether 
he were guilty of plotting acts of violence against an innocent ice skater, 
swore before judge and world: "I am." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for him. Sweep him away with a bailiff's broom. 
</P>
<P>
 Have there been many moments more chilling than when Ronald H. Hoevet, 
attorney for the confessor, was asked whether or not Jeff Gillooly or Tonya 
Harding ever discussed killing Nancy Kerrigan? No, the man said, whereupon a 
follow-up question was asked -- did anybody ever plan to kill Nancy Kerrigan? 
-- and the lawyer's reply was: "Jeff Gillooly and Tonya Harding did not discuss 
killing Nancy Kerrigan." Leaving all to wonder who else might have. 
</P>
<P>
 To seven separate acts of impropriety or inhumanity, Gillooly acknowledged 
guilt. Hoevet ticked them off like a grocery list: 1. Intent to injure or 
assault; 2. Illegal recording of a conversation; 3. Conspiracy to commit 
first-degree battery; 4. The actual assault itself; 5. Intent to commit 
perjury; 6. A similar lie under oath; 7. Conduct resulting in the destruction 
of physical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you get the feeling that somewhere in New England, there is a young woman 
with a swollen knee who sits in a soft chair staring at a TV and repeatedly 
shaking her head in disbelief? 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Gillooly admits that each of these incidents occurred," said Mr. Hoevet. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, have a nice day, Mr. Gillooly. Have a swell cell. 
</P>
<P>
 But before he goes, damned if Jeff Gillooly isn't going to take someone with 
him. Someone being his wife, with whom he has conspired, he says. She was in on 
it, he says. She made phone calls. She dropped him off with the two grand to 
pay Shawn Eckardt, that tower of Jell-O bodyguard they hired. She became upset 
when the job wasn't done as originally scheduled and demanded satisfaction or 
her money back. Tonya did this and Tonya did that, he says, and why shouldn't 
we believe him, Jeff Gillooly being such an upstanding citizen and all? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think any of you will go to bed tonight" still believing in the 
innocence of Tonya, said her husband's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 How can the woman skate for America? She covered up knowledge of a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoevet: "That fact alone ought to be 'unsportsmanlike,' don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's whole career is going down the drain, and Gillooly is the Drano. He 
is quickening the slide. Now that Harding's out there trying to avoid taking 
the fall, well, the least Gillooly can do is stick out his foot and trip her. 
Haven't we seen this story before? Wasn't it with John Garfield and Lana 
Turner, or was it with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange? Something to do with a 
postman who came by more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's going down. You can feel it now. Either she did this thing or she 
didn't, but she is going down, one way or another. The Olympic people are going 
to pull her plug. This thing is spinning out of control. It is too wild, too

PUCK DOESN'T STOP IN MILWAUKEE; HOCKEY: NHL EXPANSION ELUDES APPARENTLY 
FAVORABLE CITY AMID RELUCTANCE OF BILLIONAIRE PETTIT TO ENDURE LONG-TERM 
MEDIOCRITY AND EXORBITANT ENTRANCE FEE. 
</P>

<P>
 It looks like an NHL arena. It actually looks nicer than most NHL arenas, big 
without being cavernous and modern without being stark. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like an NHL arena. It rocks with the cheers of nearly 9,000 fans at 
each hockey game, more than attend some games in Hartford and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Then why isn't Bradley Center home to an NHL team? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Milwaukee seems to have everything a professional league could want, 
major league hockey has passed it by. And judging by the NHL's recent 
expansions to warm-weather cities and covetous glances it is directing toward 
Seattle and Portland, Milwaukee probably won't get another chance to grab the 
NHL's brass ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The city boasts many attractions. A major league arena? It has the 
five-year-old Bradley Center, home to the NBA's Bucks. Hockey tradition? 
Milwaukee has long been the home of the International Hockey League's Admirals. 
Solid local ownership? Milwaukee has resident billionaire philanthropists Lloyd 
Pettit, formerly the Chicago Blackhawks' play-by-play announcer, and Jane 
Bradley, Pettit's wife and benefactor of local charities. Owners of the 
Admirals, they financed the Bradley Center and donated it to the city. They 
also contributed $2 million for the Pettit National Ice Center, a 
state-of-the-art speedskating rink used for the Olympic trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like an NHL franchise. That's the epitome of what you strive for," said 
Phil Wittliff, Admiral general manager. "However, we're happy with what we 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 They have one of hockey's most successful minor league franchises. The 
Admirals, who are not affiliated with an NHL club, last season drew an average 
of 9,117 to 41 home games, the first IHL team to average more than 9,000. 
They've led the league in attendance for the last five seasons and will 
probably be tops again. With ticket prices of $11 and $8, they provide an 
affordable night out for the family. Prices for the Bucks, who average almost 
16,000 a game, range from $95 for courtside seats to $35, $32 and $24. Some 
seats are available at $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee supports the NBA well and has shown it would do the same for the 
NHL. The Blackhawks and the Kings drew 16,292 to a neutral-site game at the 
Bradley Center last season, and 9,836 attended another neutral-site contest 
between the Washington Capitals and the Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he applied for an expansion team for the 1992-93 season, Pettit 
commissioned a market research study by the Gordon S. Black Corp. of Rochester, 
N.Y. The study found that fans in Milwaukee and its surrounding counties would 
buy about 11,200 tickets a game at a top price of $30 and that local businesses 
would add enthusiastic support. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concluded: "An NHL franchise will succeed in Milwaukee if Wisconsin 
Ice Hockey (the group formed to apply for a franchise) builds a quality, 
competitive team." 
</P>
<P>
 There's the rub. Concerned that the expansion draft would leave him the dregs 
of the league's talent and a mediocre roster, Pettit abruptly ended his long 
and ardent pursuit of NHL membership three years ago. He has not tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have withdrawn Wisconsin Ice Hockey, Inc.'s application for (a) National 
Hockey League expansion franchise because such a franchise would result in a 
non-competitive team and an economically unsound franchise," he said in a 
statement on Oct. 10, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit declined to be interviewed about his NHL hopes. However, a year ago, 
before the Kings and Blackhawks played at the Bradley Center, he said he had 
virtually given up on bringing NHL hockey to Milwaukee. The terms of the 
expansion, which added Tampa Bay and Ottawa to the league, soured him on trying 
for another expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 As well they might. The NHL, which has limited scope and no national 
television contract, wanted a $50-million entrance fee. The NBA, riding a 
marketing and attendance surge, had charged $32.5 million to admit Charlotte 
and Miami in 1988-89, and Orlando and Minnesota in 1989-90. The NHL's price tag 
also drove off groups from Seattle, Houston, Hamilton, Canada, and St. 
Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Milwaukee was viewed by many, because of the arena and the applicant who 
clearly met the wealth parameter set by the league, as the strongest 
candidate," Bill Lear, a banker involved with the Seattle group, told the 
Milwaukee Sentinel after Pettit's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit's ire was heightened by a deal given George and Gordon Gund when they 
sold the Minnesota North Stars in May, 1990. Without competition, the Gunds got 
an expansion team in San Jose for 1991-92 for $42.9 million, or $50 million 
less a $7.1-million kickback of future expansion fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was a bad deal: $50 million, and the players that they were going 
to make available to us were going to make us a loser for a long time to come," 
Wittliff said. "So Mr. Pettit withdrew his application." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Pettit's misfortune that in the next expansion draft, better players 
were made available. The Mighty Ducks and the Florida Panthers, who also paid 
$50 million each, had a deeper talent pool to draw on and a good choice of 
goaltenders to make them instantly competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say (applying again) is something the Pettits would consider, but I 
think they'd prefer an existing team so it would be closer to being 
competitive," Wittliff said. "You're not going to get Montreal or Toronto to 
move here. The top-echelon teams are rarely available. But we feel the 
lower-echelon teams are probably closer to being competitive (than an expansion 
team)." 
</P>
<P>
 IHL Commissioner Tom Berry anticipates that Milwaukee will remain in his 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Pettit has done absolutely nothing to indicate he's going to change 
that," Berry said. "A few years ago, I would have said there's a good chance 
he'd go for an NHL team, but that's not been true for over two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Wittliff said Pettit has not spoken with any of the teams that have filed 
notice of intent to move. Those include the Edmonton Oilers, who are trying to 
move to Minneapolis' Target Center, and the Hartford Whalers. Wittliff also 
said that while he'd expect the Chicago Blackhawks to ask for indemnification 
if Milwaukee got a team because Chicago is only about 90 miles away, Hawk owner 
Bill Wirtz has never specified an amount. The Ducks paid $25 million of their 
$50-million admission fee to the Kings as indemnification. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettit last tried to buy an existing team in 1986, when he offered to purchase 
a minority interest in the St. Louis Blues with an option to buy majority 
interest. He backed out of the deal when he couldn't get assurance that he'd be 
allowed to move the Blues to Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Pettit could lure a team, history stacks the odds against the move 
being approved. The last Midwestern city granted an expansion franchise was 
Kansas City in 1974-75, which lost the Scouts to Colorado after two seasons. 
The last Midwestern city to adopt a relocated team was Cleveland, which took in 
the California Seals in 1976-77. That didn't last, either: The team, renamed 
the Barons, merged with the Minnesota North Stars in 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
 California has gotten two of the last five expansion teams, Florida two more 
-- following movement in the U.S. population away from the Midwest and 
Northeast. Seattle, Phoenix and Portland are reportedly the top candidates for 
the next expansion, but NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he has no 
demographic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're responding to areas where there is interest," he said. "There's a 
number of factors -- the market, the building and most importantly the 
ownership. I'm not trying to diminish Milwaukee. We just haven't thought about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional expansion is probably not far off, but Bettman said no one has 
suggested Milwaukee to him. "We have two things in mind," he said. "First, 
we've got to have 26 stable, successful franchises. We've got to deal with 
Edmonton and Hartford and make sure the franchises we have are able to operate 
where they are. Then we look at the five most recent expansion teams to 
determine how competitive they are -- Ottawa, Tampa Bay, San Jose, Anaheim and 
Florida. What everybody's concluding is the second (condition) is not going to 
take as long as we thought. Nevertheless, we have no timetable for another 
expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 If Milwaukee never gets an NHL team, Wittliff and the Pettits can live with 
it. The Admirals are a city fixture; Bradley Center a boon to civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done well attendance-wise and we play in an arena that's as nice as any 
I've been in," Wittliff said. "It's one befitting the home of an NHL team." 
</P>
<P>
 All that's missing is the team.

RAMS' JACKSON TO DISCUSS JOB WITH NEW FALCON COACH JONES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram receivers coach Milt Jackson will meet with the Atlanta Falcons today to 
discuss taking a similar position with the staff of new Coach June Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the Rams granted the Falcons permission to talk to him.His 
contract with the Rams expires in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson flew to Atlanta on Tuesday and will interview today with Jones and 
other team officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the talking stage," Jackson said. "We haven't reached a verbal 
agreement, but I know they are interested in hiring me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach on Jan. 24, didn't 
retain receivers coach Jimmy Robinson from the staff of former head coach Jerry 
Glanville. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson joined Ram Coach Chuck Knox's staff for the 1992 season. He coached 
wide receivers at Indianapolis from 1989-91 and from 1986-88 at Houston, where 
he worked with Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "June and I have been good friends for a long time," Jackson said. MIKE

UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT BACKS FULLERTON'S CASE; JURISPRUDENCE: GORDON TESTIFIES 
THAT THE DECISION TO FIRE HUFFMAN CAME BEFORE THE COACH FILED GENDER-EQUITY 
SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton President Milton Gordon testified Tuesday that a 
recommendation to fire Jim Huffman as women's volleyball coach was made several 
weeks before Huffman filed a lawsuit that blocked the school's attempt to drop 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't pinpoint a specific meeting with (Titan Athletic Director) Bill 
Shumard, but he made the recommendation that the coach not be renewed based on 
performance," Gordon said during Huffman's wrongful-termination trial in Orange 
County Superior Court. "It was in December, 1991, or January, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 University officials claim they decided in the fall of 1991 to terminate 
Huffman because of substandard performance. Huffman, who is seeking $1.2 
million in damages, claims he was fired on March 23, 1992, because he spoke out 
against the school's poor gender-equity record and initiated successful legal 
proceedings that resulted in negative publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon's testimony corroborated the university's defense but also contradicted 
statements by Shumard in the two-week-old trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon said Tuesday that he "accepted" Shumard's recommendation. But when 
asked last Wednesday whether Gordon approved the decision not to renew Huffman 
before the school announced it was dropping volleyball on Jan. 28, 1992, 
Shumard replied: "I don't recall (Gordon) ever commenting on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Boyd, one of Huffman's attorneys: "Isn't it true, to the best of your 
recollection, that President Gordon never approved the decision to terminate 
Coach Huffman before the decision to drop volleyball?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard: "To the best of my recollection, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys must prove retaliation was a factor in his termination. 
Gordon said neither he nor any university official was retaliating. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I so much as thought that was happening, I would have stopped the 
process," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryalyce Jeremiah, Fullerton associate athletic director and one of several 
defense witnesses to testify this week, said she had several concerns with 
Huffman's program in 1991, including "players not attending study hall, 
mid-term progress reports, the team's won-loss record, a budget that wasn't 
balanced, and the on- and off-court conduct of the players." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremiah, the women's basketball coach who became interim associate athletic 
director in the fall of 1990 after Leanne Grotke retired, said a recommendation 
was made in the fall of 1991 that Huffman not be given a new contract. But 
during cross-examination, she said she "couldn't remember who made the 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremiah also testified that she never put anything in writing saying there 
were performance problems with Huffman, and there were no documents in 
Huffman's personnel file supporting a decision to terminate him. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Zucker, executive director of the Titan Athletic Foundation, also 
testified Tuesday that he was aware of a decision not to renew Huffman's 
contract in the fall of 1990 and that the move was part of a dual decision to 
drop the sport and the coach "for humanistic reasons." Athletic department 
officials have said they thought it would be easier for him to get another job 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Zucker said Shumard never cited poor performance as a 
reason for firing Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Performance issues weren't raised until after the (gender-equity) suit was 
filed," Zucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's attorneys contend that only when it became apparent in the spring of 
1992 that Huffman would file a wrongful-termination suit did school 
administrators begin looking for reasons from the fall of 1991 that would 
justify the firing.

PREP VOICES; CLUB SPORTS PROVIDE POLISH, BUT AT WHAT COST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Club programs give young athletes opportunities to play such sports as soccer, 
softball, swimming and volleyball year-round. They help provide the skills and 
polish necessary to compete at the high school, college and national levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs can often provide better facilities, stronger competition, more personal 
attention and professional expertise in a particular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But at what cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Club sports can be a lucrative business. It has been estimated that expenses 
for club volleyball players can be as much as $2,000 per year, with club 
softball players and swimmers spending nearly $1,000. And though club coaches 
say offers of college scholarships are more likely to come to their charges, 
not even the most prestigious clubs can make any guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 If an athlete wants to specialize in a sport -- a conclusion reached on his or 
her own or by a club coach demanding commitment -- what's the harm? 
</P>
<P>
 Many, including high school coaches, believe the harm comes when athletes 13 
to 18 years old are skipping softball or track seasons because they are 
concentrating on club soccer. They feel club sports rob the child of varied 
experiences that playing multiple sports offers. But make no mistake, high 
school coaches have something at stake, too -- they feel they are being robbed 
of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose interests are really at stake? PRO: LARRY DRALUCK, Southern California 
Blues Club Soccer Coach 
</P>
<P>
 Club Teams Offer More to Athletes 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should playing club sports take priority over playing high school sports? 
</P>
<P>
 The current controversy over whether club athletic programs should take 
priority over high school programs comes down to the sport in question and the 
individual athlete's goals and aspirations. Having coached at both levels as 
well as the collegiate, I maintain that if an athlete desires to become the 
best he or she can become at a particular sport, club programs have tremendous 
advantages over high school. 
</P>
<P>
 High school athletics do have their place. When it comes to high profile 
sports such as football, baseball and basketball, a strong case can be made to 
suggest the high school programs should take priority in the development of an 
athlete for the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a tremendous amount of recognition, self esteem, as well as 
redeeming social value to be gained from participating in high school sports. 
The same can be said, however, of participating in a club program. 
</P>
<P>
 In all other areas, however, I would give the advantage to the club programs. 
While the top athletes possess inherent talent, the foundation of skills for 
future development is laid at the club level when the players begin at 8 or 9 
years old. It is the clubs that provide quality players for high school 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, competition is better at the club level. Club teams play many more 
games over an extended season against quality teams and finish off with a 
competition for a national championship. High school has fewer games in a much 
shorter season often times against teams of lower quality. Again, the reasons 
people participate can be entirely different with high school having a much 
more social element and participants who often are less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the sport in question and the goal of the athlete, the decision 
can be made about which environment should be given priority. If someone is 
participating in sports and recreational or social aspects are their primary 
motivation for participating, by all means high school sports should be given 
priority. If, however, one desires to develop to the best of their ability in a 
sport, they should give the priority to their club sport. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not by chance that colleges prefer to evaluate student athletes at the 
club level under the most competitive circumstances. You need only ask the 
quality high school athlete where they feel they were developed -- the majority 
will credit their club.

 "If you're talking about excellence at the sport, club definitely increases

 "There is no question that club volleyball for girls has enhanced the program 
at Dana Hills High School. A great deal of our success in 1993 is owed to the 
year-round dedication of our athletes and their club coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of female volleyball players are involved in other sports also. My 
opinion is that the athlete's priority should be with the high school sport 
that is in season. If a female athlete is on the high school volleyball team 
and chooses to play club soccer simultaneously, the high school team should be 
the No. 1 priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Club sports help high school athletes, but if a club is making money off 
these athletes -- and they are -- the ground rules of participation and 
likelihood of earning a scholarship in any given sport had best be spelled out 
in detail, up front and truthfully. No coach, club or high school, should be 
making promises to increase membership, team size, prestige or victories while 
forsaking morality."

 "I play for a club softball team and it has never been suggested that we 
remain exclusive to the club. In fact, several of the girls on the team play 
two or more varsity sports at their respective high schools. It is true that 
club sports are highly demanding and time consuming, but there is no reason 
that an athlete should have to make a choice."

 "It is difficult for someone to play several sports at the same time because 
they cannot do justice to any of them. Most club/travel teams require that the 
athlete only play one sport so she can attend all the practices and games.

 "The travel teams help the high school teams by keeping the athletes 
fine-tuned all year instead of having to start over from scratch each year."

 "You are correct in saying club programs give young athletes opportunities to

 "It's rather absurd that sports have become a big-time operation in high 
school. These are teen-agers and they should be left alone in their 
decision-making along the lines of sports. They need to be free from the 
pressure of an adult saying, 'No, you have to do this,' because it's best for 
the adult. We have to start thinking about what's best for the children."

 "Being on a club team is good, but there are positive and negative sides to 
it. One good thing is athletes are in top condition for their sports, and if 
they stick with it and are really good, they can get scholarships and maybe go 
as far as the Olympics. The only negative thing is that it prevents athletes 
from participating in other sports. Overall, being on a club year round is good 
and healthy. And if the athlete has fun doing it, then why not? Most athletes 
who have fun, but are serious at the same time, usually succeed."

 "Should the high school coaches be surprised by the possessiveness they feel 
the club programs have toward their athletes? After nine to 10 years of working 
with an athlete to suddenly be asked to forgo all your involvement and defer to 
the high school coach is not natural. This is compounded by the fact that many 
of the high school programs are coached by walk-on coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, the club athlete hoping to earn an athletic scholarship has a 
much greater opportunity via participation in club athletics than solely in 
participating with the high school program. This is especially true with 
regards to swimming. The college coach becomes much more aware of the athlete 
through club programs and national club championships than through high school 
programs. This is due in large part to the ever-decreasing athletic budgets of 
all colleges and universities. The college coach will concentrate his/her 
recruiting dollar on attending the national club championships as opposed to 
attempting to travel to more than 50 state high school championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "A club program can generally provide a better training environment for those 
athletes that wish to excel to the highest level. This is due in large part to 
a better coach-athlete ratio as well as homogeneity of training groups."

summer."

 "Club programs enhance players' performances. They give them the opportunity 
to compete against better players and to increase their potential, especially 
girls, to get scholarships. College coaches want to know what club teams you 
played with, because they know the caliber and quality of these programs. If 
the high schools want to compete or keep the kids in their programs, they need 
to develop them better, especially girls' sports."

 "The biggest problem I've had with the high school coaches is they want to 
believe we don't exist. When it's their sport's season, they don't want their 
kids practicing with us. We have to fight to get practice time. As far as the 
strict allegiance, very few of the teams I've been around have ever said, 
'You're not to play for your high school team, you're only to play for us,' 
because we understand how important high school sports are for kids."

 "As long as colleges offer scholarships for athletes, there will be a demand

select club players for their teams, knowing that club players usually advance 
faster and further."

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; PARENTS SHOULD BEWARE WHEN SHOPPING FOR GOOD CLUB PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When you aspire to greatness, there are some great risks. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the most sound advice that can be given athletes who choose to become 
specialists, who devote the bulk of their time to one sport in the pursuit of 
the almighty scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Club sports provide the teaching that gives many of today's athletes the edge 
they need to receive local and national attention. That often leads to college 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't assume that club sports are a cure-all for a family's financial 
strain once a child leaves high school. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some things parents should know -- and do -- before committing their 
children to a club program. Remember, you're a shopper.  
</P>
<P>
 What should be known: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expectations -- of practice times, of cost, of the athlete's role on the 
team in both best- and worst-case scenarios. Will the athlete start or ride the 
bench? What will you get in return for your money? Remember, everyone pays the 
same price to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who's in charge? Don't find out only the name -- anyone can do that -- but 
investigate the coach or director, find out what kind of personality he has, 
how he deals with problems, his coaching philosophy, what his standards are for 
dealing with all sorts of moral issues that might be important to the athlete. 
One of your best resources will be former players. If there has been conflict, 
don't take a coach's word that it was the player's fault; also, don't take the 
player's word that it was the coach's fault. It's best to hear both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * Track record. Find out how many players moving on from the Under 18s are 
getting scholarships. If there's a pattern, take note; some clubs produce 
scholarship winners, some don't. Coaches will explain the importance of 
competing in club sports if the athlete really wants a scholarship, and in most 
instances, that's true -- NCAA restrictions on college coaches watching 
athletes almost mandate that they make the bulk of their judgments at club 
events in which many athletes can be reviewed in a competitive environment at 
one location. Because of limited practice time at the college level, coaches 
want to recruit the most polished athletes they can find. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond those questions, the athlete and his family must ask themselves some 
questions. There are many factors to consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * What about burnout? It's a possibility. Said one Pacific 10 coach: "It takes 
a certain personality going through the year and having all the demands without 
there being some emotional payment." Once an athlete commits his time to one 
sport -- and there is no or little emotional or physical break -- there is the 
increased opportunity for mental fatigue, injuries and burnout. Burned-out 
athletes lose their zeal, and at the collegiate level -- with the physical, 
emotional and intellectual demands of athletics and academics -- that takes its 
toll on the body, on the court and in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is the specialization worth it? Not only will an athlete be giving up a 
sport, but might also be giving up drama, music or some other 
creative/intellectual pursuit. The club athlete can miss out on the varied 
experiences those programs offer. True excellence in a given field doesn't come 
without a cost. How important is being well-rounded? 
</P>
<P>
 * How feasible is getting a scholarship? Realize NCAA Division I football 
programs get 85 scholarships and that no other program gets more than 18 (for 
ice hockey). Women's soccer and softball get 11; volleyball gets 12. One 
estimation by a Pacific 10 coach is that 30% of seniors competing in club 
volleyball get Division I scholarships, and over 50% get some kind of financial 
aid from either community colleges, NAIA or Division II schools. Although that 
estimation indicates the pot is half full, it also indicates it is half empty. 
If club coaches dangle scholarships in front of you, get it in writing. 
Remember, club coaches -- like college coaches -- want the best players 
available, and you might find yourself on the end of the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 * What do I hope to get out of it? If playing is the goal, then how much will 
I play? If recognition is the goal, then how much attention will I get? The 
answer to the last question is virtually none -- the media cover high schools 
extensively but rarely cover club sports. Most club coaches agree that the 
social element is greater in high school sports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who has what to gain? Just consider why you're wanted by this particular 
club. Are your interests best served, or are you a valuable commodity for Team 
A because you're not on Team B's roster? After all, national championships are 
at stake. Always remember that club sports is a business that makes money off 
your participation; the more people involved, the more money someone makes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wrong to assume that all club coaching is better than all high school 
coaching. It is wrong to assume all clubs are run like dictatorships in which 
athletes have no room for outside interests. It is wrong to assume that high 
school coaches don't coerce players to compete in just one sport -- their own. 
</P>
<P>
 High school sports would be much more interesting if coaches were more willing 
to share athletes. It would be great to see more wide receivers running track 
and more linemen wrestling, instead of being locked away in a weight room. It 
would be great to see more soccer players running cross-country, and more 
volleyball players competing in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, whether that happens should be the decision of the athlete. It 
should not be a mandate from the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the retail world, every attempt is made to satisfy the customer; i.e., the 
customer is always right. But in some athletic environments -- in both club and 
high school -- it's the other way around. The store manager is telling the 
customer he can or cannot shop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's strange business. And among enlightened shoppers, not without risk.

PREP VOICES; CLUB SPORTS PROVIDE POLISH, BUT AT WHAT COST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Voices was compiled by Prep Sports Editor Bob Rohwer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Club programs give young athletes opportunities to play such sports as soccer, 
softball, swimming and volleyball year-round. They help provide the skills and 
polish necessary to compete at the high school, college and national levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs can often provide better facilities, stronger competition, more personal 
attention and professional expertise in a particular sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But at what cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Club sports can be a lucrative business. It has been estimated that expenses 
for club volleyball players can be as much as $2,000 per year, with club 
softball players and swimmers spending nearly $1,000. And though club coaches 
say offers of college scholarships are more likely to come to their charges, 
not even the most prestigious clubs can make any guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 If an athlete wants to specialize in a sport -- a conclusion reached on his or 
her own or by a club coach demanding commitment -- what's the harm? 
</P>
<P>
 Many, including high school coaches, believe the harm comes when athletes 13 
to 18 years old are skipping softball or track seasons because they are 
concentrating on club soccer. They feel club sports rob the child of varied 
experiences that playing multiple sports offers. But make no mistake, high 
school coaches have something at stake, too -- they feel they are being robbed 
of athletes.

<P>
 Whose interests are really at stake? CON: CHARLIE BRANDE, Orange County, 
Balboa Bay Volleyball Clubs Coach

<P>
 Specialization Limits One's Opportunities 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Should playing club sports take priority over playing high school sports? 
</P>
<P>
 Club sports are a real "Catch 22" situation in that specialization is required 
for success in high school and college, but specialization and time restraints 
could restrict athletes from freedom to participate in other activities which 
help provide a multidimensional education. 
</P>
<P>
 We have always felt that successful high school athletic experiences are a 
major part of a student's education. There is nothing like "suiting up" to 
represent your school in a success-oriented program. Our club philosophy is to 
schedule our practices so that our club athletes can participate in as many 
school activities as possible. Our feelings are that successful school programs 
are not measured in victories but in an environment that teaches 
accountability, commitment and loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 We are obviously proud of our club players' volleyball achievements in high 
school, club and college. We are also extremely proud of our athletes like 
Newport Harbor's Tina Bowman (basketball and State CIF track) and Melissa 
Schutz (basketball and CIF swimming), Corona del Mar's Kristen Campbell (ASB 
president and homecoming queen) and Kelly Campbell (soccer and State CIF track) 
and El Toro's Monika Bickert (a member of the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District board of education). We have strongly encouraged these activities and 
worked to allow them to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, our top 16s team competed in a major tournament without two 
starters as Tina Bowman and Kelly Campbell competed in the State finals in 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 Most club participants are achievement-oriented. With club emphasis on 
academics, the players learn the lessons of budgeting time ad organizing 
responsibilities. Our five committed seniors have selected colleges which will 
attest to the academic emphasis: Rice, Duke, Princeton, UC Santa Barbara and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to NCAA practice rule changes as well as the academic and financial 
additions to attending college, participation in a successful club program 
becomes more important for those student-athletes who quest for a college 
education and collegiate athletic successes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many club and high school coaches believe that success in many 
different sports and activities only serves to breed further success.

SHE KNOWS THE NOSE; THE GOAL WAS TO CLIMB ALONG THE PROW OF EL CAPITAN IN 
YOSEMITE WITHOUT ROPES, AND HILL WAS THE FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To non-climbers, the phrase "Free the Nose" might sound like a bit of nonsense 
-- or perhaps the demands of a peculiar protest group -- but to climbing 
aficionados it represents one of the sport's long-sought goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nose is one of Yosemite's classic big-wall climbing routes, one that 
ascends straight along the prow of El Capitan, the 3,000-foot granite monolith 
that is one of the national park's landmarks. Free is short for free-climb: To 
climb each pitch without the help of a rope -- except for protection against a 
fall -- or other climbing aid. 
</P>
<P>
 First up the nose, in 1958, was Warren Harding. With bolts and pitons (some 
fashioned from stove legs), Harding and a series of partners pioneered the 
route in 45 days of climbing, spread over 18 months. Other firsts followed: the 
initial solo ascent, the first ascent in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, many of the big-wall climbs in Yosemite were achieved by those who 
inched their way up without the use of climbing aids, but the Nose was slow to 
go. The 34 sections -- or "pitches" -- on the route fell one at a time to 
free-climbers, but by last summer no one had free-climbed the entire route, and 
two of the pitches had never been climbed without aid. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bachar, one of the sport's best and a veteran of 20 years of climbing in 
Yosemite, had heard speculation on when the route would go free for as long as 
he could remember. Several tried, only to be stopped by the most storied pitch 
on the route, the Great Roof, a dramatic overhang that requires some difficult 
crack climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last August, climber Lynn Hill solved the Great Roof on a free-climbing 
attempt on the Nose, only to be stymied by another difficult pitch higher up. 
She was back the following month and this time free-climbed the entire route, 
reaching the top on Sept. 16. In an endeavor still largely dominated by men, 
Hill had scored one of climbing's biggest coups. 
</P>
<P>
 "While everybody's sleeping, she grabs the prize free-climbing route in the 
country, maybe on the planet," Bachar said. "It's one of the premier bags of 
all time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is hardly unknown. Climbing's first female star, she dominated 
competitive sport climbing for its first several years and has more than 20 
World Cup titles to her credit. 
</P>
<P>
 On a promotional tour, Hill made a recent stop at an indoor climbing gym in 
Costa Mesa, drawing an admiring crowd for an afternoon climbing demonstration, 
then selling out two evening slide shows to their 300-seat capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 33, got her first glimpse of El Capitan on a camping trip with her 
family when she was 13 and lived in Fullerton. The next year, she got her first 
taste of climbing when an older brother and sister introduced her to it at Lake 
Perris. On subsequent trips to Joshua Tree, a climbing mecca in the high 
desert, she became hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill graduated to tougher and tougher climbs, eventually returning to El 
Capitan for a classic-style three-day ascent in 1979. In the '70s, climbing was 
still largely an esoteric endeavor. "When I started climbing, (it) was not a 
cool sport -- people didn't think of it as a sport at all," Hill said. "I liked 
the spontaneity of climbing and the natural environment and the freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's reputation continued to grow, and in 1986 she was invited to climb in 
one of the first international competitions, in Arcos, Italy. She won and went 
on to dominate the sport in its early years. In sport climbing, pursued 
primarily on artificial walls, climbers compete against each other on 
increasingly difficult routes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Hill was still one of the top women in climbing, winning several 
major competitions and finishing third overall in the year-end World Cup 
standings. Still, she decided to cut back on competitive climbing to 
concentrate on other projects, including a book, business interests and a 
renewed emphasis on climbing natural rock. 
</P>
<P>
 El Capitan continued to interest her. About six years ago, climber and close 
friend John Long had suggested a free-climbing assault on the Nose. "It wasn't 
a new idea, but it stuck in my mind," she recalled. In the summer of '92, she 
returned to the Nose for a one-day ascent with a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she wasn't able to study closely the logistics of a free-climbing 
ascent then, Hill said: "Ever since then, I thought I really want to come back 
and try this free. The seed was planted in my brain." 
</P>
<P>
 She came back last summer, looking for a partner, and finally hooked up with 
British climber Simon Nadin for an August attempt. The two were pressed for 
time, and their ascent was slowed when they continually crossed paths with a 
team of Croatian climbers. Although she was tired, Hill managed to solve the 
Great Roof on her final try. The next day, however, the pitch above Camp 6 
proved too much, and the pair climbed past it to the top with help of ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill called Steve West, a representative of her climbing shoe sponsor, with 
news of her climb, and he persuaded her to go back to get some photographs on 
the Great Roof. She agreed, with thoughts of trying the full climb again, and 
upon her return to the valley was joined by climber Brooke Sandahl. 
</P>
<P>
 During the photo session, Hill was able to refine her technique on the Great 
Roof pitch; also, she worked out the moves at Camp 6, which had defeated her on 
the previous attempt, and knocked out a broken piton from a tiny crack that 
might come in handy. She said that after three days of practicing on the pitch, 
"I was pretty sure it would go. I had not linked it yet, though -- I had done 
it in sections." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair started the climb, and this time everything came together -- the 
weather held clear until the end of the climb; the traffic on the popular route 
wasn't a hindrance and Hill was climbing well. She again handled the Great Roof 
-- although Sandahl had to climb with aid -- and this time was able to 
free-climb the Camp 6 pitch with the help of the tiny crack she had cleared and 
some unconventional moves. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 16, after 3 1/2 days on the rock, Hill and Sandahl made it to the 
summit. "I was just really happy," Hill said. "It was still light out, and we 
had time to relax and make a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Other climbers joined them and, she added: "We had a really nice time, sitting 
around the campfire like the good old days." 
</P>
<P>
 The climb left her exhilarated, not tired. "I definitely felt like I had put 
in my three days of hard effort, but I didn't feel exhausted," she said. "You 
don't feel exhausted after you've done something significant like that. You 
feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That a woman was the first to climb the route surprised some, but Hill has 
long maintained that climbing is ideally suited to females. It is less 
dependent on brute strength than on the strength-to-weight ratio, and at less 
than 110 pounds Hill is lean -- and strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 5 feet 2, she is sometimes at a disadvantage because of her reach, but on 
this climb her small hands and fingers were actually a boon during some of the 
more difficult crack climbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a phenomenal climber anyway, but in this case, it's ironic that she had 
an advantage," Bachar said. "The reality of crack climbing is, if you can't get 
your fingers in the crack, you can't climb it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill feels pride in her accomplishment, but knows that other previously 
"unclimbable" routes will fall. "I'll never say that the challenges are drying 
up, because there's always vision. There's always the potential for someone to 
have the idea for something grand," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) a challenge like that, that was kind of like plucking the classic, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
 After her current tour, Hill will head home, to the Provence region of France. 
As for her next big challenge, she's not sure yet, but she may not be done with 
El Capitan. 
</P>

 "I'm thinking of doing it all free in a day. I would like to do that, but I 
almost feel like I don't want to dwell too much on one route," she said. "I 
like the effort of a long climb . . . sort of a balance between technical 
challenge, length, aesthetic beauty -- all those elements are really important 
to me."

 The Washington Redskins have hired Norv Turner to be their new coach and will 
make the official announcement today, according to the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, the Dallas Cowboys' offensive coordinator, accepted the job Tuesday at 
a meeting with Washington owner Jack Kent Cooke and General Manager Charley 
Casserly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins didn't interview any other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 41, is a former USC and Ram assistant and is expected to retain four 
current Washington assistants -- line coach Jim Hanifan, secondary coach Emmitt 
Thomas, offensive assistant Russ Grimm and research and development/receivers 
coach Charley Taylor. Former Cincinnati assistant Ron Lynn is expected to be 
named defensive coordinator, with former Cincinnati assistants, Mike Haluchak 
and Bob Karmelowicz, joining him. 
</P>
<P>
 Milt Jackson, Ram receivers coach, will meet with the Atlanta Falcons today to 
discuss taking a similar position with the staff of June Jones, new Falcons' 
coach.

KENNEDY PLAYS ON DESPITE HARDSHIPS FROM EARTHQUAKE; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: 
SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION AND THE GYM IS DAMAGED, BUT GOLDEN COUGARS CONTINUE 
SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 New doesn't necessarily mean better, a point hammered home with force Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy High is the newest of the City Section's 49 high schools, yet it 
sustained the worst damage in the Northridge earthquake. El Camino Real is the 
second-newest campus, and it also suffered serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools are expected to remain closed for the next few weeks, which has 
left the basketball teams in a state of flux. 
</P>
<P>
 Newest or not, Kennedy was dealt the worst hand of all. To recap: No school, 
no gym, no students, no practices . . . and an important game scheduled for 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to (Taft Coach Jim) Woodard and said, 'No fair, you've got an 
advantage,' " Kennedy Coach Yutaka Shimizu said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real is closed, but the team started practicing Monday in the girls' 
gym. The boys' gym must still be inspected for exposed asbestos. The six El 
Camino Real players who live in the L.A. Basin arrived for practice with no 
problems, Coach Neils Ludlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids seemed real anxious to (play)," Ludlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of earthquake damage, Kennedy and El Camino Real were forced to adopt 
the district's year-round academic calendar and will not reopen until mid-March 
at the earliest. Several schools in the L.A. Basin's most populated areas are 
on the same calendar. And while the City has agreed to provide transportation 
for athletes who live in the L.A. Basin, it took several days to iron out what 
Shimizu called a series of "snafus." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been trying to get together for about a week," said Shimizu, who has 
five players who live over the hill. "It took this long to pull it all 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, today Kennedy will hold its first practice in three weeks. The Golden 
Cougars, tied for first place in the West Valley League at 2-1, last played 
Jan. 14. Kennedy plays at Cleveland on Friday at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Other City schools have had logistics problems, but none as extensive as 
Kennedy. For instance, Woodard's Taft team practiced during sixth period all 
last week. Taft suffered no damage to its gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Kennedy will play its three remaining league games on the road. 
"We can't do much about that," Shimizu said. "We have no gym." 
</P>
<P>
 Shimizu has lined up nearby Porter Junior High for practices. The Kennedy 
girls' team practiced Monday on the blacktop at school -- and it was captured 
by television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said that a round-robin tournament for North 
Valley League boys' teams scheduled Feb. 9-11 at El Camino Real might be moved 
if the campus remains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible," she said. "We've set it for El Camino Real on a tentative 
basis. The gym itself is OK as far as structural damage."

NO OFFERS YET FOR NORDHOFF'S LEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the first day of the winter signing period for high school football 
players, Nordhoff High's Sean Leach remains a kicker without a college. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, who was named Cal-Hi Sports' top kicker in the state from medium-sized 
schools, has drawn interest from Notre Dame, Claremont-Mudd and those that fall 
in between on the broad spectrum of college football, but has yet to receive a 
formal offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, who made seven of 11 field goals and 33 of 37 extra points, also has 
been contacted by Oregon, Syracuse, UC Davis, Cal Lutheran and Kansas State. 
Washington has invited him as a walk-on, but Leach's father, John, said some 
schools have hinted that scholarship offers might be made after today's 
signings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the elder Leach also expressed surprise that his son hasn't drawn more 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "USA Today made him its No. 2 punter and Sean made the Southern Section Super 
Team (covering all divisions), so we expected to hear a little more than we 
have," he said. "But it's still early." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11, 140-pound senior had a 44.7-yard punting average, including a 
long punt of 77 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, USC has shown no interest in Leach, whose uncle, Dick Leach, is 
the Trojan men's tennis coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas tackle Jason Rempel (6-5, 260) could land at a Division I school in 
the coming weeks, if only as walk-on player. Rempel's No. 1 choice is UCLA. The 
Bruins have offered Rempel a visit but no scholarship. College Commitments

BURBANK REPORTEDLY NEAR HIRING HAZELTON AS FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montclair Prep assistant John Hazelton is the overwhelming choice to be named 
football coach at Burbank High, a Burbank district official said Tuesday. 
Hazelton and two other finalists will be interviewed today by a selection 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates to replace Dave Kemp as coach are Glendale College 
assistant Robert Dos Remedios and St. Genevieve Coach Richard Fong. 
</P>
<P>
 But the official, who wished to remain anonymous, said Hazelton is the 
favorite to turn the Bulldogs around from their 2-8 record in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hazelton will go 7-3 next year," he said. "Hazelton has won CIF 
championships. We're serious about building athletics here. It's important to 
us to turn this thing around." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton has served two stints at Montclair Prep, from 1982-85 and from 1989 
to the present. His only head coaching job lasted one season at Banning in 
1987. The Pilots were 6-4 and reached the quarterfinals of the City Section 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the community, boosters and people on the inside are telling me I 
should be the guy," Hazelton said. "There's a tremendous amount of support."

CSUN GYM COULD OPEN IN 2 WEEKS; FACILITIES: BASKETBALL, VOLLEYBALL TEAMS PLAY 
ELSEWHERE UNTIL EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE IS REPAIRED. 
</P>

<P>
 Be it ever so humble, there is no place like home for the Cal State Northridge 
volleyball and basketball teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Gym, never a showplace among Southland sports facilities, has 
nevertheless been sorely missed by Matador athletic teams since it was closed 
as the result of damage sustained during the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Northridge coaches and athletes received a glimmer of hope. Their 
gym is scheduled to be reopened by Feb. 14, Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Northridge teams will continue to practice and play elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matador men's basketball team, which returned from South Bend, Ind., on 
Tuesday, has secured practice time at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion today and Thursday 
in preparation for another trip this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play at Cal State Sacramento on Friday night and at California 
on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Still uncertain is the Feb. 10 date at home against Northeastern Illinois. The 
game will be postponed, canceled or moved to another site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to get with those people back there and see how bad they really want 
to play that game," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's basketball team has moved its Feb. 8 game from Northridge to Cal 
State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's volleyball team will continue to practice at Occidental College. The 
Matadors play at USC on Friday and in the ASICS Tournament in San Diego Feb. 
11-13. CSUN's next home game is Feb. 18 against Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said Northridge's baseball home game Feb. 14 against UCLA also might 
be moved.

SEASON WASN'T A TOTAL LOSS; COVINGTON ONE PREP STAR WHO WASN'T DOWN AND OUT IN 
DANA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Covington may have been the most-sacked high school quarterback in the 
Southland last season. In addition, he completed only 49% of his passes, and 
his team, Dana Hills, finished 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that meant much to many of the top college football coaches. Notre 
Dame, Alabama, Miami, Wisconsin and USC were among the schools that came 
calling, each hoping to convince the 18-year-old senior that their program was 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
 The yearlong recruiting process was one of the few bright spots for Covington, 
who had to cope with the frustration of a weak supporting cast the last two 
seasons. His team won just five games during that time, and he took more than 
his share of hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept worrying that if we didn't win more games, the recruiters wouldn't 
call," he said. "To keep myself motivated, I just worked that much harder, 
figuring I had to prove that much more." 
</P>
<P>
 His fears were unfounded. On Dec. 1, the first day college coaches could make 
home visits, Dennis Erickson of Miami flew into town. That was enough to 
convince Covington, who will sign a national letter of intent with the 
Hurricanes tonight at his home in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Erickson could have gone anywhere in the country that day, and he chose 
to come here," said Covington, who is 6 feet 4 and 180 pounds. "That told me 
that he really wanted me, and I think it is smart to go where you're wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite rumors that Erickson might leave to become the coach of the Phoenix 
Cardinals, Covington said he is committed to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Such devotion does not surprise those who know Covington best. He is described 
by coaches and teammates as a humble leader who often burdens himself with too 
much responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cunerty, offensive coordinator at Saddleback College, has worked closely 
with Covington the last four years. He recalls several conversations in which 
the quarterback described his anguish over not doing more for his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he was taking the brunt of the failures and that wasn't fair," 
Cunerty said. "No one that age should try to carry the weight of an entire team 
on their shoulders, and I tried to point that out to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Covington actually thrives on being an underdog. After living in Fresno, his 
family moved to Southern California before his freshman year. Although he could 
have attended a more high-profile football school, Covington chose Dana Hills, 
which has never won a league title. He said he was excited about trying to lead 
an unheralded team into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills competes in the South Coast League, one of the toughest in Southern 
California. The league has produced many top quarterbacks, including former 
Raider Todd Marinovich, who played at Capistrano Valley. Two starting 
quarterbacks in the Pacific 10 played in the league: El Toro graduates Rob 
Johnson at USC and Steve Stenstrom at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 In his sophomore season, Covington won the starting job and led Dana Hills to 
its best season. The Dolphins advanced to the Southern Section Division II 
championship game, which they lost to Irvine, and finished 9-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The road got bumpier after that. Although Coach Don Douglass continued to take 
advantage of Covington's skills by opening up the passing game, he could not do 
anything about heavy graduation losses and injuries. The Dolphins finished 4-5 
in 1992 and failed to reach the playoffs. Douglass left and was replaced by 
Jack Murry, an assistant at San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Murry, eight starters went down with injuries, and Covington was playing 
behind a young line. The team's only victory was against Irvine University in a 
nonleague game during the third week of the season. The Dolphins lost their 
last three games by a combined score of 117-0 and Murry resigned in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not easy going out there week after week with little hope of winning," 
said Covington, who never considered transferring. "I really wanted everything 
to go perfectly my senior season, but I knew from the first game on it was 
going to be a long year. I didn't have any protection and was getting sacked 
like eight times a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Murry said: "Despite all that happened to our team, Scott always hung in 
there. He set several school passing records this season, and I figured he had 
over 500 yards in dropped receptions. Against Mater Dei, we lost, 41-0. But we 
still had 18 first downs. That game really impressed the scouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his frustrations on the field, Covington took solace in the college 
recruiters paying little attention to his won-lost record. He said several 
coaches even liked the adversity he had faced. 
</P>
<P>
 Covington, a mobile quarterback with a strong arm and a bright mind (3.4 
grade-point average), narrowed his choices to Alabama, Miami and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended all of USC's home games last season. He also enjoyed his visit to 
Alabama, where he met the school's president and was made to feel like a 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alabama is a football Disneyland," Covington said. "They really care about 
football down there above everything else. But socially, I did not feel like I 
fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 His fondness for Erickson, coupled with Miami's history of sending 
quarterbacks to the NFL, made the Hurricanes his choice. Covington is expected 
to battle for the backup job with another top recruit, Ryan Clement of Denver 
Mullen. Junior Ryan Collins and senior Frank Costa are the top returnees and 
shared the job this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, I did not want to be at a school that stockpiled quarterbacks," 
Covington said. "I want to have an opportunity to start for two or three years. 
I also want to be in a situation where I'm competing for a national 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Covington is having a party at his house tonight for family and friends. He 
wants to celebrate what has been a difficult four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told every recruiter that I'll value a win and a supporting cast more than 
anyone else they'll sign," Covington said. "I know how important both are."

DECISION ON BRADSHAW POSTPONED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Simi Valley Unified School District failed to reach a decision 
Tuesday night on Simi Valley High basketball Coach Dean Bradshaw's punishment 
for pushing one of his players to the floor during a Jan. 14 game. 
</P>
<P>
 The board was expected to decide Bradshaw's coaching fate based on the 
recommendation of Simi Valley principal Kathryn Scroggin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't comment on it because it's a personnel matter," Scroggin said while 
the board held a closed session. "I really don't know when the board is going 
to vote on it." 
</P>
<P>
 District Superintendent Mary Beth Wolford said the board had more pressing 
issues Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not get to it and I'm not sure when we will," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw, in his sixth season as Simi Valley coach, has been suspended from 
games and practices since the incident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been accused of grabbing and subsequently throwing Sam Rodriguez to the 
ground after Rodriguez was assessed a technical foul during a home game against 
Westlake. IRENE GARCIA

<P>
 Brad Cervantes of Trabuco Hills has made an oral commitment to USC and 
quarterback Justin Vedder of Laguna Hills committed to Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes, a 6-foot-4, 215-pound defensive lineman, earned All-Southern 
Section Division VIII honors and helped the Mustangs win the Division VIII 
championship last season.He also was named All-Pacific Coast League at tight 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," Cervantes said. "They said I'm too small to play Division I 
line, but they like my speed, so I'm moving to outside linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
 Cervantes, who plays first base for Trabuco Hills and was a first-team 
All-Pacific Coast League selection last year, will also play baseball for the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan said Vedder, a 6-1, 180-pound senior, chose 
Boston University, a Division I-AA school, over Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder started three seasons at Laguna Hills and in 1991 helped the Hawks win 
their first Southern Section football championship. He completed 55% of his 
passes for 2,129 yards and 20 touchdowns last season and also rushed for four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks reached the Division VIII semifinals last season, where they lost to 
eventual champion Trabuco Hills. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AID POURS INTO VALLEY, MORE STRUCTURES ARE 
TAGGED UNSAFE; RECOVERY: REQUESTS FOR INSPECTIONS MOUNT AMID HEADACHES OVER 
HUGE TRAFFIC TIE-UPS. BUT OFFICIALS BELIEVE MOST OF THE DAMAGED BUILDINGS CAN 
BE REPAIRED. 
</P>

<P>
 Infusions of assistance, public and private, poured in for San Fernando Valley 
quake victims Tuesday, but more damage from aftershocks caused enormous traffic 
tie-ups and some high school students had to eat in wind-whipped tents after 
part of their cafeteria was condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 While hundreds of frightened residents continued to live outdoors in tents at 
Red Cross shelters throughout the Valley, building inspectors said Tuesday that 
for the most part, the aftershocks have not done a great deal of additional 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are receiving (requests) continually," said David R. Keim, principal 
building inspector for the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
"(But) mainly the damage from the aftershocks has been architectural or 
superficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released Tuesday by the city's Department of Building and Safety show 
that 1,862 buildings have been deemed unsafe, affecting 13,860 housing units. 
Another 7,000 buildings have been posted with yellow flags that limit entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Keim said building officials believe most of the unsafe buildings 
can be repaired. "We expect very few demolitions on these red-tagged 
buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * President Bill Clinton added $2 billion to his federal aid package for Los 
Angeles, bringing the total White House request to $9.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elizabeth Dole, president of the American Red Cross, announced in Northridge 
that the agency is seeking to raise $50 million for disaster relief, including 
efforts in Southern California. The Red Cross has spent about $30 million 
providing shelter, clothing and serving meals for more than 7,000 people since 
the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Earthquake Express," a caravan of nine 40-foot tractor-trailers filled 
with food, beverages, diapers and other earthquake supplies donated by Teamster 
union members around the state, arrived at a Red Cross warehouse at the Van 
Nuys Airport. The goods will be distributed to earthquake victims at shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mayor Richard Riordan visited two fire stations near the quake's epicenter, 
including one that has been condemned because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the confluence of the Hollywood and Ventura freeways in North Hollywood, 
cracks and exposed steel in concrete columns after Saturday's 5.0 magnitude 
aftershock added to the traffic woes of thousands of San Fernando Valley 
motorists already coping with earlier quake damage to freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation workers have begun shoring up the damaged pillars, but the 
process forced them to shut down key transition lanes, leaving commuters 
bottle-necked during most of the day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an entire surprise, but then again, it's been an entire surprise since 
they opened the freeways," said Tim Cochran, 25, whose half-hour commute from 
North Hollywood to his job at Warner Center Flowers & Gifts stretched into a 
90-minute ordeal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The right lane of the two-lane transition road from the westbound Ventura 
Freeway-134 onto the westbound Ventura Freeway-101 has been closed, jamming 
traffic for miles during rush hour. Even in the early afternoon, the half-mile 
drive from Cahuenga Boulevard through the freeway split took more than 10 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans also has cordoned off one of two lanes in the junction leading from 
the northbound Hollywood Freeway-101 to the Hollywood Freeway-170. 
</P>
<P>
 Both transitions are off-limits to trucks, which "tend to cause bouncing on 
the connectors," Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lane closures should last at least through Thursday as transportation 
crews reinforce the damaged columns with steel beams. The shoring work will 
cost Caltrans about $300,000, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1995, the damaged interchange is scheduled to be seismologically 
retrofitted with steel casings for the columns and long anchoring rods. But 
"we're focusing on the emergencies for now, so we don't have a (precise) 
timetable for that," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the Van Nuys Courthouse, employees and jurors were faced with a 
new problem Tuesday morning after the 2,000-space parking structure serving the 
two Van Nuys courthouses was declared unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure of the parking facility took workers and jurors by surprise -- 
mainly because they had been parking in it for more than a week, since it 
passed inspection two days after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court judges were allowed to park in a makeshift lot next to their 
courthouse. But Municipal Court judges, attorneys working for the district 
attorney and public defender, and hundreds of jurors were forced to fight for 
limited parking in private lots and on surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking mess grew throughout the morning, growing worse when several 
nearby streets were closed because a gas leak forced the evacuation of the 
nearby Los Angeles Police Station in the Van Nuys Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have developed contingency plans to provide parking to jurors and 
some court employees, but 200 jurors summoned for a death penalty murder trial 
set to begin today have been asked to report next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every minute, it's a new crisis," said Richard D. Johnson, chief of the 
Valley Division of the Los Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 At Cleveland High School in Reseda, one of the dozens of Valley schools 
damaged during the quake, students were forced to eat lunches outside for a 
second consecutive day because of a quake-damaged cafeteria. But Tuesday, 
strong winds added another insult, depositing dust on students' hamburgers and 
fried potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much dust . . . in the air still settling," said senior Samantha 
Manchen, 17, who instead ate lunch at a Denny's. Samantha said she will 
continue to eat out until she feels it's safe to eat lunch at the new outdoor 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though city inspectors declared the cafeteria and the dining hall 
structurally safe after the initial jolt more than two weeks ago, some parts of 
the covered walkway that wraps around the building -- situated at the center of 
the campus -- were deemed unsafe, cutting off access to the cafeteria, 
Principal Ida Mae Windham said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the school reopened Monday, administrators hurriedly brought in a 
blue-and-white striped circus tent, which they set up near the back of the 
cafeteria. On Tuesday, strong winds bent one of the metal support bars, 
preventing workers from re-erecting the tent and forcing cafeteria staff 
members to serve lunches in the open. 
</P>
<P>
 Food service workers wheeled out carts filled with cold sandwiches, hamburgers 
and chocolate milk, but because of the long lines involved, his chicken patty 
was cold, senior Mike Knispel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some did commend the school for trying its best to feed the students 
against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some students, this is probably the only hot meal they will have all 
day," said Gohar Tokuzyan, a 12th-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan looked over one fire station condemned because of quake damage 
near the quake's epicenter and at another he praised city firefighters who 
fought dozens of blazes and rescued several people trapped in buildings the 
morning of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you very much. You guys are heroes," Riordan told firefighters from 
Station 73 on Reseda Boulevard. The station's firefighters dealt with the 
collapse of the Northridge Meadows Apartments where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters told Riordan their biggest problem after the quake was battling 
the numerous gas-fueled fires that erupted after the temblor broke underground 
gas lines and residents were unable to turn off their gas lines because 
shut-off valves were either located underground or could be controlled only by 
a special key used by gas company employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a hill, within 15 to 20 minutes you could see a bunch of fires that -- 
if not started by broken natural gas lines -- were certainly aided by them," 
Battalion Chief Richard Jioras said. "It was by far the most difficult thing we 
had to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding, Riordan said, "Yeah, we really have to think of some ordinances" 
to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the morning, the mayor viewed Station 70 in Northridge -- about 
five miles north on Reseda Boulevard from the Reseda station. The 15-year-old 
building, which has been condemned, has not been used since the quake sent 
tiles and bricks raining down and caused deep cracks in the station's walls and 
doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters and equipment have been reassigned to other stations and a Fire 
Department spokesman said the building -- which may have incurred $1 million in 
damage -- might have to be rebuilt.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; IT'S THE END OF THE ROAD FOR OKIE GIRL 
RESTAURANT; TEJON PASS: FREEWAY DAMAGE HURTS BUSINESS AT THE EATERY MADE FAMOUS 
DURING "UMBRELLAS" ART EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Promoting a restaurant in the remote Tejon Pass wasn't easy, but the "Okie 
Girl" went at it with aspirations higher than her hairdo. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lynn Chess, 54, who opened the Okie Girl barbecue restaurant and 
mini-brewery in 1990 alongside the Golden State Freeway about 70 miles north of 
Los Angeles, could turn everything from a minor skirmish with a state agency to 
a local look-alike contest into a media event. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the Christo "Umbrellas" art exhibition landed in the nearby mountains 
in 1991, television crews from around the world lined up to interview the 
Oklahoma-born entrepreneur with the towering beehive hairdo who could discuss 
moonshine and the latest in computerized restaurant equipment with equal 
aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing the tireless Chess couldn't stand was to be ignored. But that's 
what happened during the earthquake, and it proved fatal for her Okie Girl 
restaurant in Lebec, on the Los Angeles-Kern county border. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess and her crew served their last "pasture and pond" special (barbecued 
beef ribs and catfish) and homemade blackberry cobbler a week ago Sunday. With 
freeway traffic disrupted by the quake damage in the northeastern San Fernando 
Valley, business plunged to about three customers an hour, Chess said, and she 
had no cash reserves to weather the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to try to open the next Sunday again, but it was a losing 
proposition," said an uncharacteristically sedate Chess, speaking from the 
closed restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last three days we were open, we took in maybe $500 a day, all day," she 
said. "That doesn't even pay for labor." 
</P>
<P>
 Chess had 13 full-time employees, including a brew master who turned out 
"River Bottom Stout" and other beers amid the knotty pine and Old West-decor of 
the restaurant. Proudly, she noted, 10 of those employees had been with her 
since the day she opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a wonderful place, people loved it. The customers came out of their 
way to support us," said Chess, her Oklahoma accent getting a little thicker as 
she shifted into her promotional mode. "But I'm telling people that we'll be 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Troy Aikman got sacked during the Super Bowl, but he didn't lose the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Chess may be best known for her 1990 quarrel with Caltrans, which at one point 
refused to allow her to advertise on state-controlled signs alongside the 
freeway, saying the restaurant's name insulted Oklahomans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody has a right to call themselves an Okie, I do," protested Chess, a 
native daughter of the Sooner State. "I'm proud of it and I always have been." 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation officials noted that during the 
Depression, when Oklahomans were coming to California to escape the Dust Bowl, 
"Okie" was a pejorative. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chess prevailed after a campaign that generated widespread public support. 
Even the governor of Oklahoma came to her defense, writing to Caltrans an 
official declaration that, whatever Californians thought, Oklahomans now wear 
the name "Okie" as a badge of honor, symbolizing their "strong work ethic, 
character and resiliency." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans not only backed down on the sign, a court later ordered the agency to 
pay Chess $32,000 in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1991 Christo exhibition -- during which the environmental artist 
dotted the mountainous landscape with more than 1,000 giant yellow umbrellas -- 
Chess went into promotional high gear. She whipped up two custom brews -- 
Umbrella Gold and Autumn Umbrella -- as a "tribute" to the artist and brought 
in several young women from Oklahoma as extra waitresses. 
</P>
<P>
 She needed them. A post-Umbrellas study by a Kern County business group 
determined that the restaurant served an average of 1,000 customers a day 
during the 17-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder that a group of business graduate students from Loyola Marymount 
University trekked to Lebec to observe her entrepreneurial skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine a little ol' Okie girl like me talking to those college students," 
Chess said at the time, with false modesty that made even her laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was a favorite with the local Stetson-and-boots mountain 
dwellers, and was often crowded on weekends with cross-country skiers, 
motorcyclists, equestrians and city dwellers who keep weekend cabins in the 
pine-dotted mountains nearby, where snow is common in the winter. Many praised 
the food and the homemade beer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the major cause of the restaurant's demise, Chess said on Tuesday, was its 
"inconvenient location" for travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People coming up from Los Angeles on a trip were not ready to stop after 60 
or 70 miles," she said. "They had practically just got the family in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "And coming home, they were tired and didn't want to stop before getting 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Chess said she would not move entirely out of the area if travelers have more 
of a reason to stop there. She has her eye on the intersection of the Golden 
State Freeway and California 138, just eight miles south of Lebec, because it 
is the proposed site of an outlet mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Okie Girl could be back within two years," Chess said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SMALL-TOWN AMERICANA IS DEALT A CRIPPLING BLOW; 
FILLMORE: MERCHANTS SAY THE COST OF STARTING OVER IN THE QUAKE-DAMAGED DOWNTOWN 
MAY BE TOO GREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 They have been the backbone of Fillmore for decades. Passing their shops from 
father to son, they have kept their main street alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they've preserved a slice of small-town Americana so pleasant movie 
crews flock there to recapture an era lost to tract homes and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with their grit tested to the limit, some business owners on downtown 
Fillmore's Central Avenue say they don't know if they can ever recoup what they 
lost two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No city in Ventura County was more devastated by the Jan. 17 earthquake than 
Fillmore, a town of 13,000 residents founded in 1888 on a railroad line from 
Saugus to Ventura. The worst of the city's estimated $250 million in damage was 
on Central Avenue, the heart of the downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of this small oil-and-farm town say the city -- destroyed by fire in 
1903, swamped by flood in 1928, rocked by at least three strong quakes this 
century -- has the pluck to bounce back. But for now Fillmore is a town in 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing family, " said gun shop owner Gary Creagle. "People are 
already coming up to me and saying: 'We miss downtown. What are we going to do 
without downtown?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Buffeted day-to-day by engineering reports that are ever gloomier, shopkeepers 
who spoke confidently of reconstruction a week ago are now wondering if they 
can afford $200,000 to $300,000 to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of a half-dozen buildings with 14 shops -- nearly all built of brick 
and mortar between 1910 and 1925 -- say they'll tear down their structures and 
not rebuild. They say they're too old to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Central Avenue's 55 merchants say they don't know where they will end 
up in the months to come. Nearly half of their shops are red-tagged as being 
too dangerous to enter. Most of the rest are marked unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are finding out it's too expensive to rebuild. So it's like: 'Mark us 
red. We're outta here,' " said Janet Foy, whose flower shop has little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as merchants mourned their losses and pondered reconstructions that 
do not pencil out, they said they love their small town and don't want to go 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 They like the fact that they graduated from the same high school as their 
grandfathers, that their moms jerked sodas at Clough's drugstore and that the 
all-male Fillmore Club is reputed to have met for cards and meals at a 
second-story Central Avenue walk-up the second Monday of every month since 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 As search-and-rescue crews entered cracked buildings to retrieve valuables 
last week, some merchants showed a resiliency that they say will bring Fillmore 
through its current trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the losses they face tear at the heart and soul of the town.  
</P>
<P>
 Locals call the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater, at the precise center of the 
town's central business district, "The Show." As the only movie theater along 
the 50 miles between Ventura and Santa Clarita, it lured customers from miles 
around. But now a key wall has collapsed. Demolition is expected. And many 
residents say they regret the theater's passing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the owner of the Fillmore Theater building, Dale Larson, is 76 years old 
and not in a position to think about starting over. "Right now I'm just 
planning on demolishing the building and having the plot for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, hope emerged that The Show might avoid demolition after all. City 
Manager Roy Payne said state preservationists insist the theater is not beyond 
repair and have presented calculations that suggest reconstruction might be 
feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 What finally happens to the Fillmore Theater and other badly damaged Central 
Avenue businesses may depend on disaster aid. U.S. Small Business 
Administration representatives are in town doling out application forms, but no 
loans so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's getting more confused and frustrated as we go along," said Ron 
Stewart, 44, whose grandfather started Ballard Furniture 57 years ago. Stewart 
bought the building from his mother four years ago. His sister's manicure shop 
is one of his three tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart figures it would cost him perhaps $250,000 to rebuild, "so financially 
I would be better off to just tear it down and start over," he said. Of course, 
he said, he couldn't afford the mortgage on the reconstruction loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing heavily on Stewart, and on store owners close to the Fillmore 
Theater, however, is the question of what will happen to their businesses if 
the theater comes down. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Central Avenue stores have common walls, as was the practice 80 
years ago. The strength of one store relies on its next-door neighbor, as have 
the merchants themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But when one building falls, the others are threatened in a domino effect, 
several merchants said. Garner's plumbing and hardware stores share a wall with 
Stewart's building. And Garner shares a wall with The Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater has dominoed me," Garner said. "I'm yellow tagged now. They're 
letting me get all my stuff out of my store before they tag it red." 
</P>
<P>
 The same fate could befall Ben Aparicio, 44, whose building also abuts the 
movie house. After building a tax preparation business to 3,000 clients, 
Aparicio said he and a relative bought his 1918 storefront four years ago for 
$250,000. They invested another $50,000 in improvements last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all chose Fillmore because of the uniqueness of its architecture and its 
small-town feel," he said. "But if any improvement through demolition or repair 
will bring this building up to code, then I'm for it. It needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants along Central Avenue tend to agree.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; QUAKE BRINGS SOME WORKERS DOWN TO EARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the Northridge earthquake's destruction to Panorama City 
high-rise office buildings, hundreds of people have abandoned their lofty work 
spaces for more down-to-earth environs. And from a congressman to social 
workers, many former tenants are struggling to continue providing services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting out right now," said Tim Farrell, a union steward for county 
Department of Children's Services, which had occupied the 13-story Panorama 
Towers on Van Nuys Boulevard. "We don't have another building. It's going to be 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing safety concerns about the building, Children's Services 
officials Monday ordered Farrell and the 200 social workers who occupy the 
building to pack up their files. While the building has not been condemned, 
city inspectors have ruled that a portion of the building is unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The evacuation leaves the social workers in need of another 48,000-square-foot 
office space. And with so little time to mobilize, Farrell said many expect to 
spend the next month without a desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The social workers are going to be telecommuting. Working from their cars and 
homes," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) is not much luckier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his staff was fortunate enough to be offered office space in the old 
San Fernando police station, they have not been able to retrieve their 
computers, constituents' files and other equipment from the now-trashed 
fifth-story office on Roscoe Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been allowed in the office since Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's left me without my possessions, essentially," Berman said Tuesday from 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman is not complaining. The disaster has forced him to temporarily 
cancel only one of his services -- tax advice for senior citizens. His phone 
numbers remain the same and his staff members are still taking calls from 
constituents and coordinating earthquake relief efforts in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But Farrell said Children's Services will think twice before operating out of 
another high-rise in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for something one or two stories," said Ferrell. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; BUSINESS LEADERS CONFIDENT THEY WILL RECOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake was extensive but not crippling to 
Chatsworth, according to local business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken especially hard were the neighborhoods along Devonshire and Lassen 
streets near De Soto, Owensmouth and Canoga avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to local business "was a matter initially of great despair to many 
people, myself included," said A. W. Moss, secretary of the Chatsworth Chamber 
of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But as local business joined together to help each other, and owners got a 
closer look at the damage, the picture brightened, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything in Chatsworth that is not repairable in three months or 
so," said Dick Pearson, owner of a commercial leasing firm that manages over a 
dozen buildings in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake damaged several large industrial complexes, including the 
headquarters of Packard Bell and Great Western Bank. Packard Bell has moved 
many of its operations to Newbury Park, but Great Western, after grounding most 
employees initially, had called 90% of them back to work by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ralph's grocery store at Mason Avenue and Devonshire Street is temporarily 
closed. Telltale red no-entry tags are also posted on several small mini-malls 
in the neighborhood, the Trac Tech and Devon Industries buildings on De Soto, 
and some smaller, free-standing businesses such as the Kragen Auto Works on 
Devonshire Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Parishioners at the Catholic St. John Eudes Church have been attending 
services in a meeting hall because the church sanctuary was damaged, and the 
public library and historical museum are closed because of massive disarray.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, five mobile home parks in Chatsworth were hard hit by the 
earthquake, said Sandy Clydesdale, field deputy for City Councilman Hal 
Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile home parks throughout the 12th Council District "feel like forgotten 
cities," Clydesdale said, noting that several are still without utilities.  
</P>
<P>
 Although many apartment complexes were damaged by the quake, one apartment 
manager said it was loss of jobs due to the earthquake, not fears about 
building safety, that are driving some tenants out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearson said that kind of ripple effect may be the most telling reverberation 
of the quake in the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake "is not in itself a fatal blow," he said. "But it is another sort of 
negative factor in the already weak economy . . . a number of companies were on 
the fence and this will push them out." JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; MANY RELIEVED THAT DAMAGE WAS LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like an accident victim who gingerly feels around for broken bones and finds 
just a sprain, the West Hills community, post-earthquake, is heaving a big sigh 
of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relative to many other areas in the San Fernando Valley, West Hills was 
generally very lucky in that most people did not suffer significant damage," 
said Joel Schiffman, board member of the West Hills Property Owners Assn. 
"There were some isolated areas where people were pretty hard hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiffman estimated that most people suffered less than $5,000 worth of damage 
to their homes, although in the worst cases, homeowners sustained losses of 
$50,000 to $70,000. In the community, chimneys fell down or shifted, walls 
cracked, block walls tumbled and home furnishings were sent cascading to the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 90% of what I own was on the floor," recalled Dayton Clark, president 
of the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and others said that they have noticed no damage to roadways in the 
area, and that traffic is flowing smoothly. People in the largely residential 
community are now mainly concerned with assessing property damage and trying to 
get Federal Emergency Management Agency grants and Small Business 
Administration loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pressing problem facing residents, Schiffman said, is that in many 
cases their incomes make them ineligible for emergency grants and low-interest 
loans, yet they can't afford to make the repairs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fallbrook Mall, the three major department stores remained closed, with 
inventory damage and major wall cracks.  
</P>
<P>
 Christine Silvestri, marketing director for the mall, said J. C. Penney is 
slated to reopen in two weeks, Mervyn's department store will do the same in 
two months, and Sears' timetable is "uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the mall suffered no structural damage and was open for its first 
full day of business last Thursday, Silvestri said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit businesses were the gift shops, some of which lost 30% to 40% of 
their inventory, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came through extremely well," Silvestri said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased and grateful." KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; BUSINESSES REBOUND BUT HOTEL STILL CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the make-believe Main Street of CityWalk, the shattered china and liquor 
bottles have been cleared from restaurants and the glasswork swept off art 
gallery floors. King Kong is back in business at Universal Studios Hollywood 
and the sitcom cameras are rolling nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the entertainment businesses on the hill known as Universal City, 
the Northridge earthquake was a temporary setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Universal City . . . held up remarkably well compared to Northridge," said 
Jim Mahfet, executive director of the Universal City/North Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Universal Sheraton Hotel, however, sustained significant damage. The 
444-room hotel, which closed on the day of the earthquake, will not reopen 
until May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all cosmetic, nothing structural, thank goodness," said Dave Cocks, 
general manager, describing cracked plaster, broken mirrors and bathroom tiles. 
"Ninety percent of our rooms have something where our contractors are going to 
have to go in and repair something from earthquake damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the contaminated water source and needed repairs, the hotel 
staff went from room to room on Jan. 17 explaining to the remaining guests that 
they would be shuttled to Sheraton hotels downtown or near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them left on their own the morning of the earthquake," Cocks said. No 
guests or employees were injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocks said the company had no estimate of damages or how much money the hotel 
will lose during the closure. But he said that in 1993, with an occupancy rate 
of 77%, the hotel grossed more than $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps luckily for the Sheraton and for the local attractions, January is a 
slow time of year for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the very, very slowest time of year, said Joan Bullard, vice 
president of public relations at Universal Studios Hollywood. "Definitely there 
has been a dip in attendance but that's to be expected. We don't expect it to 
last a long time at all." 
</P>
<P>
 At CityWalk, a faux Los Angeles street built by MCA to complement its 
Universal Studios Tour, few signs of the earthquake remained, save the slightly 
thinned crowds and a few plaster cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, tables at Wolfgang Puck's brightly colored pizzeria were dotted 
with the power lunch crowd. Workers from other CityWalk restaurants strolled 
over to Gladstones Universal City for their meal breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did wonderfully well -- no structural damage whatsoever," said Ron Herman, 
director of marketing for MCA Development Co., the company that runs CityWalk 
for MCA Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 Business is slowly picking up, said Herman and shop managers at CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first weekend, I was surprised anybody came," Herman said. "We did about 
40% of a normal week, which was surprisingly well. This weekend we did about 
75% of a normal January weekend. We're real pleased." REBECCA BRYANT

VALLEY BRIEFING: HIGHWAY COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The portions of Interstate 5 and Highway 14 that collapsed where the San 
Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys meet were scheduled for retrofitting this 
year. But experts say that because of the quake's severe vertical movement and 
the highways' location near an unknown fault, retrofitting may not have 
prevented the collapses. Both highways were built to meet standards set after 
the 1940 El Centro earthquake. Those standards did not require engineers to 
gauge the danger of nearby fault lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeways are expected to be repaired within a year. Meanwhile, detours are 
being opened. The heavily-used I-5 has top priority in the rebuilding process, 
which is moving at a rapid pace. "We're doing things within days right now that 
would usually take us months or even years," said Jim Roberts, chief engineer 
at Caltrans. About the Freeways 
</P>
<P>
 Highway 14 (Antelope Valley Freeway) 
</P>
<P>
 Built: Parts that recently collapsed were under construction during the 1971 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Average number of vehicles: 127,000 daily at interchange, in both directions 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate 5 
</P>
<P>
 Built: Section that collapsed was finished in 1967, survived 1971 Sylmar quake 
with minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Average number of vehicles: 191,000 daily in both directions. Soil Danger 
</P>
<P>
 The ground the freeways are built in may have contributed to their collapse. 
The soil under the interchange has a high clay content, which transmits more of 
the earthquake's shocks than oth1701981216 The following sequence of events 
caused the collapses of each of the four sections of the I-5 overpass at The 
Old Road, shown at left. 1. Restrainers, which were installed after Sylmar 
quake, broke. 2. Joints were pulled apart. 3. Spans then collapsed, breaking 
off on opposite sides. Status: Bridges have been demolished. The Old Road has 
been rebuilt as a four-lane detour between Weldon Canyon Road and Calgrove 
Boulevard. The detour is scheduled to open Saturday morning. Reconstruction of 
the bridge is to begin Monday. Both of the Highway 14 collapses were caused by 
failure of the short, inflexible columns. The following sequence of events led 
to the collapses of the Highway 14 connector onto the southbound I-5, shown 
above. 1. Short-column broke. 2. Adjacent spans were pulled off abutment. 3. 
Span on other side of abutment could not be supported by remaining column and 
fell. 4. Status of I-5 / Hwy. 14 interchange: Damaged area was shored up and 
lanes restriped. Two southbound lanes opened Friday, one a car-pool lane. A. 
450-foot section of Hwy. 14 connector to southbound I-5 fell onto I-5. (shown 
above) B. 300-foot section of southbound Hwy. 14 connector to north I-5 fell 
adjacent to truck lane. (not shown) Sources: Caltrans, University of

ROOMMATE OF SLAIN MAN BEING SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's homicide investigators searched Tuesday for the roommate of a 
38-year-old man found shot to death in his home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Sgt. Robert Stoneman, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department, emphasized that the roommate, Anthony Lopez, 25, was not 
a suspect in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to find him because he may be able to shed some light on what 
led up to this murder," Stoneman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Steven Lee Stewart, was found by co-workers at their home in the 
3200 block of Lantana Court about 7:40 p.m. Monday after he failed to show up 
for work at the clothing store he managed, Stoneman said. Lopez has not 
returned to the home since then, he said.

POLICE DOG EASILY TRACKS DOWN FUGITIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal fugitive managed to elude FBI agents and Los Angeles police officers 
for more than two hours Tuesday. Then they brought in the police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 And just like that, Eduardo Hernandez was apprehended, in the 45-gallon 
plastic trash can where he was hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing," said FBI Special Agent John Hoos. "Within five minutes, he 
had him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 26, who was wanted on suspicion of murder in Texas, was shot at by 
at least one FBI agent during the confrontation. He was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents found no weapon on Hernandez but fired on him because he was a fugitive 
wanted for murder and he made sudden motions, said Agent Steven Wayne Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the chase started when agents watching Hernandez's house in the 8500 
block of Snowdon Avenue saw him leaving, and approached him and identified 
themselves. "He . . . took some evasive action, then dashed," Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Rudy Delgado of the La Feria, Tex., Police Department said Hernandez 
accompanied a drinking companion home from a bar in 1992 and strangled him. 
"There could be some others" involved, Delgado said. "We won't find out until 
we get Eddie back here."

POLICE SURROUND MARKET, BUT ARMED ROBBERS ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police surrounded a Van Nuys supermarket Tuesday morning where two 
armed men were believed to be trapped after a failed robbery attempt -- only to 
discover six hours later that the men had somehow escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 police officers, two canine units, several fire engines and a Special 
Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team were sent to Jons market in the 6600 block of 
Van Nuys Boulevard after a store employee spotted the robbers and called 
police, said Los Angeles Police Officer Lorie Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Jons employees were opening the store about 6 a.m. Tuesday when one, a 
bookkeeper, was confronted in the market's top floor by two men wearing ski 
masks. According to the bookkeeper, one of the men carried a shotgun, the other 
a pistol, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to get me to open the safe," said the bookkeeper, who refused to 
give her name. "Their gun fired, and I ran downstairs." 
</P>
<P>
 The bookkeeper escaped without injury, told the other two employees about the 
robbers, and all three escaped through the store's front door, locking it 
behind them. They called police around 6:10 a.m., and officers from the nearby 
Van Nuys Division arrived shortly afterward, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who sealed off Van Nuys Boulevard between Vanowen and Kittridge 
streets, thought the men were inside because every known exit was locked. A 
SWAT team arrived about 8 a.m. Entering through the roof and a cargo door, the 
team combed the building for about four hours. They found no trace of the men 
and no clues about how they entered or escaped, Taylor said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; METROLINK PASSENGERS AWAIT MTA RULING ON 
2-FOR-1 TICKET DEAL; RAIL: RIDERS WERE TOLD -- INCORRECTLY -- THAT THEIR $144 
WOULD COVER TWO MONTHS. THE BOARD WILL DECIDE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of riders who flocked to Metrolink to avoid traffic-choked highways 
will learn today if their monthly passes are as valuable as they think. 
</P>
<P>
 Many commuters who purchased tickets at Santa Clarita outlets had been told 
their $144 monthly passes for February are also valid for March. That 
information was either premature or wrong, Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Metrolink officials said Jan. 21 that they supported such an offer, 
it is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that will decide today if the 
offer will be extended in Los Angeles County, Hidalgo said. A similar decision 
will be made Friday by the Ventura County Transportation Commission regarding 
the Metrolink line in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be approved by each county," Hidalgo said. "Metrolink has no 
jurisdiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said some agents in Santa Clarita outlets, trying to spread the word 
about Metrolink, told customers they would get two months for one. He said 
inexperienced vendors may have believed the recommendation by Metrolink had 
decided the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps they didn't understand the process this goes through," Hidalgo said. 
"Metrolink can't make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 One site where residents were told they could ride for two months for the 
price of one was Santa Clarita's Emergency Operations Center in the parking lot 
of City Hall, where earthquake-related information was being distributed to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 City transit officials are unsure how the mistake began, but suggest it was a 
misunderstanding compounded by communication difficulties following the 
6.6-magnitude earthquake that hammered Santa Clarita and damaged City Hall so 
severely it will be closed for two to three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what you saw at the EOC was confusion," said Bob Murphy, city transit 
analyst. "Someone heard something and turned it into a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy said city representatives will attend the MTA meeting this afternoon to 
request approval for the two-for-one promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has only authorized one similar deal since the system began in 
October, 1992, Hidalgo said. Residents who bought a pass in January, 1993, were 
allowed to ride the system in February for free -- an attempt by the MTA to 
draw passengers to the new commuter rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 The news their monthly passes may only be good for February after all prompted 
mixed reactions from riders. Several said they'll continue to ride Metrolink 
regardless of the MTA decision, while others are irritated at what they 
consider false advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought my ticket figuring I don't have a choice," said Douglas Bryce, a 
Saugus resident who takes the commuter rail system to his job in Glendale. "I'm 
doing it because I don't know what the commute is going to be like." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce said he had heard that monthly passes would be valid for two months, but 
was never told so by transit officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Ganrau, who purchased a pass last week, said he will be disappointed if 
the MTA doesn't approve the two-for-one deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're undoubtedly making more money with all of these people riding, so 
they should try to help those of us trying to get over the earthquake damage," 
Ganrau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said refunds will be available on a prorated basis. If a monthly pass 
was used for one week, a passenger will receive a 75% refund. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink ridership has skyrocketed since the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged 
Southern California highways, initially restricting car travel out of the Santa 
Clarita Valley to a two-lane road.

OUTLINE ON HIRING OF FEMALE OFFICERS OKD; POLICE: COMMISSION MEMBERS COMPROMISE 
IN STATEMENT, URGING THE RECRUITMENT OF MORE WOMEN BUT CAUTIONING ABOUT 
POSSIBLE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles Police Commission, eager to push the LAPD toward 
hiring more women but reluctant to create legal troubles for the city, approved 
a statement Tuesday that attempts to forge a compromise on the politically 
volatile issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Police Commissioners supports and encourages all serious and 
legitimate efforts to increase the number of women police officers through a 
vigorous recruiting program designed to increase the number of female 
applicants," the commission statement said. "The commission has been advised by 
the city attorney's office, however, that all legal ramifications must be 
explored before new hiring goals are pursued." 
</P>
<P>
 The statement falls short of demanding that 44% of the Police Department's 
annual hires be women -- a target urged by leaders of the Women's Advisory 
Council to the Police Commission -- but members of the commission said it 
reflects the difficulty in trying to mandate such a goal. It also sets the 
stage for an upcoming City Council debate on the proposed goal; the council's 
Personnel Committee is scheduled to take up that proposal in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city attorney's office has warned us that this is an area of danger," 
said Gary Greenebaum, president of the Police Commission, who says the LAPD 
needs to increase its hiring of women. "We don't want to get ahead of ourselves 
in terms of supporting a percentage figure that we can't reach, but I also 
believe strongly that if you don't set goals, you'll never reach those goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Some advocates of the 44% annual hiring goal were bitterly disappointed by 
what they considered the commission's halfhearted statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a Police Department that does not want to hire more women," said 
Katherine Spillar, national coordinator for the Fund for the Feminist Majority. 
"The liability issue is a total red herring." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 44% annual hiring goal for women in the department has stirred 
controversy since the idea was unveiled last year as part of a report by the 
Women's Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
 That report, only the latest to cite the need for more female police officers, 
found that the department values physical strength over negotiating skills and 
complained that it has been lax in investigating complaints of sexual 
harassment and domestic violence by its police officers. One of the report's 
central recommendations was that the LAPD increase the annual hiring goals of 
the department so that the representation of women in the department would 
match their presence in the work force -- roughly 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Several prominent women's organizations have lent their support to the 
proposal, but some council members are privately worried that approving the 
goal could expose the city to liability if it falls short of achieving it. At 
the same time, they are concerned about the political ramifications of voting 
against an ambitious hiring goal for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the plan received support from a December city Personnel Department 
report, which warned that the city could be hit with lawsuits if it establishes 
an annual 44% female hiring goal for the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Spillar said that is not true. She said more ambitious annual hiring goals 
would encourage the department to make faster progress in diversifying the 
police force and would reduce the city's potential liability. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's meeting, Police Chief Willie L. Williams pledged to pursue any 
hiring goal set by the city, but he emphasized the progress made in recent 
years in increasing the number of women on the force.

AMERICA ONLINE FINDS IT CAN'T HANDLE THE LOAD; COMPUTERS: THE HOTTEST COMPANY 
IN THE INDUSTRY IS FORCED TO RESTRICT ACCESS. THE SNAFU RESULTED FROM AN 
AGGRESSIVE PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America Online, the hottest company in one of the hottest industries in 
America today, is getting burned by its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which enables personal computer users to read the news, shop for 
merchandise or "chat" with other computers over the phone lines, said Tuesday 
that its own computers are so overloaded that it must limit the number of 
customers during peak evening hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer overload has been a problem for months, slowing the system to a 
sluggish pace and driving some of America Online's 600,000 customers into the 
arms of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vienna, Va.-based company had to shut down its system for five hours 
Saturday to add new software to address the problem. But it said in a letter to 
subscribers that it will take 60 to 90 days to resolve the overload. 
</P>
<P>
 The snafu resulted from an aggressive promotion of America Online that was 
apparently too successful for the company's own good. The company routinely 
gives away the software that enables customers to hook up. In September, Chief 
Executive Steve Case toured the country promoting his firm's linkup with the 
international on-line network the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a faster ramp-up than we anticipated. It took us eight years to get 
to 300,000 (subscribers) and just seven months to double it," Case said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Case notified America Online customers -- or at least those who were able to 
sign on to the system -- of the restricted access in a letter posted Tuesday 
night on the on-line service. Case said he hoped the firm's "forthright manner" 
in dealing with the problem will help it "emerge from this with a stronger 
sense of loyalty and community." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second time in recent months that America Online has been forced to 
shut down its network to address capacity problems. The company shut down its 
system for eight hours in December to add computers and rewrite portions of its 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 Its problems come at a risky time, undercutting momentum and potentially 
alienating customers, who pay a basic monthly fee of $9.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are on a roll right now," said Mary Modahl, senior analyst at Forrester 
Research, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting company. "That they need 60 to 90 days 
for review is not good news. It shows a lack of foresight." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivals in the fiercely competitive business say they are already benefiting 
from America Online's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen a growing number of customers coming from America Online because 
of complaints about access," said Brian Ek, spokesman for Prodigy Services Co., 
one of the nation's two largest on-line service providers. CompuServe is the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Ek said America Online faces more capacity problems than other on-line 
services because its subscribers tend to be heavy users of chat sessions that 
take up computer time and tie up phone lines. Prodigy and CompuServe customers 
tend to be signed on for shorter periods for research or to get stock quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of potential long-term problems at the company have hit America Online's 
stock, which closed Tuesday at $62, down $1.75 on the Nasdaq. The company went 
public two years ago at $11.50 a share and soared to a recent peak of $70 as 
its services became a hit among younger computer buffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, America Online benefited from customers who found its services 
broader and more sophisticated than larger rivals such as Prodigy. But the 
giants are fighting back and newcomers have entered the field, taking aim at a 
market that Modahl predicts will multiply sixfold to $3 billion in revenues by 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy, which had been a laggard, has regained some strength as a result of 
an easier-to-use format introduced in November. The company says it has added 
100,000 subscribers since then. CompuServe, a unit of H&R Block, said it added 
450,000 new customers last year.

 Despite recent research indicating that some locations are more prone to 
earthquake damage than others, the cost of quake insurance in Southern 
California generally does not vary by where you live, only by who insures you, 
according to a study released Tuesday by Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, until insurers begin to adjust rates based on earthquake risk -- 
as they say they will -- it pays to comparison-shop between insurers for the 
best rates on homeowner and the optional earthquake insurance, consumer 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 15 largest homeowner insurers in Southern California that were 
surveyed, only three alter their rates based on where the home was located. The 
other 12 -- including the Big Three of State Farm, Allstate and Farmers -- 
charge the same premium regardless of whether the home is in Santa Ana or 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also no price variation among those 12 based on whether the house 
sits on granite or landfill, or its proximity to a known fault -- pivotal 
issues in determining how well a home survives a temblor, according to quake 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earthquake insurance prices vary dramatically by insurer, according 
to the study. State Farm generally charges the least: $231 for a $200,000 
policy with a 10% deductible. Federal Insurance Co. charges the most: $600 for 
a similar policy, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "We price earthquake coverage differently, depending on the type of home 
construction -- masonry or wood frame," says Rick Dinon, senior vice president 
of 20th Century Insurance. "But we do not apply geographic differences at this 
time. Frankly, when we began writing the coverage, methods for figuring seismic 
risk were not terribly sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 Experience gained from the recent Northridge quake and from the 1989 Loma 
Prieta quake in Northern California are likely to spur more risk-based pricing 
for earthquake coverage, Dinon and other insurers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey results provide a compelling argument to shop around, says Mary 
Griffin, an attorney in Washington for Consumers Union, the nonprofit 
organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine. But shopping for quake 
coverage is not easy, she acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because few insurers will sell a stand-alone earthquake policy. The 
vast majority will sell earthquake insurance only if you are already buying a 
homeowner's policy from them. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, to get the best price, you must check several insurers for 
their rates for standard homeowner's insurance -- which covers fire and theft 
-- and optional earthquake coverage. Then add the two together and compare. 
</P>
<P>
 When shopping for earthquake coverage, you need to keep an eye on deductibles 
and policy terms, experts note. While the standard earthquake policy has a 10% 
deductible, some insurers offer policies with lower deductibles. State Farm, 
for example, gives consumers the choice of a 10% deductible or a more expensive 
policy with a 5% deductible. Some companies also apply the deductible 
differently. The policies listed in the Consumers Union survey are 
substantially the same. 
</P>
<P>
 How much can shopping around save you? Consider a hypothetical homeowner 
living in Canoga Park who buys a $150,000 homeowner's policy with a $250 
deductible and a $200,000 earthquake policy, which has a 10% deductible. (The 
different policy values are used in the example because of differences in 
survey data.) 
</P>
<P>
 If that homeowner bought his policies from Federal Insurance, he'd pay a total 
of $1,439. If he bought from State Farm, he'd pay $819 -- a $620 annual 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the homeowner lived in Hollywood, he'd pay more by insuring with 
State Farm than with Allstate. While Allstate charges a bit more for earthquake 
insurance, State Farm charges substantially more for the basic homeowner's 
policy. As a result, the State Farm customer in Hollywood would pay a total 
annual premium of $990, $271 more than the Allstate customer. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a company, EQE Earthquake Insurance Services in San Francisco, which 
offers a separate earthquake policy that can be purchased in concert with any 
other insurers' homeowner insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But EQE, which is affiliated with the noted seismic engineering firm EQE 
International, does not offer sample rates comparable to those in the Consumers 
Union survey. Company President W. Rodney Smith says EQE's premiums vary based 
on the consumer's specific address, type of construction and the year the home 
was built. 
</P>
<P>
 The company feeds that information into a sophisticated computer program that 
plots a home's location in relation to known faults. It also factors in soil 
types to determine exactly how much shaking is likely to occur at a precise 
address. With that information, the company determines a premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone whose home rests on landfill will pay nearly twice the premium of a 
homeowner whose house is built on rock, Smith says. If you're 10 miles from the 
nearest fault, you'll pay comparatively less than the person whose home is 
sitting at the intersection of Earthquake Central. 
</P>
<P>

 The cost of earthquake insurance varies dramatically by insurer but not 
significantly by location -- no matter how close you are to fault lines or 
whether you live on granite or landfill, according to a newly released 
Consumers Union study. Consumers Union analyzed policies offered by 15 major 
insurers in 12 different Southland communities based on California Department 
of Insurance data. Here's a sampling of survey results, based on a $200,000 
earthquake insurance policy with a 10% deductible. Companies are listed in

JAMES FLANIGAN: JAPAN MUST OPEN DOOR TO SEE NEW DAWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it morning in Japan? Thanks to an encouraging outlook for political reform 
and growth in Japan's domestic market, stock prices are rising once again in 
Tokyo and analysts are re-evaluating the attractions of Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony, Matsushita, Hitachi and other global companies are selling at near 
record prices. But Japan's economy remains in the doldrums and so do the 
earnings of the major companies. Moreover, Japanese business faces a critical 
date Feb. 11 when Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Clinton in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 If Hosokawa comes with little to offer by way of opening Japan's markets to 
U.S. competitors, particularly its new cable and communications fields, 
Japanese companies could have trouble in the U.S. market and those high stock 
prices could fade like false hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Japan's companies, hailed as awesome in the 1980s, face many 
challenges today. And a look at Sony, among the most international of Japan's 
major companies, provides a good illustration of those challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony is especially fitting because its co-founder Akio Morita, 73, had been 
making speeches -- before he became ill in December -- exhorting Japan and its 
industries to open up to the rest of the world. Morita had a stroke, is 
recuperating and has lost none of the mental acuity that has served his company 
and Japan for almost five decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The '90s have not been gentle for Japan's companies. They no longer have the 
benefit of loans at 1%, as they did in the '80s. And because they missed a 
technological turn or two, Japan's companies are having to play catch-up in 
computing and telecommunications. So they're reaching out for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a big reason for high stock prices for Sony and Matsushita, both 
owners of Hollywood movie studios, is that analysts anticipate deals with U.S. 
telephone and cable television companies that would bring the Japanese firms up 
to speed in multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony stock, which dipped $1.25 to $58.25 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Tuesday, has risen 80% in the last year partly on speculation that it will sell 
a 25% to 40% interest in its entertainment assets -- Columbia and TriStar 
Pictures and Sony Music (formerly CBS Records) -- to a regional Bell telephone 
or a U.S. cable television company. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Schulhof, the head of Sony's U.S. operations, has admitted to holding 
inconclusive talks with every major U.S. phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sony deal, similar to Time Warner's venture with US West, could bring Sony 
$3 billion to $4 billion in cash, according to analyst Barry Dargan of the 
Tokyo office of S.G. Warburg Securities. And Sony would welcome cash to pay off 
some of its $10 billion in debt, says Dargan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main advantage for Sony would be video distribution of its movies and 
music productions and training in cable TV and telephone services. The latter 
are important because Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telegraph is preparing to 
allow more competition with government phone and television networks. One 
reason Japanese companies lag in multimedia is that the home market doesn't 
have the variety of U.S.-style cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, such a venture might bring Sony out of the doldrums, mental 
and financial, it has known along with much of Japanese business in recent 
years. Sony, of course, practically invented consumer electronics with portable 
radios in the 1950s, and it hit the big time with the universally popular 
Walkman tape player in the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the business of TV sets, CD players and tape recorders, which gives 
Sony 80% of its $34 billion in sales, has become a quagmire. Its electronics 
sales and profit have declined in the last few years -- profit by more than 70% 
-- because of recession in Japan and competition from South Korea, Taiwan and 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 And Sony's once-great ability to bring out successful new products has faded 
since the Betamax videocassette format failed in the early 1980s. In fact, 
after Betamax failed -- because more movies were put on VHS -- Sony became 
obsessed with the supposed need for synergy between software and hardware, of 
using Sony movies to sell Sony TV sets and other ancillary products. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a policy that failed spectacularly with "Hook" and "Last Action Hero" 
and which was misguided at any rate in an age in which software of any kind -- 
from computer games to business programs -- comes from a multitude of small 
businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet for years Sony's attempts to form joint ventures with small software 
suppliers have resulted in failure because of the big company's overbearing 
attitude -- a fault large companies everywhere are struggling to correct. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Sony's studios can make fine, successful movies -- such as 
"Sleepless in Seattle" and "In the Line of Fire" -- and its music business is 
doing very well. The entertainment assets bring Sony half its profit on only 
20% of its revenue. Morita clearly saw the future when he paid $2 billion in 
1987 to buy CBS Records, even then a global business that couldn't be 
duplicated for many times that purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 Another far-sighted move Sony made was to put a lot of production and research 
in the United States -- roughly $12 billion worth of consumer goods production 
today in San Diego; Terre Haute, Ind.; San Antonio, and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Sony may be regaining its flair with new products. The Sony 
MiniDisc, a device that both plays and records on compact discs, could evolve 
into a superior "mobile multimedia product," veteran technology analyst 
Kathleen Wiegner writes in Upside magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 If it can find a partner for its entertainment business, Sony could achieve 
growth and success in the new field of telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Add it all up and Sony, like much of Japanese business, has made some 
mistakes, learned some lessons and now has a chance for a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why political reform, the expansion of a consumer economy, cable 
channels, open communications and success in the Washington talks Feb. 11 are 
so important. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's morning in Japan, the country will open as Morita has advised, and 
Morita's company -- and many others, both Japanese and American -- will 
prosper.

NEW JUICE FOR ELECTRIC CARS; AUTOMOBILES: BLOC OF EAST COAST STATES BACKS IN 
PRINCIPAL CALIFORNIA'S RULES FOR NON-POLLUTING VEHICLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overriding the objections of the auto industry, a group of eastern states 
voted Tuesday to support California's efforts to develop a market for electric 
cars as a means of reducing air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 While the states and the District of Columbia refused to adopt California's 
precise rules -- which call for 2% of the cars sold in the state in 1998 to 
have zero emissions -- they made it clear that electric autos should be a basic 
part of the nationwide effort to curtail pollutants spewing from car and truck 
tailpipes. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote by the Ozone Transport Commission was a setback for car companies, 
which have insisted they cannot build viable electric vehicles at a reasonable 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be the California standard, just under a different name," 
William B. Winters, a spokesman for the American Automobile Manufacturers 
Assn., said after the vote. "We continue to believe there is a viable 
alternative," he said, referring to the industry's proposal to build more 
low-emission cars running on fuels such as natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, California and the states voting Tuesday are home to slightly more 
than 50% of the nation's population -- a vast potential market for electric 
cars. California is promoting electric cars as the centerpiece of a new 
manufacturing industry and because they operate without producing pollution -- 
except at power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows California thinking is certainly in the mainstream," said Diane 
Wittenberg, head of electric car activities for Southern California Edison, a 
key backer of electric car development. 
</P>
<P>
 The best electric cars available today can drive about 100 miles before 
needing a recharge, a process that takes up to eight hours, depending on the 
size of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote by the commission, with eight states and the District of Columbia in 
favor and four states opposed, was a formal recommendation to the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency to require "progressively cleaner standards" 
for automobile emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's proposal would allow manufacturers to sell five categories of 
vehicles, ranked according to their volume of pollution. Beginning in 1999 at 
the latest, the average emissions of each car maker's fleet would have to fall 
steadily. But manufacturers would be free to "choose any combination of 
vehicles" -- including zero-emission electric cars -- to meet the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 10 days ago, the commission was considering a draft resolution 
that would have specifically adopted California's detailed plan, including its 
2% requirement and 1998 deadline for selling electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But several states objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is right for California may not be right for Connecticut or Maryland," 
said Timothy R.E. Keeney, Connecticut's commissioner of environmental 
protection and chairman of the committee that prepared the commission report. 
"Some governors felt the (California standard) was too restrictive." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has "the same emission goal" as California, but it allows for 
greater flexibility -- including options for governors who want the opportunity 
to develop alternate auto technologies in their states. While the electric car 
"has to be a major player," Keeney said, it could be less prominent in the 
Northeast than in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA will now have nine months to consider the issue before producing final 
rules on low-emission vehicles. During that period, the agency will hold public 
hearings to grapple with what it means to build a "clean" car, said Mary 
Nichols, the EPA's assistant administrator for air and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry has mounted a strong lobbying campaign against the 
California standards -- including a proposal of its own in December to instead 
boost production of low-emission cars using alternative fuels such as natural 
gas. Critics say the industry's approach would virtually foreclose the 
development of improved electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Clinton Administration has launched a "partnership" with the 
auto makers, centered on a $1-billion program to develop a new generation of 
cleaner, high-mileage cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto makers hope they can use the new relationship with Washington to 
circumvent the California standards. Tuesday's resolution was approved by 
Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New 
York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont. Opposed were Delaware, New 
Hampshire, New Jersey and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 New York and Massachusetts have adopted rules similar to the California 
standards, but those are being challenged in federal court by the auto 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The commission rejected a plank of California's plan mandating the use of 
reformulated gasoline, which costs 10 to 15 cents a gallon more than 
conventional fuel. While the fuel is cleaner-burning, the oil industry says it 
is too costly to produce, and auto makers say it will require more expensive 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it has the nation's most severe smog problem, California has been 
allowed under federal law to adopt clean-air standards stricter than those in 
force elsewhere in the nation. Electric Highways 
</P>
<P>
 Some highlights of the recommendations to the EPA by the Ozone Transport 
Commission, which proposes clean-air standards for 12 northeastern states and 
the District of Columbia: 
</P>
<P>
 * States must begin implementing a low-emissions program in 1996 and require 
sales of cleaner cars and light trucks starting in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 * Five categories of vehicles are allowed -- including electric cars -- for 
meeting emission standards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Starting with 1999 models, emissions must be reduced each year, with a 
reduction of nearly 50% by 2003.  
</P>
<P>
 * California's reformulated gasoline standards are not endorsed.

FED MEMBER QUITS, LEAVING CLINTON 2 POSITIONS TO FILL; POLICY: PRESIDENT HAS 
RARE OPPORTUNITY TO STEER BOARD IN A NEW DIRECTION FOLLOWING 12 YEARS OF 
REPUBLICAN DOMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David W. Mullins Jr., vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, announced 
Tuesday that he will resign, handing President Clinton an unusual opportunity 
to put his stamp on a Republican-dominated institution that influences the 
course of the economy with its control over money supply and interest rates.  
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected departure of Mullins, who said he will step down Feb. 14, along 
with the previously announced resignation of board member Wayne D. Angell, will 
allow Clinton to nominate two new members to the Fed's seven-member board. 
Mullins and Angell were appointed by Clinton's Republican predecessors, Ronald 
Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President will nominate individuals who will add some constructive 
diversity to the board," Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said, signaling the 
Administration's intent to set a new course after 12 years of Republican 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 The change comes at a key time in the economic cycle. Recent statistics 
indicate that a sluggish recovery is beginning to pick up speed, causing some 
economists and Fed insiders to worry that inflationary pressures could be 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank's traditional inflation antidote is higher interest rates, 
and Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has served notice that the board will probably 
act soon to nudge short-term rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has lowered rates by four percentage points to combat the recession 
that began in 1990, and it has left its benchmark discount rate at 3% since 
mid-1992. The discount rate is the interest rate paid by commercial banks on 
overnight loans from the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins, 47, has been "one of the more vociferous advocates of higher interest 
rates," said David Hale, chief economist of Kemper Financial Companies, a 
Chicago-based investment company. He would have been a "voice for tightening" 
to keep inflation in line in the months ahead, Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mullins said he will become a partner in Long-Term Capital Management, a 
recently formed investment management firm based in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 Angell, a former Kansas banker, farmer and university professor, has not 
announced his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to appoint two new board members is something of a political 
windfall for the President. It could bolster the White House economic agenda, 
which depends in large part on a continuation of low interest rates to 
stimulate consumer and business spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important, no two ways about it," a delighted senior Administration 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration -- and the Fed -- must achieve a delicate balance. If 
bond traders conclude that the central bank is keeping short-term rates too low 
for too long, they are likely to bid up long-term rates to hedge against future 
inflation. Higher long-term rates could do more damage to the Administration's 
economic program than a modest increase in short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is widely believed that Clinton will name George Perry, an economist at the 
Brookings Institution in Washington, to the position vacated by Angell. With 
Mullins' retirement, the President could nominate Perry to the vice chairman's 
post, though questions have been raised about placing Perry on the board in any 
capacity because his wife is a portfolio manager for several mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little overt disagreement at the moment between the Fed and the 
Administration, even on the sensitive question of interest rates. Nevertheless, 
the White House has kept an anxious eye on Greenspan, cautioning against 
raising rates too aggressively in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a fear of any type of action when things are going so good," a 
senior Treasury official said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to make the call as to when to make the adjustment," said Laura 
D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed from the White House perspective, a false step in either direction 
could upset the economy two years down the road, when Clinton is likely to 
begin his reelection drive. Keeping rates too low could fuel inflation, but 
raising them too rapidly could cause another economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "So goes the economy, so goes President Clinton's personal popularity 
ratings," a senior White House official said. "They are directly tied to each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 "These opportunities don't come along all the time," the aide said. "We don't 
know how long or hard the recovery will be. If we follow the normal cycles, we 
could end up dipping back at the end of 1995."

 Construction Spending Up in '93: Rising an unexpected 2.6% in December, 
construction spending finished the year with a 7.9% gain, the Commerce 
Department said.Economists said they expect the advance -- which most had 
predicted would be only 1.5% in December -- to carry over into 1994. They noted 
that even the depressed office and industrial building sector appears to be 
rebounding. The Commerce Department reported that residential, non-residential 
and government spending on construction totaled a record $470.3 billion in 
1993, up from $436 billion in 1992.

 Northrop Blames Missile Development for Loss: In reporting a fourth-quarter 
loss and 21% lower annual profit, the defense company cited cost overruns on a 
missile it is developing for the government.Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp., 
whose best-known product is the B-2, or stealth bomber, lost $35 million, or 73 
cents a share, on sales of $1.26 billion during the October-December period. It 
earned $55 million, or $1.17 a share, on sales of $1.51 billion during the 
fourth quarter of 1992. For the year, Northrop's net income was $96 million, or 
$1.99 per share, down from $121 million, or $2.56 per share.

 Pacific Enterprises Profits Rise: Pacific Enterprises reported sharply higher 
fourth-quarter earnings.For the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company posted net 
income of $47 million, or 52 cents a share, compared to a year earlier, when it 
reported a loss of $1 million, or 7 cents a share, including results from the 
company's two former major non-utility businesses, which have been sold. 
Revenue fell to $825 million from $875 million for the fourth quarter of 1992. 
Earnings from Pacific Enterprises' principal subsidiary, Southern California 
Gas Co., declined slightly, although the utility earned its authorized rate of 
return for the 11th consecutive year.

 ICN Beats Back Khan's Proxy Challenge: The Costa Mesa-based drug company 
easily won a bitter 10-month proxy battle as dissident investor Rafi M. Khan 
garnered less than 10% of the votes cast at the firm's annual meeting on his 
proposal to oust Chairman Milan Panic and eight other board members. ICN said 
it will pursue legal action against Khan unless he reimburses the company for 
the $4 million it spent defending itself.

 Mutual Fund Guidelines Urged for Banks: Six banking organizations are asking 
member institutions to tell customers: If you buy mutual funds, understand that 
they are not guaranteed by the federal government.The message is included in a 
series of guidelines that the trade groups hope commercial banks will adopt 
when selling the popular mutual funds. Surveys show that many people who buy 
mutual funds from banks are unaware that they could lose their money. Unlike 
bank deposits, fund investments are not guaranteed by the government.

 Cable Firms Seek to Compete With PacTel, GTE: The California Cable Television 
Assn. is asking the state Public Utilities Commission to allow cable companies 
to compete with Pacific Bell and GTE by offering phone service in certain areas 
of California. Alan J. Gardner, the trade group's vice president of regulatory 
and legal affairs, said the action is in response to recent lawsuits filed by 
the phone companies that seek approval to offer video service in portions of 
their service areas. The association said it wants the immediate right to 
compete in those areas specified by the phone companies, which include Los 
Angeles and Anaheim.

 Nation's Manufacturing Growth Surges: The managers who do the buying for the 
nation's factories reported the healthiest manufacturing growth in 5 1/2 years 
in January, but their monthly assessment carried a troublesome warning of 
higher inflation. The National Assn. of Purchasing Management's monthly survey 
on the economy was unexpectedly strong and bolstered other evidence that the 
economic expansion in the final three months of 1993 carried over into 1994. 
The survey also indicates higher price increases filtering down to consumers in 
coming months, perhaps heralding an end to the tame inflation that has 
characterized the recovery from the 1990-91 recession.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move state leaders are expected to tout as a sign of rising confidence in 
California's economy and business climate, Air Products & Chemicals Inc. will 
announce plans today to spend $270 million to build six new plants and expand 
others in the Golden State over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plants will be in Orange County, Santa Fe Springs, another location 
near Los Angeles and in Martinez in the Bay Area.Air Products, which makes 
industrial gases, chemicals and environmental systems, will also expand an 
existing facility in City of Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Details will be announced at a New York news conference this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick J. Witmer, state government relations manager for Allentown, Pa.-based 
Air Products, said Tuesday that the new facilities will create about 90 
permanent jobs. But many workers will be employed building the plants, he said, 
and the expansion will increase Air Products' capital investment in California 
by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facilities will make products designed to help companies reduce air 
pollution, Air Products said.

TRAIL AT END OF B-2 LEADS TO NORTHROP CONTRACT; AIRCRAFT: AIR FORCE WILL PAY 
$63.5 MILLION TO GET RID OF THE WISPY WHITE CONTRAILS THAT GIVE AWAY STEALTH 
BOMBER'S LOCATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Air Force has decided to make the Northrop B-2 stealth bomber more 
stealthy by attempting to eradicate the pesky white contrails the aircraft 
sometimes leaves in its wake.  
</P>
<P>
 The service has awarded Northrop Corp. a $63.5-million contract to develop a 
top-secret system designed to allow pilots to avoid creating the contrails, 
which are formed by condensation.  
</P>
<P>
 In certain atmospheric conditions, the wispy white lines can linger for up to 
an hour, leaving a visual track stretching hundreds of miles, according to 
experts. The problem has plagued military pilots for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not very stealthy when you are flying at the end of a white line in the 
sky," said Steven Crow, an aerospace engineering professor at the University of 
Arizona and a leading expert on contrails. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials would say little about the contrail effort, though they 
were quick to emphasize that it does not reflect any new glitch or deficiency 
in the $44.4-billion project to build 20 B-2 bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a shortcoming," Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Patrick Mullaney said. 
"This is not a problem-fixing issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Northrop began the B-2 program in 1981, critics have questioned the 
ability to fly undetected by enemy radar and infrared sensors. They have 
contended that various types of radar can detect and track all stealth 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon, however, has repeatedly asserted that the B-2 has performed well 
in tests and that there is no known radar or infrared technology that can 
pinpoint its location. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lesser-known issue of contrails seems to be another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early stages of the program, the House Armed Services Committee has 
expressed concern in secret meetings that contrails would reveal the B-2 to 
enemy jet fighters or missile crews, according to a former staff member of the 
panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials repeatedly assured the committee that the problem was 
"being worked" on and that a solution would be found, the ex-staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee spokesman said recently that the panel is not even aware of the 
Northrop contract, even though the award was several weeks ago. "It is 
surprising that they are just now getting around to doing something about it," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited solution is apparently at hand. Mullaney said the contract 
reflects recent technological advances, but he said he could not discuss any of 
the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, methods to control contrails are a closely held military secret, 
according to aerospace industry officials and combat aircraft test pilots. 
Academic experts say contrails form in two ways: 
</P>
<P>
 * The aircraft's jet engines burn massive amounts of fuel, emitting water 
vapor out the tailpipe. As the warm vapor hits the cold air at high altitudes, 
it condenses. The effect is much like seeing your breath on a cold morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * As an aircraft moves through the air, its wings create two intense swirling 
masses of air, called wake vortices. At the center of each vortex, the 
temperature and pressure drop compared to the surrounding air, causing humidity 
to condense and form a contrail. Such contrails are most likely to occur in 
cold and humid conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Crow said most contrails are formed by wake vortices. But Alvar Bendiksen, an 
aerospace engineer at UCLA, said engine exhaust is the major culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause, pilots are alert for contrails when outside air is roughly 
67 degrees below zero on humid days, according to a veteran test pilot. 
Contrails are most likely to form at altitudes between 28,000 and 45,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If pilots notice contrails forming -- which they refer to as marking -- they 
typically lower or raise their altitude. Some planes are particularly notorious 
markers, among them the Lockheed F-117A stealth fighter jet, the veteran test 
pilot noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In its announcement of the contract, the Air Force said it will cover the 
development and testing of "hardware, software and air crew procedures that 
will allow operational B-2 aircraft to avoid or minimize the impact of flying 
in atmospheric conditions which may produce contrails." 
</P>
<P>
 Mullaney, the Air Force spokesman, said the system will be ready for the last 
two B-2 bombers off the production line in Palmdale in 1997. The other 18 
bombers will be modified later, he said. The design work is being done at the 
B-2 plant in Pico Rivera.

CABLE, NETWORKS OFFER DIFFERENT VIOLENCE PLANS; TELEVISION: ONE PROPOSAL IS FOR 
THE INSTALLATION IN SETS OF A DEVICE THAT WOULD ALLOW PARENTS TO BLOCK OUT 
"V-RATED" PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The two major segments of the television industry drew dramatically different 
responses Tuesday for their strategies to limit violent TV programming, with 
cable executives winning praise for their comprehensive plan and network 
broadcasters being criticized for not doing enough.  
</P>
<P>
 In separate news conferences on Capitol Hill designed to head off federal 
legislation that would force them to reduce violent programming, broadcast and 
cable TV companies agreed to form an independent monitoring board to assess and 
report on the amount of violence in entertainment programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But cable television went a step further, agreeing to begin rating its 
programs for violence and endorsing technology that would permit parents to 
block violent shows from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House telecommunications 
subcommittee, warned that legislation may still be enacted this year to bring 
broadcasters in line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that just having a monitoring group that reports once a year is 
inadequate to the task," said Markey, who will keep pushing his anti-violence 
bill to install an electronic chip in new TV sets to let parents block out 
programming with a violent "V" rating. 
</P>
<P>
 While critics say such moves could violate the First Amendment, there are 
already 10 or more pieces of anti-violence legislation being drafted. Sen. 
Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) said he still intends to press his bill requiring 
manufacturers to install a V-chip in TV sets. "There are other steps we need to 
take" to address TV violence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The networks and cable systems have long been aware of this problem and have 
resisted any effort to do anything about it," said Carlton Carl, spokesman for 
Rep. John Bryant (D-Texas), who will continue to sponsor his bill calling for 
the Federal Communications Commission to set formal violence standards. 
"Promises now to monitor violence and report it to folks is a rather slight 
effort, given the obvious seriousness of the problem and the proliferation of 
violence on the air waves," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the only one who will back off his legislation for now is Sen. Paul 
Simon (D-Ill.). Simon has been the leading crusader for a reduction in 
television violence, but in recent months many others have joined in as public 
concern over the issue has reached a critical level. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four out of five Americans feel violence in television entertainment 
programs directly contributes to violence in society, and 54% say they would 
support government guidelines to limit the amount of mayhem on TV, according to 
a Los Angeles Times poll taken in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Rakolta of Americans for Responsible TV, a national organization with 
350,000 members who want to keep the public air waves free of violence when 
children are watching, said on Tuesday that the independent monitoring group 
proposed by the networks is just a delaying "tactic to have business as usual, 
to provide them another three to five years of uninterrupted, reckless, 
irresponsible programming." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The networks think this will die down. They're waiting for this 
issue to turn cold. But it won't because the public opinion is too strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast networks believe they have already controlled the situation, 
referring to a recent independent study that found network television is less 
violent today than it was a year ago, and much less so than five or 10 years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the broadcast networks implemented the Advance Parental Advisory 
Plan last year to alert parents with on-air labels to programs that might be 
inappropriate for children due to some violent content. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the new monitoring board, according to a CBS statement, is 
"both to reassure those who are concerned that the networks' progress on 
violence might only be temporary and to provide useful information for 
continuing industry-wide self-evaluation. An independent outside expert will be 
hired to perform the joint assessment." 
</P>
<P>
 The cable industry also agreed to set up an independent panel to measure 
violence in TV programming and to issue annual reports to the public on their 
findings. Officials did not say from what groups panelists would be drawn nor 
how frequently reports might be issued. Networks do not support the V-chip or a 
ratings system because they fear advertisers might shy away from programming 
deemed too violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably easier for cable than the networks to accept the notion of a 
blocking system because they are narrowcasters and the networks are 
broadcasting," said Joel Federman, director of research for Mediascope, a 
nonprofit organization working to lessen violence in the mass media. "In other 
words, the networks want the widest possible audience, so there are financial 
disincentives to lose any segment of your audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Federman believes a ratings system is inevitable, however, because of public 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Hollywood TV producers feel differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Cuse, co-creator and executive producer of the Fox drama series 
"Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.," doesn't expect the networks' monitoring 
group to affect what he does on a weekly basis, even though his show has come 
under fire for excessive violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a producer and as a parent of two children, I take a great sense of 
responsibility as to what I put in my show already," Cuse said. "I feel that 
any kind of moves in the direction of self regulation are steps in the right 
direction. But I really am kind of guided by my own internal moral principles."

FCC WON'T BLOCK INFINITY'S KRTH BUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday that it will not block 
Infinity Broadcasting Corp.'s bid to purchase a Los Angeles radio station 
despite repeated complaints about Infinity's off-color radio personality, 
Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the agency voted 2 to 1 to seek another $400,000 in fines against 
Infinity for six alleged indecency violations by Stern but to grant Infinity's 
application for the broadcast license at KRTH-FM. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based Infinity is already contesting about $1.3 million in fines the 
FCC has levied against the company in connection with listener complaints about 
Stern's talk show. But Infinity said it was "gratified" by the license 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Infinity has agreed to buy KRTH from Beasley Broadcast Group for $110 million. 
In addition, it is seeking FCC clearance for its purchase of Washington 
stations WPGC-AM and -FM from Cook Inlet Radio Partners for about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC acted grudgingly, and its decision not to block the purchase of KRTH 
underscores the difficulties federal regulators face in grappling with speech 
that some audiences find offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Ervin S. Duggan said he would have opposed the deal if he thought 
the courts would uphold such an action. But Duggan, who left the FCC on Tuesday 
to head the Public Broadcasting Service, ultimately sided with Commissioner 
Andrew C. Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 Voting against the application was James H. Quello, who said: "It is apparent 
that previous FCC fines have not had a deterrent effect. . . . Approving 
transfer of additional stations to Infinity at this time might be 
misinterpreted as the FCC endorsing Infinity and Howard Stern." 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC's new chairman, Reed Hundt, whose former law firm represented the 
company selling KRTH, did not participate in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, whose provocative autobiography "Private Parts" has sold more than a 
million copies, has built a career on remarks about race, ethnicity and 
sexuality that some critics say go beyond the bounds of good taste. 
</P>
<P>
 But while there has been increasing public outcry against crudeness and 
violence on the airwaves, the FCC has been constrained in its regulatory role 
by courts seeking to preserve constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington overturned 
FCC rules that prohibited radio or TV from broadcasting sexually explicit 
material between 6 a.m. and midnight. The court ruled that the ban covered too 
many hours of the day.

QUAKE AREA GETS INSURANCE HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi issued an emergency directive Tuesday 
barring insurers from canceling or refusing to renew any insurance policies in 
the earthquake-affected area for 60 days after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also announced that State Farm Insurance Co. has backed off on its 
previously announced 18-county moratorium on selling new earthquake insurance, 
agreeing to limit the moratorium to five full counties -- Los Angeles, Orange, 
Ventura, Santa Barbara and Kern -- and parts of two others, Riverside and San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency directive is meant to provide a special grace period for the 
thousands of low-income people -- especially auto insurance policyholders -- 
who continually face cancellation for non-payment of premiums. Some insurers 
have already created such grace periods voluntarily so that people will not 
lose their coverage at a time when they may be hard-pressed because of the 6.6 
temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 The order, which expires March 18, is retroactive to Jan. 17, meaning that any 
consumer whose policy was canceled for non-payment between the quake and 
Tuesday is automatically reinstated with no interruption in coverage. Included 
are Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi had criticized State Farm, the state's largest insurer, for 
extending a moratorium on new earthquake policies to cities up to 250 miles 
away. A State Farm spokeswoman said its original moratorium was based on early 
damage estimates and that the company scaled back when a more accurate picture 
emerged.

 Russian Industrial Output Plummets: The record 25.5% decline in January 
compared to a year earlier was reported by the State Statistics Committee in 
Moscow, according to the Interfax news agency. Industrial output fell 18% in 
1993 and 16% in 1992. Russia's new government, dominated by conservative 
ministers with close links to industry, hopes to support production with 
growth-oriented policies, including cheap loans to agriculture and higher state 
subsidies.

BRIEFING BOOK / CAROL J. WILLIAMS: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; ONCE-BATTERED 
SLOVENIA EMERGES TO JOIN THE WESTERN ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Since breaking from Yugoslavia in 1991, the tiny nation of Slovenia -- 
which was the Balkan federation's economic locomotive -- has been battered by a 
dizzying succession of crises that caused its gross national product to shrink 
almost 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry leaders and financial analysts say the bad times have bottomed 
out. Slovenia has reoriented exports to Western markets, and most indicators 
for 1993 point to recovery after a two-year tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 If the conversion from public to private ownership can be completed 
successfully -- a big if, critics say -- Slovenia could become the first former 
communist country to be fully integrated into the economic networks of Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: A Western work ethic and Teutonic orderliness instilled during the 
era of Austro-Hungarian rule helped make Slovenia the most productive republic 
of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 While accounting for only 8% of the population, Slovenia contributed 25% of 
Yugoslavia's GNP and more than 35% of hard-currency exports. Slovenes also 
enjoyed the highest living standards, with per capita income at $6,000 per 
year, above some European Union countries.  
</P>
<P>
 But the emergence of Serbian nationalism spurred Slovenia's secession in June, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 A Yugoslav federal army attack was repulsed by the fledgling Slovenian forces 
within 10 days, but it shattered the nation's image as a serene, stable corner 
of the roiling Balkans. Continuing hostilities in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as United Nations sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia, 
shut down Slovenia's main markets. 
</P>
<P>
 And a global recession took its toll on trade with everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 As sales plummeted, unemployment shot up to more than 10%. Inflation also 
soared two years ago to an annual rate of 1,000% when the tolar was introduced 
to sever Slovenia from Yugoslavia's monetary system.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, private consumption dropped more than 7%, GNP shrank 6% on top of a 
1991 contraction of 9%, and investment plummeted 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: The hardships it has experienced has forced belt-tightening and 
restructuring in Slovenia. This has paid off by making Slovenian 
light-manufacturing enterprises more efficient. Most firms have cut their work 
forces and operating costs more than enough to compensate for lower sales, 
which are now picking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales to countries outside the former Yugoslavia now account for more than 80% 
of exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovenia has signed cooperation agreements with the European Union and the 
European Free Trade Assn. and has earned the confidence of lending agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-year growth trend in unemployment began to reverse itself in 1993, 
and new jobs are expected to be offered in some of the most swiftly recovering 
industries, such as wooden furniture making, printing and publishing, textiles 
and tourism. Inflation is down to 1% per month, or about 20% a year -- high by 
Western standards but among the lowest in Eastern Europe and still falling. 
</P>
<P>
 GNP was flat for 1993 after three losing years, but modest growth is expected 
for the next two years. Improved exports over the past year boosted hard 
currency reserves, allowing easy servicing of a $1.7-billion foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
 One negative: Slovenia remains burdened by some antiquated heavy industries, 
such as steelmaking, which economists say should have been closed before 
privatization began. Losing enterprises are likely to be a drag on the 
development fund to which shares left over from public offerings are to be 
allotted. 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: Slovenia's small size -- just under 2 million people -- is one of 
its biggest advantages. "Even if we increase exports to Germany by 50%, this is 
such a small part of a big market that no one is going to worry too much" and 
impose trade protections, says economist Joze Mencinger, a former finance 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue of concern to potential investors is the unresolved distribution of 
$3 billion in loans to the former Yugoslavia. Commercial lenders have been 
pushing for Slovenia to shoulder the entire burden, as it is the only Yugoslav 
successor state paying its debts. But Ljubljana officials reject a formula 
that, in effect, punishes its success, and they are still negotiating.  
</P>
<P>
 While an unfavorable allotment of that debt could scuttle Slovenia's 
improvement trend, other factors make Slovenian companies potentially 
attractive.  
</P>
<P>
 Wages remain low -- an average of $400 a month -- and workers are more 
disciplined than many Eastern Europeans. A collective agreement reached between 
employers and employees in July has helped avoid strikes by taking workers into 
psychological partnership with management, keeping them abreast of hard 
realities faced by their enterprises and motivated by the potential for profits 
many will share in as a consequence of privatization.

 German Union Lowers Sights; Strikes Continue: Germany's powerful IG Metall 
union retrenched from a demand for a 6% wage increase but went ahead with a 
second day of token strikes that disrupted operations throughout the crucial 
engineering sector.In dropping its original demand, the union said it might not 
even be able to get a deal for increases matching the likely inflation level of 
3% in return for guarantees of job security. Management is calling for a wage 
freeze and benefit cuts, which the union says means a real pay cut of about 
10%. Mass walkouts and demonstrations were focused on the state of North 
Rhine-Westphalia.

 Jordan Licenses 5 Banks in Occupied Territories: The government has given the 
go-ahead to the banks to reopen branches in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and 
Gaza Strip, Central Bank Gov. Mohammed Saeed Nabulsi said in published 
comments. Nabulsi said the move is part of an agreement reached with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization earlier this month to give Jordan a strong 
say in the economy of the occupied lands, parts of which are expected to come 
under Palestinian autonomy soon. The Jan. 7 Jordan-PLO agreement provides for, 
among other things, Jordanian control of banking and monetary affairs of the 
nearly 2 million residents of the West Bank and Gaza during a proposed 
five-year interim self-rule period.

POLICE DEPT. ACCUSED IN SEX-HARASSMENT SUIT; COURTS: CYPRESS OFFICER CONTENDS 
SHE WAS TARGET OF PRANKS, RETALIATION AFTER COMPLAINING OF PHOTO OF SCANTILY 
CLAD MODEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sandra D. Stanton, who rose through the ranks to become the first female 
sergeant in this city's Police Department, figured that 1992 ought to have been 
the best year of her 14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleagues had just selected her "Officer of the Year." She had an article 
published in a leading law enforcement journal and was doing well at the Golden 
West College Police Academy, where she trains young recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the late months of 1991 and early 1992 brought Stanton trauma rather 
than celebration, she alleges in documents filed in Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On her desk, someone left a photocopy of the dictionary definition of the word 
bitch. A message on a key holder left on her desk stated, "Let's Get Drunk So I 
Can Take Advantage of You." The pockets of her uniform were stapled shut, and 
glass shards were dumped in her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, 42, claims in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the city and its 
Police Department that her career was marked for ruin when she complained that 
male colleagues -- including her ex-husband, who was also her supervisor -- 
taunted her in April, 1991, with a photo of a scantily clad woman. 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of 1992, she had received a poor evaluation and knew she had 
been targeted for retaliation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton and her lawyer say the civil suit, which went to trial this week, will 
include testimony from at least three other female employees that this small 
Police Department was a hotbed of favoritism and sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through hell," Stanton said in her first interview since filing the 
lawsuit in December, 1992. "This (harassment) has caused me worries and medical 
problems I never had before. What my colleagues have done to me should never 
happen to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Police Chief Daryl Wicker and Lt. James Weuve, her ex-husband, have 
denied the allegations. Both declined to elaborate, saying they will present 
their sides at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harold Bridges, a lawyer representing the city of Cypress, said both the 
city's personnel office and the state Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
found no evidence of harassment or retribution when each conducted 
investigations of Stanton's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandy Stanton has exercised her rights to have this matter investigated," 
Bridges said, "but she was not happy with the outcome. To continue with this 
matter, with no evidence of retaliation, and to seek large sums of money, is a 
gross misuse of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton no longer works as a police officer. In May, 1992, she took medical 
leave from the department, saying she suffered stomach problems and headaches, 
and was taking anti-depressants -- all of which she attributed to job-related 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives on workers' compensation payments and earnings from teaching at the 
Golden West College Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's lawsuit is one of several in the past two years charging sexual 
harassment against a Southern California police department. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the city of Buena Park lost two sexual harassment lawsuits, and last 
year, Garden Grove paid a $180,000 settlement to a fired reserve police officer 
who said she was fired for ending a romantic relationship with then-Police 
Chief John R. Robertson. Robertson has since become chief of police in Orange. 
In 1993, the city of Long Beach paid nearly $3 million to settle a sexual 
harassment lawsuit brought by two of that city's former policewomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two weeks ago, Newport Beach paid $175,000 to two of the 10 women who 
filed harassment lawsuits against the city, its former police chief and a 
former police captain. Similar lawsuits are pending in Irvine and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phyllis Gallagher, a Fullerton attorney who is representing Stanton, said 
her client's lawsuit varies from this category of sexual harassment claim, in 
which women employees charge that they were fondled by their male colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's case "is more typical of the gender-based discrimination that women 
face when they assert their rights not to be the target of abusive behavior," 
Gallagher said. "They become punished for being 'troublemakers.' " 
</P>
<P>
 City officials acknowledged that the civil trial comes at a difficult time for 
the 87-member department, which has morale problems and is in a labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, who have received since early 1992 numerous unsigned 
letters alleging abuse, favoritism and mismanagement within the Police 
Department, have hired a Los Angeles law firm to investigate those claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police officers, who have been working without a contract for two 
years, have taken to picketing council meetings and mailing "information 
bulletins" to Cypress residents, which contend that this bedroom community in 
northwest Orange County is suffering a rising crime rate that its small force 
cannot handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the outcome of the departmental problems, Stanton said that her 
childhood dream of having a career as a police officer has turned into a 
nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton, who at one time was the department's only female officer, joined the 
force in 1977, rising through the ranks to become a detective. In 1986, she was 
named the first female sergeant in the 37-year-old department's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton married fellow officer James Weuve in 1981. They were divorced three 
years later, but Stanton said she and Weuve maintained cordial relations until 
April, 1991, when she was made the target of locker-room humor. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in that month, according to court records and interviews with Stanton, 
that she showed up late to a weekly meeting of the department's supervisors. 
Stanton said she apologized for her tardiness, noting that she had had 
difficulty getting a ride to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting, another sergeant showed Stanton a postcard of a voluptuous 
model in a skimpy tank top, Stanton alleges in court documents. "If you looked 
like this, you'd probably not have any trouble getting a ride," he was quoted 
as saying in court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The room erupted in laughter, Stanton said. Her ex-husband said, "No, No," and 
joined the laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the incident, Stanton wrote a letter to Weuve, in which she took 
issue with her fellow supervisors entertaining themselves at her expense.  
</P>
<P>
 "By your actions today, you have seen fit to show your contempt for me as a 
sergeant as well as a woman," she said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight months later in 1991, Weuve gave his ex-wife an "unfavorable 
performance review," court documents state. Weuve continued to supervise 
Stanton, even though the police chief and City Manager Darrell Essex knew that 
their relationship was becoming increasingly strained, Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton said she became the victim of continued harassment. Some unknown 
person, or persons, repeatedly placed hostile notes in her mailbox. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lawyer, Gallagher, said Stanton's civil rights were violated because the 
city failed to remedy the "general (and) sexual harassment" even after Stanton 
complained about it. The Police Department also allowed Stanton's ex-husband to 
continue to supervise her even though he was "in large part responsible for the 
continuing pattern of sexual harassment and discrimination," court papers 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to Mayor Richard Partin, the police chief said that he knew 
Stanton's "personal property (was) tampered with by persons unknown" and that 
he had warned every sergeant in the department to "refrain from such behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges, the city's lawyer, acknowledged that a colleague showed Stanton the 
postcard of the scantily clad woman. He said the incident was probably "in bad 
taste" but that no harassment was intended. Bridges also said Stanton was 
mistaken in interpreting Weuve's response as jeering. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's attorney said he doubts that Stanton will prevail in part because 
Stanton cannot trace any of the hostile messages to her ex-husband or any of 
her colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton believes Bridges is mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that my problems only began 
after I brought to light some embarrassing facts to the department," she said. 
"I want a jury to say that I didn't deserve this. I want to have my day in 
court."

2ND DEMOCRAT JOINS RACE FOR UMBERG'S SEAT; POLITICS: SANTA ANA CHAMBER 
PRESIDENT METZLER'S ENTRY IN PARTY PRIMARY, ENCOURAGED BY INCUMBENT, IRKS RIVAL 
MORENO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the unofficial backing of the man he hopes to succeed, Santa Ana Chamber 
of Commerce President Mike Metzler on Tuesday joined the June 7 primary race 
for the 69th Assembly District seat now occupied by Tom Umberg (D-Garden 
Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's encouragement of Metzler to run in the Democratic primary was 
criticized by another Democrat in the race, Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. Moreno, 
who said that Umberg had pledged to stay neutral until all the candidates had 
filed for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler and Moreno are the only Democrats who have declared their candidacies 
and paid filing fees, although other Democrats have expressed their intent to 
run. They include Zeke Hernandez, a Santa Ana resident and Latino political 
activist, and Enriqueta L. Ramos, a Rancho Santiago Community College District 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler, 47, of Santa Ana enters what is looming as an intraparty clash over 
the 69th Assembly District seat, the only Orange County legislative office now 
held by a Democrat and one which has been targeted by Republicans. Umberg is 
stepping down to run for state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard O'Neill, a former Democratic Party chairman, said Metzler's business 
community connections make him the candidate most likely to raise the kind of 
money necessary to win the race against a Republican in the November general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who can raise the money to win the primary with the momentum to win in 
November? And who can get support from Democrats outside the district?" O'Neill 
said. "I think (Metzler) would be the strongest candidate to hold that seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Metzler said that while Umberg first suggested he run, the assemblyman's 
support was not the deciding factor. Metzler said his work with the Chamber of 
Commerce has given him an appreciation of the need to help create jobs and 
improve the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no politician," Metzler said. "This is the first time I have ever run for 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos make up two-thirds of the population in the central Orange County 
district -- which includes parts of Santa Ana, Garden Grove and Anaheim -- but 
only one-fourth of the registered voters. In the 1992 presidential election, 
Latino-surnamed voters cast only about one-fifth of all votes in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is a district that Latino political activists hope to capture. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, 26, said he does not believe Latinos are automatically entitled to the 
seat. However, he said he is disappointed that Umberg apparently is backing 
Metzler, since he had once heard Umberg express the hope that the seat 
eventually would be filled by a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still confident Tom is going to stay neutral in this," Moreno said. "If 
he's going back on his word, he's going to have a lot of explaining to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, Umberg's chief of staff, said that while the assemblyman had 
encouraged Metzler to run, Umberg would wait for the candidate filing deadline 
to pass before he "gets in and plays an active role" in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom's No. 1 goal is to make sure that that seat remains Democratic," Urch 
said. "Our goal is to elect the best candidate that's going to do the best job 
for the district regardless of race, creed, ethnicity or religion."

 During the one-day program sponsored by the Orange County Health Care Agency, 
an array of speakers will discuss a variety of topics ranging from rising AIDS 
rates within some segments of the black community to the feelings of isolation 
experienced by many African American youths who grow up in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have thought that in this day and age, when there have been medical 
breakthroughs across the board, we would have made greater strides," said Dr. 
Vonnie Ross, an African American physician who directs a county drug abuse 
treatment program for pregnant women. "But African Americans are at the 
forefront when you look at things like diabetes, cancer and infant mortality 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, one of the scheduled speakers at the conference, titled "Focus on 
African-American Health in Orange County," said she will deal mostly with 
infant mortality rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the most significant topic for me," Ross said. "It is a problem not 
only here but across the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, blacks make up just 2% of the population. But conference 
organizers said the small numbers are all the more reason that public health 
officials need to expand outreach efforts to one of Orange County's smallest 
ethnic communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a small population (that) if we don't focus on it, people's needs 
will be lost," said Barbara Holmes, a supervisor in the Health Care Agency's 
tobacco use prevention unit and one of the program organizers. "The real 
significance of this event is that it's the first time anything like this has 
been sponsored by Orange County public health officials." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, who became director of public health for the Orange 
County Health Care Agency in January, said the workshops will also try to offer 
solutions to some of the social and health problems that plague low-income 
African American communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stark reality is that African Americans are an endangered species in this 
country," said Stallworth, an African American. "We're trying to help people 
develop some control over their lives and show them that they have the power to 
make sure that they remain healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is scheduled for Thursday at the Sequoia Conference Center, 7530 
Orangethorpe Ave., Buena Park. The event is from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The entrance 
fee is $40 and includes meals and conference materials.

HONORARY CHAIRMAN OF LONG BOARD; FLOWER POWER DRIVES COLLECTOR'S WAVE OF 
SURFING NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rusty Wink can't explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 When he spots an old surfboard with psychedelic print, he flips out -- 
totally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I see a board with paisley or flowers, I go nuts," Wink said with a 
shrug. "I just gotta have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have the same feeling for butterflies. Others collect stamps or 
coins. Wink, a 35-year-old union sheet-metal worker from Laguna Niguel, has 
joined an emerging cult of collectors drawn to the craftsmanship of early 
surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike many of his fellow members of the LCC -- the Longboard Collectors 
Club -- Wink collects only surfboards from the late 1960s. Even more 
exclusively, he is interested in the kaleidoscopic boards with the paisley 
patterns, the "acid drips" and tiger stripes that were the signature of the 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is I just like the colors, the drab olives, the oranges that say 
1960s," Wink said. "It's flower power." 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia is the force driving most of the hundreds of relatively new 
surfboard collectors, said surfing historian Allan Seymour of Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail stores like San Diego County's Longboard Grotto now specialize in old 
long boards. There is a renewed fascination in early surf artists like Rick 
Griffin and Bill Ogden and the old "surf music" albums and posters dating to 
the time Gidget and Moondoggie were "hangin' 10" at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the collectors tend to be men in their 40s and 50s who are reaching 
back to their younger days, Seymour said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like getting your first car back, the one you had in high 
school," said Seymour, 50, who admits to having the bug himself. 
</P>
<P>
 At a sports convention in 1989, Seymour put on a show called "The Surf 
Pioneers" and invited many of the old-timers of surfing, a get-together he 
believes jump-started the interest in surfing's early days. 
</P>
<P>
 The old long boards, which had drifted out of fashion in the 1970s in favor of 
shorter, lighter models that inspired more radical maneuvers, started to become 
popular again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when the tide changed, when it stopped going out on long boards and 
started coming in again," Seymour said. "In one day long boards that were 
considered 'logs' and 'tankers' all of a sudden were collectible pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the old foam boards can fetch up to $2,000 from collectors while the old 
wooden boards that date back to the 1930s can double that price, Wink said.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the other collectors, Wink scours garage sales and classified ads, 
looking for the colorful 1960s boards in good condition. Their new popularity 
makes them much more scarce today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out there but they're becoming much harder to find," said Wink, who 
has been collecting boards for five years. "You can always find the beaters, 
but not boards in mint condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more notable boards in his collection are a Mickey Dora "da Cat" 
model made by Greg Noll Surfboards, a David Nuuhiwa lightweight made by Bing, a 
Corky Carroll Super Mini made by Hobie and a 10-foot-2-inch Greek Eliminator, 
for which he was recently offered $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned him down," Wink said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Wink is a surfer and has been riding boards for 22 years. But unlike the 
nostalgia buffs, he most often rides the more modern short boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I surf a short board and go out there and haggle with the guys at Salt 
Creek," said Wink, who grew up in Long Beach, where his family owned the old 
Wink's Fish and Chips restaurant. "That's really what I learned to ride." 
</P>
<P>
 But every so often, when the surf is small or he's in the mood, he pulls down 
one of his 25 long boards from the rafters and racks in his garage and paddles 
it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole different way of surfing and a whole different mood," Wink said. 
"It mellows me out."

FIREFIGHTERS UNION CHIEF IS SUSPENDED; WESTMINSTER: FIRE CHIEF CITES 
'UNSUBSTANTIATED COMMENTS' LINKING MAN'S DEATH IN A FIRE LAST WEEK TO BUDGET 
CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. said Tuesday that he has suspended the 
firefighters union officer who charged last week that Fire Department budget 
cuts may have caused the death of a mentally disabled man during a recent fire 
in a board and care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Garrison, a director of the Westminster Firefighters Local 2425, was 
suspended for making "unsubstantiated statements" about the Jan. 27 fire that 
killed Mark D. York, 34, while the findings of an investigation were still 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco announced Garrison's suspension at a Tuesday press conference on the 
steps of City Hall, where about two dozen firefighters -- some accompanied by 
their spouses and children -- showed up with placards that urged city officials 
to support public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Charles V. Smith, who joined DeMonaco and Councilwoman Charmayne S. 
Bohman at the press conference, reserved his support for the embattled fire 
chief, who is caught between his disgruntled firefighters and City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're determined that the Fire Department be run by the fire chief, not the 
firefighters union," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison became the second union official to be suspended in the dispute 
between city officials and the firefighters union over changes at the Fire 
Department forced by a million-dollar budget cut in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The union president, Paul Gilbrook, has been suspended with pay since Dec. 28 
and now faces termination after investigators said they found that he has 
improperly claimed sick leave and drove a fire engine with a suspended driver's 
license last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing was scheduled for 10 a.m. today at City Hall to determine if 
Gilbrook should be fired. He has maintained that he has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it coming," said Garrison, a captain and 19-year veteran of the Fire 
Department, of his suspension. "If you speak the truth, and abide by the 
Constitution, this council will fire you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dictatorship," said Gilbrook. "If you say your piece, you're fired." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said that Garrison behaved unprofessionally when he said during a 
press conference last week that York's death could have been avoided if city 
officials had not put a firetruck out of service and cut personnel at Station 2 
at 15061 Moran St., which was closest to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Such statements . . . could cost the city thousands of dollars in legal 
fees," DeMonaco said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison and Gilbrook watched the press conference from a sidewalk about 100 
yards away from City Hall because of a policy that prohibits suspended 
employees on city property. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook said that council members are retaliating for a recall drive 
supported by the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall targets Smith, Bohman, Craig Schweisinger and Tony Lam, who voted 
for the $1-million budget cut. Recall proponents have until Feb. 19 to gather 
7,000 signatures to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that the budget cuts were made to streamline the 
department and control overtime costs, which rose to more than $1 million for 
fiscal year 1992-93 alone. The Orange County district attorney is investigating 
allegations by city officials that the spiraling cost of overtime may be 
attributed to fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the investigation have not been released, but Alan C. Davis, who 
represents the firefighters, said Tuesday that the district attorney's office 
has not questioned any firefighter about the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said preliminary investigation by the state fire marshal's office and 
his department's chief investigator, Don Herr, has indicated that York, whose 
body was found in a bathroom on the bottom floor of the board-and-care home on 
Candlewood Street, died of smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said homicide and foul play have been ruled out. The fire may have been 
caused by someone using a lighter or matches that ignited clothing or paper, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting from a report from the responding firefighters, DeMonaco said that the 
fire was so intense by the time firefighters arrived that no one could have 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one could survive the intense fire, heat and smoke . . . without 
protective gear," said Capt. Mark Benedetti, who led the four-man crew that was 
first on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said that refutes Garrison's assertion that additional equipment and 
people could have saved York. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garrison maintained that city officials have placed public safety in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go from three pieces of equipment to one, and from eight people to 
four, it doesn't take a kindergarten education to see there's a reduction," 
Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Station 2 used to have a three-person fire engine crew, a three-person 
firetruck and two firefighter-paramedics who operated a medic van. It now has a 
four-person fire engine crew and a city ambulance operated by two employees of 
a private firm. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the firetruck, which uses a 100-foot ladder, was not 
necessary because it is designed to fight fires in high-rise buildings, and the 
tallest building in the area is only three stories. 
</P>
<P>
 By removing the firetruck from service, Smith said, the city is now able to 
provide full paramedic services in each of the areas served by the three fire 
stations.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that about 80% of the calls to the Fire Department are medical 
emergencies. Westminster is also a member of Central Net, a regional force that 
can respond to fires and medical emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Felix Pesigan, 45, who operated the board-and-care home where York 
died, said Tuesday that three other disabled adults who lived in the house are 
now staying in a Garden Grove board-and-care home also operated by Pesigan and 
his sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are doing fine," said Pesigan. "They are settling in OK and are glad 
that they are still together."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DRUG AGENTS MAKE LARGE COCAINE BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's Regional Narcotics Suppression Program has seized 1,976 pounds 
of cocaine in what authorities said Tuesday is the first major cocaine bust 
this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The drugs have an estimated street value of $35 million and were seized last 
week by the county's drug task force, which includes 67 officers from local 
police departments and state and federal agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Tuesday, narcotics agents displayed the drugs in dozens 
of small boxes set out on two conference tables. Some boxes were yellow with 
"Clinton" stamped on the side, which may have been for camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
 This indicated "someone's sick sense of humor" and "very little respect for 
the office of the President," said Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Doug Storm, 
head of the task force.  
</P>
<P>
 Storm said most boxes also were wrapped with a scented adhesive that sent 
search dogs off the trail. Finding such a large amount of cocaine in one place 
is unusual because many smugglers now transport cocaine in much smaller amounts 
to avoid capture, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve officers seized the drugs from a Cerritos home and arrested four 
suspects on Jan. 27. The suspects apparently rented the house about a week 
earlier to store the drugs, Storm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of those cases where we sat back and watched them doing 
business," he said. "We caught them transporting this cocaine from Diamond Bar 
to Cerritos in a pickup truck both on freeway and surface streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the cocaine was found in the closet of the house, and some in a truck 
in the garage, Storm said. Three of the suspects were being held Tuesday at the 
Los Angeles County Jail. The fourth, a juvenile, was released to relatives 
pending further investigation, Storm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Storm said the four suspects are believed to have brought the drugs recently 
from Colombia, which agents suspect is their homeland.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate to get it just as it came into the country," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based task force is funded in part by assets seized from drug 
suspects. Started in 1986, the program has been involved in at least 343 
investigations, resulting in 616 arrests and the seizure of $137.9 million.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; BOY WITH HANDGUN SUSPENDED FOR 5 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sixth-grade boy received a five-day suspension from the Capistrano Unified 
School District for showing off a loaded handgun Monday afternoon at an 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the youth left a group of friends he was playing with 
at Viejo Elementary School, 26782 Via Grande, and returned with a .25-caliber 
semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies said the child told them he was just trying to impress his 
friends. After showing off the weapon, the boy tossed it in some bushes.  
</P>
<P>
 A deputy went to the boy's home after he was tipped off by the parents of the 
boy's playmate. The child led them to a wilderness area next to the school 
where the gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Randy Blair said deputies are attempting to determine whether the boy's 
parents negligently left the firearm where their son could find it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly want to know how the kid got ahold of the gun," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 School officials will also interview students and parents in efforts to 
determine whether a lengthier suspension or expulsion should be imposed on the 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no good reason for a kid to bring a gun to campus," said Rich 
Johnson, district coordinator for pupil services.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WOMAN SENTENCED IN SKINHEAD PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim woman arrested as part of a federal investigation into the criminal 
activities of white supremacist skinheads was sentenced Tuesday to one year's 
probation for violating federal weapons laws. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin in Santa Ana ordered Jill Marie 
Scarborough, 22, who pleaded guilty last December to possessing an 
unregistered, sawed-off shotgun, to live in a Garden Grove halfway house for 
six months and to submit to frequent drug testing and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents arrested Scarborough and her former boyfriend, Geremy C. Von 
Rineman, and charged them with possession of the 12-gauge shotgun. Two 
undercover FBI informants had befriended the couple and later paid $400 for the 
shotgun, according to a federal complaint.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal authorities said Von Rineman was a member of the Florida-based Church 
of the Creator, a white supremacist group, and that Scarborough shared his 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough and Von Rineman were among eight people arrested last July after 
an 18-month undercover investigation of white supremacists in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to McLaughlin and filed with court documents, Scarborough 
said she endured a "lousy childhood" with a mother who was "in and out of 
mental health care facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 "I fell into a way of thinking sponsored by (Von Rineman), which I am not very 
proud about, and came to possess the shotgun while not using good judgment," 
Scarborough wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough's court-appointed defense attorney and the government prosecutor 
both recommended one-year probation for Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
 In court documents, the U.S. attorney's office said probation was warranted 
because Scarborough was only 20 when the crime occurred, had no criminal 
history and the gun was not loaded when it was presented to the FBI 
informants.E.J. GONG JR.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; BUDGET DEFICIT IS MORE THAN EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A six-month review of the city's budget this fiscal year shows that the 
deficit has increased rather than decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line locally is we're not seeing an economic recovery in our 
revenue sources," said Finance Director Greg Beaubien.  
</P>
<P>
 In June, when the City Council adopted the 1993-94 budget, a $400,000 
shortfall in revenue was projected. Reserves were to be used to cover the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Kevin O'Rourke said the total deficit to date is about 
$761,000 for the $28-million general-fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
 A reduction in anticipated sales-tax revenue contributed to the higher 
projected deficit, O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone said the council would likely opt to continue to use 
reserves to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the deficit, Bone said the city's economic outlook this year is not as 
bleak as in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a $28-million budget, $700,000 represents approximately 2 1/2% of that 
budget," Bone said. "That 2 1/2% is real close. A lot of things could happen 
between now and the end of the year. We could see expenditures reduced and 
income increased. It is fair to say the budget is in the best shape it's been 
in a lot of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Gouged by state cutbacks in tax revenue, combined with the poor economy, the 
city has lost about $5.5 million since the 1989-90 fiscal year, O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-saving measures have been taken. Last year, for example, the city 
eliminated several jobs, imposed spending and hiring freezes, increased the 
hotel bed tax and did not offer raises to employees. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke said other City Council actions to consolidate services, such as 
contracting animal control services with La Habra, will also save money. The 
city also has an agreement with La Palma, in which La Palma's prisoners are 
taken to Buena Park's jail instead of the County Jail. This makes money for 
Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also is considering contracting fire protection services with the 
Orange County Fire Department, which could save about $500,000. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: $5-MILLION WINDFALL TO GO TO LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financially troubled Orange County library system was given a boost 
Tuesday when the Board of Supervisors approved $5 million in onetime funding to 
stock shelves with thousands of new books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, board Chairman Thomas F. Riley called for the creation of a 
special library commission that would explore new funding sources for the 
network of 27 branch facilities still reeling from a 44% service reduction 
during last year's round of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The new library funding is largely from money the county borrowed to make up 
for shortfalls created by delinquent property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other departments benefiting from the total $8.1 million in available onetime 
funding are the county Flood Control District, which received $2.6 million 
Tuesday, and the county Harbors, Beaches and Parks Department with $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Libraries, however, were by far the hardest hit last year when the state 
shifted $2.6 billion in local property taxes to pay for public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new funds represent a sizable infusion for the library system and 
ensure that book collections will remain somewhat current, it still will not be 
enough to restore full-time operating hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Since July 1, officials have been forced to cut operations at most branches by 
two days each week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mission Viejo, Councilwoman Sharon Cody said the shortened weeks have been 
a particular hardship. She pleaded with supervisors Tuesday to use the money to 
keep library doors open longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody said that her burgeoning South County community had long ago outgrown its 
9,000-square-foot library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why consider spending $4 million on magazine subscriptions when residents 
won't have access to them anyway?" Cody said. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials, however, said the most severe cuts -- more critical than 
the reduction in hours -- sliced new books and materials purchases by 75%. 
County Librarian John Adams said the money would be enough to keep most 
collections current for the next 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "To give you an idea," he said, "in some branches, before today's vote, our 
staff was having to decide whether to renew Science Magazine or Scientific 
American. Both are highly respected science journals, neither one of which you 
want to be without."  
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, $4 million of the library funding will be spent on book purchases 
and to renew thousands of periodical subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance will be used to buy new fax machines for all local branches; help 
pay for staffing of the new Rancho Santa Margarita branch scheduled for opening 
in September; and purchase a new roof for the University Park branch in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley acknowledged that the money would only provide short-term relief for the 
library system. He asked that county staffers return to the board on March 1 
with a "condition report" on the library system.KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CITY TO LOAN CLIFF RESIDENTS $200,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city will loan La Ventana street residents $200,000 to help shore up the 
cliffs above landslide-choked Pacific Coast Highway under a proposal before the 
City Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial arrangement is part of a cooperative agreement between the city, 
Dana Point and La Ventana residents whose cliff-top homes are threatened by the 
crumbling slopes that deposited thousands of tons of rubble on Pacific Coast 
Highway almost a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The unstable cliffs are in San Clemente, while the highway is on the Dana 
Point side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, San Clemente will loan seven property owners the $200,000 
needed to pay for restoring the cliffs underneath their ocean view homes. If 
there are any construction overruns, Dana Point would pay the next $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, homeowners will not hold either city liable for damage occurring from 
the slope repairs, said Peter Shikli, a representative of the La Ventana 
residents. The residents will be free to sue over the February, 1992, 
landslide, which severely damaged or destroyed five homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything to do with the restoration project is excluded from any claims," 
Shikli said. "I don't have any problems (with the cooperative agreement). It 
took us a long time to get to this point and I think it's a win-win for all of 
us and the fastest way to open Coast Highway." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dana Point officials expect federal funding to pay for the most 
expensive part of the project, clearing the highway, work has been stalled for 
several months over the slope restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the homeowners balked at pitching in to pay the $200,000 not covered 
by the federal grant, which only pays for highway excavation. Residents also 
say city officials required them not to sue Dana Point and San Clemente over 
the original landslide. Officials in both cities deny the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente City Manager Michael W. Parness said the compromise would be good 
for all sides as well as for the motorists using Pacific Coast Highway every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our other option would have been to put a wall at the bottom of (Pacific 
Coast Highway) to catch the homes as they fall down," he said. "Now, everybody 
is working in the same direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors will cut into the top of the cliffs at an angle to stabilize the 
slopes. The new ground surface will be built up using original bedrock and 
other materials so that homes can be reconstructed and renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dana Point City Council is expected to vote on the cooperative agreement 
at its Feb. 8 meeting. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; PARKING CHARGES TO BEGIN AT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parking gates are coming to Dana Point Harbor and parking could cost up to $18 
a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction has begun on gates to the 724 spaces in the popular Mariner's 
Village and Dana Wharf parking lots where visitors have parked free since the 
harbor opened in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 A gate will also restrict another parking lot of 124 spaces, commonly called 
Lot 4, which will be reserved for harbor employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the gates are complete this month, parking will cost up to $18 a day 
without any validation from a harbor concessionaire. Officials estimate that 
the gates could be in operation by Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who control the harbor, say the controversial paid parking 
plan is the only way to control the parking problems and traffic congestion at 
the harbor. They say paid parking has been discussed by officials and urged by 
harbor commercial tenants for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of the harbor's 1,623 spaces, in the outer parking lots, will 
remain free, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent is not to inconvenience people but to avoid congestion at the peak 
parking times," said Ken Bruner, an aide to Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose 
5th District includes the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Validations from retail shops in the harbor will offer patrons one hour of 
free parking, restaurants two hours. Sport fishermen will get as many as four 
hours of free parking in the Dana Wharf parking lot only. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego-based Ace Parking has been given the parking lot concession for the 
private harbor lots. Ace Parking will employ traffic directors and managers to 
control the parking during peak hours, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The paid parking program was approved by the Dana Point Planning Commission 
last May. LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; LUNGREN AGAIN BACKS '3 STRIKES' CRIME PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN RAY BALLOU 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Daniel E. Lungren Tuesday repeated his support for a proposed 
"three strikes" initiative aimed at locking up habitual criminals, and 
criticized the mass media for inundating children with violent television 
shows, music and video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, in addressing local law enforcement officials attending a conference 
on violent crime at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel, said he approved of the 
initiative, which requires life sentences for offenders convicted of committing 
a third felony after having been found guilty of two previous serious or 
violent felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers are attempting to place the initiative on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also told the crowd of about 300 that more focus needs to be placed on 
preventing such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A culture of violence has taken root in our society," he said. "These young 
people committing crimes didn't spring from their mothers' wombs hating and 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something in our society has helped condition them to that. Before, I didn't 
believe that there was any relationship between the prevalence of violence in 
motion pictures, video games and music and what happens on the streets, but my 
thinking has changed, I was wrong." BRIAN RAY BALLOU

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MOBILE HOME PARK NEAR ARENA TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of a 23-acre mobile home park next door to Anaheim Arena have told 
their tenants that they will close the park by October and may pave it for a 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants of the Orange Tree Mobile Home Park are being asked by Campanula 
Properties Inc. to sign an agreement saying they will not fight the closure and 
will leave by Oct. 15. In return, the company is offering to waive up to $5,000 
in rent, which would cover about six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 The 236-space park is north of the arena and next to its main parking lot, 
which overflows during most large events at the sport complex. An arena 
spokesman said the facility is not negotiating with Campanula and any lot it 
builds would be a private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stanaland, Campanula's president, said the company plans "to issue a 
formal notice (confirming the closure) within the next few days." He cited the 
25-year-old park's deteriorating condition, its escalating vacancy rate and 
traffic problems with the arena as reasons for the closure.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanaland said that converting the park to a private parking lot serving the 
arena is the most obvious solution, but other possibilities that he declined to 
name are being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Leion, president of the tenants association, said most tenants are not as 
upset about the closure as they are the way it is being handled. He said they 
believe they are being intimidated into signing the agreement, which gives them 
too little money and contains several clauses concerning control of their 
property that make them uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is people don't trust (Stanaland's) actions," Leion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leion also said that most tenants are not bothered by the traffic and added 
that the park had begun deteriorating only recently, after Campanula stopped 
making repairs, which made the vacancy rate go up. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest conflict between Stanaland and his tenants is over how much they 
should receive for moving. Under Anaheim's mobile home ordinance, if Campanula 
shuts the park, it must pay the tenants the average cost of moving their mobile 
homes to another park within 125 miles. Stanaland says the average of three 
estimates Campanula has received is $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leion says the tenants association has received two estimates that average 
about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are going to move by U-Haul, some will want better choices," 
Leion said. "But Stanaland ought to provide for our out-of-pocket costs. This 
is not a voluntary move on our part. This is a forced move." TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; COUNCIL COMMENDS 4 CRIME WITNESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four people have been awarded commendations by the City Council for helping to 
apprehend a car thief and identify a purse snatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange resident, Jeffrey Kisow, was praised by the City Council last week 
for calling the Sheriff's Department from his cellular phone after witnessing 
four people committing a car burglary. Kisow followed the suspects as they 
drove away. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the burglars attempted to flee the city, a sheriff's deputy cut the 
suspects off and arrested them, authorities said. The incident occurred last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects were arrested because of Kisow's involvement in the case, 
sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another crime case, Michelle Shabazian of Villa Park and Bryce Shepherd and 
Brian Roberts, both of Orange, were commended by council members for aiding a 
woman whose purse was taken as she walked to her car in the Villa Park Shopping 
Center last September. 
</P>
<P>
 A man ran up behind the woman, snatched her purse and drove away as she yelled 
for help, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherd and Roberts saw the theft and chased the suspect but were unable to 
catch him. Shabazian, however, followed the thief in her car and watched as he 
got into a waiting vehicle. She followed the car long enough to record the 
description and license plate number and returned to the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The three witnesses gave deputies the same description and license plate 
number and, together with the victim, who was unharmed, identified the suspect 
in a photo lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 A warrant was issued for a suspect, who was on probation in connection with 
another robbery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's purse was later found by an unknown person and returned to the 
victim with all its contents, except about $40. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people were committed to doing the right thing," Sheriff's Capt. Bill 
Miller said. The Sheriff's Department also commended the four witnesses for 
their deeds earlier this year. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; NEW POLICE CHIEF REORGANIZES FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of his first official acts, Police Chief Randall Gaston has reorganized 
the Police Department to reduce administrative positions and reallocate 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure that we are running the department in a lean, 
administrative way," said Gaston, who announced the reorganization on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the restructuring, the department will eliminate one of five 
captain's positions. The slot eliminated is the one that Gaston vacated after 
he became chief last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, five police divisions are being renamed, reassigned and 
consolidated into four divisions. The new divisions are: Community Services, 
Detective, Patrol and Special Operations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the restructuring will save some money, which will then be funneled 
into other police services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have less administrative costs and take those savings and apply 
them to existing field operations," Gaston said.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; LIMITS ON PARKING NEAR SCHOOL OKD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has made it a violation to park in front of Villa Park 
Elementary School during certain school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Feb. 25, parking will be prohibited from 7 to 9 a.m. and from 1:30 
to 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week unanimously extended the no-parking hours on the 
streets that border the school so children arriving and leaving school will be 
more easily visible to drivers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it less dangerous for kids coming to and leaving the school," 
Councilman Bob Patchin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who park on the streets but remain in their cars will not be cited, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, signs posted around the school allow parking 35 minutes before 
school lets out for the day, Patchin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one parent criticized the plan. Judi Allen, a parent who drives her 
7-year-old daughter to and from the school, called the new parking prohibition 
a "revenue generator." 
</P>
<P>
 She said when the school parking lot is full, she will park on the street and 
leave her car unattended as she walks her child to and from class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to risk getting a ticket," Allen said. The ordinance "doesn't make 
any sense to me."MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; TRAFFIC LAWS WILL BE ENFORCED AT CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies soon will have the authority to cite vehicles 
in the Villa Park Shopping Center for violating basic traffic laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council last week unanimously voted to implement rules of public 
roads in the shopping center's parking lot after customers complained of 
drivers who speed, fail to stop at stop signs and drive recklessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities will begin enforcing the California Vehicle Code prohibiting 
speeding, speeding contests and reckless driving when city officials post signs 
in the center warning drivers of the new law in the private parking lot. The 
signs are expected to be posted within weeks, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, people who violate speeding and other traffic laws in the center 
cannot be cited. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people violate the traffic laws now, they will get ticketed or their cars 
will get towed away," City Manager Fred Maley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brodsky, owner of the Villa Park Pharmacy and Fountain in the center, said 
he was happy about the new law. He said he has sent several customers who 
complain of speeders to City Hall, which also is in the center, to tell city 
officials about their worries. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rule "will stop people from speeding through here," Brodsky said. MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL BOARD VOTES TO ELIMINATE 36 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees for the Orange Unified School District unanimously voted last week to 
eliminate 36 jobs to close a $485,000 shortfall in its $107-million 1993-94 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's 7-0 vote Thursday night follows a steady course of 
budget-tightening over three years. In that time, the district has slashed 
$11.5 million from budgets, resulting in layoffs to teachers and classified 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the board approved cutting expenses for administrators, which 
saved about $180,000. A proposal to trim benefits to trustees is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wishes more than me that layoffs weren't necessary," said Trustee Max 
Reissmueller Thursday night. "Life is life, and we can't pay what we don't 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 The board ignored a plea from the president of the classified employees union 
to postpone a decision on the layoffs until negotiations between the union and 
the district could be concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised the vote was 7 to zip," said union President Becky Mayers. 
"It tells me there are people up there who haven't been laid off before and 
don't know what it feels like." 
</P>
<P>
 The board had delayed a vote on the layoffs in December and hoped that 
scheduled talks between union and district officials could offer cost-trimming 
measures elsewhere. At Thursday night's meeting, Interim Supt. Marilyn Corey 
said the district would lose $90,000 for each month it pushed back 
implementation of the layoffs.

 "Each delay could result in deeper cuts in services to students," said Corey, 
who recommended the board approve the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Mayers was hopeful a plan could be developed that retained the 
jobs by slashing union costs elsewhere. Mayers would not say where the cuts 
would come from. School officials said Thursday if such a plan were devised and 
agreed upon, the union jobs could be retained. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Bob Viviano wasn't quite as optimistic about the prospect of such 
an agreement between the district and the union, who have been engaged in talks 
since the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact we are going to have a meeting doesn't mean we are going to have an 
agreement," he said. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SUSPECT LINKED TO 4 ROBBERIES ARRESTED 
</P>

 A man suspected of committing four robberies in Orange and Los Angeles 
counties was arrested after he hit two motorists with his car, police said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrested William Wasz, 31, of North Hollywood about 9:45 p.m. 
Monday, they found Wasz had shot himself in the leg, Sgt. Andy Gonis said, 
adding that police did not know why. Wasz was treated for the wound and placed 
in the city jail with bail set at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizen reported about 9:25 p.m. Monday of seeing a drunk driver at 8th 
Street and West Bay Avenue, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers saw the truck 10 minutes later southbound on Newport Boulevard at 
30th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 When the driver saw the police car, he turned at 29th Street and then headed 
back on Newport Boulevard, driving north on southbound lanes, Gonis said. Just 
past Via Lido, he jumped over the center divider and drove with northbound 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Near West Coast Highway, the driver rear-ended a 1989 Pontiac driven by Edward 
Morse, 49, of Irvine, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect then turned east on West Coast Highway with officers still chasing 
him. About a quarter mile later, with slow traffic on the road, the suspect 
drove into the left-turn pocket and hit a 1993 Infinity driven by Michael 
Monaco, 34, of Newport Beach, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasz then tried to run away, hobbling on one leg, but was caught in front of 
Newport Classic Inn, 2300 W. Coast Highway. Police did not know when Wasz shot 
himself in the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Morse, the driver of the first car that was hit, was treated for scratches and 
bruises and released, Gonis said. Monaco was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana to be treated for a concussion and a rib fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the truck Wasz had been driving had been stolen from 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the truck were a handgun, drug paraphernalia, sound equipment, alcohol 
and at least $500 in cash believed to have been taken in robberies earlier in 
the day, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasz was believed to be the suspect in robberies of a Blockbuster Video store 
in Hawaiian Gardens, a Music Plus store in Tustin, and a Pizza Hut and a liquor 
store in Huntington Beach, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Municipal Court in 
Newport Beach.THUAN LE

ANAHEIM MAYOR, POLICE UNION CHIEF TALKING PRIVATELY; LABOR: DISCUSSIONS ARE 
CHARACTERIZED AS 'FENCE-MENDING.' WAGE DISPUTE HAS LASTED 18 MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of the police association and the city's mayor have been meeting 
privately in an effort to resolve the officers' acrimonious 18-month wage 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Both officials declined to discuss details, although police union President 
Bruce Bottolfson characterized the sessions so far as largely "fence-mending" 
to "bury the hatchet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson, president of the Anaheim Police Assn., speculated that Mayor Tom 
Daly made the initiative because he is "looking for recognition" for putting 
the deal together. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor is protecting his own political interests, Bottolfson said, adding: 
"I don't care, though. If Tom can put the deal together, great." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, for his part, rejected Bottolfson's talk about ulterior motives. "I 
wouldn't characterize it quite that way," he said. "I just want to get to 
settle this in a fair way. If and when there is an agreement there will be 
plenty of credit to go around." 
</P>
<P>
 The union president added that "Daly, to us, has been the evil emperor." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract dispute between the city and police officers has resulted in 
several public protests by the officers, including a 24-hour "blue flu" job 
action two weeks ago. Nearly 200 officers participated in the job action. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officers have been working without a contract since July, 1992, and 
have not had a raise since July, 1991. The officers are seeking a 10% raise 
through July, 1995, which would cost the city about $7.5 million. The city has 
offered a 6.5% raise until 1995 with an additional 3.25% to 5% raise in 1996, 
depending on the inflation rate. That package is worth about $5.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials have insisted that they cannot afford to meet the union's 
demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the negotiations, Daly has come under fire from the police 
association for what it calls a lack of leadership on the issue. Councilmen Bob 
D. Simpson and Fred Hunter have also criticized the mayor for failing to 
resolve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, an officer, frustrated by the impasse, purposefully ticketed the 
mayor's car for expired vehicle tags, department sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly acknowledges receiving the ticket but said: "I don't have any factual 
basis for the officer's motivation." And, he said, "I certainly don't expect 
any special treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he still believes the offer the city has made to the police is 
fair, especially with the city facing an $8-million deficit next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he said, "we aren't entirely sure how we are going to pay for this 
offer on the table . . . but we want to recognize the outstanding work of the 
officers. They do a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly also said he is committed to increasing the number of officers in the 
department from 352 to about 400 in the next several years. He has asked city 
staff to try and find funding for those positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is seeking a federal grant to help fund 22 new police positions. City 
officials were told Tuesday by White House officials that they should learn in 
a couple of weeks whether the city will receive the grant.

SUPERVISORS TAKE TIGHTER CONTROL OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E. J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by television images of crumbled buildings, tent cities and long 
lines of people seeking assistance in Los Angeles County after the Northridge 
quake, the Orange County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to 
increase its control over the county's disaster preparedness agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emergency Management Division, the disaster agency currently under the 
Fire Department, will be placed in the County Administrative Office. The plan 
would centralize emergency planning and place decision making on such issues 
closer to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department is in favor of the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to move the agency stemmed primarily from the recent temblor's 
devastating aftermath, said Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northridge earthquake really heightened our need to place a higher 
priority on emergency preparedness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez emphasized that the Fire Department has done an "outstanding job" in 
managing EMD and in no way does the move indicate any problems with current 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have an opportunity to further enhance the EMD's efforts by 
elevating their role in the county family and heightening board involvement," 
Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a move we recommended over a year ago," said Hugh Wood, assistant 
director of the Fire Department. "The move gives a centralized focus of 
emergency management issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said the Fire Department prefers the role of team player on the EMD 
rather than the lead organizing agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better if the EMD is controlled by the central point of the county 
because they will have better access to the board for policy direction," Wood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EMD is the planning and response team composed of 10 full-time employees 
who plan for both natural and other disasters.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which has an annual budget of $690,000, works with the Sheriff's 
Department, social services, county health officials and other agencies to 
devise strategies for dealing with crisis situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just about how you respond to the event when a disaster strikes, but 
also how your agencies and departments are organized to help people get their 
lives back in order afterward," Vasquez said.

POLICE, CARWASH IN ORANGE PLAN GUN TRADE-IN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER and LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department and a carwash owner will hook up this weekend to make 
this city the second in the county to participate in a program that offers a 
free wash and wax to anyone who turns in a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of a similar campaign in Costa Mesa, Orange police will issue a 
receipt for weapons brought into the police station Feb. 5 and Feb. 12 between 
10 a.m. and 2 p.m. The receipt can be redeemed for a $47 hand wash and wax at 
Metro Car Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs in both cities were the idea of carwash owner Frank Bianchini, 
who has facilities in Huntington Beach, Santa Ana, Costa Mesa and Orange. At 
the behest of Bianchini, the Costa Mesa Police Department initiated a gun 
trade-in program three weeks ago, but it has netted only three firearms so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun buyback and exchange programs have sprung up across the country over the 
past year. Bianchini said he wanted to create the local programs after learning 
of one in New York where authorities handed out toys in return for guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bianchini has also contacted police departments in Santa Ana and Huntington 
Beach to determine if they are interested in starting trade-in programs in 
their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to get as many guns off the street as we can," said Orange Police 
Lt. Ed Tunstall. "The guns we'll get are guns people don't want. They're the 
ones that end up in the wrong hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say they will adhere to the same procedures during the 
trade-in as they do when collecting abandoned weapons. Police will check the 
firearm's serial number to make sure it hasn't been stolen or used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know who is going to turn in guns," added Tunstall. "It's a 
brand-new program and we are anxious to see how it works out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Police station is at 1107 N. Batavia St.

DRUG DISPUTE LINKED TO MAN'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old man was fatally wounded Tuesday in what police said was a drug 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Marin Miranda of Santa Ana was shot in the chest just before 2 a.m. in 
the 500 block of North Broadway, Lt. Bob Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers responding to reports of gunfire found Miranda lying in the 
street, being treated by paramedics. He was unable to speak, and was taken to 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he died about 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness, who was with Miranda at the time of the shooting, told police they 
were approached by three men in their early 20s who demanded $20 for drugs, 
possibly crack cocaine, previously sold to Miranda. The victim said he had no 
money, Chavez said, and refused to be searched by the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 When Miranda and the witness fled, one of the three men fired once with a 
handgun, Chavez said.

SANTA ANA DEBATES PLAN FOR SPACE SAVER SCHOOL; DEVELOPMENT: SOME WORRY ABOUT 
INCREASES IN CRIME AND NOISE. OTHERS DON'T WANT TO TURN DOWN STATE FINANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 450 parents and community leaders packed a school board meeting 
Tuesday night, debating a plan to build a school in the Bristol Marketplace 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Tuesday night, the Santa Ana Unified School District board had not 
voted on the proposal for the $43-million "space saver" school. 
</P>
<P>
 Space saver schools typically have several stories, instead of taking up room 
with single-floor buildings. The idea is to add schools -- without condemning 
private property -- in densely populated cities with little room for new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday night, many residents urged the board to approve the new school, 
noting that state officials chose the Santa Ana Unified School District over 
others to receive money for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine anyone winning the lottery who would say, 'Nah, I don't want 
the money.' That's stupid," said Santa Ana resident Richard Eldridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But others worried that the school district has not adequately addressed 
problems that the new school would bring, such as increased traffic, crime and 
noise, to an already busy area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants the school to lose the money, but there must be adequate 
mitigation, so we can all walk away happy," said Santa Ana City Councilwoman 
Lisa Mills, who was speaking as a member of the West Floral Park neighborhood 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 She called for a two-week delay so board members could come up with an 
alternative site or revamp the plan to satisfy people who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's space saver school would be a three-story building within the 
Bristol Marketplace, a shopping center now being remodeled.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana school officials say the proposal provides a fast way to build a 
much-needed school in an overcrowded district. State officials, when allocating 
money for schools, said they will give priority to plans that use the space 
saver idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's public hearing was held at Phillips Hall on the Rancho Santiago 
College campus, across the street from the proposed school site.  
</P>
<P>
 Many residents told the board that a new school would better serve the 
community if built elsewhere and that district officials could have chosen an 
alternative site without losing the state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a Jan. 31 letter to the district, officials of the State 
Allocation Board said approval of the plan is site specific and that the board 
is "expected to move forward with the project in a timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, signed by state Sens. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) and Leroy 
F. Greene (D-Carmichael), also states that "any changes to the current proposal 
shall subject the district to a loss of the funding now reserved for the 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the meeting, many residents supported the plan as a way to 
alleviate overcrowding and hailed the board's recent decision to make the 
campus a fundamental school. Fundamental schools combine traditional 
instructional programs with strict dress and behavior rules and strong parental 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to get a gift of $43 million (from the state) to be able to build a 
school, four to seven years before we would otherwise be able to, is a great 
opportunity," Supt. Rudy Castruita said before the meeting. "It's an 
opportunity to build a school for 1,300 students, and that's the bottom line 
for me."  
</P>
<P>
 The new 98,000-square-foot campus would accommodate 1,300 students from the 
sixth through eighth grades, easing a space crunch at other intermediate 
schools, said Mike Vail, senior director of facilities.

ANAHEIM POLICE ARREST 7 IN HOME ROBBERY ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Seven men posing as police officers were arrested Tuesday by Anaheim 
detectives after they attempted a home invasion robbery in San Bernardino, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are suspected of committing a similar robbery in Anaheim recently, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police officials released only sketchy details Tuesday about the San 
Bernardino robbery attempt, the Anaheim robbery, or the arrests, saying the 
investigation is continuing and future arrests are possible. Four of the 
suspects are Anaheim residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Randall Gaston said the men are suspects in an Anaheim home 
invasion robbery that occurred several weeks ago and that other suspects may be 
sought. But he declined to give further details or say whether there have been 
other robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Vince Howard said the men were armed with handguns when they attempted the 
home invasion robbery in San Bernardino and were arrested afterward by Anaheim 
detectives, with the help of San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies. He 
refused to give further details of the robbery or the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston and Howard said releasing information about the Anaheim robbery -- 
either when it occurred or on Tuesday -- would have endangered the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We release information on a case-by-case basis," Gaston said. "It's not an 
easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, San Bernardino County law enforcement officials said they had no 
knowledge of Tuesday's robbery attempt or the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are being held in Anaheim City Jail in lieu of $50,000 each on 
charges of attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 They were identified as Anaheim residents Faustino A. Romero, 36; Armando B. 
Sanchez, 21; Manuel F. Valenzuela, 33; and Jose M. Bernal, 24. Also arrested 
were Giovanni G. Zavalza, 21, of Los Angeles; Roman C. Aguilar, 23, of San 
Bernardino; and Felipe B. Garcia, 24, of Hemet.

DRAWING IRE; IS NO MARRIAGE SAFE? DICK TRACY IS STEPPING INTO THE '90S BY 
SPLITTING WITH HIS WIFE. WHY CAN'T ZIGGY, SNOOPY AND CATHY GET REAL INSTEAD? 
</P>

<P>
 Holy egads! It looks like copper Dick Tracy and his wife, Tess, are getting a 
divorce! 
</P>
<P>
 So who isn't? you ask, underwhelmed at the news. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking about some fly-by-night Hollywood couple here. This is Dick 
and Tess Trueheart Tracy, for gosh sake. Married 45 years, comic-strip 
characters 63 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the facts: Seems Tess wants Dick to pay a little less attention to truth, 
justice and the American way and a little more attention to their marriage. The 
divorce papers will be served on Monday while he's at FBI training school. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Tribune reporter Michael Kilian, who has been writing the Tracy strip 
for 1 1/2 years (and says he liked the movie), wants to put Dick Tracy -- a 
product of the Depression -- "into more contemporary situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, we don't want Dick Tracy to be a modern kinda guy. We don't want him to 
be human. 
</P>
<P>
 We want him to be a plain, simple comic-strip character: A goody-two-shoes cop 
with Jack Lord hair, who battles ugly bad guys in shootouts that would have 
left Superman for dead -- but in true comic-strip style, they all manage to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 And we want (a group whine, please): Dick and Tess to stay together. Pick on 
another comic strip, you. If it's contemporary reality you're after, here's 
what we'd like to see: 
</P>
<P>
 * Miss Buxley gain 40 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cathy lose 40 pounds and accept Susan Powter as her personal savior. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "Far Side" make sense every day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Andy Capp stand up and announce at an AA meeting, "I'm Andy and I'm an 
alcoholic." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hagar trim that horrible beard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dagwood dump the bow tie and one-button shirt and get himself a couple of 
Armani suits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heathcliff, his dog tags lost, sitting in a cage at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Garfield sitting next to him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snoopy and Marmaduke come out on "Geraldo" as the world's first gay pet 
couple. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rex Morgan decide that he's burned out, propose to faithful nurse June, 
elope and run off to serve in the Peace Corps in a remote South American 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Wizard of Id renounce his title and declare himself the Wizard of Ego 
and Superego. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ziggy join Hair Club for Men. 
</P>
<P>
 * Charlie Brown, opting for toupee over weave, issue a press release saying 
that he now prefers to be called "Charles." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dick and Tess Tracy patch things up: Next, on "Oprah."

 In Dr. T. Berry Brazelton's book "Touchpoints," the well-known pediatrician 
answers parents' questions about their child's feelings, development and 
behavior, from birth through age 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The word touchpoints refers to universal and predictable times just before a 
surge of rapid growth of any kind of development -- motor, cognitive or 
emotional -- when, for a short time, a child regresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If parents understood that children may steal, wet the bed or experience 
other 'problem' behavior when they are entering a new developmental stage, then 
they would put less pressure on their child," Brazelton said in an interview. 
"And if these 'touchpoints' are used as windows, then future problems could be 
prevented." 
</P>
<P>
 The 512-page reference book (Addison-Wesley, $22.95) is divided into three 
sections. Part one begins with pregnancy and ends with age 3. Part two covers 
the first six years and presents the most common developmental challenges to 
this age group. Part three looks at all the important people in the child's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make parenting a lot more fun," Brazelton said. "If I can give 
parents the right questions, then they feel backed up."

MAD ABOUT MONOGAMY; RELATIONSHIPS: EAGER TO PUSH THE EROTIC ENVELOPE? YOU MAY 
NOT HAVE TO GO FAR. A WAVE OF NEW BOOKS SUGGESTS THAT THE BEST HUNTING GROUND 
FOR GREAT SEX IS RIGHT AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, when Lonnie Barbach and David Guisinger wrote a book called 
"Going the Distance," they wanted it to carry the subtitle, "A Field Guide to 
Monogamy." Their publisher vetoed that idea outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Monogamy, Barbach was told, was terminal boredom. It was death. Mentioning it 
on the cover would kill the book, pronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward the literary calendar to the winter of 1994. Barbach, a Mill 
Valley psychologist, has a forthcoming book called "The Erotic Edge," stories 
of passion for -- gasp! -- married people. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Lloyd, a 52-year-old grandmother and emergency medical technician in 
Westchester County, N.Y., is publishing her third book of "handy household 
sexual hints" for monogamous folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in time for Valentine's Day, Dr. Harold Bloomfield, a San Diego 
psychiatrist, is bringing out the paperback version of "Love Secrets for a 
Lasting Relationship," aimed at couples who plan to stay together until the 
12th of Never. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the title-of-the-year category, there is "Hot Monogamy," the book that 
has Texas family therapist Patricia Love hopping from talk show to talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 The boomlet of sex books for married people is a "very '90s" phenomenon, said 
Lisa Johnson of the publishing house E.P. Dutton, reflecting the possibility 
that people can actually stay together and still have passion -- a notion that 
seemed borderline unthinkable during previous decades of greed and 
self-absorption. Commitment is very much in vogue, say publishers, who are 
churning out books with such titles as "Getting to I Do" and "Now That I'm 
Married, Why Isn't Everything Perfect?" 
</P>
<P>
 All of which represents a welcome turn of events, said America's sexual 
godmother, Dr. Ruth Westheimer. 
</P>
<P>
 "To think that being with one partner is now in fashion again is music to my 
ears," said Dr. Ruth, who has been married to the same man for 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ruth was quick to report that her latest literary effort, "Dr. Ruth's 
Encyclopedia of Sex," focuses extensively on avoiding the tedium that sometimes 
accompanies long-term partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the fear of contracting AIDS or other diseases, years of economic 
uncertainty have helped bring about the reanointment of long-term commitment. 
Books about how to cheat on your spouse, which once flooded the market, have 
been supplanted by titles that promise ecstatic bliss to nice married people. 
And books about marriage in 1994 don't just talk about balancing the checkbook, 
managing aggression or car-pooling the kids. They talk about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind this trend, said Sandra Scantling, a Connecticut psychologist whose new 
book is "Ordinary Women, Extraordinary Sex," is a sudden and collective 
awareness that "we don't have to look outside to find joy."  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want many partners anymore," Scantling said. "We want one with whom 
'it' will be extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Scantling said she wanted to explore how average people enhance their 
relationships. But she said her publisher, Dutton, balked when she wanted the 
phrase "Ordinary Women" in her title. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me to say 'Remarkable Women,' " she said. "And I said, who are 
you talking about, Eleanor Roosevelt?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyday men and women also populate the wildly successful paperbacks of Joan 
Lloyd. "Come Play With Me," Lloyd's newest book for "plain, normal people," 
will be out this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I wrote my books for the couple who has the same fantasy, but they 
never found a way to share it because they felt that nice people didn't do 
things like that," said Lloyd, who has lived with the same man for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With her penchant for filling her books with such advice as how to avoid rug 
burns, Lloyd has taken to calling herself "The Sexual Heloise." Her editor at 
Warner Books in New York, Jamie Raab, said Lloyd's appeal has been enhanced by 
"a heightened consciousness now that if you're not feeling excited by your 
relationship, you can no longer go out and have an affair." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the fear of AIDS, said Carole DeSanti, who has edited a number of 
the new titles for Dutton, "people have watched their friends, their families, 
or themselves go through serial monogamy, and they have noticed that people 
seem to take up the same problems in a new relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, DeSanti said, marriages, or marriage-like relationships, "no 
longer feel so expendable. People don't feel like they can dump the old model 
and trade up for a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 The amorous shopping sprees of a decade or more ago have simply stopped, said 
one of DeSanti's authors, New York sex therapist Eva Margolies, whose newest 
book also targets married couples and is called "Undressing the American Male." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we've been given permission to explore, most people have come to the 
conclusion that if anything, new partners don't alleviate sexual problems and 
may make them worse," Margolies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Patricia Love, another of DeSanti's authors, said a sense of 
cosmic insecurity has attracted some people to the very sense of permanence 
that formerly scared them when "m" words such as marriage or monogamy were 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so much unrest in the world, there's this need to hold on," said Love, 
who acknowledged that her surname occasionally jeopardizes her professional 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 But Love said she has an even more "grandiose idea," that "maybe we're finally 
getting it right as a species." Monogamy and regular sex are "biologically 
healthy," Love said. "Maybe we're figuring that out at last." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as best-selling author Bloomfield pointed out, cultural expectations were 
a tough match for any kind of biological imperative. "I believe that my 
generation grew up with the idea that sex gets boring as you get older," said 
Bloomfield, who is 49 and has been married to the same woman for more than 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ozzie and Harriet happily retiring to their twin beds every night, "there 
was no model" for middle-aged marriages that left the sheets steaming, 
Bloomfield said. Monogamy was tantamount to monotony. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monogamy was something you did," Bloomfield said, nearly gagging on his next 
phrase, "because you were mature." 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, Bloomfield said, speaking from experience, "for a while 
there, it was like if you were the couple in the room that was married for the 
longest time, you felt weird. You were almost embarrassed." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Old Married Couple may have been feeling dull and stodgy, the 
swingers in the room had problems of their own, Lonnie Barbach maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people got very tired of moving from bedroom to bedroom," said 
Barbach, who has been writing about sex and relationships since 1975. Barbach 
described co-author and fellow psychologist Guisinger as her partner, meaning 
that they have lived and worked together for 10 years. Their daughter, Tess, is 
7. "We just never got married," Barbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she wrote "The Erotic Edge," Barbach did two books of erotica for 
women. "Then I thought, erotica is fun, why not do something especially for 
couples?" She said she makes a clear distinction between pornography, "which is 
degrading," and erotica, "which centers around eros, or romantic love," and 
believes such stories "allow couples who may not be comfortable talking about 
their fantasies to read to each other instead." 
</P>
<P>
 But for married couples, psychologist Love said, erotic reading materials may 
vary enormously. 
</P>
<P>
 "One couple I know, they go to bed, he reads the Wall Street Journal, she 
reads erotica," Love said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever gets you through the night, Dr. Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the grass is not so much greener on the other side of the lawn," 
Westheimer said. "Somehow, the pendulum is swinging back."

FIXATIONS: WORKIN' ON THE RAILROAD ALL THE LIVELONG DAY; ONE-TRACK MINDS HAVE 
NO PLACE IN THE BURGEONING MODEL TRAIN LANDSCAPE WHERE AN ANAHEIM HILLS CRAFTER 
PASSES THE TIME AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Maybe it's the 1/24 scale model steel railroad bridge you first see when you 
approach the hilltop house, or the 3/4-mile of accompanying G-gauge track that 
nearly surrounds the place, running past little towns, around mountains, over 
rivers and through tunnels into the house. Maybe it's the way those tracks and 
others continue through nearly every room, or the way the kitchen dining area 
is filled with little trees being painted and plaster houses being constructed 
by Cliff Springmeier, who was casually flicking his cigarette ash on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly this, you say to yourself, this is a bachelor pad. 
</P>
<P>
 I had been pestering Springmeier since March to allow us to view his railroad 
setup, which local hobby shops maintained was the most extreme in the county. 
And every month Springmeier would politely put us off, saying he and friends 
were working on it nonstop and it just wasn't ready to be viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 It still isn't ready, and won't be for years, but he did finally relent, 
allowing us to see the creation in progress. It's pretty scary. 
</P>
<P>
 Springmeier, 60, has indeed been working on the railroad all the livelong day. 
Since he sold off his $60 million-a-year plastics distribution business in 
1989, he's passed the time away on his trains from 4:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. (with a 
couple of hours off for an afternoon nap) seven days a week. It's not a 
solitary activity: He has seven people helping him, of about 15 he says have 
greatly contributed their time and skills over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 With that time and human effort, one could build some awfully nice houses, and 
Springmeier has done that as well, designing and building, among others, a 
$2.5-million manse in Orange Park. But that was easy going compared to his 
railroad project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know anybody who would be insane enough to do this," he said in a 
rocky chain-smoker's voice as he began a tour of his place.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the rooms are dominated by oak platforms containing locomotive worlds 
in various states of completion. Some hold towns and switching yards, nearly 
finished but for details such as gravel and painted-on rust. Another holds a 
plywood framework for an extensive mountain railroad layout. Even though it 
will be out of view when completed, the wood is gracefully sawed and sanded 
like a finished product. As a backdrop to the scenes, the walls are painted in 
cloud patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a look under here," Springmeier suggested, motioning to an open panel at 
the base of one layout designed to have six G-gauge trains running 
simultaneously. Beneath the tableaux on the plateau was a low, cedar-paneled 
chamber that would have looked like a midget Finnish sauna but for the tracks 
covering the floor and the immaculately neat electrical wiring bundled along 
the rafters. Two of the tracks ran up to a pillow leaning against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the engine yard. I can store 23 engines and trains under there and 
electrically bring them out onto the railroad. I bring them into the yard, (the 
pillow was covering a hole in the wall) and can have them end up back on this 
layout or on another in the garage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has video cameras and monitors to track the trains outside, and his various 
control panels -- bearing colored charts resembling London Underground route 
maps -- are linked by voice-activated intercoms. Once outside, the trains go 
over remote-controlled drawbridges and iron trestles sturdy enough for 
Springmeier to stride on and around mountains in the back yard. One of those, 
when finished, will house tiki torches and a smoke generator to simulate a 
volcano.  
</P>
<P>
 He had to rebuild the other mountain after it exhibited some volcanic traits 
of its own last Thanksgiving. A ruptured fire-pit gas line had caused natural 
gas to accumulate inside the concrete mini-mount, and it exploded, taking out a 
section of scenery and several of his house's windows. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been reconstructed now, and one only realizes how much work remains to 
be done outside when ushered up a stairway to the train room in his garage 
attic. As he opened the trap door to the room, Springmeier said, "For this one, 
you have to go 'ooh' and 'aah' even if you don't mean it." 
</P>
<P>
 The prompting wasn't necessary. The low-ceilinged room contains a 
breathtakingly detailed HO-scale miniature of railroad-adjacent life, with 347 
buildings and 2,500 tiny people (all hand-painted), an 11-foot trestle made 
from 6,000 pieces of wood and a combination of realistic and fanciful scenes of 
American life from 1850 to 1920. Because the only door is in the floor, the 800 
feet of track and surrounding scenery entirely circle the room. 
</P>
<P>
 There's everything from Indian battles to a mining-town toxic pond with dead 
foliage, all rendered in eye-straining detail. If a tiny character is fishing, 
you're sure to find a far tinier bobber floating on the plastic water surface. 
Turn off the room lights and the scenes are lit by their storefronts and street 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our little subtle things: Here's a mugging. Then, you see this guy in 
the boat? That's his wife on the dock screaming at him because instead of 
fishing he's watching the nudes on that end of the beach. And here's an auto 
wreck, a hooker and a drunk stumbling along. I come in here sometimes and have 
to say, 'I can't remember doing that,' or 'I don't remember ever seeing that 
before,' " Springmeier said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the rest of his house is finished -- he thinks it may take as long as six 
years -- it will all have a similar level of detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the names on the little business buildings are those of friends who 
have helped build the stuff. All of the railroad equipment, though, bears the 
logo M.Y.R.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Springmeier explained, "That stands for My Railroad. That started as a kid 
because people would always ask me if my setup was a copy of the Pennsylvania 
or the B&O, and I'd say, 'No, it's my railroad.' And as I went along later, I 
enjoyed building things I liked rather than what's prototypical. There are a 
lot of people in the hobby who are very prototypical. They're nut and rivet 
counters who might say, 'Oh, that doesn't happen in a real railroad.' But it 
does in mine. It's more fun to build what you like." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He has liked model railroads since he got his first ones as a 12-year-old 
growing up in Cincinnati. He still has some of his childhood trains, along with 
more than 300 HO engines. Along the course of turning his plastics business 
from a three-employee operation into a 450-person, 23-office enterprise, 
Springmeier found the trains were a great way to let off steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the business was successful, when you're the head of the company, 
all you hear about is the big problems. During the 23 years I did that, it was 
so therapeutic to sit and build these. I'm a very hyper person, and I can't sit 
still. My mind is always churning, and this gave me something to apply that 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 He once confined his locomotive lust to the attic room. But after selling his 
business -- he cites the state's "anti-business" climate as the reason -- and 
splitting up with his second wife, his "little railroad empire" sprawled into 
the house and yard. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered what the neighbors must think, particularly one stuck with a prime 
view of the outdoor rail line. Springmeier said, "Well, that guy also has 
trains in this gauge. He's going to connect up to it over here. Besides, when 
this gets painted, it's going to look prettier than most dog-run side yards." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though unfinished, his back yard layout is eye-catching for the perspective: 
The backdrop to its tiny buildings is the distance-shrunk skyline of the 
county, and they seem oddly matched.  
</P>
<P>
 And just as the life-size state has had its seismic woes, Springmeier's 
Lilliputian one is on shaky ground. As were many Anaheim Hills homes, his was 
significantly damaged in landslides last winter -- the floor in one room is so 
uneven it's like walking in Knott's haunted house -- and it, trains and all, 
may yet slip all the way down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even a year ago, when Springmeier was required to evacuate his house each 
evening and sleep in a motel, he and his helpers were back in the daytime 
working on the railroad. Though he sometimes speaks of the slide zone as an 
inevitable cancer, he's working as if it's for posterity. When he's gone to 
that big train yard in the sky, he plans for the house to be maintained and 
kept open "to charities, orphanages and everyone else." Though he enjoys 
sharing the creation, he sometimes gets cranky about the looky-loos who have 
been showing up so far, because every time the doorbell rings, work stops.  
</P>
<P>
 He enjoys building his railroad more than he likes running the trains. When it 
comes down to it, Springmeier doesn't even especially like real trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't go eight feet to see a train or go to a train museum," he 
declared. "In the hobby I think there's a lot of people like me, who aren't 
that interested in trains for trains' sake but are interested because it is a 
great craft hobby. I don't know of any others where you can work in as many 
materials as you can with trains. You weld bridges, wire electronics, pour 
concrete. You can work in everything from dirt to steel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To him, it's an art.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're building a life scene, building life in a way, duplicating it. You see 
pictures, Rembrandts and stuff, but they're just a little splotch, in one 
dimension. This is three-dimensional, with great depth. You can do anything 
here, have any scenes you want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't do this so much to leave a mark on life. I think what I've enjoyed 
most in both my business and with my railroad has been to see people mature and 
grow in their abilities. When I started my business, we couldn't afford to hire 
college graduates. You see their skills develop, see a guy who didn't think he 
could spell his own name become manager of the sales division over 20 years. 
And there have been people who have come in here who were scared to death to 
paint a little figure, or use a little penknife, and they've become pretty damn 
fine little mechanics." 
</P>
<P>
 He says it isn't ego that drives him, at least mostly not that. "I built a big 
business, and I'm sure as hell building a big railroad," he said with a laugh, 
"so maybe there's just a little bit of that there. Mainly I'm trying to pass on 
the love of this craft."

 The drag theme resurrected by "Mrs. Doubtfire" is creating a flood of 
cross-dressing scripts in Hollywood. Guys in the music world, meanwhile, have 
long been open to gender-blurring their apparel. Nirvana recently appeared in 
videos in dresses, and Aerosmith and Duran Duran have also featured men in 
drag. 
</P>
<P>
 The guy who does it best, RuPaul, takes the look to the limit in his new duet 
video with Elton John, "Don't Go Breaking My Heart." The surprise in this 
"costume epic and tribute to history's most famous couples," says Randy 
Barbato, who co-directs with Fenton Bailey, is that John gets his turn playing 
the woman, too. London designer Polly Clayden dresses the duo to pose as Antony 
and Cleopatra, the painting "American Gothic" and Marie Antoinette with her 
consort, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 When the singers appear as themselves, John is in a red suit and RuPaul is in 
a black lace dress, both by Gianni Versace. The video's fashion coup is that it 
shows off some of John's prized sunglasses. He auctioned off most of his 
collection years ago but kept a few treasures, seen here, for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Go West, Young Woman: This is the year of gal Westerns ("Bad Girls," "The 
Quick and the Dead") in Hollywood, and that trend may have inspired at least 
one video due out mid-February. In the campy "Lay Down Your Arms," Belinda 
Carlisle shows just how glamorous one can look in an embroidered shirt and 
cowboy hat. Makeup master Carol Shaw did the singer's face, giving Carlisle a 
beauty edge over the rest of her female posse. To find similar Old West duds, 
stylist Jeannine Braden recommends a trip to the Rose Bowl flea market or such 
vintage shops as Ragtime Cowboy in North Hollywood or Polkadots and Moonbeams 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Global Dreams: Deep Forest's extraordinary "Sweet Lullaby" is an authentic 
Pygmy lullaby sung by a girl to her sleepless sibling. Director Tarsem, best 
known for his MTV award-winning "Losing My Religion" for R.E.M., starts this 
video in Turkey, then follows the little sister on a tricycle ride around the 
world. The screen is filled with lush scenery, indigenous clothing and extras 
wearing Fatima Andrade's Ottoman Empire-inspired costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "On MTV, everything has been done. We thought these were images no one has 
touched," Tarsem says. The director and Andrade appear in the costumes, 
disguised by oversize mustaches. "I don't know if the mustaches will catch on," 
Tarsem says with a laugh, "but we thought they were beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 After an absence of several years ("I don't like too much music"), Tarsem 
decided to do "Lullaby" because "I fell in love with this song" and the video 
proceeds go to the Pygmy Fund, which helps preserve the Pygmies' culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Try This at Home: Porno for Pyros' new "A Little Sadness" shows a form 
of not-for-the-squeamish body decoration that makes tattoos and punk piercing 
look positively tame. Based on the performance art piece "4 Scenes in a Harsh 
Life" by Southern Californian Ron Athey, it features "scarification" borrowed 
from ancient tribal traditions. Director John Lindauer cautions that permanent 
raised scarring works only on skin with dark melanin. Light- to medium-skinned 
adventurers ought to stick with tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Today: For men, variations on dreadlocks, including cropped (Counting 
Crows, Leaders of the New School), sticking up as if they've been caught in a 
cyclone (Wu-Tang Clan) and short twists worn with a wide headband (A Tribe 
Called Quest). 
</P>
<P>
 For women, long hair with a portion caught up in a knot, reminiscent of "I 
Dream of Jeannie" or Madonna a few years back. The newest versions are braided, 
as done by Snoop Doggy Dogg's girlfriend in "What's My Name," or loose and 
wavy, as done by Janet Jackson in MTV's New Year's Eve "Because of Love" 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Blur: When digitized blocks cover something in a video, it's usually 
exposed body parts or a fashion faux pas, such as a T-shirt emblazoned with 
four-letter words or marijuana plants. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV asks record companies to place the blurry squares over anything that 
promotes gratuitous sex or violence, glamorizes drug use, shows a commercial 
product or violates Federal Communications Commission obscenity rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Digitizing is rampant in John Mellencamp's "When Jesus Left Birmingham," which 
shows society's deterioration through drug needles, a white man in blackface 
and a black woman in white face. MTV declines to comment on specific videos, 
but perhaps its Beavis and Butt-head flaps have prompted the channel to go the 
conservative route.

FIRST PERSON / SUSAN CHRISTIAN: SICK CHILD AWAKENS PARENTS TO VALUE OF TIME 
TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the Sunday before I learned my baby would need surgery, I dolled her up for 
the Christmas card photo. I tried pinning her wispy blond hair in pigtails, a 
do that had been mine decades before. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ill-fated coif's brief existence, Erin and I engaged in a game of 
peekaboo -- she on one side of the bathroom door, I on the mirrored side. It 
was a sweet sensation, glancing first at my adult image, then at this giggly 
little girl looking as though she had walked out of my parents' old home 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this has anything to do with the ordeal our family was about to 
endure, except that I would recall the moment often over the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the photo session, Erin came down with a cold and high 
temperature -- her first fever. My husband, Mike, took her to the pediatrician, 
who ordered chest X-rays to check for "pneumonia or other." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely 'other,' " the radiologist told our doctor. More than half 
of Erin's intestines appeared in her left lung cavity, indicating a herniated 
diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 months, a dangerous birth defect had gone undetected in our robust and 
cheerful child. A hole in the muscles between her abdomen and lungs had allowed 
Erin's bowels to creep upward. Usually, such hernias cause obvious breathing 
difficulties and are caught at birth. But Erin showed no symptoms at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery was urgent, but doctors wanted Erin's cold to subside before putting 
her under anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The next few days were weighted with fear and grief. We learned enough about 
Erin's condition to terrify us, but not enough to rein in our wild 
imaginations. I paced the floors of our home. My husband prompted me to change 
out of my bathrobe in the morning and to eat dinner at night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It took the wise words of a stranger to yank me from my abyss. On a Saturday 
morning, five days into our limbo, Erin underwent more X-rays at Long Beach 
Memorial Hospital. This time, radiologists forced barium up her nose as she 
screamed in terror. 
</P>
<P>
 I waited outside the X-ray room, sobbing as Mike helped the radiologists hold 
Erin down. A woman sitting nearby with her daughter told me that she understood 
my state of mind. When her child had open-heart surgery as an infant, she 
didn't think she could cope. Now the girl is a healthy 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cry when there is nothing that can be done," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember that day as my re-entry into some semblance of sanity -- the day I 
decided I had no choice but to muster a little faith in modern medicine, the 
day I started putting Erin ahead of my fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin pulled out of her cold early the next week. Surgery was scheduled for 
Dec. 16.  
</P>
<P>
 My most wrenching moment was kissing her goodby as a nurse pried her from my 
arms. Erin however, had just been given a sedative and -- fascinated with the 
nurse's hair -- happily dismissed me. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon said the operation would take two hours. We watched the clock from 
11 a.m. until 1:15 p.m., when we were paged in the hospital lobby. A nurse told 
us that the doctor had discovered a second hole and would need another 45 
minutes. Rather than panic, Mike and I focused on the positives: Thank God for 
that fortuitous X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, the surgeon appeared in the lobby. "Erin is fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 I steeled myself before entering Erin's room in the pediatric intensive care 
unit. Bandages covered my baby's torso. There were tubes everywhere -- in her 
nose for oxygen, in her back for epidural anesthesia, in both sides of her 
chest to drain mucus from her lung cavities, in her right arm for intravenous 
fluids. Her left hand was tied to the bed to prevent her from tugging at the 
apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 She would open her eyes and look at us drowsily, indifferently, then drift off 
again. She cried weakly whenever a nurse fiddled with her IV or a respiratory 
therapist tapped on her chest. I stroked her hair and forehead -- all that was 
available for me to touch -- and fought back my own tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Days and nights melted together. Mike and I caught snatches of sleep at home 
in six-hour shifts. I conducted my visits to the silent house with businesslike 
efficiency -- mail, bed, shower -- purposely avoiding Erin's toys and empty 
crib. 
</P>
<P>
 Our angel returned to us in wondrous moments day by day. "Look!" Mike said the 
day after surgery, nudging me from a nap. One of us had loosed Erin's hand from 
the crib to hold it for a while, then forgot to retie it. She seized the 
opportunity to slip her two middle fingers in her mouth -- a familiar and 
delightful sight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the third day, she reached for my headband. And on the fourth day, when she 
was taken off morphine, Erin's spirit rebounded altogether. By evening, she was 
clasping musical toys between her feet and manipulating them with her 
unfettered hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin's acceptance of her situation was consoling and heart-breaking. For days, 
the same child who demands her freedom after 30 minutes in a high chair or car 
seat lay strapped inside a crib. For days, the same child who loves waffles for 
breakfast and milk anytime helplessly smacked her dry mouth, deprived of even 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet somehow she managed to smile, laugh, find amusement in her father's silly 
faces or the lights above her bed. She was mad at the doctors and nurses, but 
not at the two people who had brought her to this torture chamber. As long as 
Dad and Mom were nearby, and white coats weren't, life was OK. Babies are so 
forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days before Christmas, the surgeon unwrapped Erin like a gift. So long to 
the chest tubes, off with the oxygen tube, farewell to the heart monitor. He 
lifted the bandages, revealing a tidy scar running diagonally across her belly. 
A nurse brought her a tray with Jell-O, soup and milk. She consumed only the 
latter, although with gusto. 
</P>
<P>
 We were in our final lap. By the next day, Erin no longer needed an IV. And by 
the day after that, she no longer needed a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At last, the ceramic Santas and cookie-dough ornaments came out of the garage. 
It was a Christmas filled with immeasurable gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 When a child has been seriously ill, parents too must recuperate -- and for 
us, the process is much slower. I often wonder if I will ever again feel that 
my time with Erin is not borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, I tell myself, childhood is fleeting. Could we ever appreciate too 
much the time we have with our children?

'PHILADELPHIA' STORY SUBJECT OF LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of Geoffrey Bowers, a lawyer who brought one of the first AIDS 
employment discrimination cases in the United States, has filed a 
multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Hollywood producer Scott Rudin, TriStar 
Pictures and the creators of the movie "Philadelphia," charging that the film 
is substantially based on Bowers' story. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers' two brothers and his attorneys said Tuesday that they had met numerous 
times in 1988 with Rudin, an independent producer, providing him with 
information and access to Bowers' legal hearing that they say are reflected in 
"Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 In a suit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the estate and family 
of Bowers, who died in 1987, are seeking $10 million in damages and an 
acknowledgment that the film is based on Bowers' story. 
</P>
<P>
 The family said they have received no acknowledgment or financial compensation 
for the information they provided, despite what they said was an oral agreement 
with Rudin to provide such recognition. "Philadelphia," the first mainstream 
Hollywood movie about AIDS, has grossed $36.6 million so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rudin and TriStar, the distributor of "Philadelphia," the suit 
also names as defendants Jonathan Demme, director and co-producer of the movie; 
co-producer Ed Saxon and screenwriter Ron Nyswaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the studio had not yet been served with the lawsuit, TriStar 
senior vice president Ed Russell, issued a statement Tuesday saying, "The film 
'Philadelphia' is not the story of Geoffrey Bowers. 'Philadelphia' is a 
fictional story which addresses a regrettably recurring theme of AIDS 
discrimination in this country. TriStar Pictures is very proud of 
'Philadelphia.'  
</P>
<P>
 "There is no merit to the lawsuit, and we're confident we will be vindicated 
in this matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudin is not listed in the movie's credits and the studio said he had nothing 
to do with the production of "Philadelphia." Neither he nor the other 
defendants returned a reporter's phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers, then a New York attorney, filed a complaint with the New York State 
Division of Human Rights in 1986, charging that he had been fired from his job 
at the Chicago-based Baker and McKenzie law firm after AIDS-related lesions 
appeared on his face. Two months after testifying at a hearing on the 
complaint, he died at age 33. The case was resolved in his favor in late 
December, when Baker and McKenzie was ordered to pay $500,000 to Bowers' 
estate. The firm said it plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, producer Rudin contacted the Bowers family in 
1988, saying that he wanted to make a movie of Bowers' story. Charles Bowers, 
Geoffrey's brother, said he spent four hours with Rudin recounting personal 
material that was included in the film. The lawyers said Rudin engaged Nyswaner 
to write the screenplay and sold his rights to Bowers' story to Orion Pictures, 
where it went into development under then-executive vice president Marc Platt. 
In 1991, they said, TriStar acquired Orion's rights to Bowers' story in 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowers family said they read of "Philadelphia" in 1992. When the family's 
attorneys contacted Rudin, they said, he acknowledged that the movie was based 
on the Bowers' story and told them that he had sold the rights to TriStar.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: HO-HUM: BOWLED OVER BY GIMMICKS; TELEVISION: THE SUPER BOWL 
FOLLOWS A DUBIOUS TRADITION OF TRICKING VIEWERS INTO WATCHING FORGETTABLE 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dallas-shmallas, Buffalo-shmuffalo. Another year, another Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's so essential, so meaningful, so Norman Rockwellian, so much the soul 
of Americana, then why is it so readily forgotten? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, you can count on a handful of sports reporters and other professional 
zealots continuing to dwell on Buffalo's repeat loss to Dallas on Sunday, as if 
the defeat were Napoleonic, something that should matter deeply to the global 
multitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, for example, Jay Leno did a bit with Buffalo quarterback Jim 
Kelly, who somehow got himself together despite being widely depicted as a 
disgrace, a discredit to humanity, after Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. 
Meanwhile, David Letterman used his Top 10 list to give Buffalo coach Marv Levy 
the business, and his first guest was victorious Dallas coach Jimmy Johnson. 
Letterman: "This is a dumb question, and you probably can't answer it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dumb" is what applies to this nonsense about Levy. He could discover a cure 
for the common cold and still be the butt of jokes, viewed as an abysmal 
failure for repeatedly failing to win the Super Bowl. C'mon, now, it's a game, 
one . . . game, one that truly matters only to a very few. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just chic or politically correct to give the impression that you care. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, the Super Bowl has been television's super gimmick, Madison 
Avenue's mother lode of hyperbole, a Roman-numeraled gold mine of seductive, 
stone-chiseled marketing scam that the public is irresistibly drawn to the way 
salmon instinctively swim upstream without knowing why. The interior beeper 
beeps, and off they go. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the power of super gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 You could argue that Super Bowl Sunday is one of those rare days in which much 
of the United States becomes a community, united with a single focus. Fewer 
criminals are on the streets, too. But the artificially induced camaraderie in 
front of the television set, whether in homes or in bars, is not only fleeting 
but also hollow, a momentary high. All you've got afterward are drained 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates that about 45% of U.S. television sets and 66% 
of the total TV audience were tuned to Sunday's game, a figure that translates 
to a record audience of nearly 135 million. That's boggling, especially as 
two-thirds of those viewers arguably had no particular interest in Dallas or 
Buffalo or even Bud Light. And many of those who weren't watching probably felt 
compelled to prove to others that they cared. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rang Sunday. "Who's winning?" the caller asked about the game that I 
wasn't watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The question came from a sports illiterate who probably was also wondering if 
anyone in the Super Bowl had hit a home run. "Who's playing?" I asked the 
caller mischievously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buffalo and Houston?" came the tenuous reply. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't know who's playing, why care who's winning? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, is that it's the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that television would have made Americans gimmick-resistant by 
now. Instead, the opposite has happened. Viewers have become desensitized to 
the sheer abundance of TV gimmickry. It's relentless. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sally Jessy Raphael's ever-present box of tissues for inevitably teary 
guests? Gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 * The use of live reporting to freshen old news? Gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
 * The oral signatures of newscasters (from Walter Cronkite's "That's the way 
it is" to Jerry Dunphy's "From the desert to the sea")? Gimmicks. When I worked 
in Louisville, a guy there signed off this way: "Since you were, thanks for 
watching." 
</P>
<P>
 * Catchy movie ratings (thumbs up/thumbs down or "on a scale of one to 10")? 
Gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some earthquake reporting? Gimmick. There on KNBC-TV Channel 4, the day 
after a magnitude 5.0 aftershock, was Rick Chambers: "You know what it felt 
like, here's what it looked like on the Channel 4 'seismo-cam.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's rich. Somehow experiencing the reality doesn't quite hack it. You're 
asked to watch the "seismo-cam," as if Channel 4's gizmo had a life of its own, 
as if your emotions needed to be validated by a needle making scratchings on a 
sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weathercasts that use maps with moving parts? Gimmicks. When I was a kid in 
Kansas City, the top TV weathercaster was the guy with the biggest gimmick. 
Facing viewers from behind a clear, plexiglass screen, he'd have to write 
backward as he put up temperatures. Very cute. Naturally it made him a star, 
setting him apart from competitors who wrote normally. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was quaint compared with today's high-tech TV weather maps, which 
convey movement -- that's the point -- but not visual information that you can 
process. On KABC-TV Channel 7, while Dallas Raines is mentioning a high 
pressure ridge, blue dots are moving across his map. They tell you nothing 
except that blue dots are moving across his map. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers never engage in such stunts. Meanwhile, since you were, thanks for 
reading.

IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING HE SAID; RADIO: HARRY SHEARER CELEBRATES 10 YEARS 
OF 'LE SHOW' WITH A RECORDING AND TURNS OUT A MUSICAL, 'J. EDGAR.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a story humorist Harry Shearer loves to tell that inspired a satirical 
bit on his long-running syndicated radio program, "Le Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer built his own satellite dish and on it has watched and heard material 
not intended for public consumption. One such moment involved CBS newsman Dan 
Rather on a trip to Soweto just after the release of South African leader 
Nelson Mandela. The audio and video are running, but it is clearly not an 
official news segment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's 500,000 people chanting and dancing behind him," Shearer recounts. 
"He's crouched, hunkered down on the top of a flatbed pick-up truck and he's 
really uncomfortable. It's cold, he's not happy, doesn't like being on top of 
the truck. He's there because of the shot and he's just sitting there grousing 
for like 10 minutes and finally he says to a makeup lady, 'Question: I did not 
wash my hair last night because sometimes the stiffness helps, but the question 
now is should I wash it tonight? I guess that's something we're going to have 
to decide as we go along.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This snippet led to a "Le Show" bit titled "Dan Rather Gets His Hair Dyed," 
and has been included with 13 other parodies in a recording called "It Must've 
Been Something I Said," released this week to tie in with the 10th anniversary 
of Shearer's radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 The record also features a rap about the Rodney G. King beating, called "Cops 
With Attitude"; a spoof on the ethnocentric coverage of Olympic sporting 
events, called "Ice Tennis"; and a Madonnaesque composition called "Expose 
Yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Shearer has written, directed and co-starred in a theatrical 
production of his first musical, "J. Edgar," a story about former FBI Director 
J. Edgar Hoover and his relationship with his longtime assistant, Clyde Tolson. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical, produced by L.A. Theater Works and performed last Wednesday 
through Friday at Guest Quarters Suite Hotel in Santa Monica, was taped for 
broadcast and will air on KCRW-FM (89.9) this spring. KCRW is also the local 
outlet for "Le Show," Sundays at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is a pet project for Shearer, who had been tossing the idea around 
for several years with writing partner Tom Leopold. When L.A. Theater Works 
director Susan Loewenberg asked Shearer if there was anything he'd like to 
write and direct, he tentatively suggested a musical about Hoover.  
</P>
<P>
 Loewenberg was intrigued and gave him the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, all the public events in J. Edgar Hoover's life pass as if on a 
moving screen in the background of a very poignant love story," Shearer said. 
"So we conceived it as a pre-rock, pre-Lloyd Webber era musical." 
</P>
<P>
 The love story between Hoover, played by Kelsey Grammar, and Tolson, played by 
John Goodman, required the two television stars to sing love songs to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me do this right," the Hoover character says at one point as he gets down 
on one knee. "Clyde Tolson, will you be my lifetime assistant?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tolson responds in song: "How could a job title sound so romantic? / How could 
a promotion produce such emotion? / I feel so proud / Got to shout it loud! 
Lifetime Assistant." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer played reporter Walter Winchell while his Spinal Tap cohorts 
Christopher Guest and Michael McKean portrayed Roy Cohn and President Truman. 
Marian Mercer took the role of Hoover's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stay very cheap and tacky," Shearer said. "He's dead. We can exploit him. 
We're just having fun with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the 40 years he has been in show business -- since his start as a child 
actor on Jack Benny's radio show -- Shearer's career has been a model of 
eclecticism. 
</P>
<P>
 He assumed the film role of has-been rocker Derek Smalls in the mock 
documentary "This Is Spinal Tap" and has impersonated on his radio show such 
disparate figures as Dick Clark, Madonna and radio psychologist Dr. David 
Viscott. His versatile vocal cords are regularly heard in a variety of roles on 
"The Simpsons." He is also well known for his off-center bits and 
impersonations while a cast member on "Saturday Night Live " in the 1980s, and 
he co-wrote the film "Real Life" with Albert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer appears to thrive on juggling several projects simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of love what I'm doing at any given moment," he said over lunch 
recently at a Hollywood restaurant. "The closer what I'm doing is to what I had 
in mind when I started the particular project, the more I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shearer chose to write a play about Hoover because he was fascinated by the 
way the former FBI director devoted himself to gathering information about 
people's private lives, yet managed to keep his own so hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hoover is an easy target, Shearer often chooses less likely victims 
to lampoon in his weekly satires on "Le Show."  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to do what another guy's doing," he said. "I don't think you'll 
hear another person do Dick Clark in your lifetime. I don't limit my range of 
satire to the people I disagree with. I try to make fun of anything and 
everybody that's around." 
</P>
<P>
 It is that freedom to tackle anything and everything that has kept Shearer 
doing "Le Show" over the past decade. "I think it's a unique situation in show 
business because I have access to something that approaches a mass audience and 
yet nobody reads a script and nobody hears the stuff before it goes on the air 
and I never have a meeting afterward," Shearer said of the program, which is 
heard on about 70 stations nationwide. "It's just me and the audience. And the 
communications media serve the function that I believe they should, which is to 
connect us, instead of keeping us apart. It's kind of the reverse from the way 
the rest of this town works."

ASSISTANT CURATOR TO SPEAK AT BOWERS ON AFRICAN ART TRADE

 As a doctoral student in anthropology, Christopher Steiner surveyed studies of 
African art. He found a lot of attention paid to its original use in African 
society but not a word on how the works make their way to the art markets of 
Europe and America. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes that is at least partly because African art dealers and 
collectors would rather not acknowledge the economic side of their pursuit: the 
way in which ritual objects are transformed into commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner, now assistant curator of anthropology at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Natural History (and an adjunct assistant professor of art history at 
UCLA), will speak Thursday at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art about his 
studies of the transnational African art trade, and will screen a documentary 
film based on his research, "In and Out of Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Spending 18 months in the Ivory Coast in 1987 and 1988, Steiner studied the 
structure of the trade in African art objects, and the way in which economic 
value is conferred on objects by dealers, based on changing and subjective 
standards of "authenticity." A book expanding on his dissertation, "African Art 
in Transit" (Cambridge University Press), was published this week. 
</P>
<P>
 African art "exists in three different worlds," Steiner said in a telephone 
interview: the original world in which they were created and used; the "middle 
world" of the African traders, mostly Muslims who feel no connection to ritual 
religions and see the objects as economic items; and the world of American and 
European art markets, where "objects are treated as aesthetic items" divorced 
from their spiritual content. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studying the African art trade and the whole issue of authenticity raises 
issues of racism in this country," Steiner said, especially regarding attitudes 
toward the African traders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Collectors tend to view them as ignorant," Steiner said. "They call them 
'runners,' " people who "don't understand the aesthetic value of what they're 
carrying." In reality, Steiner said, the African traders are "very much aware 
of what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The film "In and Out of Africa" focuses on a single art dealer who travels 
from the Ivory Coast to New York with a cache of items, often inventing 
fantastic tales about the objects for dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour documentary was produced in 1991 by Ilisa Barbash and Lucien 
Taylor, based on Steiner's research, and has won numerous festival awards. 
</P>
<P>
 * Christopher Steiner will speak Thursday at 7:30 p.m. at the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art, 2002 Main St., Santa Ana. $5, museum members; $7.50, non-members.

AN ENSEMBLE OF THE PEOPLE AND BY THE PEOPLE; MUSIC: IN VIRTUALLY ALL RESPECTS, 
THE ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA IS SELF-GOVERNING. ALL POSITIONS ROTATE, AND 
THERE IS NO CONDUCTOR.

<P>
 You might say that the members of the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra still play 
musical chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rotate all seating positions in the orchestra," explained Julian Fifer, 
executive director of the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sections are absolutely interchangeable, and we rearrange seating for 
every piece. There is no such thing as being first violin player, or principal 
anything, in Orpheus." 
</P>
<P>
 That means four different seating configurations tonight at the Cerritos 
Center for the Performing Arts, where the group assays Boccherini's Sinfonia in 
D minor, "La Casa del Diavolo"; Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 18 in B-flat, with 
Radu Lupu as soloist; Alban Berg's Lyric Suite, and Dvorak's Serenade for Winds 
in D minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-member ensemble has played without a conductor since Fifer founded it 
in 1972. In virtually all respects it is self-governing; impermanent seating 
plans reflect the fact that artistic decisions are made by revolving 
committees, or core groups. In recording sessions, everyone crowds into the 
production booth to listen to the first playbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the New York-based Orpheus the French Revolution come to the arts, the 
embodiment of the democratic process in the music world? 
</P>
<P>
 Fifer chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it depends on your own political persuasions," he said. "In this 
country, people do view us as such an embodiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we tour, it's interesting how others react. In 1984 in Yugoslavia, 
they felt we were the ideal representation of socialism. On the same tour, in 
Romania, they were surprised that such an organization was permitted in the 
United States, because everything was run by the workers -- they saw us as the 
ideal Communist workers' collective! I don't know what other systems we could 
visit as an orchestra -- so far no one has viewed us as a dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is somewhat democratic," continued Fifer, who played cello with the group 
until deciding four years ago to focus on administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years we've had internal discussions about the difference between 
democracy and republics. One of our horn players, William Purvis, has a 
philosophy degree, and he's not sure we should refer to ourselves as a 
democracy because democracies tend to fall to the lowest common denominator, 
republics to the highest," he said. "We are always seeking the highest 
denominators in our work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, if it were really a democracy, the concertmaster wouldn't always be a 
violinist. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a hot topic with a couple of non-violinists!" Fifer said. "For certain 
pieces, it has been felt that the concertmaster could be the principal cellist. 
And some of us have said there should be a concertmaster of the strings and a 
concertmaster of the winds, which I suppose would be whoever's occupying the 
first oboe chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as expressing ideas, and providing interpretive leadership, I suppose 
it could be anyone," he said. "It could even be someone not playing in the 
group. But in terms of giving cues and interpretive impetus in performance, it 
really needs to be the violinist. The violins are out in front, and most of the 
time they have the leading melodic role." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, so change the seating! 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Orpheus' schedule includes up to 60 concerts and four albums for 
Deutsche Grammophon. Because the musicians themselves are responsible for the 
creative outcome of those efforts, Fifer feels that they take a 
greater-than-average pride in their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fifer also described some of the greater-than-average artistic hurdles the 
Orpheus has had to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because so many people are giving cues, at first there were problems when we 
performed larger pieces requiring additional strings, trumpets, timpani. . . . 
It was like trying to maneuver a trailer truck on a curvy mountain road," he 
said. "It took time to develop the flexibility to accommodate an orchestra of 
up to 40 players for certain recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge that always remains is to find the unified collective 
spontaneity that any one of us as individual artists exercise when we play 
sonatas or concertos." 
</P>
<P>
 Put more simply, it's being able to make the slightest gesture and have it be 
immediately and accurately interpreted by all the other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conductor has two arms available with which to suddenly urge the troops 
one way or the other," Fifer said. "With us, it's much more subtle because we 
have instruments in our hands. It's the nod of a head or bow arm. But some of 
the great conductors have shown us that very small motions can get very large 
responses." 
</P>
<P>
 So why all the bother? Weren't conductors invented for a reason? 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a conductor the musician never needs to choose between what he hears 
and what he sees," Fifer said. "(The orchestral chamber repertory) really 
becomes chamber music. Radu (Lupu) can talk directly to anyone, he can just 
say, 'Dave, would you mind playing it this way?' And it's obvious from the 
sound he makes the sound we all need to be making." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Orpheus Chamber Orchestra with Radu Lupu as piano soloist plays tonight 
at 8 at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. $28-$39. (310) 916-8500.

MUSIC / CHRIS PASLES; LOVE IN GOOD MEASURE; IT'S THE CHIEF EMOTION IN THE PIANO 
CONCERTO THAT ALAIN LEFEVRE WILL PERFORM TODAY AND THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alain Lefevre went right to the source to prepare for playing and recording 
John Corigliano's Piano Concerto this week with the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old French Canadian pianist sought out the composer and spent 
about six days over about the same number of months working with Corigliano in 
New York. As it turns out, the experience was a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to play music when the composer is still alive," Lefevre 
said in a recent break from rehearsing in Costa Mesa. "He knows exactly what he 
wants to hear, and the danger is that you will lose a kind of inspiration 
because you really want to do what he wants. That for me was kind of difficult. 
But finally, it came out very well." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Corigliano praised the pianist's interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alain Lefevre made me rediscover my concerto," he reportedly told a 
Radio-Quebec production team that is making a one-hour documentary on the 
pianist. (That documentary, which will incorporate the efforts of Lefevre, 
conductor Carl St.Clair and the Pacific this week, will be broadcast later in 
Canada. Thursday's concert, however, will be carried live locally on KUSC-FM 
91.5.) 
</P>
<P>
 Composed in 1967, the concerto has four, rather than the traditional three, 
movements, following the pattern of Brahms' Second Concerto -- an allegro, a 
scherzo, a slow movement and a finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth (movement) is an atomic bomb," Lefevre said. "John had told me 
that it had to be barbarian." 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist described the work as "a huge piece, 102 pages. A long concerto, 
like the Rachmaninoff No. 3, is (only) 81 or 82 pages," he said. "It took me 14 
months to put it together. The first Tchaikovsky concerto I put together in 
seven weeks, just to give you a comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 The music is "modern" and at the same time "classic in form," Lefevre said. 
"That means that if you make a false note, people will hear it." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief emotion in the work, he said, is "passion. It's love. John is a 
loving man, and when I talk about love, I say love, with a lot of violence, a 
lot of fight and a lot of Romanticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Love and passion are uppermost in Lefevre's mind right now, as he deals with 
the death three weeks ago of his father, a professional clarinetist, from 
cancer at the age of 62. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough time for me. I was very near my father," he said. "My father and 
mother were very health-oriented: No meat, no cigarettes, no coffee. Go to bed 
very early, no alcohol. All their life they fought not to have cancer, and 
(yet) cancer fell on my father." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre got the news of his father's death about 24 hours before a scheduled 
rehearsal with the Montreal Symphony for a program that ironically included 
Liszt's "Totentanz" for piano and orchestra, which is, Lefevre said, "the dance 
macabre" -- or dance of death. "I called my mom and she said, 'Alain, your 
father wants you to play.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude was typical of the man. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of his sons (there are no daughters, and Alain is the third son) are 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the dream of my father," he said. "For him, the first thing was not 
-- I'll say something terrible -- was not even his wife, but was music." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre was born in Poitiers, France, and moved with his family to Quebec when 
he was 3 so his father could begin teaching clarinet at the local conservatory. 
Alain Lefevre started studying piano a year later but didn't take to it at 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that you know that a young kid doesn't really want to work," he 
said. "I was a kid, and it was a very hard discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he won a contest when he was 5, and by the time he was 11 had "really 
decided to dedicate myself to work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 17, he went to the Conservatoire National Superieur de Musique de Paris to 
study with Pierre Sancan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sancan was the first French teacher to refuse the French technique," he said. 
"He was more interested in the German tradition. He also put a lot of the 
Russian technique and Russian power-piano in his technique." 
</P>
<P>
 What did he most get out of that study? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sancan was the kind of man who forced you to think. If you came to a lesson, 
his first question was, 'Can I see your music?' And then, if you hadn't put in 
the fingering, he would say, 'I don't want to hear you . . . ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre still writes in the fingering for all the notes, as his copy of the 
Corigliano score clearly indicates. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there are a lot of difficulties," he said, "I put two possibilities of 
fingering." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sancan, fingering was really a matter of creating "sonority," Lefevre 
said. "He said, 'The piano has to be an orchestra. You have a great orchestra 
in your hand, and you have to think about the voicing of the instruments.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre finished his studies at 21, taking first honors in piano, chamber 
music, analysis and other subjects. He began playing recitals with famed 
violinist Christian Ferras and concertizing in Belgium, Germany, England, Italy 
and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But all along he stayed in touch with Sancan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always called me to see if I was not doing what I call major mistakes in 
piano," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefevre still calls Montreal home ("I'm really a kid of Canada now"), although 
he said, "I don't spend a lot of time there (because) I'm traveling a lot now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Corigliano Concerto will be his first recording, and Lefevre sees it as an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is fantastic music. It's angel music," he said. "If you come with Chopin 
No. 1, people have recorded it so well that what can I add? You have to make a 
recording (only) when you feel you have something to say." 
</P>
<P>
 * Alain Lefevre will be soloist in John Corigliano's Piano Concerto with the 
Pacific Symphony led by Carl St.Clair today and Thursday at 8 p.m. at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Also 
on the program are Frank Ticheli's "Postcard" and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5.

EX-SPOUSE PLEADS GUILTY AND IMPLICATES HARDING; ASSAULT: GILLOOLY WILL GET 
2-YEAR PRISON TERM IN DEAL. HE URGES EX-WIFE TO CONFESS THAT SHE WAS PART OF 
PLOT EARLY ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Her Olympic status even more in doubt, Tonya Harding faced further 
incriminating accusations Tuesday as her ex-husband pleaded guilty and 
bargained himself a reduced prison term in the attack on her figure-skating 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gillooly, in a written statement, called on Harding to confess that she, 
too, was part of the misguided plot from early on. Gillooly's action was not 
without some spite, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the plea bargain presented in Portland court Tuesday, Gillooly 
will be sentenced to two years in prison and fined $100,000 in exchange for his 
admission of guilt to one count of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, he promised to assist prosecutors in convicting others in 
the Jan. 6 assault on Nancy Kerrigan. Prosecutors, in turn, said they would try 
to arrange incarceration in a federal prison. He was released until sentencing 
April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly's attorney, Ronald H. Hoevet, said he believed that would be the 
lightest sentence anyone would receive in the bizarre case, even though the 
26-year-old former warehouseman appears to be the central figure in the 
conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials speaking for Harding responded to the accusations by calling 
Gillooly a troubled man and denying his claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff Gillooly's accusations appear to evidence a continued practice of 
abusive conduct intended to disrupt Tonya Harding's life and destroy her 
career," said a statement from the skater's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the court proceedings Tuesday, prosecutors released 123 pages of 
selective FBI interviews with principal figures in the case. That offered the 
clearest picture yet of the attempt to alter the outcome of the U.S. women's 
national figure skating championships -- through the eyes of the conspirators 
and those they spoke with during December and January when the attack was 
planned, carried out and then clumsily covered up. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorities also revealed they suspected that the Harding camp was 
involved almost from the start, apparently thanks to an anonymous tip. 
</P>
<P>
 In his confession, Gillooly said he lied to investigators in Detroit the day 
after the attack. And attorney Hoevet said Harding also lied when questioned in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, from the time that Harding and Gillooly returned from the championships, 
which she won and in which Kerrigan was unable to compete, law enforcement 
investigators followed and videotaped the couple's every move. At the time, 
they were divorced but had reconciled and were living together. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding has not been charged with a crime. But recently she admitted learning 
of the plot after the fact and not reporting it to authorities. On Tuesday, she 
continued her workouts at a suburban shopping mall ice rink, stopping several 
times to ask news photographers not to use flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 County prosecutor Norman Frink announced Tuesday that he was extending 
indefinitely the grand jury probe into the case. "There is a prospect of 
returning indictments against additional persons other than those currently 
charged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two weeks after the attack, according to the FBI transcripts released 
Tuesday, Harding was questioned at length by local authorities and allegedly 
was caught lying. After she spent hours denying any involvement in trying to 
cover up the plot, an FBI agent finally "told Harding that he knew she had lied 
to him . . . that he would tell her exactly how she had lied to him." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, she adjourned for a conference with her lawyer and changed her 
story to say she had become aware of Gillooly's involvement and had not told 
the truth to a number of questions. She indicated that she was at Gillooly's 
side as law enforcement officials closed in on him. 
</P>
<P>
 She apologized to the FBI at the end of her interrogation and said: "I hope 
everyone understands. I'm telling on someone I really care about." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more incriminating is the disclosure of telephone conversations that 
Harding instigated with part-time figure-skating journalist Vera Marano, who 
writes for American Skating World in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FBI account: The journalist received a call from Harding 
about Dec. 27 inquiring where Kerrigan trained and where she lived. Marano told 
investigators that she was able only to locate Kerrigan's practice rink, the 
Tony Kent Arena in Dedham, Mass., and passed that along to Harding the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Marano said that Harding explained herself as having a bet with someone about 
Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Gillooly and two other men implicated in the case, Dec. 27 
and 28 were the dates when the final details of the attack were worked out in 
Portland. On Dec. 28, the suspected hit man in the case, Shane Stant, left 
Portland for Boston. He told authorities that he carried background information 
and a photograph of Kerrigan and instructions of how to reach the Tony Kent 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the attack was not done in Massachusetts, and Stant told 
authorities he went on to Detroit. He told investigators he hit the skater with 
a glancing blow on her right leg with a police baton "with approximately half 
his force." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this telephone record was revealed, nothing in the investigation -- 
except the word of the plotters themselves -- has provided anything to indicate 
that Harding may have been involved with preparations for the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on Gillooly's behalf, attorney Hoevet followed up his court 
appearance with a press conference in which he made several accusations about 
Harding's involvement. Portland colleagues said they were shocked that a 
defense attorney such as Hoevet would speak so strongly, as if he were 
prosecuting Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet read a statement designed to sum up the ex-husband's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key date is Dec. 28, 1993," Hoevet said. That morning, Gillooly met with 
Stant and the confessed get-away driver Derrick Smith. Also present was Shawn 
Eckardt, a friend of both Harding and Gillooly. He was once described as her 
bodyguard but now appears to be the go-between that brought Gillooly in touch 
with the other two men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya knew that the purpose of this meeting was to discuss how they could 
prevent Nancy Kerrigan from competing for the U.S. Women's Figure Skating 
Championship. Tonya dropped Jeff off at the meeting and picked him up after it 
was over. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . After the meeting, while driving toward home, Tonya approved of the 
plan that had been discussed and gave the OK for the assault on Nancy Kerrigan. 
The final decision was hers to make." 
</P>
<P>
 How did she express her consent? 
</P>
<P>
 "As I understand the quote, it's 'OK, let's go for it,' or 'OK, let's do it,' 
" Hoevet said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for motive, Gillooly told authorities that he and Harding were upset at her 
fourth-place finish at an early December international competition in Japan, 
and suspected that U.S. Figure Skating Assn. officials would favor Kerrigan at 
the Detroit competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly appeared in court Tuesday and spoke only in response to questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is your plea?" asked Presiding Judge Donald H. Londer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guilty," Gillooly replied. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not appear afterward at Hoevet's press conference, although his 
attorney said, "Jeff has a message for Tonya: He hopes that she will now do 
what he has done and move quickly to resolve the charges that will surely be 
brought against her." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoevet said he and Gillooly both hoped Harding would be disqualified from 
representing the United States at this month's Winter Olympics in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer conceded one point that could cast doubt on Gillooly's motives in 
lashing out at his ex-spouse. Hoevet said the former husband had been willing 
to take the blame for everything, but then learned that Harding had pointed the 
finger at him. In turn, Gillooly decided to implicate her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff was prepared to fall on the sword for Tonya," Hoevet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Tuesday, the response from the Harding camp was backed up by attorney 
Robert Weaver, who denounced the "self-serving spin" of Hoevet and said the 
skater would not respond "in the arena of public opinion, which, as we have 
seen today, is easily manipulated and frequently uninformed." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver added: "I'm frankly appalled that Mr. Gillooly's attorney has seen fit 
to immerse himself in this media whirlpool that threatens a hallowed system of 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly and Harding have conducted a stormy seven-year romance, which has 
included marriage, divorce, reconciliation, violent quarreling, calls to the 
police and judicial restraining orders. Recently, they had come together again. 
But Harding broke off the relationship on Jan. 18, the day she was interrogated 
by the FBI in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 In his plea bargain, Gillooly took responsibility for seven actual crimes, 
including conspiracy to commit assault, assault, destruction of evidence and 
perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Colorado Springs, a special panel of the U.S. Figure Skating 
Assn. met for the first time to review the case and decide whether Harding 
should remain on the Olympic team with Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the committee may speed their work and make a recommendation on 
Harding before their self-imposed Feb. 10 deadline, said Bill Hybl, the former 
U.S. Olympic Committee president who chairs the special panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Committee had no comment on Tuesday's events. However, Frank 
Carroll, coach for Olympic alternate skater Michelle Kwan, 13, said he has been 
in contact with U.S. skating officials and briefed on possible contingency 
plans in the event Harding is disqualified.

HOUSE UNIT ACTS TO BAR QUAKE AID FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; DISASTER: THE 
$8.6-BILLION AMOUNT BRINGS NO OPPOSITION. BUT DEBATE GROWS OVER WHO SHOULD GET 
THE ASSISTANCE AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's $8.6-billion earthquake assistance package took 
the first step toward congressional approval Tuesday but only after a key 
committee amended the measure to bar illegal immigrants from receiving housing 
grants and other longer-term emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Little opposition has arisen to the size of the emergency aid bill -- which if 
approved will be the largest in the nation's history -- but debate is growing 
in Congress over the contentious immigration issue as well as efforts to force 
budget cuts to pay for the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversies, proponents remain hopeful they can steer the 
measure to Clinton's desk by the end of next week. It contains funds to provide 
rental assistance and temporary housing for those displaced by the Northridge 
quake, loans for small businesses and homeowners, money to make public 
buildings more earthquake-proof, and aid to repair damaged freeways, schools, 
veterans hospitals and other public structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by California Republicans, the measure also appears destined to push 
the escalating debate over public benefits and illegal immigrants onto the 
national stage in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 After rancorous deliberations Tuesday, the powerful House Appropriations 
Committee adopted a modified version of a proposal by Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside) stipulating that no benefits can go to anyone "when it is known 
to the federal entity or official to which the funds are made available that 
the individual is not lawfully within the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would apply to aid dispensed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency -- which coordinates government response to disasters and administers 
emergency aid -- the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. As amended, it explicitly states that 
undocumented residents would still be eligible for emergency shelter as well as 
food, water, medical care and other "essential needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 38-12, with Democrats casting all the opposing votes. Renewed 
battles over the amendment are expected as the bill -- which passed 
Appropriations on a voice vote -- moves through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats on the Appropriations panel claimed that Republicans were 
seeking to score political points at the expense of illegal immigrants in 
desperate straits. But the issue deeply divided the Democrats themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Reps. Julian C. Dixon of Los Angeles and Esteban E. Torres of La 
Puente, both longtime liberals, said they brokered the compromise in a 
pragmatic attempt to forestall more severe measures and avoid likely defeat on 
the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard's amendment said an individual would be denied benefits when it was 
"made known" to the government that the person was in the United States 
illegally. The compromise amendment struck the word made, which some Democrats 
said would have raised the danger of third parties making allegations to 
authorities about someone's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Their alternative also explicitly spelled out the range of emergency services 
to which illegal immigrants would remain entitled. Packard had simply referred 
to "emergency medical assistance," although he said he had intended to include 
a wider range of short-term aid. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote, Dixon noted that the measure does not require federal 
officials to ask about an applicant's legal status. Nor, he said, would he 
expect agencies to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus, angrily derided the proposal as "immigrant bashing" and 
mean-spirited and said it would lead to discrimination against Latinos. Rep. Ed 
Pastor (D-Ariz.) complained: "It's a sad day that we as Democrats are going to 
have this shoved down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard, who has vowed to propose a similar amendment on each spending bill 
considered this year, responded: "My amendment simply says that illegal 
immigrants should not receive assistance they would not otherwise receive just 
because there was an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, who only hours earlier had vowed to oppose Packard's effort, said the 
Appropriations fight foreshadows confrontations on an issue that is very 
divisive for Democrats. Given the solid Republican support for the Packard 
amendment, he said he determined during a party caucus Tuesday that enough 
Democrats backed a limit on aid to illegal immigrants to "represent the 
majority interests in the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), advocates of other measures to stem illegal immigration, 
both voiced support for Packard's proposal in interviews. Feinstein said the 
federal government should not "be picking up long-term rent subsidies for 
illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Another leading restrictionist, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), 
said late Tuesday that although the amendment was not as strongly worded as he 
would have liked, it accomplished what he set out to do and he would not pursue 
his more restrictive proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, adoption of Packard's initiative was roundly condemned by 
immigrant advocate groups. And, on the streets, where relief agencies are 
struggling with day-to-day difficulties of aiding tens of thousands of quake 
victims, the amendment raised the specter of further complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're asking us in an emergency situation to implement something that will 
probably be difficult at best, and potentially disruptive," said Joe 
Schuldiner, assistant secretary of HUD. "You'd like time to think about it, 
but, obviously, we'll do what Congress wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the restrictions are passed and implemented, Los Angeles city housing 
officials emphasized that they will continue with current policies of providing 
housing assistance regardless of legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ask and we're not looking," said Steve Rehahan, the city housing 
authority official who is overseeing distribution of HUD housing vouchers to 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, there was immediate concern that withdrawal of U.S. aid for illegal 
immigrants could shift large post-quake costs to city programs -- notably a 
$2.5-million emergency housing grant program established after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could increase the pressure on our program enormously," said Barbara 
Zeidman, assistant general manager of the city Housing Preservation and 
Production Department. "And it threatens (quake victims) with a more permanent 
form of homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal housing officials predicted that it would not be easy to discern who 
is a legal resident. Because it does not ask aid applicants for proof of 
citizenship, FEMA has no record of the numbers of undocumented residents who 
seek aid, though some officials and legal aid groups maintain that the figures 
are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) called for a vote on 
whether to offset earthquake aid with reductions in spending in other areas -- 
a move that could make it more difficult to win passage of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) joined a bipartisan group of four 
congressmen pushing for $7.13 billion in cuts to fund the quake aid package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give all of the necessary aid to California earthquake victims as 
we did for the Midwestern flood and Florida hurricane, but there is no reason 
why we can't pay for that," Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Democratic caucus meeting, lawmakers said privately that they expect 
the Rules Committee today to incorporate the proposal into the aid bill. 
Administration officials said that some of the proposed cuts -- including 
trimming the federal work force by 252,000 -- are included in Clinton's 
cost-cutting proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration added to the earthquake package nearly $1.2 billion in 
funds for peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia, Somalia and elsewhere as well as $750 
million largely for additional costs of the Midwestern floods and the 1989 Loma 
Prieta earthquake.

EMOTIONS HIGH, VERSIONS VARY IN GIRL'S TRAFFIC DEATH; ACCIDENT: POLICE SEEK 
DRIVER OF CAR THAT STRUCK CHILD IN SOUTH-CENTRAL. WOMAN REPORTEDLY WAS ATTACKED 
BY A MOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six-year-old Rebeca Velazquez lost her life on South-Central's unforgiving 
streets, where justice often is elusive and truth comes in many shades of gray. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny first-grader, who had a penchant for Barbies, pink bows and braids, 
was struck by a car as she darted across Compton Avenue, anxious to find a 
bathroom while running errands with her father. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few explosive minutes in this mostly Latino neighborhood, an angry mob 
surrounded the black driver and peppered her with racial epithets. But the 
woman, thought to be in her early 30s, managed to slip back behind the wheel 
and speed away from the Sunday afternoon crowd. The next morning, doctors 
disconnected Rebeca's life-support machine. 
</P>
<P>
 It may never be known who the driver was, or whether she fled because of fear 
or guilt. The California Highway Patrol would like to question her, though 
officers said Tuesday they believe the incident was an accident. On this 
stretch of asphalt, flanked by auto shops, check cashing outlets and an array 
of unlicensed vendors, the version of events changes with each eyewitness 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the driver stepped out of her blue 1970s Chevrolet station wagon only 
after several men in the neighborhood noticed she had no license plates and ran 
to block her way. They recall her as aggressive, possibly intoxicated, with a 
tattoo on her neck, berating the fallen child for dashing into her path. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came out screaming, in English -- who knows what she was saying -- but 
she was angry and she wanted to run away," said Rosario Serrano, 58, who lives 
just a few feet from where Rebeca landed, in an apartment protected by an iron 
grate. "She was waving her arms trying to get away. They just wanted to hold 
her until the police could come." 
</P>
<P>
 Others insist the driver stopped voluntarily, but grew defensive after she was 
accosted by the menacing crowd. They remember about 30 men in the street, 
pushing her, tugging her shirt, shouting derogatory words. When she finally 
made it back to the safety of her car, where they say she had two small 
children, someone started hurling bottles and tried to chase her down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, they wanted to kill that black girl," said Jorge Luis Guzman, 27, 
manager of the nearby El Carnal muffler shop. "They tried to get her out of the 
car, to do something bad to her, they were so mad." 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of his welding bench a few storefronts away, Carlos 
Orduno offered another version. He saw negligence on both sides -- the driver 
for leaving the scene of a fatal accident and the girl's father for letting her 
cross a heavily trafficked street alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an error for that lady to go -- that was wrong -- but she was probably 
scared and it's natural for anyone to look out for their own safety," said 
Orduno, 53. "But I also don't think that girl should have been crossing the 
street. It was so sad to see that tiny little thing lying there, but I wondered 
how could her father have left her alone like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebeca's father, Hector Velazquez, sat Tuesday on a plastic-covered couch in 
the living room of his small bungalow in Watts, trying to make sense of the 
split-second that cost his daughter's life. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a sentimental girl, he said, pointing out a bedroom covered with 
frilly pink lace and a wall decorated with three wooden figurines spelling out 
"Hope, Charity, Faith." Often she retreated there to watch her Spanish-language 
soap operas in peace, or play with her prized Barbie, which is perched in the 
back of a doll-size horse-drawn carriage, her head shrouded in a pink 
polka-dotted veil. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, she understood well the rules of crossing the street. "She 
knew, she knew," said Velazquez, a 38-year-old forklift driver, as he comforted 
his wife, Ana Maria, and their 5-year-old son, Hector Jr. "I always told her, 
'Stop. Look both ways.' If she had seen a car, she wouldn't have crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, they had spent the day running errands, first dropping off his wife 
at a swap meet, then taking Rebeca's grandmother home. Before picking them up 
again, Velazquez s aid, he decided to stop at a catering truck in the Florence 
district that sells seafood prepared in the style of his native Mexican state, 
Nayarit. 
</P>
<P>
 He left the girl in the car, which he parked on the west side of Compton 
Avenue, just north of Gage Avenue. He crossed to the east side and placed his 
order, but began to question whether it had been a wise idea to leave Rebeca 
alone. As he stepped to the curb, he saw her wriggling uncomfortably outside 
the car, clearly needing to use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could say anything, she walked into the street. He swears she looked 
both ways, but the car slammed into her 65-pound frame before he could speak. 
The speed limit on Compton Avenue is 30 m.p.h., but CHP officers say they have 
no way of knowing how fast the southbound car was traveling. No paint or glass 
fragments were left behind and the skid marks are very light. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing at the scene to give us any indication of anything," said 
Officer Rick Rodriguesa CHP spokesman. The driver, who he said had been dressed 
in yellow, "doesn't appear to be at fault for anything. But we would like to 
talk to her, just to identify her and get a statement." 
</P>
<P>
 All Velazquez knows is that his daughter fell limp on the street. He raced to 
cradle her in his arms, but there were no visible signs of life. If someone 
could be held responsible, he said, it would be a small solace. But he knows it 
is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides," he said, his eyes red from tears and sleepless nights, "what would 
it solve? My daughter's dead, that's all. Now I have to bury her."

CLINTON NAMES DEVAL PATRICK FOR CIVIL RIGHTS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton nominated Deval L. Patrick, a Boston lawyer with extensive 
civil rights experience, on Tuesday to head the Justice Department's civil 
rights division -- a position that has been vacant for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, who led a successful fight against Clinton's first choice, 
University of Pennsylvania professor C. Lani Guinier, immediately branded 
Patrick "a stealth Guinier," prompting Clinton to question whether they were 
acting in good faith and to charge that they "don't give a rip about civil 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, 37, who like Guinier is black, grew up near one of the poorest public 
housing projects on Chicago's South Side. But he won a scholarship to a 
prestigious prep school and another to Harvard as an undergraduate and worked 
in Africa as a Rockefeller traveling fellow. He subsequently earned a Harvard 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as a clerk for Los Angeles Judge Stephen Reinhardt on the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 With those credentials, "he could have had probably any job he wanted with 
just about any law firm in America," Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said as she 
introduced him at a White House ceremony. Instead, she said, he chose to 
practice civil rights law with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, where he 
represented Death Row inmates and handled extensive voting rights litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight years, Patrick has worked for a top Boston law firm, where he has 
spent nearly a third of his time on pro bono public service cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick said that he is "humbled" by the nomination and feels as though he is 
"standing . . . on the shoulders of those courageous advocates of every type 
and kind who have had the guts to stand up in some court somewhere and give the 
Constitution life." 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Bolick, vice president of the conservative Institute for Justice, who 
led the criticism of Guinier by labeling her "Clinton's quota queen," issued a 
press release only hours before Patrick was formally nominated, saying that he 
"appears to be a stealth Guinier." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no paper trail," he said, referring to Guinier's extensive and 
controversial writings, some of which Clinton later disavowed. "But (he) is 
part of the same pro-quota chorus that produced Guinier." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton responded to the criticism with unusual bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that a lot of those people are going to be exposed, because they 
never believed in the civil rights laws, they never believed in equal 
opportunity, they never lifted a finger to give anybody of a minority race a 
chance in this country," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Stern, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, said that neither 
Patrick nor the Administration supports quotas as a means of achieving 
affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public is getting tired of distortions. Mr. Bolick is committed 
to gutting the civil rights laws. The fox shouldn't be choosing who guards the 
chicken house." 
</P>
<P>
 The responses to criticism of Patrick stood in sharp contrast to the 
Administration's less aggressive posture when Guinier was under attack. When 
Clinton eventually bowed to political pressure and withdrew her nomination, 
civil rights leaders openly condemned the Administration for failing to support 
her and for denying her the opportunity to defend and explain her views before 
the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would have conducted her confirmation 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's second choice, District of Columbia Corporate Counsel John Payton, 
withdrew in December after opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus over 
his failure to vote in local elections and his apparent unfamiliarity with a 
major voting rights case. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), former chairman of the caucus, 
praised Patrick as an "outstanding choice" and said that "his combination of 
credentials and life experience will be a boon to the (Justice) department." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's failure to fill the post has been viewed by critics as a failure to 
convert campaign pledges into action and has contributed to the appearance of 
disarray at the department, where Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann 
unexpectedly resigned Thursday, citing differences of style and chemistry with 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 An announcement of Heymann's successor could come by the end of the week, 
Administration sources said. The choices appear to include Charles F. C. Ruff, 
a former Watergate prosecutor and Justice Department official who was Reno's 
first choice for the job; Pentagon general counsel Jamie Gorelick, who helped 
guide Reno's nomination through the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Ronald K. 
Noble, assistant Treasury secretary for enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, a supporter of capital punishment, acknowledged at the White House 
ceremony that he disagrees with an argument Patrick helped advance to the 
Supreme Court that the death penalty should be struck down as racially 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno also opposes the death penalty, although she has pledged to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick litigated two cases with Guinier when both worked for the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. They had discussed the possibility 
of his nomination to the post, according to sources who know them both. Guinier 
was said to have expressed concern over the possibility that her friend would 
be "brutalized" by the confirmation process but hoped that he would take the 
job.

 President Clinton has decided to lift the 19-year-old trade embargo against 
Vietnam and could announce the move before the end of the week, according to 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which would mark a historic reconciliation step, follows a 
formal recommendation by Secretary of State Warren Christopher late last week 
after lengthy deliberations by the Administration over the highly emotional 
issue. The White House is expected to attach no conditions to ending the trade 
ban, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal signing ceremony will be delayed to give the Administration time to 
follow usual procedures and notify members of Congress of its plans. The 
President has sole authority to take the action, which will be accomplished 
through an executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo, which has prohibited all trade with Vietnam since the Vietnam War 
ended in 1975, has been relaxed slightly in recent months to permit some 
businesses to begin making contacts in the Southeast Asian country. Among those 
pressing for the move has been the Vietnamese government, which has been eager 
for the economic stimulus that trade with the United States would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 But word of the decision brought an angry reaction from Congress' chief 
opponent of normalization, Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), who has argued, along 
with some veterans group and family organizations, that Vietnam has not done 
enough to account for missing servicemen left behind in Vietnam after the war. 
Smith and his allies had hoped that the Administration would continue to 
enforce the embargo as a way to pressure the Vietnamese into doing more to 
account for missing American servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, I'm angry and I'm sad. But there's nothing we can do now. 
It's over," Smith said. He said that the decision appears to be "a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Legion, the National League of Families and other veterans and 
family groups have objected strongly to removal of the embargo. They have 
continued to lobby the White House against the move, and some representatives 
of the groups met as recently as last week with National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But intense pressure for a resumption of trade came from American businesses, 
including California concerns that saw the potential rewards of trade ties to a 
nation that has long sought them. And other Americans -- including some 
veterans -- have been eager for the United States to finally heal the last 
wounds of a war that divided Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last week, the Senate voted 62 to 38 in a non-binding resolution that the 
United States should end the embargo "as expeditiously" as possible. By 
providing some political cover, that lopsided vote made it easier for Clinton 
to make a decision that the Administration had long leaned toward. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet because it will enrage some veterans, lifting the embargo will still be 
politically difficult for Clinton: Like many others of his generation, he 
avoided the military draft. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,200 Americans are still listed as missing from the war, but officials 
have said that there are no more than a few dozen unresolved cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a leading proponent of normal relations with 
Vietnam and a veteran of the war, had not heard of the decision, a spokesperson 
said. Kerry and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war during 
the conflict, sought last week's vote as a means of encouraging Clinton to lift 
the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have made two special trips to Vietnam to discuss the issue, 
but their growing agreement in favor of ending the ban has been hinted at for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 One such hint came when Pentagon officials declared unreliable Russian 
documents purporting to show that Hanoi had held about twice as many U.S. 
soldiers as the 575 released at the end of the war. The Pentagon said its 
analysis showed that the documents contained many "exaggerations and 
fabrications." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington imposed a trade embargo against North Vietnam in 1964.

COLUMN ONE; BOUND BY 'THE CALL OF BLOOD'; DESPITE OFFICIAL CLAIMS OF NEUTRALITY 
AND HORRIBLE PAST DEFEATS, BULGARIANS ARE POISED TO DEFEND THEIR ETHNIC KIN IN 
MACEDONIA. SUCH FERVOR SHOWS WHY THE BALKANS' VIOLENT HISTORY IS COMPELLED TO 
REPEAT ITSELF.

<P>
 Dagger-wielding goatherds and vintners lugging 50-year-old hunting rifles 
stalk the Pirin Mountains, listening as they tend their flocks and truss 
denuded vines for the starting shot of a fifth ethnic bloodletting this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 The summons will not come from the military high command in Sofia. The 
government has vowed neutrality in the conflict destroying this land's Yugoslav 
neighbors. This peaceful pose has drawn Western plaudits for Bulgaria as an 
island of stability in a tempestuous realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither will it be the promise of victory and resolution of the century-old 
"Macedonian question" that would propel Bulgarians into the medieval savagery 
on their doorstep. Impoverished and politically drifting, Bulgaria could expect 
from the current conflict the same ignominious defeat it suffered after four 
previous wars for Slavic unity and territorial grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 But logic and strategy seldom wield much clout against nationalist passions in 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 If war spreads to Macedonia, explains would-be warrior Hari Mavrodiev, 
Bulgarians will be honor-bound to answer "the call of blood." 
</P>
<P>
 "We must go and defend our relatives if this war touches them," says the 
burly, mustachioed paramilitary commander outfitted in camouflage. "If war 
spills to Macedonia, every man in this region will go there to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The call of blood is a venerated principle by which the poor and backward of 
the Balkans live. The need to stand by ethnic brothers, no matter how doomed 
their fight, is the defining measure of nationalist dignity and a convincing 
explanation for why the region's violent history is compelled to repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials in the capital of Sofia assure Western leaders of their 
determination to stay out of the Balkan conflict, the Internal Macedonian 
Revolutionary Organization -- a turn-of-the-century terrorist group -- has 
reinvented itself as a quasi-legal nationalist movement. It is arming and 
training volunteers for battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrodiev and fellow activists in the group pay lip service to the official 
aim of staying neutral. But they readily concede all bets are off if any Balkan 
neighbor threatens the Slavs of Macedonia, whom Bulgarians claim as their kin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be among the first to protect Macedonia, because we are conscious of 
the fact that we would not just be protecting a new country but our own 
brothers," said Anatoly Velichkov, a revolutionary organization leader in the 
city of Blagoevgrad. 
</P>
<P>
 The brash, 29-year-old artilleryman disclosed that the group is engaged in 
paramilitary training. He said Bulgaria's loose, poorly applied gun-control 
laws pose little obstacle to the movement's drive to secure arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's women's councils are stockpiling food and clothing in the event 
Slav refugees from neighboring Macedonia begin to pour in, and to ensure 
rations are ready for men who go off to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The battles would be triggered, as Velichkov and others see it, by a series of 
events that would destabilize the region. Under these predictions: 
</P>
<P>
 * Serbs would spark the crisis by moving to ethnically cleanse Albanians in 
Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. 
</P>
<P>
 * In turn, Albanians in Kosovo, trying to escape Serbian aggression or gather 
arms and supporters for their fight, would seek refuge in the predominantly 
Albanian western half of Macedonia, disrupting the ethnic balance there; as a 
result, Serbian forces would be enticed into Macedonia to eradicate nests of 
Albanian resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarians then would rush to the defense of the 
Macedonians. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 1,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops, including 300 American GIs, are 
deployed along the Macedonian-Serbian border in an effort to stare down such an 
escalation. But the foreign soldiers, like 27,000 comrades deployed in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, are hamstrung with so restrictive a mandate 
they could do little more than watch, if the worst happens. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria was the first country to recognize Macedonia's claim to independence 
from the former Yugoslav federation roughly two years ago, hoping that 
according it statehood would protect the territory from Serbian or Greek 
adventurism, preserving it for eventual union with Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 But Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov insists that his 2 million citizens 
make up their own nation; Macedonians reject claims that their people and 
language are actually Bulgarian, and they are wary, at best, about Sofia's 
offers of assistance to them in the event of conflict with the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 This striving for a separate identity stirs the ire of nationalists like the 
17,000 members of the revolutionary organization and the larger mass of 
Bulgarian society whose unspoken aspirations for unity they represent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is too much tolerance for this principle of self-determination," 
insists Velichkov, who contends the Macedonian nation is an artificial creation 
of late Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito. 
</P>
<P>
 Velichkov believes war is coming and Bulgarian patriots must prepare for it. 
He says the outbreak is not imminent because Serbian nationalists are now 
pinned down by the struggle for Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fears of being drawn into the Balkan conflict undulate with the waves 
of butchery in Bosnia, where an undeterred Serbian land grab is fueling 
regionwide desires for territorial expansion and demanding resolution of what 
has been known since the end of Ottoman Turkish rule as the "Macedonian 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma arises from the search for political and national identity for a 
territory inhabited by at least eight peoples. Macedonia has had a name since 
antiquity but has seldom been united and never affixed with formal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 More a geographic distinction than a national entity, like the Great Plains or 
the Sahara, the land known as Macedonia reaches into three countries today -- 
northern Greece, this southwestern corner of Bulgaria and the entire former 
Yugoslav republic now bearing the name. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Balkans' diverse peoples seeking national definition in the 
post-Communist era, the expanse of Macedonia provides fertile ground for 
overlapping territorial claims and clashing nationalist sentiments and for 
reviving painful memories of ethnic slaughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, which covers about one-third of the 
geographic region, has angered Greece by adopting a name that Athens considers 
the property of Hellenic history. 
</P>
<P>
 Athens insists on referring to the newly independent state by the name of its 
capital, Skopje, and Bulgarians call it Vardar Macedonia, alluding to its 
principal river. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the Bulgarian portion of the territory known as Pirin Macedonia, 
extremists lay claim to the whole region, contending that the former Yugoslavs 
are primarily Bulgars and that Slavs were the majority in the Greek sector, 
known as Aegean Macedonia, before Athens expelled them after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Mihail Ivanov, adviser to Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev on ethnic and 
religious issues, concedes the clashing views of history could undermine the 
government's determination to preserve peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to consider the worst possible scenario. Bulgaria has taken part in 
two world wars and two Balkan wars this century. A third Balkan war would be 
devastating," he says, with resignation rather than alarm. In the event of 
fighting in Macedonia, "the Bulgarian government would oppose any involvement, 
but things would be out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Some academics in the region have lately expressed the view that Macedonia has 
little chance of surviving as an independent state -- comments seen here as 
fanning the hopes of neighboring nationalists lusting after its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanov sees another risk in partitioning Bosnia, in that it would strengthen 
the arguments of those who contend Christians and Muslims cannot live together. 
"This model of intolerance is being transplanted into the minds of Bulgarians," 
Ivanov says, warning that religious polarization is a potent danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Foreign Minister Dimitar Ikonomov sees the potential for a spread of 
the Balkan conflict as "very great" and cautions that the government's power to 
control extremists is limited. "We are trying to avoid being influenced by the 
demons of the past," Ikonomov says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as at the start of this century, Bulgaria is an often forgotten state, 
too economically troubled to forge Western alliances and too militarily weak to 
defend itself should the regional bloodshed worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conflict has been raging around us for three years now and everyone has been 
living in a state of war paranoia," Ikonomov says. "This has created a kind of 
vacuum that has to be filled." 
</P>
<P>
 The revolutionary organization and an even more ardently nationalist group, 
OMO-Ilinden, appear to be filling that vacuum. More than 1.5 million of 
Bulgaria's 8.5 million people claim Macedonian origin -- 350,000 from the Pirin 
area and many more from the Aegean region that suffered an earlier bout of 
"ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite 40 years of communism, nationalism has proved durable enough and 
attractive enough to interest the younger generation," said Evgeny Ekov, a 
portly 33-year-old who is part of the revolutionary organization's national 
leadership in Sofia. "Some people will defend Vardar Macedonia because of 
family ties, but others simply because they realize it is the right thing to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 As has become common in the war-ravaged Balkans, Ekov tends to see clear 
strategy in what is more likely gesture, interpreting American participation in 
the meager U.N. peacekeeping force for Macedonia as an ironclad guarantee that 
Washington will never let that republic suffer the same fate as battle-torn 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Most activists in the revolutionary organization expect the United States to 
protect Macedonia, noting that otherwise the whole of the Balkans will be drawn 
by cross-border ethnic links into the conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bulgarians are sensitive about Macedonia because a lot of Bulgarian blood has 
been spilled there," says Georgy Todev, a 73-year-old who spent a dozen years 
in prison for revolutionary organization activity while it was banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zhelev will do whatever he can to keep Bulgaria neutral, and I believe he is 
sincerely working for that," the white-haired revolutionary says, hoisting up 
his black wool sweater to reveal a pistol tucked into his belt. "But if the war 
spills over to Macedonia, Zhelev will not be able to do anything. No one will 
be able to stop us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's sorry history in past Balkan conflicts seems to weigh little in the 
minds of Pirin peasants, who have convinced themselves that 19th-Century battle 
tactics and weaponry that is scarcely newer will suffice in a faceoff with 
Serbian-led Yugoslavia, Albanian separatists or NATO-member Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 "No country can count on continuous military successes," Ekov says of the 
neighbor states that defeated Bulgaria in 1912 and 1913 Balkan bloodlettings 
and in both world wars. "We don't foresee a fifth victory by other powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that Serbs command the third-largest army on the Continent, Ekov 
contends that "nationalist energy can be channeled to make up for any technical 
inadequacies." 
</P>
<P>
 The revolutionary organization was founded in 1893 with the aim of reviving 
Bulgarian national consciousness after 500 years of rule by the Turks. In its 
first decade, it gained a reputation as one of the most ruthless terrorist 
groups in Europe as it ambushed, tortured and killed in a failed campaign for 
liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was its underground activity so well-organized and successfully masked 
as in this rugged mountain stronghold, known before World War II as Nevrokop. 
Gotse Delchev, a teacher, helped build a network of shadow governments, schools 
and other institutions in preparation for the day when revolutionaries would be 
able to drive out the Turks. Delchev was captured and executed even before the 
movement staged its ill-fated rebellion in 1903, but his efforts won him the 
respect of Slavs throughout Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonina Zhelyazkova, a specialist in Ottoman history who heads the 
International Center for Minority Studies and Intercultural Relations, says the 
dispute over Macedonia is an "invented problem," but one that has the potential 
to throw Bulgaria back into the carnage of Delchev's time. 
</P>
<P>
 She expresses confidence that no Bulgarian group, no matter how radical, will 
provoke fighting with Serbs, Greeks or Albanians. But if any of those forces 
invade Macedonia, "our nationalists would participate gladly." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhelyazkova sees trouble for Bulgaria in the event of Macedonian fighting, 
even if Bulgarians can somehow be compelled to stay within their own borders. 
Any influx of refugees would strain an already bankrupt social system and 
change the delicate balances in Pirin Macedonia's Orthodox and Muslim 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolutionary organization's unfettered, nationalist saber-rattling has 
already fueled antagonism toward Bulgaria's 1-million-strong ethnic Turkish 
minority by reviving Slav resentment of descendants of Ottoman occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrodiev, the self-styled revolutionary organization warrior, belabors claims 
that the Turks are trying to assimilate Bulgaria's Muslim Slav population, 
which, as in Bosnia, is a legacy of Ottoman rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoyan Boyadjiev, the revolutionary group's national president, also rails 
against what he calls Greek and Yugoslav Communist-era perfidy against the 
Bulgars, reciting statistics of post-World War II expulsions, executions and 
internment. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflammatory campaigns against rival religions and ideologies exacerbate 
fears of moderates that nationalism is strengthening its hand in deceptively 
placid Bulgaria. Those concerns are not eased by growing signs of extremist 
sentiment and intolerance that foretell another impassioned quest to reverse 
perceived wrongs against the Bulgarian nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the roadside wall of a whitewashed farmhouse in the nearby town of 
Melnik, someone has scrawled a warning in red spray paint that seems to express 
the belligerent spirit of Bulgarians poisoned by nostalgia and nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "God forgives," the graffiti read. "The (revolutionary organization) doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, The Times' Vienna Bureau chief, recently was on assignment in Sofia. 
Bulgaria at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Population: 8.5 million 
</P>
<P>
 Area: 42,855 square miles (about the size of Ohio) 
</P>
<P>
 Monetary unit: Lev 
</P>
<P>
 Language: Bulgarian 
</P>
<P>
 Religions: Eastern Orthodox, 27%; Muslim, 8% (atheist, 65%) 
</P>
<P>
 Economic activity: Processes agriculture, mineral, timber products; 
manufactures machinery, electronics. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of Bulgaria clearly bears the marks of the long strife in the 
Balkans: 
</P>
<P>
 First Bulgarians, horsemen akin to Huns, crossed Danube in 600s, subjugating 
Slavs in area but adopting Slavic dialect and customs 
</P>
<P>
 * After Serbs subjected their kingdom in 1330, Bulgars gradually fell prey to 
Turks 
</P>
<P>
 * From 1396 to 1878, Bulgaria a Turkish province 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1878 Russian forced Turkey to accord Bulgaria independence, but European 
intervention caused it to be made an autonomous state under Turkish 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha declared country independent, himself 
Tsar in 1908 
</P>
<P>
 * Bulgaria sided with Germany twice in the great wars, though it resisted 
sending its troops against Russia in World War II and briefly declared war on 
Germany before Russian troops streamed in. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Soviet-style republic was established in 1947 and Bulgaria became one of 
Moscow's most slavish satellites.

EXTENT OF DAMAGE DAUNTS HEART OF HISTORIC FILLMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY and SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have been the backbone of this town for decades. Passing their shops from 
father to son, they have kept their main street alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they have preserved a slice of small-town Americana so pleasant that 
movie crews flock there to recapture an era lost to tract homes and shopping 
malls. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with their grit tested to the limit, some business owners on downtown 
Fillmore's Central Avenue say they don't know if they can ever recoup what they 
lost two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No city in Ventura County was more devastated by the Jan. 17 earthquake than 
Fillmore, a town of 13,000 founded in 1888 on a railroad line from Saugus to 
Ventura. The worst of the city's estimated $250 million in damage was on 
Central Avenue, the heart of the downtown business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of this small oil and farm town say the city -- destroyed by fire in 
1903, swamped by flood in 1928, rocked by at least three strong quakes this 
century -- has the pluck to bounce back. But for now Fillmore is a town in 
mourning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing family," said gun shop owner Gary Creagle. "People are 
already coming up to me and saying, 'We miss downtown. What are we going to do 
without downtown?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Buffeted day to day by engineering reports that are ever gloomier, shopkeepers 
who spoke confidently of reconstruction a week ago are now wondering if they 
can afford $200,000 to $300,000 to rebuild. Because their buildings were made 
of unreinforced masonry, merchants were unable to get earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of a half-dozen buildings with 14 shops -- nearly all built of brick 
and mortar between 1910 and 1925 -- say they'll tear down their structures and 
not rebuild. They say they're too old to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Central Avenue's 55 merchants say they don't know where they will end 
up in the months to come. Nearly half of their shops are red-tagged as being 
too dangerous to enter. Most of the rest are marked as unsafe. A high wire-mesh 
fence keeps the public away. Visitors wear hard hats when surveying the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are finding out it's too expensive to rebuild. So it's like, 'Mark us 
red. We're outta here,' " said Janet Foy, whose flower shop has little damage 
but whose neighbors are increasingly distraught. "We've heard a few more 
negative things. Today has been a bad day." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as merchants mourned their losses and pondered reconstructions that 
do not pencil out, they said they love their small town and don't want to go 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 They like the fact that they graduated from the same high school as their 
grandfathers, that their moms jerked sodas at Clough's drug store and that the 
all-male Fillmore Club is reputed to have met for cards and meals at a 
second-story Central Avenue walk-up the second Monday of every month since 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 As crews entered cracked buildings to retrieve valuables last week, some 
merchants showed a resiliency that they say will bring Fillmore through its 
current trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the losses they face tear at the heart and soul of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Locals call the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater, at the precise center of the 
town's business district, "The Show." Its bright new red-and-white marquee 
still announces "Beethoven's 2nd," the last picture before the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only movie theater along the 50 miles between Ventura and Santa 
Clarita, it lured customers from miles around. But now a key wall has 
collapsed. Demolition is expected. And many residents say they regret the 
theater's passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the things that hurts me more than anything else," Fire Chief 
Pat Askren said. "A lot of little towns don't have their own theater. I'm going 
to miss it if it doesn't come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Show is important to a town like Fillmore because it had continued to draw 
not only teen-agers but old-timers who had once paid 20 cents to see its first 
talking pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there when the first sound movie came to town," said Harvey Patterson, 
74. "It was 'Hell's Angels,' and in the very first scene there was a plane 
diving at us with its machine gun going. Every kid hit the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 The theater still brought the young to town after dark and customers to the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 "People around here aren't real wealthy, and it's a nice source of fun. I 
don't know where we'd go otherwise," said Gabe Asenas, proprietor of the 
Fillmore Billiard Parlor, a teen-age hangout a few doors away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the owner of the Fillmore Theater building, Dale Larson, is 76 and not in 
a position to think about starting over. "Right now I'm just planning on 
demolishing the building and having the plot for sale," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, hope emerged that The Show might avoid demolition after all. City 
Manager Roy Payne said state preservationists insist that the theater is not 
beyond repair and have presented calculations that suggest reconstruction might 
be feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 What finally happens to the Fillmore Theater and other badly damaged Central 
Avenue businesses may depend on disaster aid. U.S. Small Business 
Administration representatives are in town handing out application forms, but 
no loans so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's getting more confused and frustrated as we go along," said Ron 
Stewart, 44, whose grandfather started Ballard Furniture 57 years ago. Stewart 
bought the building from his mother four years ago. His sister's manicure shop 
is one of his three tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart figures it would cost him perhaps $250,000 to rebuild, "so financially 
I would be better off to just tear it down and start over," he said. Of course, 
he said, he couldn't afford the mortgage on the reconstruction loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just sounds like a lot of us are going to be out a lot of money, or just 
out, period," he said. "I'd like to carry on. What else am I going to do? My 
life's work has been in this business." 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing heavily on Stewart, and on store owners close to the Fillmore 
Theater, however, is the question of what will happen to their businesses if 
the theater comes down. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Central Avenue stores have common walls, as was the practice 80 
years ago. The strength of one store relies on its next-door neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 When one building falls, the others are threatened in a domino effect, several 
merchants said. Darrell Garner's plumbing and hardware stores share a wall with 
Stewart's building. And Garner shares a wall with The Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater has dominoed me," Garner said. "I'm yellow-tagged now. They're 
letting me get all my stuff out of my store before they tag it red." 
</P>
<P>
 The same fate could befall Ben Aparicio, 44, whose building also abuts the 
movie house. After building his tax preparation business to 3,000 clients, 
Aparicio said he and a relative bought his 1918 storefront four years ago for 
$250,000. They invested another $50,000 in improvements last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the earth shook furiously in Fillmore, wiping out a lifetime of effort in 
seconds. Aparicio said he hopes to rebuild and save a building that has helped 
establish Fillmore's character. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all chose Fillmore because of the uniqueness of its architecture and its 
small-town feel," he said. "But if any improvement through demolition or repair 
will bring this building up to code, then I'm for it. It needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants along Central Avenue tend to agree. They realize what could have 
happened if the 6.6-magnitude, pre-dawn earthquake had occurred during business 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Fillmore city officials moved quickly last week to demolish old, 
unsound buildings and rebuild from there, state and federal authorities 
intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the city announced that it would tear down 14 buildings, including 
five Central Avenue structures that contain 13 different businesses. Included 
are the Central Market, the Fillmore Theater, the Fillmore health clinic, the 
landmark Masonic Building and a small structure next to it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, the state Office of Historic Preservation refused to allow 
any buildings to be razed, saying that its own inspections indicate that every 
Central Avenue structure can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 But building owners say they don't have the money for costly reconstruction. 
And state representatives acknowledge that ultimately they cannot stop 
demolitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be really changed when those buildings come down," said 
Santa Paula architectural historian Judith Triem, who recommended against 
demolition. "What was so good was that it was so cohesive. And when you take 
those buildings out, you have holes. And it's never really the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Fillmore's distinctiveness will be lost, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole valley -- Fillmore, Piru and Santa Paula -- is like a step back in 
time," she said. "It's like a time warp, really. It reflects a sort of 
frozen-in-time place that doesn't go much past the 1930s." 
</P>
<P>
 Several shops have reopened, and inspectors downgraded the danger of several 
others on Friday. Still, city officials say it could be 18 months before 
Central Avenue is fully recovered. And some merchants think that estimate is 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be back to normal, but it will not be done for three or four 
years," Robert Harmonson said. "Hopefully, in my lifetime I'll see it back the 
way it was a month ago."

VIACOM, QVC OFFER FINAL BIDS FOR PARAMOUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viacom Inc. and QVC Network submitted their final bids in the prolonged battle 
for Paramount Communications on Tuesday, but the offers were so close that 
neither emerged as the clear winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on closing market prices, QVC's cash-and-stock proposal was worth nearly 
$10.6 billion compared to $10.2 billion offered by Viacom, but Viacom has 
offered protection to Paramount shareholders that QVC eschewed. That protection 
-- coupled with Viacom's higher cash component and its pending merger with 
Blockbuster Entertainment -- may give Viacom the edge, Wall Street sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several top shareholders in Paramount -- which owns the Hollywood movie 
studio behind "The Firm" and "Entertainment Tonight," Simon & Schuster 
publishers and the New York Knicks basketball team -- agreed that the race is 
too close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street executives said it may not be decided until the Feb. 14 
deadline for shareholders to pledge their stock to Viacom or QVC. And even then 
it is possible that neither bidder in the $10-billion battle will walk away 
with 50.1% of the shares required under Paramount's auction rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "What scares me is, there's no substantially better bid. I can envision this 
thing with nobody getting 50.1%," one institutional investor said somberly. 
</P>
<P>
 Belatedly, Paramount tried Tuesday to head off that problem by proposing to 
QVC and Viacom that a victor will be declared if it wins 40% of the Paramount 
shares and has a 2% lead or more over the other suitor, sources said. But by 
evening, QVC had not agreed to the new terms and Wall Street executives said a 
company might balk if it fears it is losing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount board is expected to meet late this week in New York to consider 
the new bids before making its recommendation to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 To the dismay of many Wall Street speculators, Barry Diller, chairman of the 
QVC home shopping channel, kept his vow not to raise his offer above the bid 
submitted five weeks ago when the Paramount board opened its auction. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC also stuck to its long-held position that it does not need to offer 
Paramount shareholders any protection if the price of QVC stock declines in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 But QVC did reconfigure its bid by substituting $750 million in cash for 
securities it offered in its earlier proposal. To accomplish this, QVC said it 
would use $250 million in bank borrowings and another $500 million from the 
sale of QVC shares to BellSouth Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 By shuffling its bid, QVC now is offering $104 per share for 50.1% of 
Paramount, compared to Viacom's offer to pay $107 per share. But Wall Street 
has valued QVC's package of securities for the remaining 49% at a greater value 
than Viacom's securities, leading to the fluctuating -- and confusing -- 
"blended" values assigned to the two bids each day. 
</P>
<P>
 In its new bid, Viacom -- best known for its MTV and Showtime cable networks 
-- said it was improving a provision designed to protect shareholders against a 
decline in its value after the deal. Viacom also increased the value of its 
offer slightly by improving the terms of the securities it is offering 
Paramount shareholders for the remaining 49.9% of their shares. 
</P>
<P>
 If QVC wins Paramount, regional phone company BellSouth will wind up as the 
largest shareholder with a $2-billion investment and nearly 18.2% of the stock. 
BellSouth and QVC's other partners -- Comcast Corp., Cox Enterprises and 
Advance Publications -- have renegotiated an earlier agreement to buy QVC 
shares, which allows them to buy the stock at $52 per share, instead of $60. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diller insisted that control of QVC has not shifted, noting that BellSouth 
already had the option of acquiring up to 35% of QVC's stock under the prior 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of its latest commitment, BellSouth will not gain any additional 
seats on the QVC board and it will continue to operate as just one of the three 
votes in the voting trust agreement negotiated by the telephone company with 
Diller and Comcast. BellSouth's $2-billion pledge is contingent on winning 
Paramount; if QVC loses, BellSouth has a six-month option to purchase $500 
million of QVC's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller said QVC's directors deliberated all day before settling on the plan 
submitted just before Paramount's 5 p.m. deadline. "We made it just under the 
wire," the QVC chairman said, describing a global telephone hookup that 
included directors who were as far away as Switzerland. One key director, 
Comcast President Brian L. Roberts, participated from a heliport in Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, who turns 52 today, said QVC will make no effort to change its bid 
again, although he did not rule out the possibility that BellSouth or some 
other supporter will buy QVC shares in the open market to support the value of 
his company's shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis McAlpine, a co-director of research for Josepthal Lyon & Ross, said 
QVC's decision to raise the cash portion of its bid to within $3 of what Viacom 
offered means "cash is not a major factor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's a matter of wading through the stock and putting a value on that. 
Basically, you have to sit back and wait to see what happens to the stock. This 
is not a game for amateurs anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight started Sept. 12 when Paramount agreed to a friendly merger with 
Viacom. QVC made a counteroffer for Paramount eight days later.

NAVY GETS OK TO USE UNDERWATER EXPLOSIVES; ENVIRONMENT: FISHERIES PANEL 
APPROVES OFFSHORE EXERCISES TO TEST STRENGTH OF WARSHIPS. ACTIVISTS CONDEMN 
PLAN THAT ALLOWS FOR DEATHS OF PROTECTED SPECIES DURING BLASTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Navy plan to detonate underwater explosives west of the Channel Islands to 
test the strength and durability of warships was approved Tuesday by the 
National Marine Fisheries Service, a decision that could prompt legal 
challenges from environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning March 3, the Navy will have the authority to conduct the tests that 
could involve the "incidental take" or killing of some federally protected sea 
lions, seals and whales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy plans to detonate the explosives -- some as large as 10,000 pounds -- 
in waters of the Outer Sea Test Range, about 60 miles west of the Point Mugu 
Naval Air Weapons Station in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy will be able to conduct as many as 10 tests a year for a period of 
five years but must seek reauthorization yearly from the fisheries service. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisheries officials said they decided to grant the Navy's request because of 
safeguards in the testing procedure that call for extensive pre- and post-test 
aerial observation flights. The Navy also agreed that testing would be halted 
if marine mammals are found in the test zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The test zone is in the migratory path of gray whales, and marine biologists 
have noted four species of seals and sea lions and 17 species of whales in the 
area. All of these species are protected by federal law and some of them are 
listed by federal officials as endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased to be of assistance in providing additional monitoring and 
checkpoints so that our obligation to provide environmental protection for 
marine mammals is carried out appropriately while balancing our national 
defense obligations," fisheries service director Rolland Schmitten said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmitten added that fisheries service biologists have spent more than a year 
surveying the Point Mugu test range and have pinpointed three sites where 
marine mammals are least likely to be. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of local environmental groups say the approval of the 
testing program shows the federal agency's disregard for protecting the marine 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this coming down the tracks," said Alan Godley, a Ventura environmental 
activist. "I'm disappointed because I think this shows the Clinton 
Administration's real disregard for protecting the marine environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Maris Sidenstecker, co-founder of Venice-based Save the Whales, called the 
Fisheries Service decision "disgusting" and vowed to seek a legal injunction 
against the Navy before testing can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to do what we have to do legally to try and stop this awful 
program," Sidenstecker said. "There is too much on the line out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Alpers, a Point Mugu spokesman, said the fact that the Navy's permit 
provides for the incidental deaths of marine mammals does not mean that large 
numbers of deaths will occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because we have that authorization doesn't mean that there will be a lot 
of animals killed," Alpers said. "We have designed the testing procedure to 
very carefully prevent harming animal life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Cmdr. Frank Thorp, a Navy surface fleet spokesman in San Diego, said the 
test is part of a $35-million Naval trial program. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that initially the Navy will conduct the testing on one of its 
high-tech Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the John Paul Jones. The Jones is 
equipped with the Navy's Aegis weapons system -- a computerized system capable 
of tracking and engaging multiple targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials say that the testing program is of critical importance in 
determining the "survivability" factor of new vessels before they face combat 
-- specifically, testing ship hulls, electronic systems and the vessels' 
ability to protect their crews.

ON CALIFORNIA: EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DAY OF THE LOW BIDDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were about 50 of them. They wore hard hats of many colors and stood in a 
pack at a Cyclone fence. On the other side of the fence were the brick ruins of 
what had been the old Masonic Building. The hard hats squinted, gawked, asked 
questions. What about lawsuits? What about toxic materials? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," said a man in the center of the pack, "you are supposed to get it 
done. If something else happens, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. 
But right now, we just want to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 This man's hard hat identified him as Bert Rapp. He works for the city of 
Fillmore, and on this day he was conducting a sad little tour of his town. 
Fillmore (pop. 13,000) is located in the Santa Clara River Valley, about 50 
miles north of Los Angeles. Built by railroaders, nurtured by orange growers 
and oil well drillers, the town came of age after World War I, and its 
architecture and ambience seem frozen in that time -- a quaint, two-block 
downtown of brick; surrounding neighborhoods of fine California bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for Fillmore past. Fillmore present is a mess. Much of the town was 
wrecked by the earthquake. Damage has been estimated at $250 million, a figure 
that does little to convey the true sense of loss. For all the brave talk of 
rebuilding Fillmore, the first step will be to tear down structures that cannot 
be repaired. And this is what brought out the hard hats Monday afternoon. After 
the tour they would submit bids; to the low bidder goes the job of demolishing 
pieces of what had once been a town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a newspaper office up there," Rapp said, pointing to the rubble, 
"and there's about 20 years of documentation in it that we want to try and 
salvage, and also an antique safe the historical society wants. And we want to 
save all the brick that we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The contractors shook their heads. Plucking antiques and bricks from rubble 
would drive up the cost. A few put away their pencils. One got on his 
cell-phone to his office. He hung up and turned to a brother hard hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Want to bid on a building in West Covina?" he asked. "We got until 3 this 
afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 "How big is it?" the other said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty big. A Bank of America." 
</P>
<P>
 They left. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop was a pale green bungalow. The earthquake had flung it off its 
foundation. "We want to save that lamppost there," Rapp said. "Also there's a 
time capsule inside. We want to save that." The contractors snickered. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's in the capsule?" one asked the homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. "It was there when we moved in. After we rebuild, I 
plan to throw a party and open it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner was Roger Campbell, an auto mechanic and also Fillmore's mayor pro 
tem. A few days after the quake, he pitched a media fit, complaining to every 
camera he could find that Fillmore had been forgotten in the focus on 
Northridge. Similar complaints can be heard across the region, as attention 
ripples outward from the epicenter. The full reach of the earthquake remains 
uncharted, and nobody understands this better than the demolition specialists 
who were gathered on Campbell's lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Doug Mueller of Oxnard, said he'd been on 16 of these tours since 
Jan. 17: "All over the San Fernando Valley. Santa Monica. Parts of Greater L.A. 
Thousand Oaks. As far south as Long Beach. As far north as Summerland. The 
amount of damage is amazing. I don't think people are really grasping the whole 
picture yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tour visited only an initial batch of demolition jobs. There will be many 
such batches. At each stop the hard hats made notes, took pictures, kicked 
beams, calculated. "Two days," one surmised, poking with his foot at a rotted 
foundation timber of a house. "Mess it up one day, haul it away the next." The 
owner stood nearby, politely answering questions. No, the shed could go too. 
Yes, he would like to save the garage but, since it was so much trouble, go 
ahead, "take it down, take the whole thing down." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour ended at sundown, and the last to leave the last house was Rapp, the 
city engineer. He is a young, earnest man and, unlike the contractors, he knew 
the story of each house, each building. He knew the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who used to live here," he said, pointing to the splintered remains 
of a pastel pink Craftsman, "was one of those guys where everything had to be 
perfect. The floors, the drapes, the paint, everything perfect. And then, 
kaboom. Look at it. Crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mess it up one day. Haul it away the next. It's happening all over Los 
Angeles. A crazy time.

POCKET MOUSE PUTS PROPOSED RESORT ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE and LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday it has placed a small 
mouse on the emergency endangered species list, a move likely to delay a 
proposed $500-million resort on one of the few undeveloped coastal properties 
left in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Roberts, a botanist with the service, said the Pacific pocket mouse, 
rediscovered last year after not having been seen since 1971, "is part of 
California's natural heritage. They are an important part of the ecology." 
</P>
<P>
 Described as two-inch rodents that resemble hamsters, the pocket mice were 
found again during an environmental survey for the proposed resort to be built 
on the Headlands, 121 acres overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The development plan, which is opposed by local environmentalists, calls for a 
400-room hotel complex and 394 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey revealed that 39 of the rare mice were concentrated in four acres 
of coastal sagebrush at the site. The mice were once common up to two miles 
inland along the Southern California coast from Marina del Rey and El Segundo 
south to the Mexican border. The mouse is believed to be the smallest member of 
the rodent family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The urbanization of the coast all but wiped them out," Roberts said. "They've 
probably been at the Dana Point Headlands the whole time, but nobody's looked 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as scientists know, he said, the Headland's small population of Pacific 
pocket mice constitutes the last remaining community of the species in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency listing is "really an attempt to restore the natural balance of 
things," said Connie Babb, a spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the listing, which took effect Monday, developers will not be allowed to 
build without first convincing the service that development will not further 
endanger the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have to come up with a habitat conservation plan built into this 
project that would show it would allow enough room to satisfy the scientists 
that the species could survive there," Babb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emergency listing was not welcomed by the Headlands property 
owner, a spokesman said he was confident the mouse would not change the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly not happy about it," said Dan Daniels, president of the 
Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co., which owns the parcel along with the 
Chandis Securities Co. "It certainly slows down our ability to develop those 
(four) acres. The rest of the property, I would hope, would not be affected by 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Babb, the emergency listing will be in effect for 240 days, 
during which scientists will determine whether to recommend that the endangered 
listing be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Fortune, a spokesman for the local chapter of the Audubon Society, said he 
welcomed the listing as something that, while not likely to stop the project 
altogether, will probably delay it.

MALATHION SPRAYING MAY START TONIGHT; MEDFLY: COURT TO DECIDE IF AERIAL 
APPLICATION OF PESTICIDE WILL OCCUR IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN and JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by the city of Corona in an attempt to halt aerial spraying to 
fight an infestation of the crop-ravaging Mediterranean fruit fly is scheduled 
to be heard this morning by a Riverside Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless halted by the court, the controversial malathion spraying will start 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona city officials contend that widespread application of the insecticide 
would jeopardize public health. They also argue that the state failed to abide 
by its own regulations by not conducting an environmental impact report on the 
spraying and its effects. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have long maintained that, with the exception of short-term 
rashes in isolated cases, the aerial spraying of malathion does not cause 
health problems. They say quick action is needed to prevent the pest from 
spreading to other agriculture-rich regions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, since Gov. Pete Wilson signed an emergency declaration because of the 
presence of the Medfly in Corona, state officials say no environmental impact 
report is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a delegation of local officials testified in Sacramento on Tuesday 
before the Senate Agriculture Committee on the spraying controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 They said malathion could be harmful not only to people but to pets and 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take your cat or dog indoors," said Corona Councilman Dick 
Dreininger. "But horses and sheep don't fit in your living room very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona City Manager Bill Garrett said he has no confidence that "we are being 
told the truth. And there is a lack of consistency in the information that we 
do receive." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Supervisor Melba Dunlap urged the state to divert sterile 
Medflies being used in Los Angeles County, or at least combine aerial spraying 
with ground spraying to minimize the impact on residential areas and livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry Voss, director of the Department of Food and Agriculture, said there 
are not enough sterile Medflies to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have enough sterile Medflies," Voss said. "You can't get to the top 
of the trees (with ground spraying). You don't get good coverage. Some people 
aren't home, their yards are locked up, and there are dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Rick Kreutzer of the Department of Health Services and Dr. Jim Stratton of 
the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment said malathion spraying 
does not pose a substantial health risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is the health risk of malathion?" asked Sen. Robert Presley 
(D-Riverside) during Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exceedingly low," Kreutzer replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would you do if your kids were sprayed?" the senator asked.

CLINTON CALLS ON HOSPITALS TO BACK HEALTH PLAN; REFORM: HE TRIES TO BLUNT 
CRITICISM OF HIS PROPOSAL. HE SAYS RIVAL PLANS FAIL TO ADDRESS THE 
INEFFICIENCIES OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton, trying to head off criticism of his health plan's 
complexity, declared Tuesday that insurance rules have made the current system 
a bureaucratic nightmare that "in his wildest dreams, Rube Goldberg never could 
have designed." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before separate meetings of governors and hospital officials, 
Clinton made his most specific criticism yet of rival plans offered by Rep. Jim 
Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R. I.). And as he tried to rally 
hospitals to his cause, he scolded members of Congress for not bothering to 
study his plan closely or to examine his adversaries' proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing you need to do," he told members of the American Assn. of 
Hospitals, "is to make sure the people in Congress know how the system works 
and what these various approaches would do if they were passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's forceful language came amid a flurry of critical new 
industry-sponsored TV commercials and congressional appeals for compromise on 
health reform. In his comments on the system's complexities, he was responding 
to complaints that have received new prominence since Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.), answering Clinton's State of the Union Address, brandished a 
flow-chart with a diagram of the Administration's proposed health bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton tried to signal that he remains open to negotiation. At the 
session with the National Governors' Assn., Clinton spoke of the need to forge 
a consensus. Later in the day, he even praised Dole for conciliatory comments 
that the Republican had made at the meeting with the governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Through its paperwork requirements, the insurance industry has created a 
system in which "it is impossible for hospitals to do their jobs," Clinton 
said. "No other country in the world is burdened with it and we should not 
tolerate it any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the system enables insurance companies to "slam the door on 
anybody who isn't healthy enough to get covered." That system, he said, is 
"irrelevant to the fact that we have the highest quality care in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Without mentioning them by name, Clinton criticized the Cooper and Chafee 
alternatives for proposing to begin taxing health benefits without taking steps 
to correct the inefficiencies of the existing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the 20-year stagnation of American wages, Clinton asked: "Why take 
something away from hard-working people before you squeeze the system and its 
unconscionable burdens on hospitals, doctors, nurses and the American people 
themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's bill would prohibit employers from taking tax deductions on benefits 
to workers above a specified level. Chafee's measure, in contrast, would impose 
the new tax burden on employees, not employers. 
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal to the hospital administrators, Clinton sought to mobilize a 
powerful group that has been split on health reform but could become an 
important counterweight to the insurance and drug industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I implore you to take this debate to Congress, get beyond the rhetoric, get 
beyond the ideology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiding lawmakers, he quoted an unidentified member of Congress lamenting that 
"I have no idea how to get my colleagues in the Congress to take this issue 
seriously and spend all the time it would take to absorb it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton took up again the question of whether health care is in crisis, as 
reform advocates have argued, or is only faced with problems, as some 
Republicans have maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton called the matter a "big linguistic battle." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited what he said are signs of a crisis: a steadily rising number of 
uninsured, small business insurance premiums that average 35% higher than those 
of larger institutions, uncompensated hospital health care expenses that have 
grown to at least $25 billion annually, exploding costs of the Medicaid health 
program for the poor and rules that set lifetime limits on 75% of insurance 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, whose plan has been criticized as a threat to jobs, tried to turn the 
tables with an anecdote about a South Carolina woman whose small business was 
threatened by the current health system. The woman, suffering from diabetes and 
arthritis, had seen her insurance rates rise to $305 a month, though she took 
home only $205 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doctors told her to give up her business and go on disability but, calling 
herself a "proud American," she resisted the idea. "I think we should heed her 
call for help," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has signaled his willingness to compromise on most points, Clinton 
warned against any move toward incremental reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to do it now," he told the hospital executives. "And what we have to 
do includes providing guaranteed private insurance to every single American." 
</P>
<P>
 "What normally happens around here is that everybody gives their speeches and 
then we have Washington-style reform where we tinker at the edges. . . . That's 
what we've been doing for years," he told the governors. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless all are covered, he said, inequities will remain for the states, 
for the hospitals and for individual Americans.

FIFTH AMENDMENT: NO LONGER A SHIELD AGAINST GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is not what it used to be 
-- as Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) and others have learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1975, the U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that a person suspected of 
having committed a crime can be forced to turn over all manner of incriminating 
evidence: fingerprints, hair samples, business records, a desk calendar and 
even the pages of a private diary. That is so because in the last two decades, 
the high court has shrunk the Fifth Amendment to the narrow meaning of its 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is regularly referred to as the right against self-incrimination, 
the Fifth Amendment actually says: "No person . . . shall be compelled in any 
criminal case to be witness against himself." 
</P>
<P>
 As such, the amendment does not "serve as a general protector of privacy," the 
high court has said. Rather, it only "protects against compelled testimony, not 
the disclosure of the private information." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that view, the justices have rejected claims from taxpayers and 
corporate officials who resisted turning over their private records. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on the same narrow view, U.S. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson last week 
squarely rejected Packwood's claim that he has a Fifth Amendment right to 
refuse to turn over his private diary. The Senate Ethics Committee subpoenaed 
the diary as part of its investigation of charges that Packwood sexually 
harassed several female employees. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: Before 1975, the Fifth Amendment stood as one barrier to 
government intrusion into a person's private life, including his or her 
personal papers. Then, the high court regularly invoked the amendment as 
forbidding "the compelled production of personal papers and effects." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is abhorrent to the instincts of an American," the court said in the 1886 
case of Boyd vs. U.S., that prosecutors may seek to convict someone of a crime 
"by compelling the production of his private books and papers. . . . It may 
suit the purposes of despotic power, but it cannot abide the pure atmosphere of 
political liberty and freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 But that strict standard was whittled away in a series of tax and business 
cases. While taxpayers may have thought their records were private, officials 
of the Internal Revenue Service thought otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1975, the high court majority suggested the 19th-Century view of the Fifth 
Amendment was outdated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several of Boyd's declarations . . . have not stood the test of time," 
Justice Byron White wrote. If a government's demand "does not compel oral 
testimony," it does not violate the Fifth Amendment, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, the court revisited the issue, and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor 
concluded that "The Fifth Amendment provides absolutely no protection for the 
contents of private papers of any kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Fourth Amendment also limits "unreasonable searches and 
seizures," but that privilege is voided whenever investigators have probable 
cause to believe a crime has been committed. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTCOME: Most judges and legal experts now say that the Fifth Amendment's 
shield against self-incrimination is quite limited. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Rothstein, law professor at Georgetown University, adds a cautionary 
note: The Supreme Court has not officially ruled that a purely private diary 
can be subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could still say that something as intimate as a diary is like a dialogue 
with yourself and should be protected on that basis," he said of the justices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the high court's recent action has renewed speculation that the issue is 
already settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, lawyers for a New York stockbroker under investigation appealed a 
ruling requiring him to turn over a notebook he carried around in his breast 
pocket. It included social engagements and notes for a private diary. The 
"private contents of a personal document" should be protected from disclosure, 
the lawyers argued. 
</P>
<P>
 However, without a dissent, the high court refused to hear his appeal.

IF IT SLITHERS, SWIMS OR FLIES, HE'S AFTER IT; TODD OF THE JUNGLE MAKES HIS 
LIVING ROUNDING UP THE WILDEST FUGITIVES IN SOUTH FLORIDA. SOME EVEN BECOME 
PETS.

 Todd Hardwick doesn't do dogs and cats. He does buffalo. He wrestles baboons. 
He pries stubborn six-foot Asian monitor lizards from unlikely hiding places, 
fires tranquilizing darts at monkeys looting a house, drags angry alligators 
away from back doors. 
</P>
<P>
 He does snakes. You might have seen him do his largest snake, a 22-foot, 
250-pound python he pulled from beneath a house in Ft. Lauderdale about four 
years ago. That capture was re-enacted for television's "Rescue 911" and has 
been rebroadcast several times. Hardwick and the snake, Big Mama, also showed 
up as Johnny Carson's guests on "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick, 30, is an urban animal trapper, and the jungle he works is South 
Florida. Although the semitropical climate has always made this a fertile 
breeding ground for exotics -- escapees and those deliberately turned loose -- 
Hurricane Andrew in August, 1992, really blew open the doors. Miami's Metrozoo, 
the University of Miami's primate center, Monkey Jungle, Parrot Jungle and 
several other breeding facilities were in the storm's path. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of animals out there," Hardwick says. "At least 500 monkeys 
are unaccounted for, and of course people just release pets they don't want 
anymore. Take snakes, for example. In South Florida, they thrive. A python or 
boa constrictor can grow three to four feet a year, so in five years you've got 
a monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick, who is a lithe 130-pounder himself, lives for those monster calls. 
As the owner of Pesky Critters Nuisance Wildlife Control, he doesn't mind being 
awakened in the middle of the night when a herd of buffalo break through a 
fence and start to roam the Florida Turnpike, or when a dozen wild hogs are 
tearing up a historic bay-front estate, or when a cougar is terrorizing a 
neighborhood. He's actually received those calls. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hardwick makes his living capturing more common species who are making 
pests of themselves: raccoons using the swimming pool as a toilet, opossums in 
the attic, squirrels in the chimney. Last year, corralling back yard nuisance 
animals gave him an income of about $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hardwick has taken on another role. He has been named the official 
nuisance alligator trapper for Florida's two southernmost counties, stretching 
from Miami to Key West. Last month he was called to Big Pine Key to haul 
Grandpa, an 11-foot, 600-pound gator, out of a sinkhole after incessant feeding 
by tourists had made it dangerously gluttonous. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Grandpa was a celebrity, he was relocated. Usually, however, nuisance 
gators must be destroyed. Hardwick's pay is the gator. A 10-footer, reduced to 
hide, meat, skull and teeth, can be worth about $450, Hardwick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's dangerous work. Hardwick has been hospitalized twice, both times 
after contracting blood poisoning from a relatively minor animal bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardwick lives in South Dade County with his partner and girlfriend, Jill 
Voight, in a menagerie of their own making. On their seven-acre lot are dozens 
of parrots, two South American ostriches, called rheas, a muntjac (a small 
Asian deer) and two pet alligators, Sawgrass and Wally. Inside the house the 
exotic theme continues in crafts and furniture made by Voight: lamps are 
blowfish with light bulbs inside; glass-topped coffee tables are cages for 
monitor lizards, red-foot tortoises, Colombian iguanas and Tokay geckos. 
African hedgehogs live in a TV cabinet; you can see them through the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hardwick doesn't catch domestic animals, sometimes he will help out. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, he offered advice on stopping a pack of dogs that was terrorizing a 
Coral Gables neighborhood, but he was listening for his pager to go off, hoping 
for a run-in with something more exotic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circus is in town," Hardwick said. "You know, I've got darts that will 
stop an elephant or a hippo even, so if one gets away and starts heading down 
U.S. 1, I'm going to get the call. And I'm prepared. I can catch anything."

SMOKING WHILE YOUNG TIED TO COLON CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two studies involving more than 150,000 people show that cigarette smoking can 
lead to colon cancer and that smoking at a young age apparently fixes the risk 
for life, even if the smoking habit is dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "With colon cancer, if you smoke in your 20s, that risk stays with you," said 
Dr. Edward Giovannucci of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the Channing 
Laboratory and the Harvard School of Public Health."Even if you stop at age 40, 
you'll still be at greater risk." The risk also is "dose related," he said. 
"The more you smoke, the more the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies show that stopping cigarette smoking at any age, however, does 
lower the risk of heart disease, lung cancer and other disorders, Giovannucci 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The colon cancer conclusions are based on a Harvard School of Public Health 
study of 47,935 men and a Brigham and Women's study of 118,334 women. Both 
studies used questionnaires to determine the smoking history of participants 
and then related that to the rate of colon-rectal cancer in the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The parallel studies are to be published today in the Journal of the National 
Cancer Institute.

WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS PLAN TO FURTHER CLEAN U.S. WATERS; ENVIRONMENT: PROPOSALS 
WOULD REWRITE AND EXPAND LANDMARK 1972 FEDERAL ACT. CUTTING FLOW OF REMAINING 
TOXICS IS TERMED 'THE HARD PART.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, grappling with what it called "the hard part" of 
water pollution control, on Tuesday unveiled a series of initiatives designed 
to improve the quality of the nation's waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 In its broadest terms, the plan would streamline regulations, increase federal 
funds available to towns and cities and reduce the use of some toxic 
pollutants, such as chlorine, by American industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The package of proposals, which must be weighed by what appears to be a 
largely receptive Congress, would extend the life -- and the reach -- of the 
1972 Clean Water Act, a landmark piece of environmental legislation that has 
dramatically cut the flow of industrial waste and toxins into American waters. 
Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, called 
that "the easy part." 
</P>
<P>
 But with 38% of the country's lakes, rivers and estuaries still too polluted 
for swimming or drinking, the Administration has designed a plan to attack 
still-unregulated sources of pollution. Those include agricultural runoff and 
municipal waste-water facilities that spill raw sewage into lakes and rivers 
when rain or melting snow cause them to overflow. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would cost Americans roughly $70 billion a year to implement, an 
increase of roughly $6 billion over current spending by towns, cities and 
businesses on water pollution control. But Administration officials insisted 
that Americans will save if the package is adopted by Congress: Browner said 
that the changes would cost Americans $30 billion less to implement than would 
the law in its current form. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake in the debate is the health of rivers, lakes, estuaries and wetlands 
throughout the nation. Roughly 1,300 bodies of water have become so polluted 
that state authorities have had to limit public consumption of fish and 
shellfish that live in them. 
</P>
<P>
 While 20 years of controls have stemmed the flow of toxic chemicals into the 
water by major industrial enterprises, farmers and smaller industries continue 
to pour 740 million pounds of toxic chemicals into waterways and municipal 
sewers each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such pollution causes as many as 3.2 million cases of intestinal disease 
yearly and is widely believed to contribute to cancer, nervous disorders and 
birth defects, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the potential for these more serious effects, the Administration asked 
Congress on Tuesday to approve a federal study that would recommend whether and 
how to substitute, reduce or prohibit the use of chlorine in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlorine and related compounds, which are used at lower levels to clean water, 
are thought to lead to the creation of dioxin, which has been linked to birth 
defects and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups and several key lawmakers hailed the Administration's 
proposal. But environmental groups expressed concern that the government's 
willingness to give states new latitude in enforcing anti-pollution measures 
might allow some polluters to escape censure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.), chairman of a House committee that will help 
draft a new Clean Water Act, also warned that existing federal funds will not 
be enough to pay for communities to improve their water facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Studds gave the Administration what he called a "friendly nudge" to adopt a 
proposal under which the federal government would raise $4 billion in new 
environmental taxes on commercial and industrial water users and the makers of 
pesticides, fertilizers and animal feed. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the diffuse sources of pollution such as agricultural runoff and 
storm overflow, the new legislative proposal would give states almost eight 
years to implement pollution controls to reduce farm runoff. The proposal also 
would make federal money available to states to fund activities designed to 
reduce pollutants from fields and storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 While such aid has been provided in the past, the federal government has 
placed strict limits on the types of projects that can be undertaken with the 
money. But under the Clinton plan, states also would be given new latitude in 
parceling out federal funds to communities. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, for instance, the funds could be used to create wetlands, 
to promote water conservation or to experiment with agricultural programs that 
use fewer toxic pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to step up enforcement of anti-pollution laws, the Administration 
also will ask Congress to make federal facilities such as Energy and Defense 
Department installations subject to all Clean Water Act provisions and to allow 
citizens to sue the government for violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under another proposal, citizens would be permitted, within five years, to sue 
water polluters for past violations even if the polluter had come into 
compliance. A recent Supreme Court decision had severely curtailed citizens' 
right to sue under such circumstances.

 Declaring that "U.S. help is vital," the leader of the political wing of the 
Irish Republican Army called on the Clinton Administration on Tuesday to help 
break the deadlock in negotiating a settlement of the conflict in Northern 
Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an urgent need to break the current deadlock and to move the 
situation forward towards a negotiated settlement and a lasting peace," Gerry 
Adams told a conference in Manhattan examining the chances for peace in 
strife-torn Ulster. "The U.S. government can assist at a wider level by 
actively seeking to encourage dialogue and agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, head of the Sinn Fein party, proposed that the Administration turn its 
attention to Northern Ireland, just as it worked to facilitate peace in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused British Prime Minister John Major's government of "bad faith and 
double-dealing" by declining to clarify its position, put forth in a joint 
Irish-British peace plan announced in December. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton, who approved giving Adams a 48-hour visa to 
attend the conference in the hopes of hastening the peace process, declined 
immediately to be drawn into the complex dispute. "The people who have to 
resolve this are the Irish and the British," the President said. "I think he 
(Adams) should also support the work being done by the prime ministers of both 
Ireland and Britain in pursuing the peace." 
</P>
<P>
 British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, also in Washington, attacked Adams as 
a "master of ambiguity" who has never renounced violence in Northern Ireland. 
"He has the influence to end the violence by the IRA," Hurd told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the Administration to grant Adams a visa after he was turned 
down eight times clearly upset senior British officials, although they reacted 
mildly in public. "The principles involved are pretty clear," Hurd said. "It is 
a contrast between terrorism and democracy. And I think I know which side of 
that argument the United States is basically on." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a 45-year-old former member of the British Parliament, is barred from 
speaking on radio and television in Britain because of his role with the IRA. 
His day in New York was one of maximum American media exposure, though minimal, 
if any, progress on the peace front. 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared widely on television, stressing that the ball "is very firmly in 
the British court." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, whose father was an IRA member who was shot by police in 1939 and 
imprisoned twice for his activities, emphasized that he wanted Ireland and 
Britain to agree on the principle of self-determination for all of Ireland in a 
time frame to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that December's framework for peace announced by Britain and Ireland 
was only an initial step. He wanted further clarifications, adding, "the issue 
of self-determination is central to the resolution of the conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan offers Sinn Fein equal treatment with other political parties in 
Northern Ireland, provided it renounces violence and the IRA lays down its 
weapons -- a point Hurd once again stressed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This can't be fudged," the foreign secretary said. "If there is going to be 
peace, and if Sinn Fein is going to take its part among the constitutional 
parties discussing the future of Northern Ireland, there has to be a permanent 
end to the shooting and the bombing. They have to accept the ballot rather than 
the bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed repeatedly by reporters, Adams said he would not urge the IRA at this 
time to lay down its arms. "I lean on no one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, he said Sinn Fein was committed to a peace settlement 
and was "anxious" to be persuaded that the Downing Street Declaration signed by 
Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds could provide the basis for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams added that, even if this were not the case, "we should all move to 
bridge the gap." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Committee on Foreign Policy, a private group, had hoped major 
participants in the Northern Ireland struggle would attend its New York forum 
and that progress might result. Some 40 members of Congress, spearheaded by 
Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), had 
urged the Administration to grant Adams a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conference was not inclusive: Two prominent politicians -- the Rev. 
Ian Paisley, the extremist Protestant leader, and Ulster Unionist Party head 
James Molyneaux -- declined, declaring they would not associate with 
"apologists for terrorism."

RUSSIAN SAVERS GET A SYMBOLIC BREAK ON LOSSES; INFLATION: WITH PRICES SOARING 
234-FOLD, THEY'LL RECEIVE ONLY THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF RUBLES THEY HAD ON 
DEPOSIT IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin has signed a decree aimed at compensating Russians 
for savings wiped out by the raging inflation of the last two years, Russian 
television announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure will be little more than symbolic, and ordinary Russians 
seemed to react with bitterness, not gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Depositors will receive three times the number of rubles they had in accounts 
in the Russian Savings Bank on Jan. 1, 1992, when prices were decontrolled. But 
prices have risen about 234-fold since. 
</P>
<P>
 This means a person who in 1992 lost 450 rubles -- then the price of a washing 
machine -- will get 1,350 rubles, which is not enough to buy a gallon of milk 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The populist compensation measure, long demanded by conservatives and 
Communists, will cost about $705 million. A government spokesman said the sum 
may not satisfy everyone, but it is all the government can afford without 
dangerously increasing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several new economic reports released Tuesday, Yeltsin's 63rd birthday, show 
the Russian economy continuing its fast downward slide. Industrial production 
fell 25% in January compared with the same month last year, the Russian State 
Statistics Committee reported. And the ruble plunged sharply as fears that new 
government spending will worsen inflation spurred another rush to buy dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, an agency released the first comprehensive survey of 
unemployment in Russia, showing a real jobless rate of at least 15% and 
predicting an even sharper rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The official Russian unemployment rate is between 1.5% and 2%. Only a fraction 
of the jobless even bother to register themselves as unemployed, because their 
monthly benefit is less than $7. Most have no reserves to fall back on, after 
2,600% inflation in 1992 evaporated their life savings overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's decree was apparently intended to give at least moral compensation 
for the losses, if not to soothe the economic pain that led to the stunning 
defeat of "shock therapist" reformers in December parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 But the indignant and bitter reaction Tuesday evening indicates that rather 
than appease people who lost their life savings, the paltry restitution may 
instead only remind them of how much they have lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 10,000 rubles in my savings account. I could easily have bought a car," 
said Leonid Y. Koshelev, a 43-year-old army officer. In late 1990, a mid-size 
Russian-made Zhiguli cost about 8,000 rubles -- and Koshelev was near the top 
of the long waiting list to get one. But by the time his turn came, it was 
March, 1992, inflation was running 2,600% a year, and Koshelev's rubles would 
no longer pay for the car he had saved to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree states that pensioners and invalids may collect their compensation 
beginning Tuesday, but others will have to wait until July 1, by which time 
inflation will probably have eaten away still more of its value. 
</P>
<P>
 Koshelev will qualify for 30,000 rubles, worth $19.23 after Tuesday's plunge 
in the ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I do now with 30,000 rubles that I still have to wait six months to 
get?" Koshelev said. "I doubt I will be able to fill up my old car three times 
with that. This is all . . . hot air. It is simply rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
 Two economists who support Yeltsin predicted the decree would generate nothing 
but "indignation and irritation," as one of them, Pavel G. Bunich, put it. 
"People will line up, collect their money and say they have been tricked," 
Bunich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Vasily I. Selyunin, who won a seat in Parliament in December on a 
pro-Yeltsin ticket, called the president's new decree "costly and stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will make people even angrier, and play into the hands of Communists, 
Agrarians and even (extremist Vladimir V.) Zhirinovsky," Selyunin said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bureaucratic twist, Yeltsin signed the decree Dec. 24 but for unexplained 
reasons it was not published until Jan. 29, when it appeared in the Rossiskaya 
Gazeta newspaper. The paper has a small circulation, and the decree went 
unnoticed by the rest of the Russian media until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin first promised to index savings while campaigning for an April, 1993, 
referendum, but after the election he backed off from the pledge his advisers 
opposed as costly and inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Communists and nationalists continued to raise the issue and used it as an 
example of what they said was the government's disregard for the welfare of the 
people and of Yeltsin's own broken promises. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least one voter, the promised restitution does put the issue to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is small, but at least it is something," said Aza G. Perfilieva, 70, who 
will receive $7.69. "They could have given us nothing, and we would not have 
complained."

DEVIL GETS HIS DUE IN JAPANESE NAME UPROAR

<P>
 The Family Court on Tuesday granted the wish of a 30-year-old snack shop 
operator who wanted to give his son a Japanese first name no one would forget: 
It ordered the Akishima city office to register the boy as Akuma (Devil). 
</P>
<P>
 Shigeharu Sato and his wife, Ayako, 22, agreed that their first child, who was 
born July 30, should have that unusual name.But when they tried to register it, 
as is the law here, officials balked. 
</P>
<P>
 Their case, which attracted widespread attention, brought into question 
whether the government could apply its widespread practice of "administrative 
guidance," or intervention without specific legal authority, even to the 
process of naming children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Court, in effect, said it could -- but ruled in favor of Sato on a 
technicality only. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle may not be over, however. City officials said they plan to seek the 
Justice Ministry's intervention.

THOUSANDS OF SIKHS PROTEST CLINTON'S WORDS ON PUNJAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse thousands of angry Sikhs who 
burned President Clinton in effigy Tuesday to protest his published remarks 
about their troubled homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The marching demonstrators, estimated by police to number 15,000, were halted 
by three lines of barricades about a quarter-mile from the U.S. Embassy. When 
they tried to force their way through, police charged them with metal-tipped 
sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 After some marchers kept surging forward, officers opened up with 
high-pressure water hoses and tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The carefully organized protest was swollen by 250 busloads of pro-government 
Sikhs brought from Punjab by India's ruling party to show support for the 
government's position in its struggle with Sikh militants. Since the early 
1980s, Sikh separatists have battled the government for the establishment of an 
independent homeland in Punjab, the breadbasket state in northwest India that 
is the cradle of Sikhism. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration was the third, and largest, in New Delhi to be aroused by a 
diplomatic unpleasantness that most Americans likely have not even heard about. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 27, Clinton wrote a letter to U.S. Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) that, 
according to the Indian press, mentioned "chronic tensions between the Indian 
government and Sikh militants" and the need to safeguard "Sikh rights" in 
Punjab, where Sikhs make up 60% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House dispatched another letter bearing Clinton's signature to a 
Washington lobby for Kashmiri separatists, saying Clinton was ready to work 
with the group to find a solution to the insurgency raging in the Indian state 
of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensitive Indian press learned of the letters and, to the bewilderment of 
many U.S. officials, raised a storm cloud of protest, seeing in them tangible 
proof that Washington was meddling in the country's internal affairs -- or, 
worse, was intent on breaking this fractious country apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foreign Office then displayed its displeasure by issuing a statement 
saying it was "not ready to accept external prescriptions" on human rights and 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 India's ambassador to the United States, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, met on Jan. 
24 with Assistant Secretary of State Robin Lynn Raphel in Washington to object 
to what he termed Clinton's provocative and unacceptable remarks, according to 
the Indian press. 
</P>
<P>
 New Delhi's reaction -- especially to the letter on Kashmir, which to American 
eyes appears noncommittal and which knowledgeable Indians say was probably 
drafted by a low-level clerk and signed by machine -- revealed how tentative 
U.S.-Indian ties remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is, in fact, a new recognition here that the U.S., while not an 
outright enemy, can no longer be depended on as a dependable ally," concluded 
New Delhi commentator Ajoy Bose. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have a clue how Washington works," was the acerbic conclusion of 
one high-ranking American diplomat here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, after the protesters were doused and gassed, a 30-member 
delegation including three members of Parliament and the leader of the Punjab 
branch of India's ruling Congress Party was allowed to present a letter to the 
U.S. Embassy criticizing Clinton's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, quoted by the United News of India agency, pointed out that Sikhs 
enjoy equal rights with majority Hindus under the Indian constitution.

EASE REPRESSION OR LOSE FAVORED TRADING STATUS, U.S. WARNS CHINA; RIGHTS: 
BEIJING IS CHALLENGED TO GRANT MORE FREEDOM FOR ITS PEOPLE BEFORE JUNE 
DEADLINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reinforcing recent diplomatic warnings, the Clinton Administration declared in 
its annual human rights report Tuesday that China has taken only limited steps 
to ease repression of its people and must make more "significant, overall" 
progress to retain most-favored-nation trading status. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, Washington challenged the Beijing regime to take dramatic measures 
to increase political and personal freedom before June, when President Clinton 
must decide whether the United States will extend most-favored benefits again 
to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the thriving exporter lose the coveted status enjoyed by most U.S. 
trading partners, it would be forced to pay higher tariffs on most goods sent 
to this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business groups want to continue the present trading relationship, 
despite widespread concern over Beijing's human rights failings. But the 
President and majorities in the House and Senate have insisted on linking trade 
privileges with China to an improvement in the nation's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Administration's apparent hard line, however, Human Rights Watch, 
an advocacy organization, criticized the report, contending that it "gives 
China more credit than it is due, particularly in the areas of prison labor and 
religious persecution." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual report, first issued in 1977, is compiled from reports from U.S. 
Foreign Service officers, private organizations, journalists and other 
observers and now assesses the status of human rights in 193 countries. For the 
first time, it includes an extensive assessment of how the rights of women are 
observed around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In its review of China, the report said that fundamental human rights 
safeguards in the Chinese constitution frequently are ignored in practice, 
while challenges to the Communist Party's political authority are often dealt 
with harshly and arbitrarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department said that Chinese security forces are responsible for 
widespread torture, forced confessions and arbitrary detentions and that the 
government has failed to account for thousands of people who were detained 
during the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tien An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
 While Beijing took a few positive steps by releasing some political dissidents 
and allowing others to leave the country, the report said, it did not go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Chinese) government's overall human rights record in 1993 fell far short 
of internationally accepted norms as it continued to repress domestic critics 
and failed to control abuses by its own security forces," the report said. "In 
1993, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of political prisoners remained under 
detention or in prison . . . (while) physical abuse, including torture by 
police and prison officials persisted, especially in the politically restive 
regions with minority populations." 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights, underscored 
the official line in a news conference, saying: "The report certainly shows a 
continuing climate of repression of political and human rights in China. China 
in no way meets the standards set out by the President." 
</P>
<P>
 In presenting the document to Congress on Tuesday, State Department Counselor 
Timothy E. Wirth praised China for releasing several prominent political 
prisoners but issued a warning meant to be heard half a world away by the aging 
Communist leadership: "The Chinese government must demonstrate, over time, 
steady and substantial benefit in human rights" to retain the most-favored 
status that nearly all other U.S. trading partners enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go," Wirth added, suggesting that the United States 
would require annual reviews of human rights gains in China before extending it 
trade benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) said that he is concerned that the report 
might be "whitewashing egregious Chinese crimes." But California Rep. Tom 
Lantos (D-Burlingame), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on 
international security, international organizations and human rights, said he 
is persuaded that most-favored status will be revoked unless China makes major 
changes in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the report predictably indicated that Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Haiti, 
North Korea, Sudan, Zaire and Cuba are among the most repressive regimes in the 
world. But in a somewhat surprising development, the State Department declared, 
"There are no known political prisoners in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 The report contained some criticism of longtime U.S. allies, including Turkey, 
Mexico, Thailand and even Israel, along with detailed accounts of repression in 
Africa, the Middle East and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most damning indictments of summary executions and other 
misconduct by police and military forces were directed at Serbia and the 
Bosnian Serbs, who were accused of waging a "brutal campaign of terror -- in 
which acts of genocide took place" to establish an expanded Serbian state. But 
it also reported Bosnian government atrocities, chiefly against Bosnian Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 The report noted that "positive human rights developments" occurred in Israel 
last year, with court decisions that expanded prisoners rights and placed more 
restrictions on the Israeli practice of demolishing the homes of Arab prisoners 
convicted of terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 But, citing what it described as "credible sources," the report also said that 
undercover security units disguised as Palestinians were responsible for the 
deaths of 27 Arabs in the occupied territories in the first 11 months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were "credible reports" that Israel "in some cases tortured 
Palestinians during arrest and interrogation, utilized undercover units 
implicated in extrajudicial killings" and otherwise followed a "harsh" policy 
in dealing with Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 While coercion used to force confessions from Palestinian suspects was far 
less severe than the torture common in the prison systems of many other Middle 
Eastern countries, the report said, Israel's interrogation practices violate 
internationally accepted norms and include "forced standing or tying up in 
contorted positions, prolonged exposure to extreme temperatures, blows and 
beatings, confinement in a small space (and) sleep and food deprivation."

MEXICAN REBELS AGREE TO TALKS

 Southern Mexico's Indian rebels agreed Tuesday to peace talks with the 
government, a month after their uprising began. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions for negotiations have been met," stated a two-page statement 
distributed to local media and signed by "Subcommander Marcos," the name that 
has appeared on all communications from the rebels.The statement did not 
specify a time or place for the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Government peace negotiator Manuel Camacho Solis characterized the 
communication as "an important advance." 
</P>
<P>
 In previous communiques, channeled through Samuel Ruiz, bishop of the city of 
San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas state and a noted Indian rights activist, 
the rebels had said they would be willing to talk only after: 
</P>
<P>
 * The army observed the cease-fire declared by the government on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Camacho publicly recognized the Zapatista National Liberation Army, as they 
call themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruiz was named mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to meeting those conditions, the government has declared a general 
amnesty for all those involved in the conflict, which started New Year's Day 
when rebels took control of four county seats in Chiapas, on the border with 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, 38 Indians held by the state government on charges related 
to the conflict were released on bail paid by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic reforms and Indian rights are among the reasons the guerrillas, 
thought to number about 2,000, have given for their rebellion, which has 
claimed more than 100 lives.

BOUTROS-GHALI SHIFTS BLAME OVER BOSNIA; BALKANS: THE U.N. CHIEF POINTS TO 
NATO'S AUTHORIZATION PROCEDURES AS THE SOURCE OF HESITATION. HE SAYS HE CAN'T 
SIMPLY ORDER AIR STRIKES.

<P>
 Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, in a rare news conference, insisted 
Tuesday that NATO -- and not the United Nations -- is at the core of the 
hesitation over using punitive and strategic air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 With this assertion, the secretary general sought to shake himself free of 
what he believes is a false image of him as the main obstacle to the use of air 
power in the Bosnian conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali said officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had 
informed him that their planes were authorized only to provide "air support" -- 
immediate measures in defense of U.N. peacekeepers under attack in Bosnia. The 
planes, Boutros-Ghali continued, were not yet authorized by the NATO council to 
engage in "air strikes" -- strategic measures such as the bombing of a bridge 
or an airport and punitive measures such as the bombing of troops several days 
after they had attacked U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 In line with this, Boutros-Ghali last week gave his special representative in 
Bosnia, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, authority to call on NATO for air support 
should U.N. peacekeepers fall under attack during the weeks ahead while trying 
to relieve Canadian troops now trapped in Srebrenica and open the airport now 
besieged in Tuzla. 
</P>
<P>
 But the secretary general said that, although a Security Council resolution 
gave him the mandate to call for both NATO air support and NATO air strikes, it 
would do him no good to call for the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not at the end of the chain of command," he said. On the matter of air 
strikes, that falls on the North American and West European governments that 
make up NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "So even if you will ask tomorrow (of) NATO, please do an air strike, they 
will have to take a decision which will have to be adopted by the council of 
NATO, and, as you know, the council of NATO takes a decision by unanimity," the 
secretary general said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali, a former Egyptian diplomat and professor of international law, 
does not like to meet formally with the U.N. press corps. His news conference 
was the first at U.N. headquarters in more than a year and only the third since 
he took office in January, 1992. In the 45-minute session, dominated by 
questions about Bosnia, he also: 
</P>
<P>
 * Announced his opposition to the lifting of the embargo that prevents the 
Bosnian Muslims from buying weapons on the world market. 
</P>
<P>
 * Confirmed that Croatian soldiers had crossed the border into Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Made a plea for continued negotiations for a peaceful settlement even while 
hinting that the major powers would have to come up with a new approach to the 
Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 * Predicted that countries like the United States, now wary of peacekeeping 
operations, would someday embrace the idea that these are the world's best 
means of maintaining peace and security. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of the arms embargo, Boutros-Ghali put himself squarely against 
the Clinton Administration, which has advocated lifting it to help the Bosnian 
Muslims defend themselves. The secretary general called this "a negative 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask my personal advice," he went on, "I believe that this can be 
dangerous because it will provide more arms in the region and it may open to a 
real war in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali said that, though it is rarely mentioned, a major aim of the 
international community was to "contain the dispute inside the border of (the 
former federation of) Yugoslavia" and "avoid a war in all the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the Croatian incursions into Bosnia, the secretary general said he 
did not yet know whether the soldiers were regular Croatian troops or 
"volunteers." In any case, he made it clear he was disturbed by their arrival, 
adding that it would be up to the Security Council to decide what to do about 
this new development in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general, without giving any details, hinted several times that 
moves were afoot to develop a new approach to Bosnian peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly in the next few weeks we will have to have a general reassessment 
of the situation, because many member states are thinking to withdraw their 
troops from Bosnia," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the secretary general emphasized there was little choice beyond a slow 
negotiating process. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many U.N. officials have been infuriated by President Clinton's 
decision to withdraw all American troops from Somalia by the end of March, 
Boutros-Ghali painted the new reluctance of Clinton to take part in 
peacekeeping operations as a universal problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not peculiar to the United States," he said. "Many other countries 
have the same problem. They are hesitating. Why must I send my kids to be 
killed for a peacekeeping operation in a very difficult place (when) my public 
opinion won't accept this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our role is to convince them that it is in their . . . national interests to 
participate in these kind of operations, that . . . in the next few years we 
may have more and more ethnic wars and more and more small confrontations. 
These confrontations can spread like a disease all over the world."

SARAJEVO SIEGE CREATING CITY OF SUICIDAL CHILDREN, U.N. FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost two years of Serbian rebel bombardment of Sarajevo has created a 
community of suicidal children who have grown convinced they have no future, 
officials of the U.N. Children's Fund said Tuesday in an alarming report on the 
war's youngest victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the children surveyed claimed to have been in a situation in 
which they feared they were about to die, UNICEF officials reported after 
interviewing 1,505 children in this besieged capital. Almost all of them -- 
97.3% -- had lived through shelling of their immediate neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority reported they had witnessed a killing or maiming, that they had 
been shot at by snipers and that their homes had been attacked or damaged 
during the war. One often-expressed fear that agency officials say is unique to 
this crisis is a belief among many children that their lives will be ended by 
freezing to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a generation that has become numb to danger, warned Rune 
Stuvland, the U.N. agency's psychosocial adviser for the former Yugoslav 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents also interviewed as part of the study conducted last summer claimed 
they now see their children taking foolish risks with personal safety because 
they have become convinced they will die anyway and "they just don't care 
anymore," Stuvland reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some children are exhibiting suicidal tendencies -- not actively attempting 
suicide but taking extreme risks," said the specialist in trauma psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sarajevo was a developed, relatively affluent city prior to the siege, 
its residents have proven more vulnerable to the horrors and disruptions of 
protracted violence than more scattered, rural populations affected by 
conventional wars in Third World countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 37% of the children interviewed said a member of their immediate family 
had been killed or wounded in the war; 23% had been expelled from their homes 
as part of this war's signature, horrific act -- "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take much imagination to realize these experiences have severe 
impact on children as they are growing up," Stuvland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are supposed to grow up making plans for the future," he added, 
noting that Sarajevo's children have stopped thinking beyond the difficulties 
of each day under a destructive bombardment that has continued undeterred for 
22 months. "They actually live with the belief that their future is gone, that 
tomorrow it may be their turn to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the resignation he said has come over many children, others 
reported severe depressive reactions and physical traumas. One-third reported 
frequent stomachaches, which agency social workers say are probably 
psychosomatic; 22.5% said they feel life is not worth living. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 1,500 children have been killed in Sarajevo alone since Serbian 
nationalists rebelled against Bosnia-Herzegovina's vote for independence in 
March, 1992. There are no accurate figures available for the percentage of 
young among the 200,000 reported dead or missing throughout the embattled 
republic, but the majority of victims have been civilians.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; U.S. PLAN TO CUT AID TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
JOLTS MANY; ASSISTANCE: THE PROPOSAL WILL DISCOURAGE NEEDY APPLICANTS, SOME 
FEAR. RIORDAN OPPOSES THE IDEA BUT OTHER OFFICIALS APPLAUD IT.

 For Dora Ramirez and others still homeless after last month's earthquake, 
Tuesday's news was shocking: Federal authorities in Washington were now seeking 
to cut quake assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal and legal immigrants "are both human beings . . . regardless of what 
papers they carry," said Ramirez, a mother of three from Guatemala who was one 
of many seeking housing help Tuesday at an assistance center in the San 
Fernando Valley. "We all felt the earthquake the same," added Ramirez, a tent 
city resident who said she is undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 Local reaction was sharp and divided to the House Appropriations Committee's 
vote that would bar illegal immigrants from non-emergency earthquake aid, 
including rental subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 To many immigrants and their advocates, the proposal will only serve to 
discourage needy applicants and heighten discrimination against 
foreign-appearing legal residents seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start asking questions about people's immigration status, that has a 
real chilling effect," said Charles Wheeler, executive director of the National 
Immigration Law Center, a Los Angeles legal assistance office. "I think it is 
cruel and bizarre to link immigration status to a natural disaster of this 
magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mike Hernandez, whose inner-city district includes a 
significant immigrant population: "What they are doing is creating scapegoats." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan went on record against cutting aid to illegal 
immigrants, contending that such a move would create a "bureaucratic 
nightmare." The mayor made the statement in a letter to Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach), who was one of the first lawmakers to propose barring 
quake assistance to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 To those critical of Tuesday's House action, it appeared paradoxical that such 
restrictions are being contemplated despite the fact that U.S. officials 
enthusiastically distribute disaster aid worldwide. "Yet we have a disaster in 
our own back yard and people are looking at these kinds of issues," said 
Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the heavily Latino northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Others applauded the congressional move, which they said would rightfully deny 
assistance to people who should not be in the United States in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a step in the right direction," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, who 
represents the western portion of the San Fernando Valley. "First we have to 
help people who are here legally." 
</P>
<P>
 Assisting illegal immigrants only encourages their continued presence, said 
Daniel Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform, a Washington-based group that favors restrictions on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're aiding and abetting the continued illegal residence of someone who has 
no right to be here," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers wondered how federal authorities planned to implement the new 
program if it passes Congress. For instance, there is the thorny question of 
the eligibility of families with undocumented parents and U.S.-citizen 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't know how this is going to play out," said Susan Alva, project 
coordinator for the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles. She 
and others fear the prospect of discrimination, particularly if authorities 
only inquire about the immigration status of people who speak with accents or 
otherwise appear foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, it's going to come down to those of us who look like immigrants: 
Latinos and Asians," said Irma Rodriguez, staff attorney with the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE GIVES RISE TO BRIEF POLITICAL UNITY; AID: 
STATE'S CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND SACRAMENTO OFFICIALS OF BOTH PARTIES MEET 
IN WASHINGTON TO PUSH FOR FEDERAL ASSISTANCE. BUT RIFTS QUICKLY EMERGE.

 The biggest names in California politics turned momentarily chummy Tuesday as 
they squeezed in shoulder-to-shoulder at a news conference to put aside 
partisan bickering and push for billions of dollars in earthquake relief funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as is often the case with the diverse California delegation, it took only 
a few minutes -- and several prodding questions from reporters -- to jolt the 
unanimity like a sharp aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a fissure developed between Republican and Democratic lawmakers over a 
proposal to bar illegal immigrants from receiving earthquake assistance. Then, 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi blasted Treasurer Kathleen Brown, his 
opponent in the upcoming Democratic gubernatorial primary, and Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson for refusing to acknowledge the need to raise state taxes in an 
election year to rebuild Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who says we are going to do this without a temporary tax increase is 
either a fool or a liar," Garamendi fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 California Democrats in the House also privately accused Wilson of playing 
election-year politics when he focused on illegal immigration instead of on 
securing earthquake assistance during a closed-door breakfast meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the political rumblings, about 30 California Democrats and Republicans 
from Washington and Sacramento expressed optimism that they will succeed in 
passing President Clinton's $8.6-billion aid package through Congress and 
generate matching funds to meet the state's obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural disasters are not a political event," the state's leaders said in a 
joint statement. "They strike Democrats and Republicans alike. That is why we 
are here today in a show of strong bipartisan support." 
</P>
<P>
 After their meeting in the elegant Rayburn House office building, the elected 
officials paraded to a nearby committee room filled with reporters. The 
Californians looked as if they were posing for a reunion photo as they uneasily 
crowded together before television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the former Marine, stood ramrod-straight between Democrats Kathleen 
Brown and Garamendi, who are vying for the chance to knock off Wilson in 
November. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, no soul mate of the governor's, also 
flew cross country to join the festivities. Directly behind the governor were 
Sen. Barbara Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who lost a bitterly contested 
race to Wilson in 1990. Nearby was Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Redlands), who has 
feuded openly with Feinstein over legislation to protect the California desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), the retiring dean of the congressional 
delegation, reported that the California leaders had emerged from "a very 
friendly" meeting at which they agreed to mobilize support for quake relief. 
"It's going to take a lot of hard work to pass the bill. It is essential that 
California be united. We are united." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, however, the unified front began to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats left the news conference seething at Wilson for devoting less 
than 10 minutes of the hourlong meeting to the Northridge earthquake. Instead, 
the governor concentrated on his crusade to get the federal government to 
reimburse California $3 billion this year for the cost of providing services to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just beyond my comprehension," said one prominent California House 
Democrat, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "If the people in Los 
Angeles were watching this, they would not fathom it. Two hundred thousand 
people are suffering from the California earthquake and we are talking about 
immigration. It is just mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
 At the press conference, efforts to maintain the cooperative spirit were 
sidetracked when Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) was asked about his 
proposed legislation to keep illegal immigrants from receiving earthquake 
assistance. "I hate to be the skunk at the lawn party here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "illegal alien problem" in California, Rohrabacher said, is breaking the 
state's budget. "Providing millions, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars, 
worth of aid for people who are here illegally . . . is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Most members of the California congressional delegation have come to expect 
explosive remarks from Rohrabacher. But his statements about immigrants proved 
too much for freshman Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), who shook his head 
in disgust as he approached the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Becerra, visibly upset with Rohrabacher, said: "It does damage to the 
California delegation and all representatives for us to say that the 
undocumented are breaking the back of California. . . . This is a time now to 
look at every human being in this country, particularly in Los Angeles, who is 
in need as a result of this disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Wilson tweaked Garamendi and Kathleen Brown for their dispute 
over the need to raise state taxes and their lack of authority in deciding the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must tell you," Wilson told reporters with tongue partly in cheek, "I 
bitterly resent your efforts to try to divide the treasurer and the insurance 
commissioner, who disagree strongly on this. I think that in decency you should 
allow them to go back to California and find out the magnitude of the numbers. 
Then they can argue about it. Those of us who actually make the decision, the 
Legislature and myself, can be advised." 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the two Democratic candidates for governor also was questioned 
by Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen and John were pretty much nonexistent in that room," Brown said of 
the breakfast meeting. "They didn't say anything. They were just there. Period. 
And I don't know what either one of them (is) doing back here." 
</P>
<P>
 Other partisan differences surfaced when Rep. Randy Cunningham (R-San Diego) 
served notice that Republicans intend to demand a vote on forcing Congress to 
find cuts to offset the earthquake package. But before Cunningham could 
elaborate, Edwards cut him off and abruptly ended the news conference.

BLOOD SUPPLY REBOUNDS FROM LOW LEVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's blood supply, dangerously low immediately before the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, is nearly back to normal levels, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, blood banks now have an 8.4-day supply on hand, well above the 
one- to two-day supply available during much of the Christmas holiday period, 
said Terrie Hinz of the Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, most cities have a five- to six-day supply, about normal, although 
Washington has only a two-day supply and has issued an emergency call for blood 
donors, said Marcia Lane of the American Assn. of Blood Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although supplies are adequate, Hinz noted that there is a continuing need for 
donors in Los Angeles, especially for people with Type O blood.

IMMUNIZATION FOR CHICKEN POX SEEN AS SAVING MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vaccinating young children against chicken pox would save more than $5 for 
every $1 in costs, says a UC San Francisco report that anticipates federal 
approval of a vaccine soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are timely as the nation grapples with health reform and looks 
for ways to stretch limited dollars to cover spiraling health care costs, 
researchers said.A new vaccine under final review by the Food and Drug 
Administration could be approved by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Routine immunization of all healthy preschoolers would cost $88 million a year 
and would save $472 million annually, mainly in lost work time of parents who 
stay home to care for sick children, the researchers estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "From society's perspective, this vaccine . . . could be a good investment," 
said Dr. Stephen L. Cochi, an epidemiologist with the federal Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, which partly funded the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, led by Dr. Tracy A. Lieu of UCSF, is published in today's issue of 
the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken pox annually afflicts 3.7 million people in the United States, mostly 
children, who usually suffer little more than an itchy rash. But about 9,000 
Americans with severe cases or complications are hospitalized each year. About 
90 die. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is caused by the highly contagious varicella virus and is one of 
the last major childhood ailments for which no U.S. vaccine is available.

GARAMENDI AD PROPOSES TEMPORARY TAX HIKES TO FUND QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi planned to air the first 
broadcast commercial of the 1994 campaign year today with a radio ad proposing 
temporary gasoline and sales taxes to pay for repairs from the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax hike would last a year, said Garamendi, who is state insurance 
commissioner.Revenue from the statewide gasoline levy would be used to rebuild 
damaged roads and freeways. The sales tax would go for other public facilities, 
such as schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi did not specify the amount of either proposed increase. The state 
sales tax was boosted by a quarter-cent on the dollar after the 1989 Loma 
Prieta earthquake in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ad, Garamendi called the rebuilding job the most important challenge 
facing California. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted in the 30-second commercial, paid for by his campaign for governor, 
that he has been criticized for his proposal, first made at a forum with 
Democrat Kathleen Brown and Republican Gov. Pete Wilson on Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I believe it's time to worry less about politics and more about the 
people and pain of L.A. I don't think Californians are selfish. You can't run 
for governor if you're not willing to do what it takes to rebuild (Los 
Angeles)."

NO WRONGDOING BY BROWN SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury in Miami found no wrongdoing by Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown in connection with efforts by the Vietnamese to get a U.S. trade embargo 
lifted, a government official said late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another official, also speaking on grounds of anonymity, said it was expected 
that the Justice Department would soon close its investigation of the Cabinet 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI launched a probe early last year into allegations that Brown accepted 
$700,000 to help lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. The Justice 
Department's Public Integrity Section has been overseeing the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure of the case would indicate that Brown has been cleared by the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown previously had denied the allegations by Binh T. Ly, a 
Vietnamese-American businessman, and had predicted he would be exonerated by 
the probe.

REIMBURSEMENT FOR FIRM'S LEGAL FEES. SHAREHOLDERS AT ANNUAL MEETING QUESTION 
HIS POLICIES.

 ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. emerged victorious Tuesday from its bitterly fought 
proxy battle against Rafi M. Khan and promised to pursue legal action against 
the dissident shareholder unless it is repaid the $4 million it spent defending 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself a decent human being and I am not revengeful," Chairman 
Milan Panic said during an hourlong press conference after the company's 
long-awaited annual meeting, which was held at the drug firm's Costa Mesa 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he has damaged the company, and we have a duty to collect," said Panic, 
who is also a former prime minister of Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan, 43, of La Canada, said he is not responsible for how much money the 
company spent to fight his proxy challenge and called the demand for 
reimbursement "a joke." He vowed to continue hammering away at what he says are 
a long list of corporate problems that have financially hurt shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic said he favors dropping his company's lawsuit, which accuses Khan of 
using insider information to solicit support, if Khan is willing to come 
forward and negotiate a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to closing this chapter in the life of this company 
and going back to (conducting) business," Panic said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Khan vowed to have his name cleared of any criminal allegations. 
He said he will pursue evidence to support his allegation that Panic broke the 
law by running the company while he was the Yugoslav prime minister from July, 
1992, to January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be some interesting discovery," Khan said during an 
impromptu press conference. "It'll be fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of his defense, Khan said he sent a letter to David Kessler, 
commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, to dispute claims he had 
insider information on clinical tests involving the ICN drug Virazole. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he also wrote the U.S. attorney's office in New York, disputing 
criminal allegations made by ICN. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan launched his bid in April to unseat Panic and the company's eight other 
board members, complaining about mismanagement and extravagant executive 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 10 months that the two sides battled, Khan raised numerous issues 
about management that got ICN shareholders to question how the company was run. 
Nevertheless, a majority of those shareholders backed away from Khan, saying 
they also had to listen to ICN-inspired questions about Khan's character as a 
stockbroker and his experience in running a drug company. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Khan spent an estimated $1.5 million in his campaign to oust Panic -- a 
man he once revered as a financial genius -- he garnered only about 2 million 
votes, slightly less than 10% of the total number cast, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, ICN said it received more than 10 million of the 12.5 million 
votes cast during Tuesday's annual meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 ICN also announced that it was raising the number of its board members to 10 
by appointing Michael Smith, the 1993 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry. Smith 
becomes the second member of the ICN board to hold a Nobel Prize. Director 
Roger Guillemin was awarded the prize for medicine in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan's loss was no surprise -- he had already conceded defeat in his run at 
wresting control of ICN. If he won, Khan said he would have replaced the ICN 
board with himself and six other handpicked candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But throughout Tuesday's annual meeting, there remained an undercurrent of 
shareholder dissatisfaction with ICN management. 
</P>
<P>
 Several investors interviewed shortly before the meeting maintained that the 
company has yet to satisfactorily address many issues that have long bothered 
them, including executive compensation and the company's future direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hicks, 58, a lawyer from Lufkin, Tex., said he and his son Trent, 31, 
voted for Panic, but pledged their support would change if the company does not 
follow through with promises to enhance profits and increase communication with 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rafi Khan is involved in situations which are not in the best interest for a 
public company. I just didn't feel comfortable with him," Jack Hicks said. "But 
if things don't change, next time the challenge won't be coming from someone 
who is carrying the baggage Rafi Khan is. You're going to see a whole different 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Thayer of Anaheim criticized ICN's all-male board for its lack of 
diversity. Panic answered that he was talking with several "business ladies" 
who may be interested in joining the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Nikcevic of Los Angeles said that Panic should spend less time on politics 
and more time running the business he founded in 1960. Though he voted for 
Panic, he would have voted for Khan if the questions about his credibility were 
not raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still am borderline," Nikcevic said. "But I hope he (Panic) will change." 
</P>
<P>
 And Eddie Bloomfield, another shareholder from Texas, said that management's 
style must change. For instance, Panic has long been criticized by many in the 
investment community for his brash, unapologetic manner. Bloomfield said he was 
confident the challenge will force some positive changes to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Milan will see to it that those things will take place," Bloomfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were shareholders so dissatisfied with Panic and ICN that they 
supported Khan. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the more dramatic moments of the meeting, shareholder Morris Miller, 
79, of Anaheim Hills verbally attacked Panic, saying that the chairman 
considered himself, and not the other shareholders, the owner of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you say is I , I , I ," Miller told Panic. "You never say we . The only 
reason I have not sold my stock is that I am waiting for you to fall down and 
get bounced out (of the company)." ICN Proxy Fight Ends 
</P>
<P>
 ICN chairman and founder Milan Panic fended off stockholder Rafi Khan's 
efforts to unseat him at the company's annual meeting Tuesday. Highlights of 
Khan's acrimonious proxy battle: 
</P>
<P>
 1993 
</P>
<P>
 * April 2: Khan launches a bid to topple Panic and the eight-member board of 
directors, claiming they mismanaged the firm and lived extravagantly at 
stockholders' expense. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 6: ICN sues Khan, accusing him of insider trading, racketeering and 
violating his fiduciary responsibilities when he acted as ICN's institutional 
underwriter. Panic claims Khan is an opportunist who wants to take over the 
company for his personal gain, not to better stockholders' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 26: U.S. District Judge John Sprizzo blocks Khan's proxy effort after 
concluding Khan had been involved in a 1986 securities fraud in Britain and 
lied to conceal it. Appeals court later reverses the ruling, but the criminal 
investigation against Khan continues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 8: Sprizzo postpones ICN's annual meeting from early May to Feb. 1, 
giving Khan time to put his proxy battle back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 1: Panic and the current board receive the vast majority of votes from 
stockholders at ICN's annual meeting. Panic vows to seek $4 million in damages 
from Kahn to cover the expense of fending off the proxy battle.

 Carl N. Karcher has always gotten by with a little help from his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Karcher's children held an informal "thank you" party for some 
friends and business associates who stood by the founder of the Carl's Jr. 
fast-food chain during last year's highly publicized dispute with the board and 
management of parent company Carl Karcher Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Karcher, 76, was voted out as Karcher Enterprises' chairman during 
a bitter argument over the company's strategic direction. He's now negotiating 
a contract and will return to the company as chairman emeritus.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: TACO BELL SHOWS 18% EARNINGS BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepsico Inc. said Tuesday that its Taco Bell unit, showing strong growth for 
the fifth straight year, posted annual earnings of $253.6 million, an 18% 
increase over the previous year's net income of $214.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual sales for the Irvine chain of Mexican-style fast-food eateries also 
rose 16% to $2.9 billion for the fiscal year that ended Dec. 25 from $2.5 
billion the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsico attributed Taco Bell's increased profit to decreased food costs, 
additional outlets and more sales volume. Those gains, however, came with 
higher administrative costs and more losses at Hot 'n Now, a hamburger chain 
owned and operated by Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fiscal fourth quarter, Taco Bell's earnings rose 17% to $87.5 million 
from $74.7 million in 1992's final three months. Quarterly revenue grew 20% to 
$975.9 million from $812.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsico itself reported record results for the year and the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Purchase, N.Y., company, whose empire includes Pepsi Cola, Taco Bell, KFC 
and Pizza Hut, said annual profits more than quadrupled to $1.6 billion from 
$374 million in 1992. Revenue climbed to $25 billion from $22 billion the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly earnings grew to $442.5 million for the final quarter from $265.6 
million in 1992's last quarter. Revenue for the three-month period grew 14% to 
$7.7 million from $6.8 million in the previous year's final quarter.

COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIC POSTS '93 LOSS; EARNINGS: LAGUNA HILLS CARE PROVIDER HAD 
$24.9-MILLION LOSS BUT DECLARES A TURNAROUND. 'WORST IS BEHIND THEM,' ANALYST 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric Centers, cleared after an insurance fraud probe in Texas 
last year, on Tuesday reported a loss for 1993 but declared that a "turnaround 
is underway." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, whose stock has dropped from a high of $40 a share in 1991 to a 
low of $9.13 early in 1993 -- posted progressively better results during the 
year, however, including earnings of more than $5 million for the latest 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fiscal year ended Nov. 30, Community Psychiatric reported a loss of 
$24.9 million, or 58 cents a share. That contrasted with a profit of $23.1 
million, or 52 cents a share, for the previous 12 months. Annual revenue fell 
to $337.9 million from $347.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, based in Laguna Hills, sold several unprofitable psychiatric 
hospitals during the year, closed others and eliminated several dozen corporate 
positions, including six regional vice presidencies. It now operates 51 
psychiatric and seven rehabilitation hospitals in the United States and the 
United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the costs of those and other changes, the company said, it would 
have posted an annual profit of $10 million on a 7% increase in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst is behind them," said John Hindelong, an analyst at brokerage 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in New York. "The results are better than 
expected. They reflect the efforts of management over a very difficult period." 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, Community Psychiatric said its earnings were $5.4 
million, or 13 cents a share, more than four times its profit of $1.2 million, 
or 3 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the earnings increase resulted from its cost-cutting efforts. 
Three-month revenue rose only slightly to $87.0 million from $86.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The report gave the company's stock a boost in Tuesday's trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. It gained 38 cents a share to close at $17.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyst Alex Miselson at the brokerage A.T. Brod & Co. in New York said 
Tuesday that he will recommend Community Psychiatric's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good company that has withstood pressure," he said. "It is not 
going under, and people still need psychiatric care." 
</P>
<P>
 Until three years ago, when managed care began capping costs on mental health 
services, Community Psychiatric Centers had enjoyed two solid decades of 
growth. Today, the company said, it has found ways to prosper despite reduced 
reimbursements from health insurers. It is offering more outpatient and 
part-day care, spokeswoman Suzanne Hovdey said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Community Psychiatric has moved into the profitable business 
of housing and rehabilitating physically ill people who are being released from 
hospitals -- acute long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 Its subsidiary, Transitional Hospitals Corp., opened seven acute long-term 
facilities in 1993, four of them in the final quarter. The hospitals will 
become profitable when they begin receiving federal reimbursement for Medicare 
patients, which lags by six months for new facilities, said Richard L. Conte, 
chairman and chief executive officer of the parent company. CPC Ends Year With 
a Loss 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a fourfold increase in fourth-quarter earnings over last year, 
Community Psychiatric Centers recorded a $25-million loss for fiscal 1993, 
ending Nov. 30. The company attributed its quarterly performance to cost 
containment and the sale of unprofitable hospitals. The annual loss reflects an 
unusual charge to reflect the sales. Amounts in millions, except per-share

INGRAM MICRO MEETS $4-BILLION SALES GOAL FOR 1993 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ingram Micro Inc., a distributor of personal computers and software, met its 
goal of $4 billion in sales for 1993, up 48% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram Micro on Tuesday reported sales of $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, 
up from $820 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales gains represented the company's strongest growth since 1989, said 
Linwood A. (Chip) Lacy Jr., Ingram Micro co-chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so proud of the job our employees did," Lacy said. "We gave every 
non-sales employee in the United States a bonus when we hit our 
'$4-billion-bound' goal. We were worried we weren't going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales grew in the United States, Canada, Europe and Mexico. In the domestic 
market, Lacy attributed strong growth to increased demand by American consumers 
for software. The company also strengthened its partnerships with large retail 
chains such as Intelligent Electronics in Exton, Pa., and MicroAge in Tempe, 
Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram Micro also got a boost in revenue from the acquisition of distributors 
in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany and the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram Micro, a privately held subsidiary of Ingram Industries Inc. in 
Nashville, Tenn., does not disclose profits. But Lacy said the company profits 
were under intense pressure during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has 3,820 employees worldwide, up from 2,200 a year ago. Lacy said 
the company expects to invest $20 million this year in a computer system to 
control its distribution operations.

LABOR DEPT., UNION CHIEF SETTLE CASE; LAWSUIT: FEDERAL AGENCY CONCEDES IT CAN'T 
PROVE MARCELINO DUARTE AND OTHERS VIOLATED ELECTION LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversial leader of a big Laborers Union local, Marcelino (Matchy) 
Duarte, will not face a new election. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Department of Labor Tuesday conceded that it could not prove 
Duarte and other union officers received outside help in their election. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a smashing victory for Duarte, 61. The Labor Department had originally 
demanded that all 11 officers of Local 652 stand for election again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now only two lesser officers must rerun the June election, which ended in a 
brawl at the local's Santa Ana offices between dissidents and Duarte 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry, but what can you do?" said Crispin Perez, who ran against Duarte 
for the $107,000-a-year job of business manager. "I'm out of words right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The local has helped hundreds of Mexican immigrants move into the middle class 
with relatively unskilled construction jobs as laborers on roadways and 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a political and economic power in Orange County's Latino community, 
where this fight for control of the local is being closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez and other dissidents accused Duarte of intimidating union members during 
the election or bribing them with promises of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said it investigated and rejected those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the department thought it could prove two more specific allegations: 
that the union hadn't notified perhaps as many as 150 members about the 
election and that Duarte's supporters used the phones at a community center for 
the elderly in Westminster run by Abrazar Inc. during the election -- but never 
intended to pay the two resulting phone bills of more than $400. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Labor Department proved that Duarte's supporters didn't intend to pay 
the bills, it could have forced new elections for the local's 11 offices. But 
the lawyer handling the case said the Labor Department -- after talking to 
Duarte's lawyer -- concluded it couldn't prove the allegation it had made in a 
lawsuit just three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union actually didn't pay one of the phone bills until after the 
investigation started," said Assistant U.S. Atty. John H. Lee. "But we would 
have had a difficult time proving our case." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sour grapes," said the union's lawyer, Julius Mel Reich. The candidates 
didn't pay the bill immediately, he said, because it was misplaced.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the other allegation in the lawsuit, the union agreed in settling the 
suit that it had not mailed ballots to 98 members of the 4,000-member local. 
</P>
<P>
 The local agreed to hold elections for two offices that the victors won by 
less than 98 votes -- third auditor and vice president, both in the second tier 
of the union's hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge must now approve the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Perez and the other dissidents have hired their own lawyer. The 
lawyer has asked to intervene in the lawsuit and will probably try to block the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, the government lawyer, said the Labor Department had no choice but to 
concede defeat when it found it couldn't prove the allegation about the phone 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement," he said, "is something the Labor Department and the local 
can live with."

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: DATUM BRACES FOR A DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Datum Inc. The maker of computer subsystems said Tuesday that its annual 
earnings will be much lower than expected because it will take charges of about 
$350,000 against fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its earnings were impacted by a consolidation and redesign of 
some product lines and by delays in shipments during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim company said it now expects a "modest profit" for the year that 
still will be an improvement over the $2.2-million loss reported for 1992. 
Datum didn't say when its official results will be released. But when they are, 
it said, the numbers will show that annual sales rose 6% and that 
fourth-quarter revenue climbed 11%.

ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS

<TEXT>
<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems Inc.: The Cypress-based managed care company 
reported a profit of $20.4 million, or 73 cents a share, for its first fiscal 
quarter, which included a gain of $5.7 million from an accounting change. That

 Honored Prophet: When James L. Doti speaks, does Washington listen? 
</P>
<P>
 During an early morning session Monday with the California Restaurant Assn.'s 
Orange County chapter, Doti predicted that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan would move soon to keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that same day, Greenspan warned Congress that it might be necessary to 
raise interest rates to prevent a spurt of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti, president of Chapman University in Orange and founder of Chapman's 
Center for Economic Research, also told restaurant owners and operators that 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake won't have a dramatic effect on revenue at 
most Orange County restaurants. Doti based that statement on the fact that the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake did relatively little damage to sales at 
restaurants located away from that temblor's epicenter.

 Reclosing but Reopening: Shane at Newport, the eatery that opened Nov. 5 on 
the former Barbacoa restaurant site in Newport Beach, is closing already.But 
the building will be reopening shortly as a catering center for Santa Ana-based 
West Coast Restaurant Ventures, which also operates the Kachina, Zuni Grill, 
Bistro, Diva and Cafe Topaz restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coast maintains that the 180-seat restaurant did "respectable business" 
but that the building will better serve the corporation as a "special event 
site" for its growing catering business. 
</P>
<P>
 No employees will be laid off because of the change, said Harald Hermann, West 
Coast's director of operations.

<P>
 Taco Bell said Tuesday it has organized a charitable fund to aid in the 
education of the children whose parents were killed at one of the chain's 
restaurants in Clarksville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clarksville Children's Memorial Fund is accepting donations in care of 
First American National Bank, P.O. Box 508, Clarksville, Tenn. 37041-0508. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell said it would donate $5,000 per child to the fund. The company is 
also preparing to pay funeral expenses, and it has arranged for counseling for 
the victims' families and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The four workers slain Sunday were Patricia Mae Price, 28; Angela Wyatt and 
Kevin Campbell, both 22, and Marsha Klopp, 24. Campbell, the married father of 
a 2-week-old girl, was expecting a promotion to assistant manager. Klopp, an 
assistant manager, also was married with three children. Price had five 
children and had recently moved to Clarksville with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The four victims were found dead Sunday morning by the restaurant manager 
arriving to open for business. Two had been shot in the head execution-style, 
authorities said. The restaurant's safe was open and cash register drawers were 
empty.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: BANK OF ANAHEIM AGREES TO MERGER TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bank of Anaheim, one of Orange County's few profitable banks last year, has 
signed a tentative agreement to be merged into California State Bank in Covina 
for $8.1 million in cash, or about $15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is subject to approvals from Bank of Anaheim shareholders and 
banking regulators as well as the Covina bank's review of the institution's 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 A more definitive agreement is expected in two months if the review and 
further negotiations are completed favorably to both sides. Regulatory approval 
then would be expected by September, said Gene Hobday, Bank of Anaheim's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition would give California State its first branch in Orange County. 
With $344 million in loans and other assets, it now has 11 branches in Los 
Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Anaheim, with $74 million in assets and earnings of $256,000 last 
year, would continue to operate as the 12th branch with all of its employees. 
Hobday said he has tentatively agreed to continue working in Anaheim as a 
regional executive for California State Bank.

BANKERS, EURO DISNEY WILL HOLD SECRET AUDIT MEETING; RESTRUCTURING: THE FATE OF 
TROUBLED PARIS PARK HANGS ON FINDING SOLUTIONS TO ITS $3.57-BILLION DEBT 
PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bankers were sworn to secrecy Tuesday as they prepared for a meeting that will 
seal the fate of the troubled Euro Disneyland theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 bankers are expected at today's presentation, at a secret location 
here, of Euro Disney's finances by auditors KPMG Peat Marwick, one banker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to discuss the report in detail," said a bank official, adding that 
it would provide the bankers with a base for future talks with Euro Disney and 
its parent, Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see (today) whether we are all on the same wavelength," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney is trying to put together a package with its bankers to allow it 
to keep running its theme park and resort after Walt Disney stops financing it 
at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit has been commissioned by Euro Disney's bankers, who have promised to 
keep its contents secret. 
</P>
<P>
 It will allow them to discuss possible solutions to the park's $3.57-billion 
debt problem, the bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
 It may also lead to deeper studies into certain areas such as possible asset 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 A bank official said talks may begin with another look at Walt Disney's 
initial restructuring proposals, which the banks rejected in November because 
they did not agree with the figures, and they also wanted more time to study 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney's proposals included a review of interest rates and repayment 
periods for Euro Disney's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also foresee a capital rise of about $1.7 billion, the conversion of 
some of the bank debt into equity and the sale of the resort's hotels to a 
third party or even to Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say Walt Disney will probably have to give up management fees and 
royalties it gets from Euro Disney for some time or for good. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of Euro Disney's main bankers have already refused a debt-for-equity 
conversion, and Walt Disney is seen by analysts as also taking a hard-line 
approach, even demonstrating it could simply walk away from the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, the talks look set to be tough, and sacrifices are 
expected from all sides at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 Holders of Euro Disney convertible bonds, who have been excluded from the 
restructuring talks, already see themselves being offered as a sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they commissioned an independent report in which a law firm concluded 
that Walt Disney could be held responsible for the management and operations of 
the theme park and could be sued. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the banks, an out-of-court settlement was preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the legal position may be, Walt Disney has a commercial position, as 
do Euro Disney and the banks," said one banker in London. "We don't think 
litigation is the right solution and is not the solution we will take." 
</P>
<P>
 With the March 31 deadline approaching, banks plan to pick up the pace of 
meetings to reach a solution that both they and Walt Disney can accept to save 
Euro Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 If a solution is not found by then, the theme park faces the risk of going 
bust, auditors Price Waterhouse said in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the financial restructuring measures envisaged do not reach a conclusion 
in sufficient time, the group will have cash problems and will not be able to 
continue its activities," Price Waterhouse said.

 Hansen Natural Corp.: The marketer of Hansen's Natural Sodas, in its first 
venture overseas, said Tuesday that it has started selling its popular 
health-oriented beverages in England, Scotland and Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen Natural Corp. in Anaheim said it signed a contract with Trustin Kerwood 
Ltd. of Great Britain to distribute soda from a production plant Hansen has set 
up in England.Iced tea and lemonade will be shipped from the United States 
until production facilities can be established in England for those products, 
said Harold C. Taber Jr., Hansen's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Taber said the company isn't sure what revenue to expect from the venture 
because such health-oriented drinks are new to the United Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we feel comfortable with this, we'll pursue two or three other European 
countries over the next year or so," he said.

HOUSE UNIT ACTS TO BAR QUAKE AID FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS; DISASTER: THE 
$8.6-BILLION AMOUNT BRINGS NO OPPOSITION. BUT ROHRABACHER-SPONSORED 
RESTRICTIONS SPUR DEBATE OVER WHO SHOULD GET RELIEF AND HOW TO PAY FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's $8.6-billion earthquake assistance package took 
the first step toward congressional approval Tuesday but only after a key 
committee amended the measure to bar illegal immigrants from receiving housing 
grants and other longer-term emergency aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Little opposition has arisen to the size of the emergency aid bill -- which if 
approved will be the largest in the nation's history -- but debate is growing 
in Congress over the contentious immigration issue as well as efforts to force 
budget cuts to pay for the assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the amendment barring long-term assistance to illegal immigrants 
was hailed as a victory late Tuesday by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington 
Beach), who began advocating the measure last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important step forward in the acceptance of the fundamental 
principles I have advocated, which is that illegal aliens should not be 
eligible for the same benefits as U.S. citizens," said Rohrabacher, a longtime 
advocate of deporting illegal immigrants after they receive emergency medical 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversies, proponents remain hopeful they can steer the 
measure to Clinton's desk by the end of next week. It contains funds to provide 
rental assistance and temporary housing for those displaced by the Northridge 
quake, loans for small businesses and homeowners, money to make public 
buildings more earthquake-proof, and aid to repair damaged freeways, schools, 
veterans hospitals and other public structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by California Republicans, the measure also appears destined to push 
the escalating debate over public benefits and illegal immigrants onto the 
national stage in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 After rancorous deliberations Tuesday, the powerful House Appropriations 
Committee adopted a modified version of a proposal by Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside) stipulating that no benefits can go to anyone "when it is known 
to the federal entity or official to which the funds are made available that 
the individual is not lawfully within the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would apply to aid dispensed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency -- which coordinates government response to disasters and administers 
emergency aid -- the Small Business Administration and the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. As amended, it explicitly states that 
undocumented residents would still be eligible for emergency shelter as well as 
food, water, medical care and other "essential needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 38-12, with Democrats casting all the opposing votes. Renewed 
battles over the amendment are expected as the bill -- which passed 
Appropriations on a voice vote -- moves through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats on the Appropriations panel claimed that Republicans were 
seeking to score political points at the expense of illegal immigrants in 
desperate straits. But the issue deeply divided the Democrats themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Reps. Julian C. Dixon of Los Angeles and Esteban E. Torres of La 
Puente, both longtime liberals, said they brokered the compromise in a 
pragmatic attempt to forestall more severe measures and avoid likely defeat on 
the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher said the votes by Democrats to limit earthquake aid to illegal 
immigrants -- while given reluctantly -- represent a new political reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democratic leadership may not have seen the light in terms of those 
principles but they may have felt the (political) heat," Rohrabacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he was surprised by the approval of the amendment. "I didn't 
believe that would be in the bill. I am surprised (Democrats) have actually 
permitted it to succeed in committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard's amendment said an individual would be denied benefits when it was 
"made known" to the government that the person was in the United States 
illegally. The compromise amendment struck the word made, which some Democrats 
said would have raised the danger of third parties making allegations to 
authorities about someone's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Their alternative also explicitly spelled out the range of emergency services 
to which illegal immigrants would remain entitled. Packard had simply referred 
to "emergency medical assistance," although he said he had intended to include 
a wider range of short-term aid. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement following the vote, Packard said illegal immigrants should not 
receive aid they would not be receiving had there not been an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my strong belief that the federal government ought to assist its 
taxpaying citizens first," Packard said. "Giving assistance to illegal 
immigrants who broke the law to enter this country undermines the integrity of 
our laws. Every dollar spent on illegal immigrants is a dollar denied to 
taxpaying citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon noted that the measure does not require federal officials to ask about 
an applicant's legal status. Nor, he said, would he expect agencies to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus, angrily derided the proposal as "immigrant bashing" and 
mean-spirited and said it would lead to discrimination against Latinos. Rep. Ed 
Pastor (D-Ariz.) complained: "It's a sad day that we as Democrats are going to 
have this shoved down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Packard, who has vowed to propose a similar amendment on each spending bill 
considered this year, responded: "My amendment simply says that illegal 
immigrants should not receive assistance they would not otherwise receive just 
because there was an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon, who only hours earlier had vowed to oppose Packard's effort, said the 
Appropriations fight foreshadows confrontations on an issue that is very 
divisive for Democrats. Given the solid Republican support for the Packard 
amendment, he said he determined during a party caucus Tuesday that enough 
Democrats backed a limit on aid to illegal immigrants to "represent the 
majority interests in the House." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California and Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills), advocates of other measures to stem illegal immigration, 
both voiced support for Packard's proposal in interviews. Feinstein said the 
federal government should not "be picking up long-term rent subsidies for 
illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Another leading restrictionist, Rohrabacher said late Tuesday that although 
the amendment was not as strongly worded as he would have liked, it 
accomplished what he set out to do and he would not pursue his more restrictive 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a lot of personal abuse" for wanting to restrict services provided to 
illegal immigrants, Rohrabacher said. "I really do feel vindicated by this 
(vote)." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Palacio, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund in 
Orange County, said the bill sets a bad precedent for emergency situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reality of this is we have an economic crisis in this country. 
Whether they are Republican or Democrat, they need to blame somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, adoption of Packard's initiative also was condemned by 
immigrant advocate groups. And, on the streets, where relief agencies are 
struggling with day-to-day difficulties of aiding tens of thousands of quake 
victims, the amendment raised the specter of further complications. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're asking us in an emergency situation to implement something that will 
probably be difficult at best, and potentially disruptive," said Joe 
Schuldiner, assistant secretary of HUD. "You'd like time to think about it, 
but, obviously, we'll do what Congress wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the restrictions are passed and implemented, Los Angeles city housing 
officials emphasized that they will continue with current policies of providing 
housing assistance regardless of legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't ask and we're not looking," said Steve Rehahan, the city housing 
authority official who is overseeing distribution of HUD housing vouchers to 
quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, there was immediate concern that withdrawal of U.S. aid for illegal 
immigrants could shift large post-quake costs to city programs -- notably a 
$2.5-million emergency housing grant program established after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could increase the pressure on our program enormously," said Barbara 
Zeidman, assistant general manager of the city Housing Preservation and 
Production Department. "And it threatens (quake victims) with a more permanent 
form of homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal housing officials predicted that it would not be easy to discern who 
is a legal resident. Because it does not ask aid applicants for proof of 
citizenship, FEMA has no record of the numbers of undocumented residents who 
seek aid, though some officials and legal aid groups maintain that the figures 
are minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) called for a vote on 
whether to offset earthquake aid with reductions in spending in other areas -- 
a move that could make it more difficult to win passage of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres) joined a bipartisan group of four 
congressmen pushing for $7.13 billion in cuts to fund the quake aid package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to give all of the necessary aid to California earthquake victims as 
we did for the Midwestern flood and Florida hurricane, but there is no reason 
why we can't pay for that," Condit said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Democratic caucus meeting, lawmakers said privately that they expect 
the Rules Committee today to incorporate the proposal into the aid bill. 
Administration officials said that some of the proposed cuts -- including 
trimming the federal work force by 252,000 -- are included in Clinton's 
cost-cutting proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration added to the earthquake package nearly $1.2 billion in 
funds for peacekeeping efforts in Bosnia, Somalia and elsewhere as well as $750 
million largely for additional costs of the Midwestern floods and the 1989 Loma 
Prieta earthquake.

39 RARE MICE MAY DELAY O.C. RESORT PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday that it has placed a 
small mouse on the emergency endangered species list, a move that could delay a 
proposed $500-million resort on one of the few undeveloped coastal properties 
left in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific pocket mouse, rediscovered last year after not having been 
observed since 1971, "is part of California's natural heritage. They are an 
important part of the ecology," said Fred Roberts, a botanist with the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Described as four-inch rodents that resemble hamsters, the pocket mice were 
found during an environmental survey for the proposed resort to be built on the 
Headlands, 121 acres overlooking Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The development plan, which is opposed by local environmentalists, calls for a 
400-room hotel complex and 394 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey revealed that 39 of the rare mice -- believed to be the smallest 
member of the rodent family and perhaps the only ones of their kind that still 
exist -- were concentrated in about four acres of coastal sagebrush at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Once common as far as two miles inland along the Southern California coast 
from Los Angeles County's Marina del Rey and El Segundo south to the Mexican 
border, the tiny mouse has fallen victim to development and hungry cats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The urbanization of the coast all but wiped them out," Roberts said. "They've 
probably been at the Dana Point Headlands the whole time, but nobody's looked 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as scientists know, he said, the Headlands' small population of Pacific 
pocket mice constitutes the last remaining community of the species in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency listing is "really an attempt to restore the natural balance of 
things," said Connie Babb, a spokeswoman for the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the listing, which took effect Monday, developers will not be allowed to 
build without first convincing the service that construction will not further 
endanger the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have to come up with a habitat conservation plan built into this 
project that would show it would allow enough room to satisfy the scientists 
that the species could survive there," Babb said. 
</P>
<P>
 While news of the emergency listing was not welcomed by the Headlands property 
owner, a spokesman was confident the mouse would not change the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certainly not happy about it," said Dan Daniels, president of the 
Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co., which owns the parcel along with the 
Chandis Securities Co. "It certainly slows down our ability to develop those 
(four) acres. The rest of the property, I would hope, would not be affected by 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of the 
Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey that rediscovered the mice was conducted by a biologist last July 
at the request of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, according to Daniels, the biologist had suggested that the 
landowner move the mice to a different location to save the colony because 
house cats from nearby homes were already a danger to the rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Common sense tells you that Dana Point is an urban environment and when 
development occurs the mouse is not going to survive," Daniels said. "If a 
long-term objective of the Fish and Wildlife Service is to have the mouse 
survive, it seems the only way to do it is to relocate them to where people and 
cats are not around." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposed Headlands development, which has been approved by 
the Dana Point Planning Commission and will go before the City Council, the 
area where the mice were found is slated for single-family homes, 3.5 to 7 
units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Craft, a spokeswoman for the city of Dana Point, said it is "too early 
to tell" what effect the listing would have on the project's progress. A Feb. 
15 public hearing on the plan still will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't change the process, but certainly we can't say it's not going to 
change the plan. It could drastically change it, who knows? We really don't 
know what the City Council will decide or what other jurisdictions will 
decide." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Babb, the emergency listing will be in effect for 240 days, 
during which scientists will determine whether to recommend that the endangered 
listing be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, meanwhile, were expressing cautious optimism about this 
latest in a long series of obstacles to the development of what many consider a 
natural site that should be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Fortune, a spokesman for the local chapter of the Audubon Society, said he 
welcomed the listing as something that, while not likely to stop the project 
altogether, will probably delay it. "I don't think (the project) is consistent 
with trying to preserve habitat," Fortune said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Toni and Ed Gallagher, volunteers for Save the Headlands, a local 
grass-roots organization that is fighting the development, expressed hope that 
the federal government's action would further complicate the property owners' 
efforts to realize their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate to see (the landowners) just steamroller in, right over the 
citizens," said Ed Gallagher, who has lived in an ocean-view home on the 
Headlands for 15 years. "They have a larger opponent to face now." 
</P>
<P>
 On a stretch of untouched, ocean-bluff land behind a high chain-link fence 
topped with barbed wire and marked "No Trespassing," meanwhile, sits the spot 
identified by biologists as the pocket mouse's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tend to like ocean views and sunsets and very expensive pieces of land," 
said John Ballew, whose Costa Mesa planning and architecture firm, Ballew & 
Associates, is project manager for the site, worth roughly $1 million per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Savage, 32, who has lived near the site for seven years, said she's never 
heard of or knowingly seen one of the rodents. But her cat, Jinx, drags home 
many creatures, including small mice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I could see one is if my cat brought it home," she said. "And 
then it would be dead."

DOCTORS, CLINICS CAUGHT IN O.C. MEDICAL BILLING STING; INDICTMENTS: D.A.'S 
18-MONTH PROBE INVOLVED SETTING UP A PHONY LAW FIRM TO FERRET OUT SCHEMES 
AGAINST INSURERS. 
</P>

<P>
 An unusual sting operation ended with the indictments of 20 people -- 
including seven physicians -- accused of doctoring nearly $59,583 in bogus 
medical bills, Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-month probe, one of the longest in the prosecuting agency's history, 
involved setting up a "dummy" law firm that claimed to represent clients 
injured in car accidents. Doctors and employees at eight clinics in Santa Ana 
and one in Irvine were arrested on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to 
commit insurance fraud, and in some cases, offering kickbacks, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put the bait over the edge of the pier and the fish bit," Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, the phony law firm received $3,140 in bills for 32 
examinations and physical therapy sessions, but only one exam actually took 
place, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance fraud is not just theft against insurance companies, it's a rip-off 
of the public in general," Capizzi said. "It affects me, it affects you, it 
affects everyone with higher bills." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants and their attorneys could not be reached for comment. Phone 
messages left at the nine clinics went unreturned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sting operation was unusual because investigators went so far as to rent 
office space and pose as a fledging personal injury law firm -- right down to 
law diplomas hanging on the walls. Authorities said it wasn't long before 
clinic owners came knocking, looking for new "patients" who were actually 
undercover investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials sent their bills to the firm. In theory, the firm would 
forward payment from insurance companies back to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance fraud totals about $20 billion nationwide, said Michael L. Powell, a 
vice president with the nonprofit National Insurance Crime Bureau, which gave 
the district attorney's office $30,000 to helped underwrite the costs of the 
undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell praised Capizzi's investigation as "innovative" because it actively 
sought out the fraud, and he predicted it will become a model for law 
enforcement agencies elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 No money was paid out during the sting operation, and in some cases clinic 
workers badgered investigators for payments, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe shows that Orange County and Southern California is a hotbed for 
such illegal activity, mostly because of the lagging economy, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said 17 of the 20 defendants have been arrested and are expected to be 
arraigned today in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana. Three defendants 
remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury handed down nine separate indictments in December 
and January, but the indictments were sealed until the arrests late Monday and 
early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The phony firm opened in April, 1992, and investigators randomly chose about 
200 clinics in central Orange County from a phone book and offered legal 
services. An investigator posing as an office administrator remained on site to 
greet clinic administrators personally, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of legitimate businesses came forward. Authorities said they focused 
on nine clinics that submitted false bills and performed inadequate exams -- 
when exams were performed at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Videotape and audiotape were used to document the operation. Authorities are 
now looking into other insurance bills filed by the clinics, Capizzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we hope that it will have some therapeutic value, and someone who 
is inclined to commit this sort of fraud will be disinclined after learning of 
this operation," said Capizzi. But he said he is not "naive" enough to believe 
that the arrests would put an end to fraudulent insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Medical Board, which handles physician licensing, said an 
investigation will be launched immediately into the doctors named in the 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have an investigation pending against any of the named 
physicians, we will begin one," said John Lancara, chief of enforcement for the 
medical board. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 defendants and the clinics named in the indictment are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Rashmi Patel, 39, of Walnut, at the Pat Medical Clinic in Santa Ana; 
employee Silvia Sady-Kennedy, 37, of Lake Forest and administrator Manoj Patel, 
44, of Walnut. 
</P>

Santa Ana; Jacqueline Trinh On, 26, of Sacramento and Michelle Nicholson, 23, 
of Orange.

CLINTON TO LIFT VIETNAM TRADE CURBS, AIDES SAY; FOREIGN POLICY: HISTORIC 
RECONCILIATION MAY COME THIS WEEK. O.C. VIETNAMESE LEADERS, MIA KIN CONDEMN 
MOVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton has decided to lift the 19-year-old trade embargo against 
Vietnam and could announce the move before the end of the week, according to 
Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which would mark a historic reconciliation step, follows a 
formal recommendation by Secretary of State Warren Christopher late last week 
after lengthy deliberations by the Administration over the highly emotional 
issue. The White House is expected to attach no conditions to ending the trade 
ban, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal signing ceremony will be delayed to give the Administration time to 
follow usual procedures and notify members of Congress of its plans. The 
President has sole authority to take the action, which will be accomplished 
through an executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo, which has prohibited all trade with Vietnam since the Vietnam War 
ended in 1975, has been relaxed slightly in recent months to permit some 
businesses to begin making contacts in the Southeast Asian country. Among those 
pressing for the move has been the Vietnamese government, which has been eager 
for the economic stimulus that trade with the United States would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of the decision was welcomed by some local business leaders. But it but 
brought an angry reaction from Vietnamese Americans in Orange County, home to 
the largest group of expatriates outside Vietnam, family members of missing 
American servicemen and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will shock the community very much if the President lifts the embargo," 
said Ban Binh Bui, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern 
California. "I know I'm very shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 "We now feel very lonely in our battle against the Communists in Vietnam," he 
said. "Concerning the embargo, we request the President tie in with his 
decision the issues of human rights, a clean and free election so the people of 
Vietnam can decide what kind of government should represent them, and to clear 
up the POW/MIA questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Communists have to account for all the soldiers so the dead don't have to 
feel wronged and the living don't have to feel frustration," Bui said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huu Vo, co-chairman of the Vietnamese American Community in the United States, 
said he was "very sad" to hear that Clinton might lift the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters to the President, Vo and fellow expatriates have stressed that the 
United States is a leader of the free world and should require freedom in the 
countries wanting trade relationships, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's come to this, then I'm very disappointed that they've put business 
over democracy," Vo said. 
</P>
<P>
 POW/MIA family member Errol Bond of Fullerton was stunned when told the trade 
embargo might end this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're kidding," he said, his voice cracking, "I think it's criminal. A 
couple of hundred of guys still over there alive and he's giving up our 
leverage to get those boys back? . . . We're being sold down the river." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Co Pham, an obstetrician who heads the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in 
Orange County, hailed the prospects for lifting trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very, very emotional," Pham said. "President Clinton will do a great 
deal for 70 million Vietnamese as well as the families of MIAs and POWs. If we 
lift the sanctions, the issue of the POWs will be solved very quickly and 
Clinton will create a lot of opportunity for Americans who want to do business 
over there. A lot of American businesses are pressuring the President because 
they see the opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham conceded that the end of sanctions could ignite some political battles 
within Little Saigon. The issue has long served locally as a litmus test about 
hostilities toward the Communist regime in Vietnam. Pham himself donned a 
bulletproof vest and hired bodyguards after his public support for trade 
normalization drew death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will create some very small skirmishes with Vietnamese pro and con. Some 
Vietnamese people are still very bitter against Vietnam because of the bad 
memories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the other hand, Pham said, he expected a rush of Little Saigon 
businessman heading off to Vietnam to investigate business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go not to travel," he said, "but to find the opportunities for 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress' chief opponent of normalization, Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.), has 
argued, along with some veterans group and family organizations, that the 
Administration should continue to enforce the embargo as a way to pressure the 
Vietnamese into doing more to account for missing American servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, I'm angry and I'm sad. But there's nothing we can do now. 
It's over," Smith said. He said that the decision appears to be "a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Legion, the National League of Families and other veterans and 
family groups have objected strongly to removal of the embargo. They have 
continued to lobby the White House against the move, and some representatives 
of the groups met as recently as last week with National Security Adviser 
Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 But intense pressure for a resumption of trade came from American businesses, 
including California concerns that saw the potential rewards of trade ties to a 
nation that has long sought them. And other Americans -- including some 
veterans -- have been eager for the United States to finally heal the last 
wounds of a war that divided Americans and much of world opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura F. MacLellan, a Newport Beach banker who is president of the Export 
Managers Assn. of California, said the opening of relations will provide a 
boost for small businesses and give the Vietnamese American residents in Little 
Saigon a larger trading role. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese "still want U.S. goods," even though they have been trading 
with European nations for several years now, she said. But the delay of several 
years in opening up the markets will make it harder to switch from products 
they are now using. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County computer and health care companies are anxious to explore the 
possibility of selling to the Vietnamese. Some, such as AST Research Inc., see 
Vietnam as a natural extension of other Far East enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last week, the Senate voted 62 to 38 in a non-binding resolution that the 
United States should end the embargo "as expeditiously" as possible. By 
providing some political cover, that lopsided vote made it easier for Clinton 
to make a decision that the Administration had long leaned toward. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet because it will enrage some veterans, lifting the embargo will still be 
politically difficult for Clinton: Like many others of his generation, he 
avoided the military draft. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,200 Americans are still listed as missing from the war, but officials 
have said there are no more than a few dozen open cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.), a leading proponent of normal relations with 
Vietnam and a veteran of the war, had not heard of the decision, a spokesperson 
said. Kerry and Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war during 
the conflict, sought last week's vote as a means of encouraging Clinton to lift 
the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have made two special trips to Vietnam to discuss the issue, 
but their growing agreement in favor of ending the ban has been hinted at for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington imposed a trade embargo against North Vietnam in 1964. It extended 
the embargo to cover the whole country after South Vietnam fell to Communist 
North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Robertson Bardsley of Chatsworth, daughter of Air Force pilot Col. 
John L. Robertson, who has been missing since 1966, said lifting sanctions is a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it will damage the issue irreparably," she said. "We're giving the 
Vietnamese what they wanted without them giving us anything we wanted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'd like to see," said Bardsley, "is for President Clinton to speak with 
POW families and activists who have many years on these issues and for him to 
send a clear message that when you give back those Americans we know are alive, 
then we will normalize."

THOUSANDS OF JOBLESS BLAME QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 10,000 people lost their jobs or a portion of their wages because of 
earthquake-related damage to businesses, but the employment rate countywide 
could remain stable or even rise slightly because of a corresponding increase 
in construction jobs, officials and economists said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 10,154 people -- half of them in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys -- blamed quake damage when they filed for unemployment benefits in the 
past two weeks, state officials said. The figures do not include hundreds of 
other workers whom officials say have applied for unemployment benefits under a 
federal disaster assistance program aimed at the self-employed, who do not 
qualify for state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers in the retail sector, including shopping malls and restaurants, were 
the hardest hit by the Jan. 17 temblor, said Jack Kyser, chief economist for 
the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County, a private nonprofit 
agency affiliated with county government. 
</P>
<P>
 But the loss of those jobs could be offset by an increase in construction 
jobs, Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to come up with employment impacts yet," Kyser said. "We 
found that out after the riots. Everybody expected unemployment applications to 
surge then, but they went up by less than 1,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's overall unemployment rate had already dipped to 8.9% in 
December, down nearly a percentage point from the year before, said Jay 
Horowitz, an analyst with the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 That left about 387,000 of the county's 3.97 million workers unemployed as 
1993 rolled to a close, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the upturn, the construction trades continued to suffer, with 
about 37,000 fewer jobs late last year than the 138,000 in late 1989 -- a 26% 
drop, Kyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Construction should really boom," Horowitz said, but the exact number of jobs 
to be created cannot be determined yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some construction union officials said there is already more work because of 
the earthquake. Bill Rodgers, business manager for Plasterers Local 2 in 
Burbank, said he has sent out 80 unemployed plasterers on jobs since the quake 
toppled parking structures and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel bad about the earthquake, but it couldn't have come at a better time 
for the Southern California construction industry," Rodgers said. "There's a 
sense of optimism here that we haven't seen in several months," since the 
seasonal upswing in summer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the long-term economic effects of the quake, the impact was 
immediate at unemployment offices nearest the epicenter, from Canoga Park to 
Santa Clarita, where clerks have been working overtime or returned early from 
vacation to serve long lines of former employees of damaged shopping malls and 
restaurants for the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state unemployment office in the city of San Fernando, for instance, 
2,000 people applied for benefits in the two weeks after the quake, double the 
usual number of claims, manager Irma Flint said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts a great deal of strain on us," Flint said. "We don't have a lot of 
staff, so we are taking them (earthquake victims) in groups of 20 or giving 
them appointments to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, three shopping malls -- Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, Laurel 
Plaza and Northridge Fashion Center -- remain closed because of the quake, 
leaving about 4,000 workers unemployed at least temporarily, mall 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the upsurge in applications is a federally funded program 
that provides benefits for self-employed people and others who would otherwise 
not have been employed long enough in one job to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Blanco, 19, is one of those who lost her job as a salesclerk at the 
Fallbrook mall when her store closed to repair earthquake damage. Blanco had 
worked there for two months, not enough time to qualify for benefits under the 
usual guidelines, but the relaxed eligibility requirements have allowed her to 
receive $87 a week, just enough to feed her family and diaper her 3-month-old 
son, Walter. 
</P>
<P>
 After her Reseda apartment was red-tagged, Blanco, her boyfriend and baby were 
forced to live out of their car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel strange," Blanco said. "I never thought this would happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Mandel, 28, of Van Nuys had worked at the Broadway in Northridge 
Fashion Center for two months before the store was severely damaged in the 
quake. It may not reopen for a year, a mall spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, Mandel 
is living on $150 a week in unemployment benefits, less than half the $360 she 
earned at the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will put me behind in a lot of my bills," she said. "It's going to be 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 The maximum anyone can receive in unemployment benefits is $230 a week, which 
goes to those who made at least $30,000 a year when they were employed. 
</P>
<P>
 The application process is difficult for some people who work irregular hours, 
including Lari Benadon, 47, of Valley Village. Since the earthquake, her hours 
as a saleswoman at the Eddie Bauer store in Sherman Oaks Fashion Square have 
varied drastically. 
</P>
<P>
 The store is closed due to quake damage, but cleanup work gave her 30 hours 
last week. This week, with the store in order and no customers to wait on, 
Benadon was offered only eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Florence Hymes, 70, of Tarzana was dealt a "double whammy" after the quake. 
Her condominium not only sustained severe damage, but she lost her job as a 
salesclerk at Saks Fifth Avenue in the Promenade mall in Woodland Hills. The 
store is permanently closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The job loss has robbed her of more than her salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was my only source of income besides Social Security," Hymes said. 
"Saks was my whole life." 
</P>

RESEDA RESIDENTS TAP INTO AN EPICENTER OF CIVIC PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Some towns want a professional baseball team, others want an opera company. 
But a number of people in Reseda want their own earthquake, even if they have 
to wrestle one away from Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some seismologists now believe that the Northridge quake was really centered 
in neighboring Reseda. Not that it makes a bit of difference to the people who 
lost their lives, or even those who had to evacuate crumbling apartment 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some people in Reseda, which has long been considered the kid with 
shiny shoes of the Valley, an admission that this was not the Northridge shaker 
but the Reseda rumbler has been too slow in coming, and might even show a bias 
against the humble 6.5-square-mile community. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it's a debate without much meaning. Both communities are part of the 
city of Los Angeles, and driving south on the wide suburban streets, it's 
difficult knowing when the boundary is crossed. To most of L. A., it's all Duh 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But realtors, politicians and local newspapers have received complaints that 
Reseda, the original Hub of the Valley, where everyone once had to go to shop 
before the dawn of the Mall Age, was being snubbed, again. Eric Rose of 
Councilwoman Laura Chick's office said they received a complaint from a 
constituent worried that Reseda "would be overlooked in the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the man was assured that Reseda would get its fair share of any 
resources. Rose also said Chick has no interest in whether the quake is named 
for Northridge or Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Biafora, a Reseda realtor, said she had heard similar complaints from 
"people who want to shoot their mouth off." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Teri Canfield, the manager of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, 
cares, at least a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people now know where Northridge is," she said. "We look on that as 
a positive." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the identification of the quake with Northridge had caused her 
phones to ring off the hook. People all over the nation who want to make 
donations call the Northridge chamber to offer their plastic sheeting, diapers, 
tents and other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she would like the quake to remain in Northridge, she replied 
carefully but affirmatively: 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess, if there's no other way to do it, we will make as much positive out 
of it as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, it may be difficult to change the informal designation now that 
so much time has passed since the 6.6-magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure the identification can be changed in the minds of people since 
we've been calling it the Northridge quake since day one," said Canfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can call it whatever you want, but I'm not sure it will make any 
difference because of the tremendous destruction to the Northridge Fashion 
Center and Cal State Northridge." 
</P>
<P>
 It's true, the most graphic images of destruction associated with the quake 
occurred in Northridge, from the university's crumbling-by-degrees parking 
structure to the pancaked Northridge Meadows apartments, where 16 people died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who the heck cares?" was the response of Ann Kinzle, manager of the Reseda 
Chamber of Commerce. "Where it lands is not important." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she insisted, "It was in Reseda." 
</P>
<P>
 "The epicenter was at Wilbur and Saticoy, 16 miles down." 
</P>
<P>
 * EPICENTER DISPUTE: Regardless of the latest seismic survey, the quake will 
still be named after Northridge. A3 New Starting Point 
</P>
<P>
 Caltech's latest coordinates for the epicenter of the Northridge earthquake 
place it in Reseda. But scientists say further scismographic evidence might 
lead to another change. And they are sticking with Northridge as the name of 
the quake.
