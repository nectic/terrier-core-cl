A TIME TO DIG; NEXT TO THE SMELL OF FRESHLY TURNED EARTH, NOTHING THRILLS THE 
GARDENER LIKE GOOD DIRTY PROSE; THE ESSENTIAL EARTHMAN, BY HENRY MITCHELL 
(HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $10.95, PAPER; 244 PP.) ; GREEN THOUGHTS, BY ELEANOR PERENYI

<TEXT>
<P>
 As surely as 1776 is the date of the Declaration of Independence, or 1850 is 
the year California joined the Union, so 1981 is the best year there has ever 
been for gardening books written by Americans. I don't mean there was a record 
number of them that year. (There seems to be a record number every year.) I 
mean that two books of extraordinary quality were published. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Perenyi brought out "Green Thoughts." Henry Mitchell published "The 
Essential Earthman." Not forgetting Katharine White, Roger Swain and many 
another fine gardening writers, these two are about the best we have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green Thoughts" has stayed solidly in print since the day it was published. 
Literate gardeners (a group including, but not limited to, those who recognize 
the garden-poem allusion in her title) have had merely to stroll into a 
bookstore and buy a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 By some tragic miscalculation, however, "The Essential Earthman" was permitted 
to go out of print. But now, posthumously, it is back, in a fine new paperback 
edition. Not as fine an edition as it could have been, but still well worth 
getting. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these two writers, Perenyi has the more snob appeal. Strictly speaking, she 
is Baroness Perenyi. Born American, at 19 she married a Hungarian nobleman, and 
her first garden was at his castle. The second World War put an end to that, 
and since shortly after the war she has done her gardening in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 As you can perhaps guess from his title, Henry Mitchell lived less 
glamorously. From his birthplace in Memphis, Tenn., and after college in 
Virginia, he first moved only as far as a cotton plantation. There he spent a 
"divinely happy" year working for 40 cents an hour. Forty cents? You think that 
has to be before California entered the Union? No, it was 99 years after. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was on to Washington D.C., and most of his grown-up life he spent 
gardening, and writing about gardens warmer than Connecticut's, if not quite so 
balmy as those in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 If I had the whole of this book section, or even half of it, it would be a joy 
and a treat to compare Perenyi and Mitchell in detail. In some ways they are 
quite alike. Both have strong views on garden paths, on zinnias, on tulips, on 
what kinds of trees to allow in or anywhere near a garden. 
</P>
<P>
 In others they are quite different. For example, though both are autocrats and 
line out general rules with superb aplomb, Perenyi keeps a certain aristocratic 
distance from her readers as she leads us down the garden path. Mitchell wraps 
a warm democratic arm around each of us as he propels us just as firmly along. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Perenyi's liveliest essays is called "Woman's Place." In it, she has a 
lot to say about the very long period (in some places not over yet) where men 
kept most of the fun parts of gardening for themselves, but freely allowed 
women to do the weeding and other repetitive stuff. It is worth reading "Green 
Thoughts" just to hear in passing her account of the Hungarian farmer "who was 
the envy of the neighborhood on account of his 10 terrific daughters, who could 
and did get through twice the work of any male." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has no essay on men's and women's roles in gardens, but he does from 
time to time write very much as a man to other men, and the person he 
occasionally refers to as his "assistant" is clearly his wife. (To be fair, he 
doesn't seem to expect her to weed; he just hopes to keep her from cutting all 
his tulips and taking them inside the house.) 
</P>
<P>
 But as I don't have the whole section, I shall save the last few paragraphs 
entirely for Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing to say about him is that he has a wonderful sardonic humor. 
Suppose he wishes to convey the information that no gardener is ever entirely 
satisfied with his or her garden. Does he just blurt that out? Hardly. He says 
something like this. He has been describing the level of skill a new gardener 
reaches in about the fifth year, and the pride that gardener is apt to feel. 
Then he says this leads that person to try some more ambitious plantings, say, 
with peonies and iris. Now there's trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all right, he tells you. Just keep gardening another 40 years, and "all 
is at least in balance, and all is serene. The gardener is usually dead, of 
course. If he should live to 100, however, then needless to say it takes 
somewhat longer to achieve balance in the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Another wonderful thing is Mitchell's complete avoidance of mystique. Never 
does he say that first the intending gardener needs to take soil samples and 
send them off to a lab, and after getting the results start ordering scientific 
quantities of topsoil and expensive fertilizers. No. He says, "By and large, 
whatever soil you have will grow anything it occurs to you to grow (and a great 
deal more)." Not that he's claiming you can grow anything you want in the 
barren subsoil some developer left. He's about to tell you about the need to 
dig really big holes, and put lots of leaf mulch in them. But he does it in 
such a comradely way that you never think, "Who, me? I'm totally 
inexperienced." You think. "Sure. I can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 I said this new (and sadly posthumous) edition was a fine one, but not as fine 
as it could have been. There are two flaws. One is that the publisher skimped 
on the illustrations. They are black-and-white cuts, and they are taken from 
the original 1981 edition. But unfortunately they're reduced enough in size so 
that about half of them look like blots. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, on the cover the book is subtitled "An Expanded Edition of a Gardening 
Classic." Some expansion. There's a short well-written preface by Sarah Booth 
Conroy.Following that there's a three-page essay by Mitchell himself -- the 
last column he wrote before he died last fall. It is not up to the standard of 
the rest. From there on the expanded edition and the 1981 edition are 
identical. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. It is genuinely a classic, and it is glorious to have it back in 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Perrin also recommends: "Home Ground: A Gardener's Miscellany," by Allen 
Lacy (Houghton Mifflin) and "Second Nature: A Gardener's Education," by Michael 
Pollan (Dell).

THE GREAT HOLLYWOOD INSIDER; THE LOVE OF THE LAST TYCOON: A WESTERN, BY F. 
SCOTT FITZGERALD . EDITED BY MATTHEW J. BRUCCOLI (CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS: 
$34.95; 448 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By David Freeman, David Freeman is the author of A Hollywood Education and

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late 1930s, F. Scott Fitzgerald was in Hollywood trying to write his 
way out of debt. Perhaps because he couldn't quite make Hollywood work, it held 
a seductive power for him. Like the green light at the end of the most famous 
dock in literature, Hollywood was all the money, fun and beauty that escaped 
him. Amid the ruins of his screenwriting, there was "The Last Tycoon," as it 
has been called till now -- the novel that might have been his greatest. 
Mortality intervened. He died in December of 1940 at age 44. 
</P>
<P>
 The character of Monroe Stahr was based on Irving Thalberg, the boy wonder of 
MGM who died even younger than Fitzgerald. Today, Thalberg is best known as the 
name on a building at what has become the Sony lot. Fitzgerald long ago 
surpassed his subject in the public imagination and has become, in Cyril 
Connoly's words, "an American version of the Dying God." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel that was first published and is in print today was put together by 
Edmund Wilson from the unfinished manuscript, the author's notes and Wilson's 
own instincts. Now, Matthew J. Bruccoli, a leading expert on Fitzgerald, has 
assembled a critical edition that includes the relevant drafts, notes and 
addenda concerning Fitzgerald's notorious spelling and punctuation. And he 
gives the book a new title. Bruccoli makes the case that Fitzgerald's title was 
really Wilson's choice. Bruccoli's decision may well be right, but it's hard 
not to think Wilson did his friend a favor by plucking out the essence and 
casting off the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, Wilson criticized the Modern Language Assn. for publishing 
editions loaded down with critical apparatus. He felt that such scholarly 
undertakings tended to obscure the work, citing the French Pleiades Editions as 
an ideal mix of scholarship and text. Wilson's views were part of what 
eventually led to the Random House Library of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruccoli's introduction and account of the composition of the novel are 
sensitive and nuanced, the result of a lifetime of Fitzgerald study. He has 
published the substance of his commentary before, in the 1977 book " 'The Last 
of the Novelists': F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last Tycoon' " (now out of 
print). The reproduction of the typescript and notes ought to be the 
centerpiece of this edition, but they're murky and difficult to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Hollywood fiction is written either by or about outsiders. Typically, a 
screenwriter will fail to find satisfaction and will write an angry book in 
which the producers and executives are vulgarians or fools. Monroe Stahr, on 
the other hand, has exquisite taste and a refined sensibility. Fitzgerald wrote 
of him: "Not half a dozen men have ever been able to keep the whole equation of 
pictures in their heads." Stahr's story is narrated by Cecelia Brady, the 
college-age daughter of a studio executive. Her voice opens the novel: "Though 
I haven't ever been on the screen, I was brought up in pictures." An insider by 
birth, if not by inclination, Cecelia says: "You can take Hollywood for 
granted, like I did, or you can dismiss it with the contempt we reserve for 
what we don't understand." Her background is based on the childhood of Budd 
Schulberg, whose father was the head of production at Paramount in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot has two main threads: Stahr's struggle for control of the studio and 
his pursuit of Kathleen Moore, a young English woman who fascinates him because 
she looks like his late wife. Raymond Chandler, in a letter to his English 
publisher, said that Stahr was "magnificent when he sticks to the business of 
dealing with pictures and the people he has to use to make them; the instant 
his personal life as a love-hungry guy and exhausted man enters the picture, he 
becomes just another guy with too much money and nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
 There are two questions about the uncompleted book that bedevil anyone who 
reads it closely. What changes would Monroe Stahr have undergone had Fitzgerald 
been granted more time? Stahr is unflawed, which, as Bruccoli points out, is 
unlike the central figures of Fitzgerald's other novels. Think of the 
self-destructive nature of Amory Blaine, Anthony Patch, Jay Gatsby and Dick 
Diver. Stahr has a sense of loss about him that seems larger than grief for his 
wife. It makes him emotionally elusive and gives rise to Chandler's 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the narrator and the question of point of view. Cecelia, unlike 
Nick Carraway in "Gatsby," is not present for important sequences. Fitzgerald 
spoke to the issue in a letter to his publisher and a magazine editor: "I shall 
grant myself the privilege, as Conrad did, of letting (Cecelia) imagine the 
actions of the characters. Thus I hope to get the verisimilitude of a first 
person narrative, combined with a God-like knowledge of all events that happen 
to my characters." Just because Cecelia's not there doesn't mean she can't 
construct a legitimate version of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It has always seemed to me that "Gatsby" suffers from Fitzgerald doing 
back-flips to get Nick into scenes so that he can narrate them. "Gatsby" was 
written by a man in his 20s. Fifteen years later, Fitzgerald was ready for a 
more daring narrative leap. There are problems with his strategy, but none so 
great that one can't assume that Fitzgerald wouldn't have found a voice that 
accounted for Cecelia's point of view without limiting the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald was also aware of secondary problems. It's hard to know what Stahr 
sees in Kathleen. Fitzgerald's note here reads: "Where will the warmth come 
from in this. Why does he think she's warm. . . . My girls were all so warm and 
full of promise. . . . What can I do to make honest and different." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen was modeled on Fitzgerald's companion Sheilah Graham. He was at her 
apartment on North Hayward at the end. In "Beloved Infidel," Graham's account 
of their relationship, she recalls that he had been reading the papers and 
eating chocolate bars. He had been telling her that if the book was successful 
they would travel together. "If ever I get out of this mess, I'll make it up to 
you, Sheilo." Then he stood up, tried to steady himself on the mantelpiece and 
fell dead on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald originally planned a work of 40,000 words. He left more than that, 
and by his own accounting, was less than halfway through the story. The 
embryonic quality of the novel is unmistakable, yet passages of insight or 
beauty often break through. The book has marvelous set pieces, vivid cinematic 
images and sustained invention: The earthquake (based on the 1933 Long Beach 
quake) and the mess it makes at the studio, "The Producer's Day" in which we 
follow Stahr through his business dealings, and the celebrated "nickel for the 
movies" speech in which Stahr shows an English novelist (based on Aldous 
Huxley) why, despite the fellow's misgivings, he does have an aptitude for 
screenwriting, are a few of the reasons the book endures, no matter which 
edition is at hand.

WHY?; THE UNQUIET GHOST: RUSSIANS REMEMBER STALIN, BY ADAM HOCHSCHILD (VIKING: 
$22.95; 304 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Olga Andreyev Carlisle, Olga Carlisle's most recent book is Under a New Sky: 
A Reunion With Russia (Ticknor & Fields). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Why are you doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Hochschild heard this question often in the course of his 1991 search for 
surviving victims and executioners of the mass terror orchestrated in the USSR 
in the 1930s by Stalin. Why, Russians wanted to know, would an American 
journalist armed only with a knowledge of their language and a tape recorder 
assign himself this story? Why now, 60 years after Stalin set up the killing 
machine that would destroy 20 million of his countrymen, now when only a 
handful of witnesses survive, and when new threats loom? 
</P>
<P>
 Western readers may echo these questions. Why should we be led once again 
through the cemeteries of the Russian Revolution? Hasn't Robert Conquest shown 
us the Great Purges? Alexander Solzhenitsyn the Gulag Archipelago? Nadezhda 
Mandelstam the plight of the intellectual under Lenin and Stalin? Evguenia 
Ginzburg the day to day strategies of survival in camp? What is left in the 
'90s for an American writer, an outsider, to see and to report? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is to be found in the absorbing pages of "The Unquiet Ghost" in the 
narrow window of time available to the Stalinist reign of terror. From previous 
visits he knew that for at least three decades after the death of Stalin in 
1953, silence had prevailed throughout the USSR. Few survivors spoke to 
foreigners. Secret police files were sealed. Only with the first intimations of 
glasnost in the mid-80s did signs appear of a yearning to break the silence, to 
unburden the collective past, to stake the ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991 glasnost, which means "giving voice," was in full cry. The problem was 
that now that testimony was being sought there were few alive to offer it. 
Hochschild set about to find them. 
</P>
<P>
 His journey would take him from Moscow to Siberia, back to Moscow -- where for 
the first time the interrogation transcripts files of several American-born 
victims of the Great Purge would be opened -- back again to Siberia, and 
finally to the most dreaded corner of the gulag, on the Arctic circle in 
northeastern Siberia: Kolyma. 
</P>
<P>
 In this search he would sometimes be aided by members of Memorial (pronounced 
Memori-AL), a loose-knit, widespread organization founded in 1987 and devoted 
to the opening up of official archives of the secret police and to the 
recording and cross-referencing of data about its millions of victims. Of the 
several hundred interviews taped along the way, Hochschild chooses a few, the 
most telling, each showing a different aspect of the dissolution of the 
Revolution into terror and death, the liquidation of whole generations of 
citizens most useful to the state. We meet victims and executioners -- and 
those who can only be said to be both. 
</P>
<P>
 A powerful metaphor for the impossibility of burying the Stalinist past was 
the gruesome discovery at a town on the river Ob in 1979, when spring flooding 
and erosion exposed a mass grave in the bank under the former NKVD 
headquarters. "These corpses lay at the bottom of the grave, whose floor was 
the great sheet of permafrost that underlies most of Siberia. In addition, the 
soil dumped on top of them was dry, sandy, and laced with lime as a 
disinfectant. The bodies had not decomposed; half-frozen, they had been 
mummified." The authorities made desperate efforts to conceal the horror, and 
Hochschild records the recollections of the townspeople, including those of the 
daughter of the NKVD regional chief responsible for the thousand murders more 
than 40 years before. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere we meet Vladimir Glebov, a teacher of philosophy, former prison and 
camp inmate, reader of Emily Dickinson, the "most alive" person the author 
encountered. Glebov owed his life to changing his name: his father was Lev 
Kamenev, a principal Bolshevik leader and early victim of the Great Purges. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most wrenching scene in "The Unquiet Ghost" takes place in a KGB 
office in Moscow. Anxious to demonstrate the "new look" of their agency, KGB 
officers have opened certain files for Hochschild and a friend. One of those 
files is that of Arthur Talent, whose misfortune was to be born in the United 
States. At the time of his interrogation in 1938 he was 21. From the questions 
and his responses one can feel his mounting fear, follow his hopeless 
strategies to avoid implicating others in nonexistent conspiracies, and see him 
finally dissolve in terror, confessing to preposterous crimes, until the 
interrogation is interrupted, and, as the records show, he is taken to be shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of "The Unquiet Ghost" combines the strengths of a practiced 
investigative reporter with those of a philosopher-historian with a sensitive 
moral compass and the spirit of an enlightened 18th-Century gentleman. He 
shares with the reader his fascination with the deepest (and most often 
debated) historical and ethical questions: Were the Great Purges of the '30s 
and their aftermath the handiwork of Stalin alone, or was the entire Soviet 
Union in collusion with him? Was the deliberate murder of millions of victims 
known to be innocent the ultimate assertion of his power? Or the executions of 
the executioners, the Revolution devouring its own? Or was it the systematic 
perversion of the notions of innocence and guilt, good and evil, and finally 
the assertion of control over logic itself? 
</P>
<P>
 Of special interest to Hochschild is the question of how the Stalinist 
genocide compares with others, notably the Holocaust and the Spanish 
Inquisition. In terms of numbers of victims, many of whom were Communists like 
himself, Stalin may well have been the most murderous tyrant in world history. 
</P>
<P>
 Hochschild writes extensively of the phenomenon of denial during and after the 
long period of terror. He pays tribute to the "small band of clear-seers," 
notably Nadezhda Mandelstam. He himself is a prescient moralist: "We want so 
hard to believe that heroic resistance to evil is always possible, that there 
still can be angels in a world run by sharks. After all, what about Gandhi, 
Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela? Of course you can always resist evil. 
But to resist and have a chance of surviving is a different matter." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Unquiet Ghost" makes an important contribution to our post- glasnost 
awareness of the former Soviet Union's harrowing past -- and of its unsettled 
present. Belonging to a literary genre, which has flourished for centuries, 
that of "The Voyage of Russia" by a Western observer, it is an illuminating 
excursion led by a highly qualified guide. As Nadezhda Mandelstam once wrote: 
"We have to get over our loss of memory. This is the first task . . . otherwise 
there will be no way ahead."

RICHARD EDER: A VENT IN THE PARK; THE COLLECTED STORIES, BY GRACE PALEY 
(FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: $27.50; 368 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anger does for Grace Paley what love did for Dante's Beatrice; it makes her 
speak. But Paley's anger, at its best, is no more a rant or preachment than 
Beatrice's love was a burble. A few of these "Collected Stories" are thinly 
didactic with only one or two relieving grace notes; a few others are gnomic to 
the point of clenching and evaporating. 
</P>
<P>
 These are slips of a chisel that channels through hard rock. The channels 
gleam. Paley, now 71, is a feminist going back to the '50s when she started 
writing. Many of her stories evoke a radical New York Jewish milieu where the 
talk, no doubt, was of great things but the women, joining in, were still 
expected to tend infant male bottoms and full-grown male egos. The women in 
Paley's stories are partway along in revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 They have divorced once or twice, taken lovers, struggled to support 
themselves and their husband-less families, and fought in activist causes -- 
while still cherishing their children, the men they live with, and their old 
and sick parents. They are the burdened rope bridges between two certainties: a 
past and traditional female generation and a younger, feminist generation on 
which the past weighs hardly at all. This is precarious; on the other hand, the 
view from a rope bridge is unhampered. Swaying, furthermore, is rather like 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Paley's characters, refusing to detach entirely from any part of their 
contradictions, are in a sense imprisoned by them. Some of Paley's writing is 
immured in realistic quandary, but often her voice, like a small dynamite 
charge, breaks jail. It is an eclectic voice, by turns disruptive and lyrical. 
</P>
<P>
 Her older generation speaks warm and sharp, in tones finely inflected by 
immigrant Russian and Yiddish. Her contemporaries, moving with her from their 
30s to their 60s (Faith, a recurring character, is Paley's alter ego and even 
looks like her), speak in the nervy patterns of the present-day educated 
classes. Under stress, the patterns distort into the kind of hyper-real 
connections and disconnections that Donald Barthelme and William Gaddis were 
experimenting with at roughly the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Paley has a gift for uniting a far-out image with highly local pain and anger. 
In an early story, set perhaps in the 1920s and more folkloric than the 
author's later work, Rosie, the heroine, persists in her scandalous and 
ultimately successful attachment to a married star of the Yiddish theater. 
Phrases tumble out that begin with amiable comedy and intensify into something 
quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a samovar already," says Rosie, refusing more tea. Told that her actor's 
mother nursed him until he was 6, she protests: "She must have had shredded 
wheat there, not breasts, poor woman." And when, in middle age, her conformist 
sister condescends to her, she bursts out: "If there was more life in my 
younger sister, she would know my heart is a regular college of feelings, and 
there is such information between my corset and me that her whole married life 
is a kindergarten." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Loudest Voice" a Jewish husband and wife ruminate and complain about a 
Christmas play at the public school. These are pre-activist years; the tone is 
a mixture of pain and acceptance. But for the daughter, chosen over the 
mumbling Gentile children for her piercing delivery, there is exultation, a 
determination to prevail. "I expected to be heard," she tells herself. "My 
voice was certainly the loudest." 
</P>
<P>
 As Paley's writing moves from sharply focused social and psychological pieces 
to ones that are more complex and diffuse, it is still the blinding and 
revealing phrase that pulls us in. In "Two-Part Story," Faith, once or twice 
divorced -- her particular circumstances shift somewhat through half a dozen 
stories -- lives with a lover who tries to be friends with her two sons. He 
roughhouses so ineptly with them that they all get slightly hurt. He blames 
her; she throws an ashtray, taking a bit off his ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Later her smallest son, Tonto, wants to snuggle: "I love you, Mama," he says. 
"Love," she answers. "Oh love, Anthony. I know." She has had plenty of love, 
what she needs is a life. Yet, watching the light come through the blinds, she 
thinks: "Through the short fat fingers of my son . . . my heart lit up in 
stripes." 
</P>
<P>
 That is not reconciliation. There is nothing reconciled about this striped 
writer who rages at the way women have been victimized by their instincts, and 
refuses to deny the instincts or abstract them. Not explicitly erotic, her 
stories about Faith and her friends are as full of sex as they are of politics 
and protest. Sometimes her women succumb, sometimes they are the instigators. 
In one story, the Faith-character acquires a cabdriver, much younger, and a 
pregnancy. Instead of letting him move in, she turns her apartment into a 
commune for pregnant girls, and allows him to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the succumbing is disastrous nor all the seeking successful. Her 
female sexuality is not male sexuality in a skirt; her women are round and 
pointed. They love men for men's needs as well as for their own. It is a 
contradiction, not a synthesis. It takes great creative power to keep such 
contradictions going, and often Paley will slip off to one side or another, 
sometimes too easily. Consistency is no more her hobgoblin than it is a rodeo 
rider's; she stays seated only for a few moments, but what terrific moments 
they can be! 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, men are only sometimes the point. The points are many: work, 
children, the discovery in middle age of who one's parents really are. Some of 
the most subtle and penetrating of her stories are about visits to a mother or 
father in a hospital or nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 This collection unites three earlier ones, published in 1959, 1974 and 1985. 
The third ("Later the Same Day") shows signs of flagging; a number of the 
stories are slight or almost routine. Yet it also contains what I think is 
Paley's masterpiece. "Zagrowsky Tells" reverses her usual form. It is told from 
the point of view not of a woman but a man; in this case a retired pharmacist 
taking his little grandson for a walk in the park. The boy is illegitimate, the 
son of Zagrowsky's mentally impaired daughter and the black gardener in her 
sanatorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagrowsky is an extreme exemplar of the prejudices of an older generation of 
New York Jews. In his pharmacy he would yell at, or at least snub, any black 
customers who wandered in. He was, in fact, the object of a picket by a group 
of liberal white neighbors -- Faith and her friends among them. Now he meets 
some of them after many years. The confrontation is rich, poignant and fierce. 
It is governed not by the spirit of irony, per se, but by the spirit of the 
supreme ironist. It is time, finally, that is Paley's crowning theme, turning, 
as a kaleidoscope does, the same pieces into new patterns; changing them 
utterly.

A VIEW FROM THE HIGH WIRE; THE CIRCUS OF THE EARTH AND THE AIR, BY BROOKE 
STEVENS (HARCOURT BRACE & CO.: $23.95, 410 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Ulin, David Ulin is book editor of the Los Angeles Reader, and the 
author of Cape Cod Blues (Red Dust), a book of poems. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've never liked the circus. Even as a child, I saw it as a place of terror, 
not mirth, with contortionists and sideshow freaks performing grotesque, 
unnatural acts, and the red gashes of paint that outlined the clowns' mouths 
looking less like smiles than open wounds. To my mind, there was always a 
dangerous quality about the Big Top, a horrible nightmare world taking shape in 
the shadows, which was all the more frightening because it tapped into 
something -- archetypal memories, perhaps -- that seemed to exist within me, as 
well. It was as if the circus represented a curious parallel universe, primeval 
and symbolic, residing beneath the placid surface of everyday reality, but able 
to reach out and pull us into the maelstrom at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Stevens' first novel, "The Circus of the Earth and the Air," unfolds in 
such a universe, where logic derives from intuition, and nothing is what it 
seems. The book opens simply enough, as schoolteacher Alex Barton and his wife, 
Iris, frolic in the Atlantic Ocean off the Martha's Vineyard-like island of 
Verre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bartons are delightfully happy; watching Iris in the water, Alex thinks of 
"how much he loved her and how strange and lucky it was that they were 
together." But their happiness is short-lived, for no sooner do they return to 
shore than they discover "a tall circular tent, a circus tent with red, yellow, 
and blue stripes on its roof." Because they don't have enough money for 
admission, Iris volunteers to participate in the circus's disappearing act, 
where she is put into a wooden coffin and set on fire. When the smoke clears, 
she is gone, and by the next morning, the circus itself has vanished too, along 
with any trace that it was ever there. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex's quest to find his wife becomes the engine that drives this novel, which 
moves from Verre to Manhattan to an uncharted Atlantic island to the Deep South 
and finally back to Verre, an itinerary that, like the circus it hopes to track 
down, is circular, "defined by the ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he begins by going to the authorities, pretty soon Alex is on his 
own, making deductions from whatever incidental evidence he can uncover, 
evidence that mostly takes the form of anecdotes, things overheard or glimpsed 
from the corner of his eye. A policeman encourages him to pay attention to his 
dreams; a waitress introduces him to a man who talks about the Great Volenti, 
on whose private island of Cea an army guards a hollowed-out mountain full of 
circus performers who worship the stage as if it were a God. By themselves, 
these details are little more than hints, rumors, with no specific connection 
to Iris or her fate. But when Alex sneaks onto Cea and joins first the army and 
then the circus in the mountain, he starts to see the world in a new way, and 
to understand that his search, while ostensibly for the woman he loves, is 
really a pursuit of the essence of his being. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, quest novels can be difficult, since, for them to function, we must 
believe in the importance of the object being sought, as well as the characters 
and situations of the narrative itself. But for the most part, Stevens gets the 
job done because of the straightforward way he tells what is, at times, a 
difficult story, in which meaning is always a step ahead of us, and the true 
nature of things is not revealed until the end. 
</P>
<P>
 One way he does this is by using a flat, affectless prose that reports what's 
going on simply and without reaction, registering little surprise at the most 
fantastic turns of plot; another is by anchoring his book in the living details 
of the world. Thus, locations like New York and Mississippi are described to 
evoke their real identities, and the mystical island of Cea -- with its 
strange, faceless army and its subterranean circus -- also becomes an 
environment we can see, where the circus and its menagerie must be properly 
ventilated for the performers and animals to survive, and in Volenti's study 
hangs a framed, handwritten letter from Franklin Roosevelt, thanking him for 
his "contributions regarding troop movement" during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally important is Steven's conception of the circus as a spiritual force, 
an almost religious discipline that demands of its adherents the devotion of 
true believers. Even the secret army of Cea is but a training ground for 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most fascinating and unexpected aspects of "The Circus of the Earth 
and the Air" is Alex's transformation from teacher to tightrope walker, from a 
man who once fled the stage in absolute fear to an acrobat who, "(c)arrying a 
plate of his favorite meal, macaroni, . . . will cross to the center of the 
tightwire, make himself comfortable, and enjoy his dinner." When it comes to 
describing the dynamics of a circus -- the way performers interact with one 
another, and the dedication they bring to their skills -- Stevens knows his 
stuff; he worked for years as a tiger groom with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & 
Bailey, and he's clearly spent a lot of time considering what the whole thing 
means. His ideas on the subject heighten the significance of Alex's experience, 
providing a context in which he can hunt for Iris both physically and 
spiritually, while at the same time coming to terms with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, however, Stevens's philosophical discussions of "the ring" -- 
which pebble "The Circus of the Earth and the Air" like rocks in an open field 
-- represent the one major area where the novel stumbles, veering from 
narrative into rhetoric, fiction into cant. After all, while I'm sure that for 
many performers, "there's an emptiness, a yearning inside . . . that only the 
ring can eliminate," it seems an overstatement to claim that "circuses are 
sanity, pure sanity . . . it is only after your eyes become a circus that you 
can see your life as it really is." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, such passages read like justifications, as if Stevens were trying to 
make his point with too much force. More apropos, I think, is Volenti's 
sentiment: "Never trust a circus, never, never, never trust a circus! . . . 
They'll tell you one thing and they'll do another. They take pride in their 
dirty lies. . . . Never believe a word a circus tells you! . . . To rely on a 
circus for anything is unforgivable, a mistake, a terrible unforgivable 
mistake. . . ."

COVER STORY: THE QUEST FOR 'CHRISTY'; THE STORY OF AN INDEPENDENT YOUNG TEACHER 
MADE THE BESTSELLER LISTS 27 YEARS AGO -- THIS WEEK IT LANDS ON CBS' LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Persistence can pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask producer Ken Wales. For the past 17 years he's struggled to bring 
Catherine Marshall's 1967 bestseller "Christy" to the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 His exhaustive efforts have something to show for this week: "Christy" 
premieres as a new CBS series, shot on location in Townsend, Tenn., and 
starring Kellie Martin ("Life Goes On") as the plucky heroine of the title and 
Tyne Daly as the stalwart Quaker missionary, Miss Alice Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christy" was an instant critical and commercial success when first published, 
spending 39 weeks on the New York Times Best Seller list. Needless to say, 
Hollywood took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Studios entered into a heated bidding war back in '67 for the rights to the 
charming, inspirational tale about a 19-year-old girl who left her home in 
Asheville, N.C., in 1912 to teach school in the Tennessee wilds of the Smoky 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 MGM bought the rights and, in 1969, the studio was deep in pre-production on 
the film version. Guy Green of "A Patch of Blue" fame was set to direct. Isobel 
Lennart ( "Funny Girl") was writing the screenplay. Every picture in 
development, though, was suddenly canceled when MGM was sold and a new 
administration took over. "Christy" was sent to the basement to languish in 
oblivion until Wales ("Islands in the Stream," "The Wild Rovers") rescued her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny is the son of a minister," says "Christy" co-executive producer Barney 
Rosenzweig ("Cagney & Lacey," "The Trials of Rosie O'Neill"). "He's one of the 
sweetest human beings I have ever met. He cared deeply about this material. He 
knew Catherine Marshall. The herculean thing he did was to wrest this away from 
the company who had it. To wrest something away from one of those companies, to 
get them to agree to sell something that they were so heavily vested in, is 
virtually impossible. The fact that Kenny got it away from MGM Studios 
impressed me. I understood that passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Wales' "Christy" quest began in 1969. He was at MGM producing the musical "She 
Loves Me," a vehicle for Julie Andrews to be directed by Blake Edwards, when 
the studio was sold. The "Christy" production office was just down the hall 
from his own office on the lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Wales, a fan of "Christy," forgot about the novel until one day in 1976. While 
on the campus of the Bel Air Presbyterian Church, he saw a poster advertising 
Catherine Marshall's upcoming speech at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right on the spot, I thought, 'Whatever happened to "Christy"?' I raced to a 
bookstore, found a copy and didn't put it down for two days. When I finished, 
it was the most extraordinary feeling. I knew it was so good. It was such rich, 
deep, meaningful material that I had to do something about it. I couldn't wait 
to get on the phone with MGM." 
</P>
<P>
 The studio, though, put him on hold. "They said 'Christy' is in the basement 
and was not for sale. They owned it in perpetuity." Wales wouldn't take no for 
an answer. He got Marshall's phone number from her New York book editor. Much 
to his relief, she was overjoyed hearing of his plans to revive "Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 "With that began a lifelong friendship," Wales says. "We cared about each 
other so much. Our theology and our ideas of life were so meshed, it was just 
like sharing something with a partner. We tried to do all sorts of things to 
get it from MGM. They knew they had a good property, so it was better to bury 
it rather than have it go out with egg on their face and have someone else make 
it successful. I invested a lot of money into the attempts and the legal work. 
But I believed in it." 
</P>
<P>
 During this time, Wales also became friends with Marshall's mother, Leonora 
Wood, who was the model for "Christy." 'I videotaped her. I had the rich 
experience of talking to her about what it was like to teach in this one-room 
school house." 
</P>
<P>
 After Marshall died in 1983, Wales thought it was perhaps time to let go of 
his dreams of obtaining "Christy." But fate wouldn't allow him. While attending 
church one Sunday in 1985, he saw an MGM executive, Frank Davis, sitting in a 
nearby pew. After the service, Davis informed Wales that "Christy" might be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank said, 'Listen, carefully. There is a window here. Ted Turner is buying 
the studio and there is an opening. It will be expensive.' I went out and 
mortgaged the house and made the option. It began to take effect in 1986. I 
began to really set aside everything and stayed focused on 'Christy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wales was thwarted in his numerous attempts to get it made as a 
feature. He was reluctant to have it made for television, even after receiving 
a tempting offer from CBS in 1991 to turn it into a miniseries. "I was still 
hurting from not being able to do it as a feature film. I felt I couldn't quite 
let it go as a miniseries for TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter good friend Rosenzweig. The two had gone to USC together and produced 
the 1981 miniseries "East of Eden." For years, Wales had tried to get 
Rosenzweig interested in "Christy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me the book a couple of times, but I could never get past that 
paperback cover with the purple lettering," Rosenzweig says, laughing. "It 
wasn't my cup of tea. I was doing 'Cagney & Lacey' and 'The Trials of Rosie 
O'Neill.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, though, Rosenzweig met with CBS President Jeff Saganksy. One of 
the topics they discussed was the surprise success of the network's Saturday 
evening rural series, "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to Jeff about it and commenting on the success of the show," 
says Rosenzweig, who produced the '60s frontier series "Daniel Boone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to pitch ideas and he listened to them very nicely and said, 'You 
know what I have always wanted to make? Did you ever hear of a book named 
'Christy?' I said, 'Sure. A friend of mine owns it. I will get it for you.' I 
called up Ken and said it's time to make the movie. It's time to stop 
fantasizing about what it might be. Let's make it for television. So we put 
together a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosenzweig finally read the book. Much to his surprise, he discovered 
"Christy" had a lot in common with the urban, contemporary Chris Cagney, Mary 
Beth Lacey and Rosie O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put my own spin on it. This is a woman for the '90s. The '80s were about 
taking and ambitions and pushing. The '90s are about giving something back. 
That's what Christy does. Christy is the first member of the Peace Corps. I 
love her. I think she is just a wonderful and exciting and independent young 
woman. She fits right into my rogues' gallery of successful independent women." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenzweig feels the time is right for "Christy." "If it doesn't succeed in 
this incarnation, I don't know if it ever could," he says. "Every sign is there 
that this is what the audience wants. This could be the answer to the reaction 
to what has been on TV and what has been on the movie screen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wales is thrilled his dream has become a reality. "A lot of people have read 
'Christy' and it has changed their lives," he says. "I have letters from people 
who entered the ministry or became a doctor or joined the Peace Corps because 
they read the book. You know, I have given away a lot of books. If sharing that 
book with just one person helped them to find meaning or a better life, it is 
worth every struggle I have been through." 
</P>
<P>
 "Christy" premieres Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS and moves to its regular time slot 
Thursday at 8 p.m

 In "An Infant Science" (March 6), author Nancy Wartik peppers her piece on the 
exciting advances in assisted reproduction with a pervasive pessimism. I am 
pleased that the writer did not have the opportunity to tell Nancy Kerrigan 
what the odds were against her winning an Olympic medal. Couples who pursue 
assisted reproduction despite the odds do so because it represents the 
culmination of their lives' hopes and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 But couples planning to use assisted fertilization techniques should 
thoroughly investigate each center they consider, a task now made easier by the 
Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, the first medical group to make 
statistical information available directly to consumers.

 Those who feel guilty about being unable to conceive might do well to reflect 
on the population explosion. Scientists tell us that by the year 2010 the 
Earth's resources will be so depleted that the planet will be able to support 
only 2 billion people, with the world's population already closing in on the 
6-billion mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings, supposedly the Earth's most intelligent species, are in imminent 
danger of reproducing themselves out of existence. Rather than encourage 
fertility labs, we should outlaw them.

 Thank you for the unbiased view of the fertility industry. My husband and I 
have been there, and it was not a positive experience. When we decided to stop, 
the staff at the clinic attempted to make us feel like failures. It was very 
difficult to obtain accurate statistics on success rates. The clinic we worked 
with advertised a caring staff "who feel your pain." They were also the most 
manipulative, aggressive salespeople I have ever met. 
</P>
<P>
 I intend to carry a copy of your article with me to give to well-meaning 
acquaintances who ask why we don't have children, and then proceed to talk 
about "the wonderful things doctors are doing these days."

 Line dancing has revived the old country-Western dancing traditions, and has 
given formerly undanceable tunes a whole new market ("The Teutonic Two-Step 
Blues," Palm Latitudes, March 6).Having lived through the Twist, the Jerk and 
too many years of polyester-clad disco, I'm glad there is line dancing. No more 
do I fear being slammed into or tripping over someone spinning on his back on 
the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since the Bunny-Hop has a dance brought so many people back to dance 
floors everywhere. If those so-called country-Western musicians want to fill 
concert seats, their music had better be easy to listen to and easy to dance 
to.

CHASING THEIR TALES; THE LONGINGS OF WOMEN, BY MARGE PIERCY (FAWCETT: $22; 455 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pauli Carnes, Pauli Carnes is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Longings of Women," Marge Piercy's latest novel, we meet three women, 
each unhappy in her own way. 
</P>
<P>
 Leila is a college professor in her mid-40s. As the book begins, her husband 
is out of town directing a play and, as is his wont, shacking up with one of 
the young actresses in the company, an arrangement of convenience that Leila 
has condoned throughout their 24 years of married life. Within the first few 
pages Leila's best friend dies of breast cancer and with the demise of this, 
her bulwark, Leila's life begins to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary is Leila's cleaning woman, once a middle-class housewife. When her 
husband left her for another woman she began a slide that has left her 
homeless, though she hides that fact from her clients and her two adult 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky is an ambitious young woman from the wrong side of the tracks who is 
clawing her way up the social strata. Her climb is interrupted by the murder of 
her husband, for which she is arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lives intersect when Leslie agrees to write a book about Becky's case. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three seems able to discern the difference between appearance and 
essence. Leila thinks because her husband always comes back that she has a 
viable marriage. Mary thinks because she knew how her husband liked his eggs 
cooked, and a thousand other details of his preferences, that she deserved 
better than to be dumped. Becky confuses having good furniture with having a 
good life. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one of these three asks herself one question about what part she might 
have played, what decisions she was responsible for, in creating her unhappy 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Leila's professional field of expertise is imprisoned and abused women, no 
doubt because she identifies with their plight, imprisoned by her neediness in 
an abusive relationship. No one in her life has apparently suggested therapy 
for her obvious problems. Whether it be flying to the aid of a sister who 
doesn't need or welcome her help, just because their mother asked her to; or 
having dinner with her estranged husband and his girlfriend because her son 
asked her to; or never asking the lunk to sleep alone when he's on the road, 
this woman has no center. Worse, she has "spousified" her college-age son, 
discussing marital difficulties that no child should be burdened with -- 
although emotionally isolated people do this to their children all the time; 
one hopes that someone will refer him for therapy when he reaches midlife. He 
will no doubt need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Leila and Mary are haunted by the threat to their marriages of younger, 
thinner women; and indeed, both are deserted for younger, thinner women. This 
struck me as somewhat quaint. Almost without exception the marital bust-ups I 
know of over the past several years have been women leaving men. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary rehearses her woes, as, evidently, she once kept house -- obsessively. 
Her daughter has little time for her, busy with husband and children; my 
impression was that the author wants us to find the daughter heartlessly cold 
toward her other, but given Mary's obsessive-compulsive nature, the younger 
woman may need that much breathing room -- may have needed it all her life. 
Mary's son has moved halfway around the world from his mother. Hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 And oh, the men in this book, what a sorry lot: murderous; alcoholic; 
self-indulgent; irresponsible; immature; emotionally stunted; shiftless; 
abusive; adulterous; uncaring. They're seducers, users, betrayers, rapists, 
blackmailers -- a miserable bunch of subhuman beings. They desert pregnant 
women and they don't pay child support. One young fellow who seems to be a nice 
enough guy is running drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Leila's mother is in a lesbian relationship and declares it "the best marriage 
I ever had." Leila's husband reminds her repeatedly that she "doesn't like 
men." But in this book, what's to like? In more than one instance, women mate 
with women not out of biological predisposition, but out of disgust and 
disappointment with men; i.e., as second choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall tone that suffuses this book is female self-pity, or perhaps it is 
better termed author pity. From academic circles to the women's jail, most 
everything these gals have suffered has been because of some darn man. In the 
main this book takes place inside the head of one or the other of these women; 
their external lives are sketched in only lightly. Yet not one of these women 
acknowledges any responsibility for what her life has become. They were just 
doing the best they could, poor innocent victims that they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Piercy leaves us with some ostensibly happy endings, but her characters have 
neither questioned nor outgrown their basic desperate neediness. Manipulators 
still believe they must wait and watch and play into the fantasies of other 
people to assure their own acceptance and survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the answer to the problem of depending on a man's affectionate 
attention in order to feel good about her body is not for a woman to do those 
things that contribute to feeling good from the inside out: exercise, eat well, 
or just count her blessings for a strong, healthy body. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the answer is a new, improved lover, a lover ex machina , slightly rumpled 
-- Peter Coyote in the movie version -- himself wounded in love so he's a 
really sensitive, understanding kind of guy. The most sanguine heterosexual 
relationship in this book looks to the future with the fervent declaration: "We 
can just grub along and try to love each other." 
</P>
<P>
 But the one great shortcut to a happy ending, Piercy suggests, is to live 
without men. Get rid of your man and you get rid of your problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the book each woman is still looking for affirmation from an 
outside source; each looking, ironically, outside herself to find 
self-acceptance. None of these characters seems to have a "longing" to feel 
secure to reach out to life, to others, with a sense that in herself she has 
value, is worth knowing, is inherently lovable; to live buoyed with the 
confidence that she has a rightful place in the world, and that her gifts will 
make a place for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrily we grub along.

KELLIE GOES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kellie Martin was planning on taking a vacation from acting before beginning 
Yale University this August. 
</P>
<P>
 But she changed those plans after reading the pilot script of the new CBS 
series "Christy," based on the late Catherine Marshall's bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read the script, I thought, 'Whoever gets this I'm going to hate 
because it's the part of a lifetime,' " Martin says with a giggle. "It takes a 
lot to get me excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially because her previous series, ABC's "Life Goes On," was so special 
to her. "It would take a very incredible project to make me as excited as 'Life 
Goes On.' I was thrilled with this and especially thrilled when I got the 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 Set in Tennessee's Smoky Mountains in 1912, "Christy" follows the adventures 
of a well-bred, educated 19-year-old woman who leaves the security of her 
comfortable home in Asheville, N.C., and moves to a poverty-stricken backwoods 
settlement to teach its children. The novel, which was published in 1967 and 
has sold more than 8 million copies, is based on the life of Marshall's mother, 
Leonora Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 18, didn't read Marshall's book until she got the part. "It's such a 
charming book," she says with enthusiasm. "They gave the book to me after the 
audition. It's such an incredible study for Christy. She's on every page of it. 
It just gave me a wonderful grasp of the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
 She also read several books on the Smoky Mountains and Southern women of that 
era. Filming on location in the Smokys also has helped her get into the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are basically in the middle of nowhere," Martin explains. "All the sets 
and clothes are from 1912 and all the props are from 1912. You put a corset on 
and you are just there!" 
</P>
<P>
 Martin says she put in very long hours on the show, which begins as a two-hour 
pilot movie Sunday night. "It's basically like shooting a film. The reason why 
it's hard shooting this is that we were on location and everything is shot 
outside. We don't have any studios, so we are at the mercy of the sun and the 
rain and the noise all around us. We basically have to roll with the punches. 
There are constantly animals running throughout the shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy-nominated actress has discovered similarities between Christy and the 
contemporary Becca, the resilient teen-ager whose boyfriend (Chad Lowe) was 
dying of AIDS on "Life Goes On." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have the same kind of courage," Martin says. "Christy comes to 
the backwoods of Tennessee from Asheville. That in itself, to pick up and go on 
this mission, is just incredibly courageous. Then when she gets there, the 
people don't accept her. She is courageous and very joyful. I don't think Becca 
was as joyful. Becca has more of a dark side, but they are (both) very 
accepting and very enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin doesn't think she could have done what Christy did some 80 years ago. 
"I could have lived in Asheville in 1912," she says. "But she's faced with 
these horrible situations. She's been shot at. She's been in such frightening 
situations. I don't know if I could have lived back then. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 There are days when Martin is homesick for her family in Los Angeles. "But I 
have been so lucky," she says warmly. "I remind myself every day. I have been 
blessed with two strong characters and have been given stories to sink my teeth 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyday on 'Life Goes On' I was challenged. Everyday I would think, 'I am 
not going to handle this,' especially the scenes with AIDS. Everyday on this I 
think, 'How can I do this? This is hard stuff.' But you just take it one day at 
a time. I have been trying to deal with it. I have been rising to the 
occasion." SUSAN KING

 CULTURAL REVOLUTION by Norman Wong (Persea Books: $21; 177 pp.) Over the last 
10 or so years, collections of short stories linked by the same characters have 
become a kind of sub-genre.Norman Wong's, "Cultural Revolution" is mostly 
concerned with Michael, who is gay and Chinese. We see him at various stages of 
his life trying to come to terms with his sexuality and family; a hostile 
father, a frightened crackly mother, withdrawn older sister. The book also 
moves through the past into his parent's first meeting, and the childhood of 
Wei, Michael's father. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's writing can be incredibly evocative, such as this description of 
orchids: "Earlike shapes of colors that are not quite colors, pinks brighter 
than pink, dark whites, and yellows. . . . The larger flowers shoot upwards; 
the smaller ones rain down in clusters. Michael waits for them to make a sound. 
In their clay pots, tightly twined twigs hold down their veiny, hard roots, so 
much like scary fingers." Ironically, the strongest pieces here are the few 
without Michael. "Robbed," a quiet heartbreaker of a story is about his parents 
repeatedly aborting girl babies while they wait for a son. In "Open House," a 
Chinese woman's desire to be a property owner dictates every aspect of her 
life, especially marriage. This is not to say the Michael stories don't work 
since Wong's writing is accomplished, his characters engaging. It's just that 
as soon as Michael comes on the scene the work feels almost imperceptibly 
strident as if a subtle, private agenda needs to be filled.

 Jerry Belson's Surrender (KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m.) is a middle-of-the-road 1987 
romantic comedy that's often better when it's serious than when it's trying to 
be funny; refreshingly, it is very honest about the thorny relationship between 
love and money. Sally Field plays a struggling artist with a rich, younger -- 
and egotistical -- lover (Steve Guttenberg) who's not about to settle down; 
Michael Caine is a successful mystery writer too often taken to the cleaners by 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ten Commandments (ABC Sunday at 7 p.m.) is the last Hollywood spectacle 
made by a silent-era pioneer with a strong Victorian sensibility. Cecil B. 
DeMille's 1956 remake of his 1923 hit is never less than stirring and is 
possessed of genuine pictorial grandeur. Charlton Heston's Moses is a great 
heroic portrayal that has stood the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marcus-Nelson Murders (NBC Sunday at 8 p.m.), the landmark 1973 TV movie, 
written by Abby Mann and directed by Joseph Sargent, deals with a detective 
(Telly Savalas) trying to prevent a teen-ager from being wrongly convicted of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 A comic original who's more than a comedian, Hal Hartley is a filmmaker who 
takes us to familiar-looking yet utterly strange places: modern cul-de-sacs 
where anxiety meets lassitude, where honor battles absurdity and love tries to 
strike a bargain with lust. With his mixture of sly wit and wary compassion, 
he's able to dig deeper into his characters than all but a handful of American 
directors. Hartley's third feature, Simple Men (KCET Monday at 9 p.m.) is 
lyrically offbeat and brilliantly wacky, adapting the form of '60s and '70s 
road pictures with specific period-political implications. At the center of his 
film is a deeply emotional situation that goes oddly askew: two mismatched 
brothers (Robert Burke, William Sage) looking for their father, an all-star 
Brooklyn Dodgers shortstop who became a '60s radical and is wanted for trying 
to blow up the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing can be anticipated in this 1992 film, but everything falls into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Final Shot: The Hank Gathers Story (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is an 
unspectacular 1992 cable movie biography about the Loyola Marymount basketball 
star who died in March, 1990, after collapsing during a game. The controversy 
surrounding Gathers' death from a heart disorder is absent from this account, 
and there's also nothing distinctive or compelling about this depiction of the 
short life of Gathers, played adequately by Victor Love. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers brought undiminished sparkle to the 1993 TV 
movie Hart to Hart Returns (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.), but at two hours its plot 
lines get stretched mightily.

 ON THE EDGE OF DARKNESS: Conversations about Conquering Depression by Kathy 
Cronkite (Doubleday: $22; 352 pp.) Of all possible illnesses depression may be 
the most misunderstood.In spite of a recent public education campaign, there is 
still an attitude among many people that a clinically depressed individual is 
simply someone who's not trying hard enough. Kathy Cronkite's passionate, 
informative book, "On the Edge of Darkness," manages to dispel the myths 
surrounding depression without ever seeming didactic. The format -- each 
chapter revisits the same group of people talking about a different aspect of 
depression -- is truly innovative. There's sections on depression and its 
effects on children, the elderly, career and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some readers may have to forgive a little since Cronkite has 
chosen to illuminate depression mainly through conversations with celebrities 
who have experienced it. Rod Steiger, Joan Rivers, Kitty Dukakis and Mike 
Wallace all speak at length about their illness. One wonders if Cronkite feels 
that "normal" people's Angst isn't as book-worthy, or maybe this is her way of 
showing us that celebrities actually have problems too. Stop the presses! 
</P>
<P>
 An essential area Cronkite doesn't explore is economic. The poor and 
uninsured. Prohibitively expensive medication. Availability of care. A few tips 
on navigating the system might save someone a lot of pain. In any case, if you 
or anyone you know is suffering from depression, don't allow a proletarian snit 
to keep you from reading this important book.

 Your commentary ("The Uphill Fight of a Downbeat Comedy," TV Times, March 20) 
speaks of former 13th Floor Elevators frontman Roky Erickson (not Rocky) almost 
as if he were dead. ("(He) spent most of the rest of his life in an insane 
asylum ...").Let the Associated Press' Scott Williams and John Larroquette know 
that Roky -- institutionalized or not, at this point -- is alive and was still 
releasing records as recently as 1988.

 Veronica Moore, Los Angeles Hollywood's Big Night

<P>
 I would like to thank television news, the media, the newspapers and radio for 
making Oscar night absolutely predictable, with no surprises whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 There is so much hype and so much talk for so long before the big night that 
even if you were living in Siberia, you would know who the winners would be.

 Whoopi Goldberg deserves an Oscar for her performance as emcee during the

show at a good pace. I look forward to seeing her recast next year.

 OVER MY DEAD BODY: The Sensational Age of the American Paperback: 1945-1955 by 
Lee Server. (Chronicle Books: $16.95 ; 108 pp.). Anyone who thinks everything 
about the 1950s was fearfully dull isn't familiar with "the brief but 
gloriously subversive era" featured in this vividly illustrated 
survey.Paperback books existed before the end of World War II, but, featuring 
what author Server describes as "frenzied blurbs and risque illustrations," 
they moved into overdrive once our boys came back from overseas. With catchy 
titles and catchier cover lines ("Pleasure Alley: Sordid Love in a Sinful Slum" 
is a typical example) plus pulsating art, paperbacks became a power, turning 
Mickey Spillane, for instance, into a 150 million copies selling author. Server 
finds space to discuss paperback icons such as David Goodis, Jim Thompson, 
Chester Himes and Philip K. Dick, but the main emphasis is on covers so intense 
the book has a fine-print caveat, pleading that the images inside "are 
memorabilia. They reflect the design sensibility of the period and do not 
represent the opinions of the Publisher or the Author." You have been warned.

 THE MISSING PAGES by Cristina Comencini (Pantheon: $22; 268 pp.) No one knows 
why 19-year-old Federica, the youngest daughter in a wealthy Italian family, 
slowly stops talking.In spite of two histrionic sisters and a repressed mother 
who try with increasing panic to draw her out, Federica remains silent. This 
inexplicable descent and Federica's anxious complex relationship with Guido, 
her father, are the main concerns of "The Missing Pages," a deeply problematic 
novel. Perhaps this is the result of a faulty translation from the original 
Italian, but Comencini's sentences, full of clumsy repetitions, almost seem to 
fight each other. The words don't get along. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a passage describing Federica's mother's feelings toward her husband. 
"Suddenly she realized she wasn't alone. She looked at him. Nobody had helped 
him, he was alone. But she didn't feel any compassion toward him. She felt 
compassion for herself, for her daughters. . . . Not for him. She felt him to 
be alien and guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 The same phenomena applies to the plot. Federica's silence is due to a trauma 
she suffered and refuses to acknowledge. When the mysterious event is finally 
uncovered at the very end, instead of showing it in a scene or even in detailed 
expository description, the payoff is revealed by someone who knew someone who 
knew someone who was there. Any heat the novel's climax might have had is 
siphoned right out of it. Comencini has a genuinely original story. Let's hope 
she's able to better incorporate other much needed elements the next time 
around.

FOR A BIRTHDAY, BY THOM GUNN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have reached a time when words no longer 
</P>
<P>
 help: 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of guiding me across the moors 
</P>
<P>
 Strong landmarks in the uncertain out-of-doors, 
</P>
<P>
 Or like dependable friars on the Alp 
</P>
<P>
 Saving with wisdom and with brandy kegs, 
</P>
<P>
 They are gravel-stones, or tiny dogs which yelp 
</P>
<P>
 Biting my trousers, running round my legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Description and analysis degrade, 
</P>
<P>
 Limit, delay, slipped land from what has been; 
</P>
<P>
 And when we groan My Darling what we mean 
</P>
<P>
 Looked at more closely would too soon evade 
</P>
<P>
 The intellectual habit of our eyes; 
</P>
<P>
 And either the experience would fade 
</P>
<P>
 Or our approximations would be lies. 
</P>
<P>
 The snarling dogs are weight upon my haste, 
</P>
<P>
 Tons which I am detaching ounce by ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 All my agnostic irony I renounce 
</P>
<P>
 So I may climb to regions where I rest 
</P>
<P>
 In springs of speech, the dark before of truth: 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet moist wafer of your tongue I taste, 
</P>
<P>
 And find right meanings in your silent mouth. 
</P>

 NEW ORLEANS: Behind the Masks of America's Most Exotic City by Carol Flake 
(Grove Press: $22; 288 pp.) "I came to think of that vital essence peculiar to 
New Orleans as a sort of elixir or potion, something like the sassafras found 
in file, the secret of good gumbo. . . . That elusive, soulful essence that has 
survived for so long in New Orleans, thriving amid all the strangeness and 
decadence, is as rare and fragile as an endangered tropical plant, deep in the 
swamp, that may die before its curative powers are recognized."So says Carol 
Flake in "New Orleans," a detailed examination of the Big Easy through 
turbulent times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Councilwoman Dorothy Mae Taylor introduced an anti-discrimination 
ordinance against the krewes, which are basically social clubs, some over 100 
years old, that hold public parades and private balls during Carnival, a period 
of festivities culminating with Mardi Gras. There are gay krewes, black krewes, 
all woman krewes and highly commercialized krewes. It seems, however, that 
Dorothy Mae Taylor was after the old-line krewes of white, uptown aristocrats 
who were quickly losing their hold over a destitute, crime-ridden city. "New 
Orleans," using the proposed ordinance as drama, gives us a portrait of a place 
that is either about to perish or about to be reborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Flake has a real talent for interviews along with a flawless sense how much of 
herself belongs on the page. She makes New Orleans become like a friend going 
through a really rough time, someone you love and want to help. There are no 
pat answers, no fingers pointed, no personal vendettas. "New Orleans," is just 
a smart, moving look at a city in trouble.

 CRAZY ALL THE TIME: Life, Lessons, and Insanity on the Psych Ward of Bellevue 
Hospital by Frederick L. Covan, Ph.D. with Carol Kahn (Simon & Schuster: $23; 
279 pp.) Delusional typists.Rumors of rape stemming from a misunderstood 
elevator conversation. A Jewish-Puerto Rican conspiracy. This is all part of 
the bizarre and entertaining environment Fred Covan, chief psychologist at New 
York's Bellevue hospital, works in everyday. In addition to myriad other 
responsibilities, part of Covan's job is to supervise nine doctoral candidates 
in clinical psychology during their yearlong internship at Bellevue. "Crazy All 
the Time," is Covan's account of the trainees experiences as he guides them 
through extremely challenging cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One intern, the uptight son of a prominent psychiatrist, has to deal with a 
very ill woman who appears to be pregnant and claims the baby is his. In 
another instance, a man cuts his penis off, and the intern assigned to the case 
has to learn not to judge such a horrific act. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news about "Crazy All the Time," is that it is superbly written. 
Characters are fully drawn in a few sentences. The balance created between 
humor, depth and drama is nothing short of perfect, and like most top-notch 
writing it all seems effortless. The one disadvantage of such a strong book, is 
that its flaws scream out like a homeless schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the people and events described here seem too simple. Bureaucrats are 
mindless, artists are rebellious and the nine interns are all so slow that one 
suspects a device reminiscent of Dr. Watson losing about 20 IQ points to make 
Holmes look smarter. Also, while Covan is obviously a dedicated man, he often 
appears controlling and arrogant. In spite of those problems, though, this is a 
wonderful book.

THREE ON THE TOWN: EASIER SAID THAN DONE; WHEN ANGELENOS TALK, THE ACCENT 
SHOULD BE ON COMMUNICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles has sophisticated ears and eyes. We know a Korean billboard from a 
Chinese one, though we may not be able to read either. The bloody names on TV 
-- San Cristobal, Srebrenica -- don't sound nearly so alien here as they might 
in the Dakotas. And a colleague rightly asks, "What's a foreign-sounding name 
in L.A. ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet over the counters of banks, over the tables at restaurants, over the 
phones to doctors' offices, fourscore and eight varieties of spoken English -- 
and our own native ones, from Ice T's to Beverly Hills 90210's -- can create 
two-way exasperation and friction. 
</P>
<P>
 A language teacher told me that a black friend thought she lost out on a job 
because she couldn't understand the questions being put to her in the 
interviewer's accented English -- and she felt too awkward to ask the 
interviewer to repeat the questions or explain them. 
</P>
<P>
 A white bureaucrat I know sat through a 15-minute briefing but couldn't 
decipher what the foreign-born consultant was talking about -- and she couldn't 
bring herself to say so. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is more personal than bad breath or an unzipped fly: how to tell 
strangers who are trying to speak English that theirs is an English we can't 
understand? Often, we don't. We take the path of least offense, perhaps going 
as far as to say "thank you," hang up and call back later, hoping someone else 
will answer. 
</P>
<P>
 If you doubt that many newcomers long to learn English, drive past Evans 
Community Adult School in Downtown one evening, past people who get off work 
and then spend hours in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after puberty, muscles that have formed one language for years cannot 
adapt easily to a new one -- which is why we see 10-year-olds translating for 
the whole family. Even when we are speaking the same language, we are not 
necessarily communicating. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. David Alan Stern, now at a New England college, used to coach actors' 
accents until he got "more and more calls from junior VPs at banks who felt 
they would be senior VPs if their accents weren't so heavy." 
</P>
<P>
 He teaches what a book cannot: the phrasing and pacing of American English. 
Such nuances are what allow Robin Williams to pass off gibberish syllables as 
French or Russian. Our ears recognize the cadence and music of languages before 
they learn specific words. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, our ears betray our eyes. A landlady told a prospective tenant that 
she wanted quiet tenants. "My children and I very choir," the Guatemalan-born 
woman said. The landlady looked confused -- "You sing in a choir?" Yet the 
woman's body language could mean nothing else but "quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Not unexpectedly, "accent reduction" or "accent acquisition" treads near PC 
quicksand. One client of L.A. instructor Richard Bourell's English-teaching 
videos was a government agency whose workers talk to the public by phone. There 
had been problems with accents. The agency put a notice about the videos in its 
newsletter and braced for howls about cultural insensitivity. Instead, about 50 
employees signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Forman teaches "communication enhancement" to Southland medical and 
business professionals whose intimate, urgent work hinges on language and 
cultural subtleties. An Asian radiologist who has lived in California for 17 
years used to throw Forman's flyers in the trash, telling himself, "I don't 
need it. I think I'm good enough to perform my professional duties." 
</P>
<P>
 But two incidents changed his mind. First, his hospital installed a dictation 
system, and some colleagues couldn't understand his reports. Then, he had to 
tell a patient's family about a malignant tumor. "I realized some of the words 
I couldn't pronounce. Their facial expressions said, 'What is he talking 
about?' In that very critical situation, my problem made it even worse." 
</P>
<P>
 If his problem were ours, would we be as assiduous about fixing it?

COMMENTARY; LEARNING TO WALK AFTER THE CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a dozen years, Sam Donaldson stood tall on the White House lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 It is upon that much-trod turf, of course, that correspondents who chase the 
President pause long enough to do their so-called "stand-up" shots. But since 
moving to "PrimeTime Live" five years ago, Donaldson, though still running, has 
also had to learn to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was doing hard news, I don't recall walking in my stand-up more than 
three or four times," says the veteran ABC newsman. "Now, I have to walk while 
I do my 15-second intro for a report. I don't do it well. But I've had to learn 
how. Because that's a rule of the magazine shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: When you're chasing a story, don't ever look like you're standing still. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson knows he must think "show biz" along with "news," must entertain his 
viewers as well as inform them on "PrimeTime." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than recount another page of the presidential saga every night on the 
evening news, he shapes each of his "PrimeTime" reports into a self-contained 
morality tale with a beginning, middle and end. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he checks the ratings to make sure viewers tuned in. (He needn't worry: 
"PrimeTime" is ranked a healthy 20th for the season to date.) 
</P>
<P>
 And through it all, he upholds "PrimeTime's" duty to give the public what it's 
interested in seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a few anguished letters, 'How dare you put on this silly Tonya Harding 
story; that's not important when people are dying in Bosnia.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Right! But let me just tell you something, my friend. I am not king of 
information when it comes to deciding what's good for the American people to 
watch.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The press is there to come along, NOT drive," he says. "It's a tail that gets 
wagged by the big dog of events." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, maybe he's had to relearn a few things. But on "PrimeTime" (Thursdays 
at 10 p.m. on ABC) and the Sunday morning "This Week With David Brinkley," 
Donaldson always puts on a show. 
</P>
<P>
 And always has. 
</P>
<P>
 How could it be otherwise? That voice, erupting in fanfares like a marching 
band. And that face, frozen in an almost Kabuki-like mask, curiously at odds 
with his souped-up temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 His co-workers take turns telling a reporter what an engaging, collegial, 
loyal fellow he is. But Donaldson operates under no illusion that his chummy 
side ever translates to the TV screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Show him to me!" he trumpets, at the suggestion that a viewer might find him 
lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, he thrives as a continuing rebuke to the notion that TV correspondents 
must be comfortable to watch. He has the peculiar ability to rattle his 
audience along with those he covers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is noon a few Sundays ago, and Donaldson has done his best to rattle Lloyd 
Cutler. The just-named White House counsel was one of the guests on "This 
Week," which has signed off a few minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In his office in ABC's Washington bureau, balloons and a huge handmade 
greeting card remain from a surprise birthday party two days earlier. Now, the 
60-year-old excitable boy is anxiously waiting for the phone to ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is ripping off taxpayers," says Donaldson, speaking of someone whose home 
a "PrimeTime" producer at that moment is staking out. "He declined our kind 
interview requests repeatedly, so we're going to have to go interview him in 
some public place." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this malfeasant walks his dog, maybe he plays golf at a public course -- 
Donaldson is ready to pounce should the quarry show his face. But when the 
phone finally rings, the message is that two days' worth of newspapers remain 
unclaimed in the man's front yard. Donaldson tells his producer to knock off 
the vigil until tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if she had gotten a glimpse of him, I would have been out that door," 
Donaldson says in a way that makes clear it's just a matter of time.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; MOST MUSCULAR MAN ON CAMPUS? 
'LIFESTORIES' LOOKS AT THE HEAVY PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high school football player's quest to be bigger and stronger leads to 
steroid abuse in "A Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story," one in a series of 
HBO Lifestories: Families in Crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aaron's story was so all-American," says producer Francine LeFrak (HBO's 
"Blood Brothers: The Joey DiPaolo Story"), who first read about Henry in 
"Reader's Digest." "He was this football player who wanted to be the best and 
was a perfectionist and pushed himself so hard. I was looking for someone who 
was willing to talk about his steroid use and Aaron was. I thought that was 
incredibly brave." 
</P>
<P>
 His steroid use became "a spin cycle," Henry says. "You need more and more." 
Recent medical journal studies estimate that a quarter to a half-million 
teen-agers use steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teens don't often look at the consequences of the easy and quick way," LeFrak 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, who took anabolic steroids for two years, has had two heart attacks, 
two kidney operations, three back surgeries and an ulcerated stomach. 
Three-fourths of his lumbar (lower-back disc), as well as an inch of his spine, 
were removed, and he suffered repeated disc injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "My immunities have been affected and I get sick easily," he says says from 
his St. Louis home. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry has since learned that steroids are addictive, destructive and illegal. 
His impatience for a bigger, stronger body, coupled with a ignorance of the 
side effects, led to mental and physical deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his drive for a beautiful body evolved from how "everything you read 
or see is a depiction of perfection through physical beauty." He's concerned 
that other teens share that impression. "I'm still that extreme perfectionist, 
but my goals have changed. Maturity took that ignorance of my youth away," he 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a 27-year-old student of ecocardiology, Henry works with his mother in the 
family antique store. His continuing rehabilitation has been slow; he lifts 
weights and does aerobics three days a week. He also speaks publicly about his 
abuse and tells parents how to detect possible steroid use in their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister's a clinical psychologist, and she knew I was doing drugs -- I 
changed so much," Henry says. "But she didn't know what kind of drug I was 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of steroid use, according to Henry, are rapid weight gain, blotchy skin, 
acne in some cases and increased irritability. "Look for a real defensiveness," 
he says. "That really happened to me. I would have done anything to defend my 
use." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry says that he now realizes that, for an athlete, steroids are "cheating" 
and the results are false. "What I attained synthetically wasn't really mine," 
he says. "It was from a syringe." 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid saved his own life and, in a way, he's a real hero," LeFrak says. 
</P>
<P>
 She adds unapologetically: "This is not an afterschool-style special. There's 
no sweetness to this story. It's very edgy, gritty, hard-hitting and 
uncompromising in how far it goes. There's no whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Body to Die For: The Aaron Henry Story' " airs 7-7:30 a.m. Sunday and 
9:30-10 p.m. Wednesday on HBO. Parents are advised that there are graphic 
depictions of steroid use. For ages 10 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Pot and peer pressure are the focus of this week's Ghostwriter (Sunday 6-6:30 
p.m. KCET). In "What's Up With Alex?," Alex (David Lopez) is pressured to smoke 
marijuana by Kevin, a "cool" friend he admires and respects. Alex wrestles with 
his decision and ultimately rejects the idea that "drugs are cool." 
</P>
<P>
 There are suggestions on: what to do when confronted with drugs, how to avoid 
becoming involved and who to turn to for guidance, including family, friends 
and a school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ghostwriter's" director of research, Eve Hall, says studies revealed that a 
primary concern among the show's target audience is the threat of pressure to 
do drugs and the presence of these drugs in society. For ages 7 to 14.  
</P>

 On Monday, The Muppets (11:30 a.m.-noon Nickelodeon) join "The Muppet Babies" 
(11-11:30 a.m.) on Nick Jr., turning the block into "The Jim Henson Muppet 
Hour." For ages 18 months to 7.

PALM LATITUDES: BODY POLITIC; KEEPING ACTIVIST

 "I just got a hot second," says Pearl White, heading off to continue her 
effort to cajole $2 million from the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development for programs in her Venice 'hood. Two days later, White, 74, is 
stepping off her porch again, this time trying to whip up an uneasy truce 
between local gangs. "With all these killings we've got to do something," she 
says. "Just last night there was another shooting almost right in my window." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the Pearl White Theatre of Performing Arts, gearing up for 
more rehearsals: Got to get those kids ready for their auditions. Got to keep 
them off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 White has been putting out flames -- and stirring up trouble -- in Venice 
since the mid-1940s. Then, just arrived from her home state of Texas, she 
immediately began registering Democrats in the area because, as she now 
recalls, "We had nothing but Republicans here." Getting out the vote was 
difficult then, she says. "At the time, people didn't talk about voting. But 
now we're doing pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors credit White with starting many of the community service programs 
that serve the gang- and crime-ridden Oakwood district. The theater, which 
began in 1975 and is sponsored by actors Lloyd and Beau Bridges, stages plays, 
most of them reflecting aspects of life in Oakwood, that are written and 
performed by neighborhood youths.  
</P>
<P>
 "She has been involved with every program designed for youth since the 1940s," 
says Melvyn Hayward, the group's business manager, "from housing, education and 
theater. A lot of these kids are going on to college, doing television and 
films." 
</P>
<P>
 White isn't interested in kicking back in her golden years. Besides working to 
get funding and low-interest loans for area residents, she is involved in a 
multitude of organizations that help get homeless families off the streets, 
keep kids out of gangs and parents off drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always helping the poor," she concludes. "It's something that I've been 
doing all my life. You know why? Because that's why I'm living. As long as 
God's going to keep me living, I can't be lying in no bed." Kit Roane

 BEAUTIFUL SWIMMERS: Watermen, Crabs and the Chesapeake Bay by William Warner, 
illustrated by Consuelo Hanks (Little, Brown: $11.95.; 304 pp.). Warner 
received the Pulitzer Prize for this lyrical, evocative study of the blue crab 
and the people who trap and prepare it.Warner's gracefully written prose 
conveys his enchantment with the vast estuary, " . . . an intimate place where 
land and water intertwine in infinite varieties of mood and pattern." He 
respectfully recounts the back-breaking labor the watermen endure to supply 
diners with this elusive delicacy. But Warner sounds an ominous note in the new 
afterword. Overfishing, pollution and the increasing population of the coastal 
regions have taken their toll on the crab population and the Bay itself: "You 
look hard at the water and sometimes it seems like it's getting a little old 
and tired, a little messy. Simple as that if anyone cares to notice."

 COME TO ME by Amy Bloom (HarperPerennial: $10; 175 pp.). In clear, 
straightforward prose, Bloom exposes the lives of deeply disturbed 
characters.The narrator of "Silver Water" allows her schizophrenic sister to 
die peacefully, rather than summon a doctor who would prolong her suffering; a 
grieving widow is swept away by her stepson's passion in "Sleepwalking." In 
three linked stories about a husband and wife cheating on their respective 
partners, the woman notes, "All of our time was shaved off something bigger, 
slivered into pieces so thin you could look right at them and never even see."

 I THOUGHT LABOR ENDED WHEN THE BABY WAS BORN by Rick Kirkman & Jerry Scott 
(Andrews & McMeel: $8.95; 127 pp., paperback original). The fourth collection 
of "Baby Blues" reveals what happens when syndicates and editors choose comic 
strips for their appeal to targeted audiences, rather than for their intrinsic 
merits. "Baby Blues" is aimed at yuppie parents. In their attempts to present a 
humorous look at infant care, Kirkman and Scott use a few situations over and 
over, especially the annoyed parent who just melts when the baby looks cute. 
Readers who grow teary-eyed over "Reach Out and Touch Someone" commercials may 
be moved; the less sentimental won't.

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; A MODEL SPY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jamie Reno 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a small, cluttered office in an industrial park in Sorrento Valley, John 
Andrews designs model airplanes for the Testor Corp. But don't let the 
innocuous job description fool you. Andrews, ex-military man, patriot and 
admitted cynic, is a nemesis of Pentagon security.His models, sold in toy 
stores and hobby shops nationwide, are chillingly accurate replicas of some of 
the military's most secret aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Andrews caused an international sensation when he designed a model of 
what was then the super-secret F-19 Stealth fighter. His latest scoop: the 
SR-75 Penetrator and a faster companion craft that Testor calls the XR-7. The 
two-plane system is Andrews' rendition of the Aurora project, whose existence 
has long been denied by the Air Force. Aviation sources speculate that Aurora 
is the replacement for the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane and is capable of speeds 
exceeding Mach 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews bases his renderings on publicly available government documents, 
advice from a network of aviation and aerospace contacts and his own 
engineering knowledge. And when those sources fail him, he collects his 
information the old-fashioned way: by spying. "Legal spying" stresses Andrews, 
who last year, armed with a backpack and high-powered telescope, spent a cold 
night on a mountaintop in a remote section of southern Nevada to sneak a peek 
at the planes housed at the nearby Groom Lake military facility. Because of his 
snooping, that area has since been closed to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never bought or solicited military secrets," Andrews says. "I just love 
these planes and keep abreast of what they're doing." He says he's never broken 
the law, but "I have made people angry. I'd like to think I help keep those 
guys in Washington honest." Jamie Reno

 RED FLOWER OF CHINA by Zhia Zenhua (Soho Press: $13; 245 pp.). As a young 
teen-ager, Zhia Zenhua joined the newly formed Red Guards, hoping to prove her 
patriotism and devotion to Chairman Mao.As she took part in the violence that 
marked the opening stages of the Cultural Revolution, she realized she and her 
comrades were being used as pawns in a high-level power struggle; removed from 
her unit for insufficient zeal, she witnessed the havoc the Red Guards loosed 
on the country she dreamed of improving. Her youth and health were wasted when 
she was sent to the remote countryside to be "re-educated" by the peasants. The 
years spent in what amounted to chattel slavery revealed the corruption that 
flourished in China's ostensibly egalitarian government. The bitter eloquence 
of Zenhua's testimony provides a chilling reminder of the dangers of blind 
devotion to any ideology.

 THE POLITICS OF SILENCE by Paul Monette (The Center for the Book, The Library 
of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540-8200: $3.95 (tax deductible); 21 pp., 
illustrated). In this handsomely bound transcription of the lecture he 
delivered after winning the National Book Award for "Becoming a Man," Monette 
asserts, "It is simply not enough to be an artist, unengaged." He decries 
injustice and the policies of the Reagan-Bush administration that allowed the 
AIDS virus to spread: A defiant valedictory from an author who refuses to go 
gentle into that dark night.

 PAINTING IN THE NORTH: Alaskan Art in Anchorage Museum of History and Art by 
Kesler E. Woodward (University of Washington Press: $24.95; 160 pp., paperback 
original). The epic grandeur of Alaska's mountains, glaciers, forests and 
shores offer a challenge few artists can resist. This attractive catalogue 
surveys 3 1/2 centuries of efforts to capture this beauty in images that range 
from Academic landscapes to multimedia works that blend Amerindian iconography 
with Western media. The many color illustrations suggest the rewards and 
frustrations of attempting to reproduce the magnificence of unspoiled nature.

 CLEOPATRA'S SISTER by Penelope Lively (HarperPerennial: $11; 282 pp.). In this 
clever novel, Lively brings together paleontologist Howard Beamish and 
free-lance journalist Lucy Faulkner, two repressed characters who discover love 
when a mechanical failure forces their airplane to land in the fictional North 
African country of Callimbia.Although characters are seldom more than mildly 
engaging, Lively's account of the history of Callimbia (which was once ruled by 
Berenice, the sister of the famous the Cleopatra) includes droll pastiches of 
Plutarch and Flaubert. Reflecting on the weird biological dead-ends of the 
Burgess Shale that Howard studies, this odd couple discovers that life is "both 
remarkable and precarious. An accident of contingency."

IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE?; A QUESTION OF DESERTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing with reference to Lillian Faderman's review of my book, "Crossing 
the Border" (Feb. 27). The review seriously misrepresents the story I have told 
in my book. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, as I clearly describe, I set out for Israel in order to start a new 
life, in a new place. Because I needed to find the place before I brought my 
daughter to it, I went to Israel alone, leaving her with her father. Throughout 
the book, as one of its principle themes, I describe my continued efforts to 
bring my daughter to the kibbutz where I was living. When this did not work 
out, for various reasons, I returned home to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, we recognize conditions under which a parent may leave a child 
without this act being considered desertion. A soldier sent off to fight a war, 
when he leaves his child behind, would not be considered to have deserted her. 
A husband and children leaving the mother behind in a particular city, while 
they moved across the country because of his work, would not have brought down 
upon the mother the charge of deserting her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Desertion is a serious charge to bring against a mother. Moreover, in Lillian 
Faderman's review, this charge is not brought lightly, merely in passing, or as 
a mere rhetorical gesture. The reviewer takes it seriously enough to wonder if 
"we" can forgive the mother for deserting the eight-year old daughter. She 
wonders if the daughter can forgive the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in the book itself is the question of desertion raised or discussed. 
The charge is an invention of the reviewer. In "Crossing the Border" I raise 
questions about sex, passion, love, Judaism, by presenting an experience which 
was, for its time, fairly typical in its experimental nature. When Lillian 
Faderman overstates her case, she brings a judgmental, moralistic tone to the 
review, which misrepresents the book's scope, humor and complexity. What a 
pity, since the book tells an honest story about a dramatic chapter in a 
woman's life. 
</P>
<P>
 KIM CHERNIN, BERKELEY 
</P>
<P>
 I was appalled by the tone of the vitriolic attack in Lillian Faderman's 
review of Kim Chernin's "Crossing the Border" (Book Review, Feb. 27). Have 
Faderman and I read the same book? 
</P>
<P>
 Without paying much attention to the text, she seems to make an attack on the 
writer's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossing the Border" is a meditation on memory, time and change, and it 
presents, as many more traditional novels about the youthful artist do, the 
earthquake -- and yes, dangerous -- forces present in the young life of the 
creative self. 
</P>
<P>
 One cannot help but wonder if the same morally outraged reaction to a writer's 
youthful marriage with the world occur if Chernin were a man. Would Faderman 
write then, with such indignation, that he had left his child -- not "their 
child" -- to be taken care of by his wife? 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings are filled with yearnings we hope to understand better as we grow 
older. It is disheartening to see that a woman author who treats honestly of 
her own desires: for erotic discovery, for spiritual enactment, for personal 
and political and communal relatedness: in short, for transformation of the 
self, is judged, not on the basis of the range of her intellectual and 
emotional grasp of the world, nor on the basis of her interesting investigation 
of the fictive qualities of memory itself, but instead by some sort of moral 
checklist developed from a misreading of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 TOBEY HILLER, OAKLAND 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Faderman, highly respected for her academic work, made her name with 
writings that argue for the absence of sexuality in women's relationships 
before the 20th-Century. Reading her review of "Crossing the Border," by Kim 
Chernin, I came to wonder whether sexuality in women in the 20th Century also 
runs against her grain? 
</P>
<P>
 Her outright hostility toward Chernin's "erotic journey" raises more questions 
about the reviewer than about the book. It also raises questions about the 
editor's choice of Faderman as reviewer for such a sexually explicit and 
explosive book. 
</P>
<P>
 Faderman's review is an odd blend of 20th-Century political correctness and 
19th-Century puritanism. The reviewer makes a moral case against the person of 
Kim Chernin. This is odd, since Kim Chernin herself in "Crossing the Border" 
raises so many moral and psychological and philosophic issues related to sexual 
experience, identity, and responsibility. How is it possible for Faderman to 
have missed these? Does it have something to do with Faderman's obsessive 
erasure of sexuality in women? 
</P>
<P>
 MARGE WILLIAMS, CAMARILLO 
</P>
<P>
 Your review by Lillian Faderman of Kim Chernin's book is offensive to me and 
shouldn't pass without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Faderman clearly doesn't like Chernin-the-narrator or the younger Chernin who 
is transformed in Israel. That's OK. I guess it's Faderman's right. What is not 
right is to damn a book because of it. I, for instance, really loved the Kim 
Chernin character, despite her apparent self-centeredness. I found the 
particular ways she was troubled to be complex and sympathetic and her general 
sensibility and style to be quite endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue here is that Faderman's personal antipathy to the personalities in 
the book leaks out in almost every sentence and precludes even an attempt to 
address the book seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether one "discovers" or "constructs" one's past in 
psychotherapy is actually a major controversy in the field today. Chernin 
attempts to illustrate and analyze the difficulties inherent in reconstruction 
in a unique and personal way, at times inviting the reader to engage, with her, 
in a psychoanalytic enterprise. What did Faderman think of the issues of memory 
and reconstruction with which Chernin is playing and is attempting to explore? 
We'll never know, because Faderman is too cranky about Chernin's alleged 
narcissism. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that someone like Chernin who has the courage to talk about her 
inner life in print shouldn't be surprised when her readers respond personally. 
If the particular inner life that is conveyed is one that bugs you for some 
idiosyncratic reason, so be it. There's no accounting for personal taste. 
However, to parade that cranky, idiosyncratic response as an analytical review 
in a major newspaper is just plain offensive. A reviewer ought to exercise more 
self-awareness and not take her own unanalyzed antipathy out on the author. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL J. BADER, SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
<P>
 Lillian Faderman, a representative of the sex police, wants to protect L.A. 
Times readers from pleasure and danger -- erotic and bisexual desire, 
psychological breakdown and breakthrough, youthful transgression and mature 
recovery of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps what so disturbs her about Kim Chernin's "Crossing the Border" is 
that the people on the kibbutz whose lives became intertwined were not, as 
Faderman falsely claims, destroyed by the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it's what Faderman leaves out of her review in her effort at 
censorship, that a story of life-transforming seriousness can be rendered with 
irony and humor, and that what seems the most private love story in 
Palestine??? has political implications (about which she is silent but Chernin 
is not). If you disobey Faderman and read Chernin, you will have the major 
pleasure of "Crossing the Border," and the added minor one of trying to figure 
out why the reviewer wanted to get in your way.

 Mitch Miller is onstage telling the audience how Frankie Laine's "Mule Train" 
was cut in three hours. Then Kay Starr follows and belts out a swing tune and 
Frankie Laine accepts the year's tribute. 1949? No, it's 1994 and the annual 
gathering of the Vine Street Irregulars, a reunion of those who walked that 
golden musical crossroads when Ciro's ruled the Strip, Billy Berg's jazz joint 
swung on Vine and life seemed to be one "Make-Believe Ballroom." 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Coast was starting to come alive and Vine Street was the musical 
mecca," says regular Irregular Lee Zhito, Billboard's former publisher and 
editor. 
</P>
<P>
 Irregular originator/emcee Randy Van Horne tells it like it was: "You could 
walk down Vine Street at 2 in the morning, across from ABC, NBC, Capitol 
Records/Music City and Coffee Dan's, and meet everyone you knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Drinking cocktails at the bar here at Studio City's Ventura Club are old-style 
promo men, song pluggers, former secretaries and three waitresses from the 
Brown Derby, mingled with early DJs and VIPs like Mercury Records co-founder 
Berle Adams and bandleader Billy Mays. There's Milton De Lugg of the '40s Swing 
Wing, "Cry of the Wild Goose" writer Terry Gilkyson, as well as Laine's 
manager, Seymour Heller, who once drove a mule train down the Strip. (Missing 
was my father, the late Fred Raphael, head of Disney Music for many years. 
Songwriter Johnny Lange gave him "Mule Train," which went on to become one of 
Laine's 21 gold records.) 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horne, whose well-known vocal groups date back to the late '40s, started 
the event in 1986 with wife Sherrill to "gather memories about the good old 
days." The first meeting drew 20 people; last month's drew more than 300. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a happening. A miniature Woodstock for music people," said Michael 
Goldsen, owner of 53-year-old Criterion Music. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a private party," says Van Horne. "It's a great chance to see old 
friends at something besides a funeral." Judy Raphael

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the joys of cable television is that it lets us see ourselves as others 
see us. If you were to believe the reports from CNN, TBS, WGN and the Disaster 
Channel, post-Northridge Los Angeles has been reduced to a city in ruins, 
lacking even the very basic elements of life -- the water to fill our 
black-bottomed pools and power to run our home-tanning beds. 
</P>
<P>
 But before you join the exodus of U-Hauls rising out of the Valley, take a 
closer look at a few other towns that we see a lot of on TV. The grass might 
not be greener after all (even if the ground it's growing on is standing 
still): 
</P>
<P>
 Cabot Cove. Friendly smiles, quaint Maine accents -- and the highest per 
capita murder rate of any small town in North America. Newcomers to Cabot Cove 
never last more than 60 minutes in town before either expiring or confessing, 
so don't worry about qualifying for that 30-year mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicely. Everyone in this town talks and talks and talks and talks. Be sure to 
bring your collection of Descartes, Whitman, Sartre and Sand, but don't bother 
to pack your long underwear. This is one part of Alaska where there's more hot 
air than snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston. Get serious. Do you really want everyone to know your name? 
</P>
<P>
 New York. This town used to be about something, now it's about nothing. 
Sitting around a restaurant 24 hours a day complaining about underwear wedgies 
with friends just isn't a fair trade-off for the lack of parking and lousy 
weather. The Big Apple? Don't you mean the Big Whineapple? 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit. The Motor City has its share of foul weather, but if that's not 
enough to keep you housebound, the rambling pontifications of your unseen 
neighbors certainly will. Here's a topic you won't want to miss on the next 
episode of "Tool Time": Soundproofing. Craig Caldwell

ENDPAPERS: STICKS AND STONES; CAN A REVIEW BE SO BAD IT IS LIBELOUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

of the National Book Critics Circle from April, 1990 through March, 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "It is safe to assume," John Leonard, a former editor of the New York Times 
Book Review, has written, "that every writer has read every word of every 
review, and will never forgive you." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Henderson made Leonard's comment the epigraph to his "Rotten Reviews: A 
Literary Companion" (Pushcart Press: 1986), a collection in which, as Anthony 
Brandt wrote in the introduction, "one of the pleasures . . . is watching the 
great being terribly wrong about the great": Zola about Baudelaire, Stein about 
Pound, Emerson about Austen, Shaw about Shakespeare, and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 If slightly malicious humor is the chief pleasure of the collection, its chief 
reassurance is that literary virtue seems to triumph in the end. But does it, 
always? Near the end of his introduction, Brandt calls the cackling to a brief 
halt with the following thought: "All of this has a serious side. . . . Rotten 
reviews hurt, for one thing: And if they don't, perhaps, affect sales, they do 
affect literary reputations, which, as most authors will agree, are more 
important than sales in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Cold comfort it must be to a writer to be told to trust the marketplace of 
ideas if by the time the marketplace renders its judgment the writer is long 
since dead or ruined. Can there be no earlier redress of genuine grievance? If 
a final judgment must be left to the ages, can a timelier intervention at least 
rescue a career? Until recently, the answer would clearly have been negative. 
But now an aggrieved writer has brought suit against the New York Times Book 
Review. If he has his way, the face of book reviewing in this country may 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 3, 1989, the New York Times Book Review published a review of 
"Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional Football" (William 
Morrow) by Dan E. Moldea, a journalist specializing in organized crime. The 
review alleged a string of factual errors in the book and closed: 
</P>
<P>
 "There may well be some insidious connection between the wise guys and the 
NFL. Then again, there may not. 'Interference,' with its errors and unfounded 
insinuations, does not settle the issue. Mr. Moldea raises the questions, but 
has blunted his own sword of truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, Moldea wrote the reviewer, Gerald Eskenazi, a New York Times 
sportswriter, charging that Eskenazi had seriously misreported what Moldea had 
written. Eskenazi's errors about the book amounted to libel against the book's 
author, Moldea said, and he demanded "a full and prompt retraction." Otherwise, 
he promised to "take legal steps to remedy this situation, which has already 
caused tremendous illegal and unfair damage to my reputation and economic harm 
to my book." 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 15, 1989, having failed to win a retraction or other correction, 
Moldea wrote a letter of about 750 words to Rebecca Sinkler, editor of the New 
York Times Book Review, refuting five alleged errors in the review by quoting 
from the book. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 " Charge : Leading the reader to believe that I claimed that Super Bowl III in 
1969 was fixed, Eskenazi wrote that I charged that there was something 
premeditated and 'sinister' about a meeting in a Miami bar between (New York 
Jets quarterback Joe) Namath and Baltimore Colts place-kicker Lou Michaels 
during the week before the game. He added that I failed to point out that the 
meeting 'almost came to blows.' 
</P>
<P>
 " Response : This is not true. I wrote in the second paragraph on page 197: 
'(Lou) Michaels told me that the meeting at a Miami bar/restaurant was quite 
accidental and even confrontational.' Michaels' statement was corroborated 
during my interview with Jets' player Jim Hudson, who accompanied Namath to the 
bar. Further, I never claimed that the 1969 Super Bowl was fixed. To the 
contrary, I produced evidence on pages 194 and 198-99 discrediting the theory 
by Colts' player Bubba Smith that it was." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Times declined to publish this letter, Moldea sued -- unsuccessfully: 
On Jan. 31, 1992, U.S. District Court Judge Garrett Penn granted summary 
judgment in favor of the Times. On Feb. 17, 1994, however, a three-judge U.S. 
appeals court reinstated Moldea's lawsuit by a 2-1 vote. Summary judgment, as 
in the earlier ruling, is granted when the facts of a case are not in dispute 
and a decision may be rendered on the law alone. On appeal, Moldea claimed that 
the facts were indeed in dispute -- not the facts about Super Bowl III, it must 
be noted, but the facts about what Moldea said about Super Bowl III. To sustain 
his appeal, the court had to find not just that these facts were in dispute, 
but that it mattered that they were in dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just what the appeals court did find. Its opinion states with regard 
to one of Moldea's several charges: 
</P>
<P>
 "The clear implication of the review passage is that Moldea, either through 
incompetence or an intent to mislead, suggests that the meeting was 'sinister.' 
This is an essentially factual claim -- either 'Interference' so describes the 
meeting or it does not." The judges note that the New York Times "attempted to 
demonstrate that the disputed passages in Moldea's book do in fact describe a 
'sinister' meeting. However, arguing that the characterizations offered in the 
review are correct is not the same as contending that they are non-verifiable 
-- indeed, it is precisely the opposite." Can an Opinion Be False? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Milkovich vs. Lorain Journal that 
even statements of opinion can be libelous if they contain "false and 
defamatory" facts. Until Moldea vs. New York Times, however, no one had claimed 
that a negative statement about a book could, by implication, constitute a 
"false and defamatory" statement about the book's author. It is the novelty of 
this claim that may yet make the Moldea case one of historic importance for 
American book reviewing. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, obviously, is the extent to which every book review must also be a 
report on the facts of the book. If a reviewer gets those facts wrong, can the 
review be not just negative but also demonstrably false? And depending on the 
mistakes made, can a review be defamatory in its effect on the author? 
</P>
<P>
 Eskenazi wrote of Moldea's book that "there is too much sloppy journalism to 
trust the bulk of this book's 512 pages," a statement Moldea regarded as 
falsely bringing his reputation for accuracy into question. Chief Judge Abner 
Mikva, dissenting from the decision of the appeals court, disagreed with 
Moldea: "If the statement that Mr. Moldea wrote a sloppy book is defamatory, so 
would be a statement that Bette Midler wore a sloppy dress, or that Oliver 
Stone made a sloppy film." But Judge Harry Edwards, writing for the majority, 
agreed with the plaintiff at least to the point of recognizing the question as 
legitimate: "Although sloppy in a vacuum may be difficult to quantify, the term 
has obvious, measurable aspects when applied to the field of investigative 
journalism, just as the term clumsy would with a brain surgeon." At issue, 
clearly, is the question of whether Eskenazi's characterization of the book -- 
"sloppy journalism" -- was based on demonstrably erroneous reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikva also argues the majority opinion is "unwise . . . to ignore altogether 
the effect of the communicative vehicle upon the audience." The dissenting 
judge maintains that readers will understand that a report coming in a book 
review is not to be taken with the same seriousness as a report elsewhere. The 
Washington Post in an unsigned editorial Feb. 24 took the same tack, defending 
the New York Times by citing a 1984 case in which the court observed: "It is 
well understood that editorial writers and commentators frequently resort to 
the type of caustic bombast traditionally used . . . to stimulate public 
reaction." The Post comments: "We were not thrilled by this description . . . 
but we were relieved that the distinction between facts and opinions was 
maintained." Correcting the Record 
</P>
<P>
 Just what sort of responsibility to the facts does a book reviewer or other 
opinion writer incur? Judge Mikva agrees with his two colleagues that "it would 
be unwise 'to craft a rule that permitted otherwise libelous statements to go 
unchecked so long as they appeared in certain sacrosanct genres.' " Very well: 
How is even this level of responsibility to be enforced? 
</P>
<P>
 The duty to refrain from false or defamatory statements cannot, obviously, 
require journalists to be infallible. An innocent mistake may always be 
corrected, and most publications -- newspapers, in particular -- correct errors 
far more quickly and prominently nowadays than they once did. An author's 
intent in demanding a correction, however, may be simply to discredit a review. 
There is always a decision to be made by the editor about when a retraction is 
in order (for the correction of factual error), when a letter to the editor 
should be printed (for a statement of differing opinion or interpretation), or 
when no action is necessary. A letter, though it may also serve as correction, 
may be discounted by readers as an aggrieved author's opinion, which is 
precisely why many authors find this remedy deficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Moldea has stated for the record that if the New York Times Book Review had 
published his letter, not an overlong one by prevailing standards, he would not 
have sued. Times counsel George Freeman confirmed that the Times knew this but 
declined to publish the letter anyway, on principle, finding its charges 
baseless. Rebecca Sinkler further explained that the New York Times Book Review 
seeks to protect reviewers from authors' bias just as it protects authors from 
reviewers' bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in 1991, Moldea asked the National Book Critics Circle to take a public 
position in support of his suit. I was president of the NBCC at the time and 
forwarded his request to the NBCC board, a body of 24 book editors and 
free-lance critics. I also spoke to George Freeman and Rebecca Sinkler at that 
time so as to be able to present their side of the dispute to the NBCC board. 
</P>
<P>
 After much consideration, the board decided to take no position on the matter. 
Thinking as reviewers faced with the prospect of future litigation if their 
work struck an author as defamatory, some on the board tacitly sided with the 
New York Times, which had written in its brief: "It is not unreasonable to 
expect that if Moldea's lawsuit is permitted to continue, critics may become 
timid. For the threat posed by protracted and expensive litigation surely will 
encourage reviewers to 'steer far wider' of dangerous zones. . . . To the 
extent that criticism becomes flannel-mouthed or perfunctory, all of us, 
authors included, are impoverished." 
</P>
<P>
 Others on the board, perhaps thinking of their vulnerability as authors to 
essentially unaccountable reviewers, tacitly sided with Moldea, who claims: "If 
I win this case, the worst that can happen is that reviewers and other 
opinion-writers will suddenly have a responsibility to be accountable for what 
they write. Any writer who cannot live with that should not be in this 
profession." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the NBCC, however, the court must decide between these contending 
positions. The New York Times has asked the entire 15-judge appeals court to 
review the decision made by three of its members. If it affirms the three 
judges' decision, then the case will be remanded to the district court for 
rehearing, this time before a jury. If the jury finds that Moldea has suffered 
libel, a further determination must then be made as to whether he deserves the 
$10 million he seeks in punitive damages. At this point, his case will require 
a judgment about the power of even an uncorrected, defamatory review in the New 
York Times Book Review to destroy a book. If the three judges' opinion is 
overruled, Moldea says he will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Moldea alleges that after Eskenazi's review and, even more, after he brought 
suit, publishers were loath to consider his work, afraid to be on the wrong 
side of a newspaper that could do so much harm or good to their future 
products. This is even more difficult to quantify; but before this case has 
come to its conclusion, this too may be debated in open court, and much of 
literary America may be hanging on every word.

 Early on, they were drawn to their profession by a love of art, a fascination 
with the process of transformation, even the aroma of a beauty salon. Now six 
Los Angeles makeup artists polish the faces of those oh-so-gorgeous ones who 
pose for magazines, appear in commercials and decorate the movie screen. Making 
an actor or model more beautiful is usually easy. But what happens when they're 
challenged with their own less-than-perfect features? 
</P>
<P>
 You either have the ability to do makeup or you don't," says Lori Matsushima, 
confirming the fears of women who are all thumbs with a lip brush. Her parents 
wanted her to get a business degree, but after finishing a few semesters at 
Santa Monica College, she decided to heed her calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the features on a human face, 30-year-old Matsushima most likes 
eyebrows. Models generally have large, expressive eyes, but when it comes to 
her own, she lowers her sunglasses and confronts the awful truth: "I have no 
eyebrows," she wails, "and I love eyebrows." So she draws them on with a brown 
Eyebrow Liner by Shu Uemura, a soft pencil with a brush for blending.  
</P>
<P>
 Her daily beauty routine begins with Clarins Facial Toner. She creates her 
dewy-fresh look by using copious amounts of Kiehl's Ultra Facial Moisturizer, 
followed by a light dusting of Shu Uemura Colorless Face Powder instead of 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All girls should wear eyelashes all the time," she trills happily, opening a 
pack of individual false eyelashes -- Duralash by Ardell -- which she trims 
with tiny scissors, then glues to the lash line at the corner of each eye. She 
covers any excess glue with a brownish-black cake eyeliner, a trick only for 
the sure-of-hand. To finish, she applies one of her many berry-colored 
lipsticks, some of them by Chanel, a brand she favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few days, she washes her layered hair with a chamomile shampoo from 
Trader Joe's. One thing she never needs is blush: She blushes naturally -- 
especially in front of, rather than behind, a camera.

 Early on, they were drawn to their profession by a love of art, a fascination 
with the process of transformation, even the aroma of a beauty salon. Now six 
Los Angeles makeup artists polish the faces of those oh-so-gorgeous ones who 
pose for magazines, appear in commercials and decorate the movie screen. Making 
an actor or model more beautiful is usually easy. But what happens when they're 
challenged with their own less-than-perfect features? 
</P>
<P>
 No lipstick, no eyeliner, no blush -- men are lucky. So how does a male makeup 
artist (called a groomer when he works on men) get ready for a big night out? 
Johnny Hernandez, 34, says it's easy -- a shampoo, a shave, maybe tweezing an 
errant eyebrow hair.  
</P>
<P>
 He plucks his eyebrows?  
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. "I keep them clean," Hernandez explains. It turns out that 
removing just a few hairs between the eyes and below the brows is a 
little-publicized trick of many actors and models -- hmmm, Jack Nicholson 
perhaps? "It's really subtle," he says. "The brows can't look reshaped. You 
keep the same natural line, just clean them up to make the eyes look bigger."  
</P>
<P>
 With his clear olive skin and thick auburn hair, Hernandez's daily grooming 
needs are minimal: no sunscreen (he wears hats and sunglasses instead), no 
bronzer, just a daily wash with Neutrogena Shampoo for normal to dry hair, 
followed by Neutrogena conditioner. To slick back his hair, cut stylishly long 
in front and short in back, he uses Sebastian Molding Mud. He prefers to shave 
after his shower, applying Erno Laszlo Active Phelityl Oil for dry skin, then 
lathering up with a shaving cream by Kiehl's. And he never uses disposable 
razors: "They're too light, and I always end up cutting myself." 
</P>
<P>
 To lengthen his oval face, Hernandez keeps his sideburns trimmed about an inch 
long and avoids wearing shirts with band collars. His facial hair changes 
constantly -- one month, a goatee, the next, a mustache. His one facial 
constant: Erno Laszlo's men's skin program.

<P>
 I've always been attracted to the metamorphosis of beauty -- it never ceases 
to amaze me," says Tena Bernard, who personally wears very little makeup ("You 
get kind of burned out on it"). 
</P>
<P>
 Come a special occasion, however, and Bernard transforms. Her moisturizer is 
Chanel's Oil-Free Skin Recovery Lotion, followed by a yellow-toned concealer -- 
"a lot of concealers add pink, which looks unnatural" -- then MAC Studio Colour 
Sheer Foundation applied with a makeup sponge. She adds yellow highlights 
beneath her eyes and down the center of her nose to enhance the shallow bridge. 
She prefers Bobbi Brown face powders because the tones are warm enough for 
black skin without turning orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Her eyebrows are thin, so she plucks them only to create a clean line. She 
applies Prescriptives Eye-shadow Multiples from the yellow-orange line with a 
fine brush, using a light hand and a brown shade to sculpt rather than paint 
the brow. She highlights her eyes with a beige shade, then coats her lids with 
a camel-colored Bobbi Brown shadow. Throughout, she tests the colors repeatedly 
on the back of her hand.  
</P>
<P>
 On her hair, she uses a mild relaxer, a reddish-brown rinse and Artec shampoo 
for color-treated hair. She keeps it short -- "I like tousled hair that looks 
like it just fell into place." 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old holds a degree in merchandising from Louisiana State 
University but prefers makeup to retailing: "I heard an inspirational speech 
saying that the way to be happy was to find something you enjoy doing and make 
money at it. For me, makeup was it."

 Early on, they were drawn to their profession by a love of art, a fascination

 In her Long Island high school, Cheryl Marks was recognizable as the girl with 
blue highlights in her hair. When she announced that she planned to become a 
hairdresser, her father bribed her into college with a car. She worked as a 
shampoo girl on Saturdays until she received her fine arts degree. Then 
hairstyling won out. After a few years, she traveled to Milan to build a photo 
portfolio, learning makeup by assisting makeup artists. "I found it exactly the 
same as working on a canvas," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In both her work and personal life, Marks' style is natural and minimal. Now 
35 and fond of water sports, she worries about skin care, faithfully using 
Kiehl's Dermal Protection Eye & Throat Creme, Kiehl's SPF 8 Dermal Protection 
Face Cream and Origins Line Chaser. To her nose and forehead, she applies 
Origins Zero Oil, a matte-finish liquid for oily places. On most days, she 
stops there. For nights on the town, she whips out a Shiseido sponge and, using 
short, even strokes, lightly covers her face with MAC Day Emulsion, a tinted 
moisturizer. "I have sad dog eyes -- they slant down," she explains, so she 
doesn't line her lids. Instead, she highlights them and her brow bones and adds 
MAC Brun eye shadow in the creases. On her lips, she uses "tons" of The Body 
Shop Lip Balm, plus MAC Captive lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 For her dry hair, Marks likes shampoos with oil and Aveda Cherry Bar 
conditioner. Still fond of highlights (though not blue ones), she periodically 
streaks her hair -- "surfer girl highlights," she calls them -- sweeping a 
Mason Pearson nylon-and-natural-bristle brush through her locks.

 As a child, David Cox accompanied his mother to her beauty salon. "I just 
loved the smell," he recalls. Later in life, because he liked the idea of 
working with people and with his hands, the blond South African surfer chose to 
pursue hairdressing rather than architecture, a career decision that his 
friends found a bit weird. "But I really liked it; I had a feel for it," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Just back from a photo shoot in Cabo San Lucas, where he shattered his finger 
in a motorcycle accident, Cox, 37, looks in the mirror and decides that he 
needs a haircut. "I don't like to fuss with my hair," he says, "and as soon as 
the top starts growing into a ball, it's time to cut it." With a heavy-duty 
Wahl shaver, he begins whacking -- his description -- at the top, then tips his 
head and uses his fingers to feel his way with the clippers at the back. Any 
stray hairs are snipped with tiny KIKUI scissors. To finish, he runs a comb 
through his eyebrows and trims them, then rubs a dime-sized knob of Bumble and 
bumble Styling Creme into his hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox frequently works outdoors and finds that hats interfere with his work, so 
he coats his face and neck daily with Kiehl's Water-Based Suncreen Lotion SPF 
16. "I surf and I have lines and I'm not going to try and disguise them," he 
says, "but if I'd known about sunscreen as a kid, I would have used it." To go 
easy on his sensitive skin -- and because his behind-the-scenes job will allow 
it -- he shaves only once a week, using Kiehl's Squadron Shave Cream: "I let my 
beard grow out and when it starts pricking my girlfriend's face too much, I 
know it's time."

 Liz Rizo has a lovely oval face and olive skin but an oily "T zone" (forehead 
and nose) and the occasional annoying bout of adult acne as well. For her 
sensitive skin, she uses The Body Shop's Cocoa Butter Hand and Body Lotion as 
her moisturizer, followed by Prescriptives Makeup 1, an especially light 
foundation. To conceal blemishes, she dabs on Prescriptives Camouflage Cream.  
</P>
<P>
 With a tapered, angled brush from Columbia Stage and Screen Cosmetics, a 
Hollywood beauty-supply store, she blends in MAC's Brun eye shadow on her 
eyebrows. She then covers her lids with Almay Easy to Wear matte-brown eye 
colors, which she likes for their creamy consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizo, 30, has large, almond-shaped eyes, one slightly larger than the other. 
The difference goes unnoticed after she has shaded her eye area from the top 
lashes to slightly above the creases and just below the bottom lashes. With a 
Prestige Kohl E12 pencil, she lines the inside of her lids to make her eyes 
appear smaller. Using white inside the lids, she notes, would make her eyes 
look too big.  
</P>
<P>
 After mascara, Rizo uses Revlon's Spicy Peach powder blush and a coating of 
lip balm. She prefers a lip liner, not lipstick, for color. Her current 
favorite: MAC's Spice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizo's career began four years ago, when, burned out from a job in art 
consulting, she enrolled in beauty college. She trained in Northern California 
and, with friends from her hometown of Modesto already in the business, soon 
began working as a makeup assistant. In the past two years, she's graduated to 
full-time L.A. makeup artist.

ANOTHER MELROSE PLACE; MORTONS HAS A NEW LOCATION, SLIGHTLY NEW MENU -- AND THE 
SAME OLD FAMOUS FACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In Edith Wharton's 1905 novel "The House of Mirth," several of the wealthy 
Americans sojourning in Monte Carlo consider where to eat. One woman confides 
to a new arrival on the scene: "Of course, one gets the best things at the 
Terrasse -- but that looks as if one hadn't any other reason for being there: 
The Americans who don't know anyone always rush for the best food." 
</P>
<P>
 Put me squarely in that category. If I have to choose between the decor of a 
restaurant and good food, I'll always go for the latter. That's why you 
probably won't find me ensconced at Mortons. At this Los Angeles restaurant, 
opened in 1980 by Peter Morton, founder of the Hard Rock Cafe, the food was 
always secondary to the scene. Not that you ate badly there -- the cooking was 
just never particularly exciting. Familiar, yes. Staid, yes. It quietly 
appeared and was eaten, without ever clamoring for your attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulars could expect to see the same faces week in, week out, mostly insiders 
in the television and film industries. Its cachet seemed solid as a rock. Then 
in mid-January, after nearly 14 years at the same low-key location, Morton 
moved his namesake restaurant across the street, to the former Trump's space.  
</P>
<P>
 The old Mortons was so discreet that only the glint of light through the 
closed shutters gave away its location at Melrose and Robertson. The entrance 
was hidden around the corner. The brash new Mortons has the name scrawled high 
on the facade, and the entrance can be seen from Melrose. But just as before, 
the restaurant consists of a large high-ceilinged room with a few palms to 
shelter the publicity-shy. It seats about 140, as opposed to 120, but it 
doesn't feel cramped. However, the acoustics are such that it's harder to 
overhear any juicy gossip. It's even difficult to hear across the table. The 
old space was so dark you needed a night-scope to spot a celebrity. It's a 
touch brighter now, but still dim enough to hamper serious star-gazing. 
</P>
<P>
 With the change of venue, Morton has also freshened up the cuisine. He's hired 
Brian Keller, a young chef who worked with both Jeremiah Tower of Stars in San 
Francisco and Bradley Ogden at Lark Creek Inn in Larkspur. The idea was not to 
tear down the menu and start from scratch. To avoid unsettling the faithful, 
certain items like the Morton's house salad, a nice mix of organic baby 
lettuces with fresh shrimp and a generous handful of English peas, have been 
preserved. Also still on board, the spicy tuna sashimi in a creamy dressing. 
The free-range, lime-grilled chicken is delicious, mahogany on the outside and 
moist within. You can still count on a decent dry-aged New York steak served 
with wild mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes. And a note on the menu assures 
that "Selections can be prepared in classic Mortons style upon request." 
Everyone's home safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the gooey but appealing quesadilla with black beans and Mexican 
shrimp. The Maryland crab cakes, never a favorite of mine, now come with a 
hipper mustard aioli and a coarse red cabbage slaw. It's barely three months 
into the new Mortons, it's true, but the menu changes look more like tinkering 
than a culinary revolution. A couple of the new dishes, however, are 
surprisingly gutsy in concept -- at least for Mortons. Take the grilled shrimp 
in a salty -- too salty -- Chinese black bean sauce or the chilled asparagus 
with truffled beets and a garnish of shaved jicama. (It sounds more interesting 
than what appears on the plate.) Some dishes seem to be present because they're 
popular everywhere else, like the so-so corn pancake, here paired with grilled 
lobster instead of the ubiquitous smoked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Decked out in colors of the Italian flag, a plate of marinated lentils 
surrounded with organic tomatoes, scoops of arugula pesto and pristine 
bocconcino ("little bites") of mozzarella replaces the more conventional 
tomato, basil and Mozzarella salad. Instead of lemon and butter, swordfish is 
served in a chile-lime vinaigrette with a tired radicchio and cucumber relish. 
The ahi tuna, which was  
</P>
<P>
 always perfectly grilled, now comes with a yellow-tomato coulis. The 
unremarkable lamb loin gets a mild ginger marinade. Pork tenderloin was 
particularly disappointing, overcooked and tasteless. The old menu didn't have 
great ambitions, but the new menu seems to lack a clear point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch can be more fun than dinner; the atmosphere is more upbeat, and the food 
is marginally better. Spring rolls filled with shrimp and shredded vegetables 
are quite good, the grilled vegetable plate with wild rice is fine. And the 
pancetta pizza (also on the dinner menu) is a respectable rendition, but watch 
out for the dense burger on a thick doughy bun and the "lean duck" sandwich.  
</P>
<P>
 As far as I can see, the best thing about lunch is that, should there be 
anyone to see, it's bright enough to actually get a look. And after all, that's 
why at least half the crowd is here. It's definitely not -- it couldn't 
possibly be -- for the food. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortons, 8764 Melrose Ave., Los Angeles; (310) 276-1253. Open Monday through 
Friday for lunch, Monday through Saturday for dinner. Full bar. Valet parking.

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the new Mortons opened, virtually every wine in the place was overpriced. 
But recently, prices were reduced almost across the board.What had been a steep 
$40 for 1990 Sonoma-Cutrer "Les Pierres" Chardonnay now is an OK $35; what had 
been an excessive $48 for 1990 Matanzas Creek Merlot is now an almost fair $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this list is pretty unexciting. The California white wine "selection" 
is 18 Chardonnays and one Sauvignon Blanc -- and it's made like a Chardonnay 
(1992 Matanzas Creek, a bargain at $18). The domestic red list is almost all 
weighty Cabernet Sauvignons. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the whites, two great wines at fair prices are 1991 Sancerre from Comte La 
Fond, $28, and the best buy, 1992 Poggio Alle Gazze, a Sauvignon Blanc from the 
Tuscan estate of Lodovico Antinori, $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the red wines, the excellent 1991 Acacia Pinot Noir, $25, and the powerful 
1990 Chianti Classico "Peppoli" from Piero Antinori, $27, are both excellent 
choices. Dan Berger

ON THE RECORD: 75 SATISFYING YEARS IN CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Chicago Symphony Orchestra issued a pricey box of CDs commemorating 
its centennial in 1992, a major selling point, in addition to the orchestra's 
tradition of artistic excellence, was the amount of nostalgia that exists among 
Windy City expatriates. 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders whether tear ducts are similarly exercised by erstwhile residents 
of Cleveland -- a smaller city, to be sure, but also one that rarely receives 
widespread good press. Among the enlightened few, however, the city has 
artistic cachet, what with its fine Museum of Art, Institute of Music and the 
Cleveland Orchestra, the qualitative equal -- and not only to local jingoists 
-- of any on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 To dispel any remaining doubts, and the notion that they are come-latelys, the 
Cleveland Orchestra offers as evidence a 10-CD 75th Anniversary Edition -- 
available only from the orchestra offices directly at (800) 686-1141 -- that 
traces its history through its six music directors (and interim "music 
adviser," Pierre Boulez), from Nikolai Sokoloff in 1918 to Christoph von 
Dohnanyi, who has occupied the position for the past decade. The early days are 
represented by commercial recordings, the past 30 years by broadcast 
transcriptions of live performances, most of them in Severance Hall, the 
orchestra's acoustically welcoming home since 1931. 
</P>
<P>
 Execution is already impressively alert and solid in the set's leadoff 
component, a 1928 electrical recording of a not-too-drastically abbreviated 
Rachmaninoff Second Symphony under Sokoloff, lovingly presented in a bygone 
style emphasizing rhythmic freedom, with expressive string portamentos. 
</P>
<P>
 Artur Rodzinski, who guided the orchestra for a decade, starting in 1933, 
communicates a more hard-edged interpretive bent in a dry-eyed Rimsky-Korsakov 
"Scheherazade" and a zippy Shostakovich First Symphony (1941), the latter 
showing off superbly incisive solo winds and brass. 
</P>
<P>
 Erich Leinsdorf is next, his brief tenure having included the commercial 
recording (1946) heard here of an attractive suite of orchestral interludes, 
arranged by the conductor, from Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande" and led with 
uncharacteristic flexibility and delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The glory years arrived (although not immediately) with the ascendancy of 
George Szell, in place from 1946 through 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The Szell era is represented by, among others, a couple of handsome Sibelius 
symphonies (Nos. 2 and 3); a tough, vital Mozart Requiem; a curiously abridged 
suite from Richard Strauss' "Bourgeois Gentilhomme," with glowing solo work 
from concertmaster Rafael Druian and, indeed, from all the principals, and a 
powerful Mahler "Lied von der Erde," with tenor Richard Lewis and mezzo Janet 
Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Szell shows himself -- not surprisingly -- in firm control of his scores and 
of his musicians. But he is not nearly as unyielding or coolly objective before 
an audience as he could be in his studio recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 Szell's successor, Lorin Maazel, represented a more overtly expressive style, 
exemplified in a gorgeous, grandiose Tchaikovsky "Manfred" Symphony, if not in 
Jacob Druckman's atomized, nocturnal and quite tedious 1972 "Windows." 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra under Pierre Boulez is shown to particular advantage in the 
"Chant du Rossignol" of Stravinsky, a display of blazing virtuosity en masse , 
and in the knockings, tinklings and twitterings of Messiaen's dopey "Oiseaux 
Exotiques," with Philippe Entremont the stylish pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dohnanyi decade, during which the orchestra has achieved in live 
performance the technical perfection found in Szell's best studio recordings, 
is most impressively documented here by Carl Ruggles' craggy "Sun-treader," led 
with immense relish. And from the 1992 Salzburg Festival, there are Mahler's 
"Ruckert Lieder," sung with heart-stopping poignancy by baritone Jose van Dam, 
and the Weill-Brecht "Seven Deadly Sins," presented with strikingly apt 
musicality and directness -- as opposed to parlando caricature -- by soprano 
Anja Silja, the conductor's wife, with orchestral execution of such skill under 
Dohnanyi's edgily idiomatic leadership that other recorded editions of this 
tricky work sound amateurish, even uncomprehending, in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Happy birthday, Cleveland.

POP EYE: IS THE POP WORLD READY FOR DAVID KORESH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the furor has died down over Guns N' Roses' recording a song written 
by Charles Manson, is the pop world ready for an album of recordings by . . . 
David Koresh? 
</P>
<P>
 "Voice of Fire," just released by the small, Iowa-based Junior's Motel label, 
features a sampling of the music and oratory of the late Branch Davidian cult 
leader. The CD cover shows a drawing of Koresh engulfed in flames -- a clear 
reference to the fiery conclusion of his Waco, Tex., standoff last year with 
federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Manson, Koresh was a rock-star wanna-be who once lived in Hollywood and 
tried to pursue a music career. Besides a lengthy biblical oration, the album 
features his shaky but passable singing and more steady guitar playing on two 
religious-tinged acoustic songs, "Book of Daniel" and "Sheshonahim." 
</P>
<P>
 The CD was made from tapes given to Kirk Kaufman, owner of the Junior's Motel 
label, by his girlfriend, Sandy Berlin, who, he says, knew Koresh in the early 
'80s. Koresh had remained in touch with Berlin over the years, occasionally 
trying to talk her into joining his cult in Waco, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, we weren't going to put it out," says Kaufman, who says he 
worried that he could be accused of exploiting a tragedy. "But it seemed 
important to have people see another side of (Koresh). It just didn't feel 
right leaving it in our closet." 
</P>
<P>
 The album was released with the permission of Koresh's mother, who asked that 
some of the proceeds go to a young girl fathered by the cult leader. Kaufman, 
43, does not expect to make much money from the album -- only 3,000 copies have 
been released and Kaufman does not plan to manufacture many more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sacramento-based record distributor Bayside agreed last week to handle the 
album on the West Coast after several stores inquired about the collection's 
availability. But Bayside purchasing agent Fred Hughes says he does not expect 
to sell more than a few hundred copies. 
</P>
<P>
 More significant than sales is the publicity, says Kaufman, who hopes the 
project will generate interest in his company and in the independent rock acts 
he has produced. 
</P>
<P>
 When informed of the album, the Sacramento-based Doris Tate Crime Victims 
Bureau expressed the same anger over "Voice of Fire" as it did last year over 
Guns N' Roses' "The Spaghetti Incident?" album, which included a version of 
Manson's song "Look at Your Game, Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Koresh hurt a lot of people," says Kelly Rudiger, executive director of 
the organization, which was founded by the late mother of actress Sharon Tate, 
who was murdered by Manson followers in 1969. "No one should be able to make 
money on things like that." Steve Hochman

RECORD RACK: PANTERA 'DRIVEN' DEEPER UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE TURMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PANTERA 
</P>
<P>
 "Far Beyond Driven" 
</P>
<P>
 EastWest  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Heavier and more unrelenting with each successive release, Pantera blurs the 
line between guttural, Henry Rollins-style Angst and its own tightly wound, 
slow metallic burn on this third album. It should certainly cement Pantera's 
credibility in the more underground arena populated by the likes of Sepultura. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it entered the charts at No. 1 last week, mainstream fans beware 
-- this music isn't for the faint of ear. Singer Phil Anselmo's 
throat-punishing growl atop thundering, slow grooves makes for an assault on 
the senses that, except for a mellow Black Sabbath tune, is truly merciless. 
</P>
<P>
 The album starts off with the jackhammer bludgeoning and spooky guitar 
melodies of "Strength Beyond Strength," and from there the Texas-based quartet 
delves into its specialty -- weighty, riff-oriented power grooves -- with a 
vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks are as heavy and angry lyrically as they are musically. Produced by 
Pantera's drummer Vinnie Paul and Terry Date (Soundgarden), "Far Beyond Driven" 
is ferocious and dynamic, but without the musical diversity that characterized 
the band's first two albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the 13-to-24 male audience, Pantera's formidable command of the 
killer slo-mo riff is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

<P>
 "Martinis & Bikinis" 
</P>

 Virgin  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips and producer-husband T Bone Burnett have been accused of trying to 
channel John Lennon, and they're unapologetic enough in that quasi-psychedelic 
power-pop regard to wrap this one up with a surly, muted version of Lennon's 
spiteful "Gimme Some Truth." It's an appropriatecapper, given the high level of 
social protest already registered through "Martinis." 
</P>
<P>
 But where Lennon lobbed most of his Molotov cocktails at militarists and 
squares, Phillips has it in for the hedonist pop culture. She's a bitter enough 
former fundamentalist to rail against "the political church" but saves a lot 
more broadsides for the secular status-seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 In Phillips' view, the materialism of both right and left is a sorry 
sublimation of universal spiritual longings she describes in C. S. Lewis-like 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is one of the soberest albums you're likely to hear this year, the 
music is still a wonderfully druggy punch, using the styles of Lennon's 
wonder-struck days to convey the sort of bitter, confrontational confessionals 
he graduated to. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Burnett throws in some harder or more psychobilly-ish guitars too, 
to ensure it doesn't sound so self-conscious a throwback. "Martinis" just might 
leave you shaken and stirred. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 CECE PENISTON 
</P>
<P>
 "Thought You Knew" 
</P>
<P>
 A&M  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 Like other notable singers of her generation, such as Mary J. Blige, Peniston 
has been influenced by the vocal giants who precede her. Still, she's managed 
to fashion a style that's fairly unique.Peniston's second album evokes memories 
of early recordings by Patti LaBelle and Chaka Khan. You know right away that 
you're dealing with state-of-the-art R&B. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 1992 hit single "Finally" showed tough-edged promise, and this album 
contains moments equally appealing -- from her gruff 'n' ready vocal riff on 
"Searchin' " to the tart, vinegary, dancehall funk of "Through Those Doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Peniston's flair for creative phrasing gives such tracks as "I'm in the Mood" 
and "Give What I'm Givin"' their spunk. It's one thing to just mouth a bunch of 
lyrics; in budding soul-diva fashion, Peniston really breathes life into them. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of this former beauty queen's style lies in its ingratiating grace 
and command. This may be the year the world finally takes note. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

POP MUSIC CHARTS: AHEAD OF THE PAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Above the Rim" soundtrack wound up skying above the rest of the 
competition, slam-dunking at No. 1 on The Times' Southern California pop album 
chart. The appeal of 2Pac, who's in the movie, probably had a lot to do with 
its success, but the presence of artists such as H-Town and SWV didn't hurt. 
Look for Bonnie Raitt's "Longing in Their Hearts," which debuted at No. 3, to 
be an enduring hit. New Age king Yanni, whose album jumped to No. 8, may have 
the genre's album of the year -- unless New Age queen Enya comes out with a new 
one this year. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,43,11 Title, Artist (National Rank) Last

Busman -- as in holiday -- with Paul McCartney enlisting post-punk producer 
Youth to assist with this pseudonymous foray into semi-ambient techno.And how 
does Macca fare in the rave new world? Well, maybe someone should have told him 
that the idea is to induce trances, not snores. Don't give up your day job,

Frank Sinatra's "Duets" leave you unsatisfied? Bass-master Wasserman's latest 
project ups the ante, as he anchors a series of sparkling threesomes for real 
musical interplay, crossing genres (Primus' Les Claypool with blues-rocker 
Chris Whitley) and generations (Carnie Wilson reunited with her dad, 
Brian).Other participants of note include Elvis Costello, Willie Dixon and Neil 
Young.

 * * * Eugenius, "Mary Queen of Scots," Atlantic. The second album from this 
Glasgow band, fronted by ex-Vaseline Eugene Kelly, is an oddly addictive mix of 
Velvet Underground-style distortion and crystal-clear vocals.Muted melodies 
begin beautifully, fill with tension and then explode into bursts of guitar 
feedback with little warning. "Pebble" and "Easter Bunny" are as haunting as 
they are easy to sing along with.

 Robert Altman's triumphant and witty take on Hollywood opens on a studio lot 
with a bravura eight-minute take -- perhaps a sendup of Orson Welles' 
celebrated credit sequence of "Touch of Evil" -- which ends up in the office of 
smooth but slimy young executive Tim Robbins (pictured), the target of 
anonymous death threats. Scads of stars playing themselves, lots of inside 
jokes and sure to appeal to anyone who presumes to be hip to Hollywood (TMC 
Sunday at 11:55 a.m., again at 10:40 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

 LENNON ROM: One artist whose work is being discussed as the basis for a 
possible CD-ROM project is John Lennon. Capitol Records executives have been in 
discussion with his widow Yoko Ono about developing a CD-ROM project about the 
late rock star. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of several projects being proposed to honor Lennon, including 
talks about what a Capitol spokesman describes as "the definitive Lennon box 
set" anthology (a Lennon box featuring all of his solo tracks was released in 
England only two years ago) and a possible album of other artists performing 
Lennon songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is said to be the outgrowth of numerous artists' asking permission 
to record Lennon songs, though Capitol would not say what artists might be 
included on such a tribute album. 
</P>
<P>
 A George Harrison tribute album is also being planned, with Harrison himself 
apparently taking the lead in the project's development. Harrison reportedly 
sent letters to several managers asking if their artists would be interested. 
If he gets enough commitments, the project will be released through Giant 
Records. Steve Hochman

 HIDING OUT: It sounds like hype, but apparently it's true: Rapper Jazz Lee 
Alston is having to work on her debut album for American Records in a secret 
location because she's living in fear of a murderer whose crime she witnessed.  
</P>
<P>
 Alston was present when her cousin was shot to death in December, 1992, in New 
York.The killer is still at large. The incident, in fact, inspired Alston's 
song "Love . . . Never That," which was included in the American-distributed 
"Seattle . . . the Dark Side," an anthology of Northwest rap put together by 
Sir Mix-a-Lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem now is how to promote Alston's career without drawing the 
attention of a killer whom she could potentially help convict.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be out there promoting the album like any first-time artist," she 
promises.

 Sean Penn's 1991 writing and directing debut is a psychodrama so intensely 
personal that it is difficult to read or even experience as anything more than 
a not-quite-veiled commentary on his own life. Based loosely on Bruce 
Springsteen's brooding song "Highway Patrolman," it is a Vietnam-era parable of 
two Midwestern brothers -- the local sheriff (David Morse, left) and the local 
hell-raiser (Viggo Mortensen) -- dealing in their own ways with the collapse of 
their family. Although overly self-involved, Penn is surprisingly focused as a 
director (TMC Monday at 2:20 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Nikita Mikhalkov's poignant 1992 film is felicitously titled, for it opens 
with a seemingly endless vista of a grassy plain in China's Inner Mongolia, in 
the middle of which is a small encampment, home to a happy, healthy young 
peasant couple (Bayaertu, left, and Badema) and their family. What Mikhalkov 
has done so effectively is to catch us up in the daily existence of such 
thoroughly likable people that not until the film's stunning coda do we realize 
that he has been bidding fond farewell to a way of life that's soon to vanish

 One of the most powerful and memorable documentaries on prostitution. The 
entire film is an act of exposure, of both Aoi, a Thai prostitute, and the 
filmmaker, the Australian Dennis O'Rourke, who falls in love with her in the 
process of making the film.We're never allowed to step very far back, either 
from Aoi's hurt life or O'Rourke's increasing shame at his part in it. He 
offered her a rice farm for her participation in the film; the result of that 
offer forms this 1992 documentary's bleak coda. Those who denounce this movie 
for its displays of nudity or conversations about sex will have foolishly 
missed the point (Cinemax Thursday at 4:30 a.m.) Michael Wilmington

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE FUTURE CAREER OF SARAH POLLEY DEPENDS ON ONE 
AUDITION -- SERIOUSLY  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sarah Polley, who plays Sara Stanley on the Disney series "Avonlea," is not 
the sort of actress who counts the number of lines she has in each script. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, throughout the five seasons of the show based on Lucy Maud 
Montgomery's children stories, Polley has asked to be in fewer and fewer shows. 
Next season, at her request, she'll only be in one episode of "Avonlea." 
</P>
<P>
 Asking for less time may sound odd for a 15-year-old performer whose role was 
the initial focus of the show, but Polley is determined. "I want to be a writer 
and a political activist," she says from her home in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, her acting career now hinges on a feature-film role she's up for. If 
she gets the part, which would take her to Los Angeles, she says she'll 
continue acting; if not, she says she'll focus on her education. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty serious time for me," she says. "The film is actually something 
I really want to do. Basically, it (my career) depends on if I get that part." 
</P>
<P>
 Her career began when she was 4 in the feature "One Magic Christmas," followed 
by "The Big Town" and "Pretty Kill." She starred in the Canadian series 
"Ramona," which is available on video. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boggles my mind how together she is," says "Avonlea" producer Kevin 
Sullivan. "She wants to go to Oxford, where her father went, and she's 
determined to do it. She's worked long and hard at acting. She's seen what it 
has done to fellow actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "She grew up in an acting environment and spent a year on a huge production, 
'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Polley turned 9 during the 1988 filming of the troubled, big-budget Terry 
Gilliam film, which was shot in Italy and Spain. It starred Gilliam's "Monty 
Python" pal Eric Idle, as well as Oliver Reed, John Neville, Uma Thurman and 
Robin Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 When casting his Disney film "Lantern Hill," Sullivan says, "she was the only 
actress I knew of anywhere in the world who had the technical skill behind her 
and had the wide range of emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 He found the Canadian actress' ability to do accents right on target. Says 
Sullivan: "She used a Cockney accent for 'Lantern Hill' and has also used an 
English accent." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have also praised Polley. In her "Munchausen" review, The Times' 
Sheila Benson says Polley "seems to have been blessed oblivious to any 
child-acting cliches." In Lynne Heffley's review of "Avonlea" in The Times, she 
calls the actress "one of the most beguiling child actors around." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan says that the transition from child actor to ingenue is a difficult 
one, but he thinks that if she chooses an acting career, Polley has the ability 
"to become a (Meryl) Streep, a star performer. Her skills are much more 
sophisticated than other professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Next week's "Avonlea" -- which has evolved into an ensemble hourlong show -- 
will focus on Polley's Sara Stanley's first kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Polley has only one other acting job lined up. She'll play the lead in "Alice 
Through the Looking Glass" at the Stratford Shakespearean Festival in Ontario, 
Canada. "It's something I'm interested in doing," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Polley knows what else she wants to do, the time away from acting isn't 
daunting. "I've been working since I was four and this is the first big open 
space I've left for myself. I've always had two jobs lined up. Now I've set my 
sights on an alternative future." 
</P>
<P>
 "Avonlea" airs Mondays at 8 p.m. and repeats the following Sunday at 6 p.m. on 
the Disney Channel.

FOCUS; GOOD AND BAD TIMES IN 'SOUTH CENTRAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1970s, it was hard times for the Evans family on television's "Good 
Times." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Norman Lear-Bud Yorkin situation comedy, the lower-middle-class black 
family living in a Chicago high-rise housing project struggled weekly to keep 
their heads above water, despite overwhelming social odds. When actor John 
Amos, who played the father, left the series, his character was killed off and 
Florida Evans (Esther Rolle) had to work extra hard to keep her three children 
on the straight and narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The song remains much the same in 1994 for another black television family. 
But from the looks of Fox's new comedy-drama, "South Central," the "good times" 
have only gotten worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of riot-torn Los Angeles, single mother Joan Mosley (Tina 
Lifford) struggles determinedly to keep her three children from the ravages of 
poverty and gang-related influence and violence while attempting to overcome 
her own difficulties in trying to find a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike its 1970s predecessor, "South Central" does not have characters 
such as J.J. Evans (J.J. Walker) bellowing DY-NO-MITE at opportune moments to 
help take the edge off the realism. 
</P>
<P>
 In one episode, Tina admonishes her teen-age son Andre (Lorenz Tate) when he 
tries to get a beeper. In another episode, when Andre accepts a "gift" of money 
from a high school friend who is a drug dealer, she angrily takes him over to 
the dealer's apartment to make him give it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, ain't no thang to me," says the dealer to Joan. "You're the one who 
don't have the money to feed your sorry-ass family." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan evenly responds, "No, I don't. But I would rather clean toilets, dig 
ditches, do anything than take one penny from you." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly rib-tickling material. But as the show's creators, Michael J. 
Weithorn and Ralph Farquhar, explain, the honesty must come through despite the 
show's sitcom format. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to have an integrity, and we have to make it work this way," says 
Farquhar, an African American who was a former supervising producer on Fox's 
"Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before "South Central" went into production on its second episode, the 
show had already created a "buzz" -- and not all of it positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics from Newsweek and other publications praised the tone of the show, 
saying it transported "the comedy-drama genre into a whole new place." However, 
others had trouble with some of the lines and ensuing laughter, such as when 
the series' young daughter tells her mother, "I love the smell of gunfire in 
the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Farquhar says he and Weithorn held focus groups and discussions with community 
leaders to assure them that the show would not make light of South Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of trepidation and anticipation in the community about whether 
this show is going to trivialize the issues with jokes," he says. "But we're 
going to treat everything with honesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Weithorn recalled another run-through of the show last year when it was being 
considered by CBS as one of its fall series. Executives attending the first 
rehearsal were bothered by the show, according to Weithorn, and wanted him and 
Farquhar to inject more jokes before the second run-through. They refused. The 
show was subsequently turned down by CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fox has not put any restrictions on us whatsoever," says Weithorn. "The show 
we're putting on is entirely our vision. So if it fails, it will not be 
something we can blame on the network." 
</P>
<P>
 What's also important to Weithorn and Farquhar is that "South Central" is not 
classified strictly as a "black" show. "There are problems that this mother and 
this family are going through that absolutely everyone can relate to," Weithorn 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the cast members seem to be taking the controversy surrounding the 
series in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I approach this apprehension as just another job that I am doing as an 
actress," says Lifford, who has appeared as a guest star on several series. 
"I'm just letting the chips fall where they may. It is not my responsibility. I 
am totally focused on the work. I just know that this show is dealing with the 
truth, the total truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Tate says that he feels a little pressure about the public expectations for 
the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that people are looking forward to this just to see exactly 
how we're going to handle it," says Tate, who played a murderous wayward youth 
in last summer's critically acclaimed film "Menace II Society." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first read for this, I didn't even know it was a sitcom," says Tate. 
"There are shows similar to this, like 'Roseanne,' but nothing quite like it. 
This will show things in our community more in depth." 
</P>
<P>
 The set of the show reflects its inspiration in many aspects -- positive and 
negative. Graffitis mar the walls of an apartment building. Although the 
family's house is not in the best of shape, it is clear that someone is doing 
the best she can to maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast and the producers say that "South Central" will mark an important 
step in the portrayal of African Americans on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "For once, viewers in America will see the variety of the African American 
experience," says Lifford. "It's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 "South Central" premieres Tuesday at 8 p.m. on Fox.

ON VIEW; TNT'S BIBLE STUDIES; 'ABRAHAM' IS THE FIRST OF AN EPIC 22 TESTAMENT 
TALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, Jeff Kaye, a London-based writer, is a frequent contributor to TV 
Times.

 Richard Harris sits back in his pied-a-terre at the sumptuous Savoy Hotel on 
the River Thames, telling one of those on-the-set anecdotes that sounds like it 
was dreamed up by a Hollywood publicist. But he swears it's true. 
</P>
<P>
 There he was, in Ourzazate, Morocco, playing Abraham in the TNT version of the 
eponymous Bible story that airs this week, when trouble occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was about to perform one of the most crucial scenes in the film, the 
moment when God tells Abraham, amid a blustery wind, that the land of Canaan 
will belong forever to him and his descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had all these wind machines," recalls Harris, wearing a white, 
ankle-length caftan he picked up in Morocco while shooting the film last year. 
"The wind would blow and the trees would rumble under the force of God." 
</P>
<P>
 As crew members began testing the machines, however, the power generator broke 
and they couldn't repair it. "I turned to (director) Joe Sargent and I said, 
'Turn the cameras, Joe,' " Harris recalls. Sargent balked, insisting they had 
to have the wind machines, but gave in to Harris' urging. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, as the director yelled for the cameras to roll, "a gale blew from 
the mountains with 10 times the force that the wind machines could have 
projected. When he stopped the cameras, the wind died. Can you believe this?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Sargent (who won an Emmy for "Miss Rose White") decided to reposition his 
three cameras and shoot the same scene from different angles, the wind stirred 
up once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to tell you," Harris says, "an eerie feeling permeated that entire 
crew, the likes of which I have never witnessed in my life. I said, 'Joe, I 
think God has just given us his seal of approval.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Harris, playing the patriarch of the Jewish and Islamic faiths, became a 
spiritual journey. But he nearly turned down the role out of fears over how the 
story and his character would be presented. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a reluctance to do it," he acknowledges. "I've seen all the Hollywood 
Bible movies and I found them all dreadful." He also has some personal 
experience in the biblical department, having played Cain in John Huston's 1966 
film, "The Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris pours a cup of coffee, just delivered by room service, as bright 
sunshine -- uncharacteristic for London in March -- filters through his living 
room window. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Hollywood makes these movies," he says, "they undoubtedly play these 
characters as either a rebel or a saint. They're set up as being enormously 
heroic. I said I didn't want to play him that way. Abraham, a man advanced in 
years, according to the Old Testament, had been chosen. And the responsibility 
of being chosen must have been enormous. Excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I said I would like to play him, not as a man born to greatness, but as a 
man with greatness thrust upon him. And how could he deal with it? I'd like the 
audience to get the feeling he was breaking under the strain of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-hour, two-part film, which co-stars Barbara Hershey as Abraham's 
wife, Sarah, is part of a massive project by two European television companies 
to film the entire Old Testament and create a video Bible for the modern age. 
Plans call for a series of 22 films, shot over a period of years, at a cost in 
excess of $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Kirch, owner of the giant German media conglomerate, KirchGroup, first 
hired biblical scholars 16 years ago to find ways to give a dramatic, but 
accurate, film rendering of the Old Testament. In 1990, Kirch joined forces 
with Ettore Bernabei, owner of the Italian production company, Lux, who had 
been formulating similar plans for a video Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT bought the North American rights to "Abraham" just before filming began, 
along with an option for the rest of the series. Since then, TNT has committed 
to the next two installments, "Jacob" and "Joseph," which will begin production 
soon in Morocco for airing next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the months of preparation and production, portraying the man who is 
regarded as the father of two of the world's great religions, Harris has given 
serious thought to the story of Abraham and the events that follow in the Old 
Testament. Asked if he believes they are true, he responds with his own story 
about walking along the beach one early morning with a close friend in Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks of the mist, the smell of seaweed on the sand, the sound of 
seagulls, the receding tide and how, after more than an hour of walking in 
silence he turned to his friend and said, "Whether there is a God or not, he 
certainly was a great idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris returns to the question at hand. "Do I think the Old Testament is true? 
I don't care. But it was a great idea. And it's an idea that with patience, and 
with faith, we should embrace." 
</P>
<P>
 "Abraham," Part I, airs Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m.; Part II airs Monday at 5, 7 
and 9 p.m. on TNT.

RETRO; THE KING OF COMEDY; DISNEY DOCUMENTARY ON HAL ROACH STUDIES HIS TIMELESS 
APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Hal Roach: Hollywood's King of Laughter," a new documentary premiering 
Thursday on the Disney Channel, is a valentine to the legendary film producer 
and director who died two years ago at 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the tribute are numerous clips from his classic Harold Lloyd, 
Laurel and Hardy, "Our Gang" and Charlie Chase comedy series, scenes from his 
features "Of Mice and Men," "Topper" and "One Million B.C.," and moments from 
his TV series "Blondie" and "My Little Margie." Steve Allen, Mel Brooks, Dom 
DeLuise, John Hughes, Robert Klein, Rich Little and Gail Storm talk about 
Roach's influence with great enthusiasm in the documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important that different generations have a sense of our 
history," says producer Jeff Weinstock. "I think comedy is an important area." 
</P>
<P>
 Back during its heyday in the 20s and 30s, Roach's Hollywood studio was aptly 
nicknamed the "Laugh Factory." And even 70 years after his films were made, 
audiences still roar with laughter at the slapstick shenanigans of Lloyd, 
Laurel and Hardy and the Little Rascals. 
</P>
<P>
 Roach first tried his luck in Hollywood as an actor. After being stuck in bit 
roles, he stepped behind the camera and began making two-reel comedies. Roach 
hit pay dirt when he teamed up with bespectacled funnyman Harold Lloyd in 1916. 
Together they made such classic films as "Safety Last." In the late '20s, he 
introduced two of his most popular movie series: Laurel and Hardy and the "Our 
Gang" comedies starring the Little Rascals. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Roach was so successful, Weinstock says, is that he created 
a great working environment at his studio. "It was a place where people enjoyed 
working. Some of the the families who worked at the Roach studio lived on the 
lot. I think Hal Roach's parents lived on the lot. It was the kind of 
atmosphere where comedy had a place to grow. It was a place where many people 
wanted to work. A lot of great comedy came out of the Laurel and Hardy films. 
If you take them as a body of work, they were tremendously important and 
significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstock acknowledges that Roach's films are frequently given short-shrift 
because the majority were 20-minute shorts. "They were not the main 
attraction," Weinstock says. "The 'Our Gang' shorts, for instance, were 
tremendously successful. Historically, they were interesting because they 
showed us a lot about the time. But in terms of that kind of genre of comedy, 
no one has captured that certain thing about youth as successfully." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstock decided to concentrate on Roach's professional, rather than 
personal, life. Still, he says, Roach was an extremely charismatic man. "He was 
very kind of bold and daring. I spoke with him a year before he died and he was 
out hunting. He was like 99. He was out hunting with his dogs. He was one of 
these guys who didn't stop. He was always out there pushing and always moving. 
There was nothing he couldn't do." 
</P>
<P>
 And Roach has had a profound impact on such comedic directors as Mel Brooks 
and John Hughes. "John Hughes was so influenced by him, he said that when he 
was doing 'Dennis the Menace,' he made the kid in the film go out and watch 
Laurel and Hardy movies every day because he thought (comedy) had never been 
done better. It is interesting to me because it says something that is done 
well is timeless." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hal Roach: Hollywood's King of Laughter" premieres Thursday at 9 p.m on the 
Disney Channel; it repeats April 14 at midnight and April 26 at 10:30 p.m.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: MR. FRENCHY, MEET OKRA WINFREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's almost certain that Fred Eric, throughout his childhood -- despite 
probable scolding from unimaginative adults who didn't see the beauty in, say, 
a gravy-topped volcano made from mashed potatoes -- played with his food. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't really stopped. At each Los Angeles restaurant in which he's cooked 
-- Flaming Colossus, Olive, the Lipp and now the brand-new Vida -- his food has 
been rolled and twisted, molded and stacked, impaled with spears of vegetables, 
served on glass bricks instead of plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he finally has a place of his own -- in the space that was most 
recently home to Mark and Stephanie Carter's Duplex restaurant -- he has a 
whole building to play with. Bamboo drips from the main dining room ceiling. 
The bar, half-spherical, is lit by an orb of light, and a few tables are set 
low to the ground for a kid's-eye view of the crowd. The staff wear modified 
Mao jackets, all in chocolate brown. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a pasta called Mr. Frenchy, basically a grilled-meat pot au feu on 
pappardelle; also something called Okra Winfrey Gumbo, a brothless, 
deconstructed version of the Creole dish, nicely spicy, with a sort of risotto 
cake made from red beans and rice. Rarely satisfied with meat, potatoes and 
vegetables served in the ordinary way, Eric offers a kind of layer-cake 
concoction made from the elements of an old-fashioned steak dinner: a base of 
Yorkshire pudding frosted with mashed potatoes, then creamed corn and finally 
the steak, with a buttercream-like smear of horseradish. Believe it or not, 
it's a good steak.  
</P>
<P>
 The most amazing-looking dish, though, is the Beef Babcock, a tin-can-size 
cylinder constructed of bright yellow polenta studded with tomatoes, onions and 
chunks of braised beef, with a pool of stew juices that flow down the sides at 
the touch of a fork like, well, lava from a volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vida, 1930 Hillhurst Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 660-4446. Pasta and entrees 
$11-$17.

RESTAURANT NEWS: STEVEN SPIELBERG'S DIVE! ABOUT TO SURFACE 
</P>

 All you can see is the conning tower poking above the tarp, but a spokeswoman 
for Dive! says that Steven Spielberg's submarine-shaped restaurant will open 
next month. Located across from the AMC multiplex in the Century City Shopping 
Center, the 300-seat restaurant will be run by the Chicago-based Levy 
Restaurants, a food concession specialist that has serviced everything from 
Disney World to Sears Tower to Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive chef Michael Northern (he's noted for bringing the first chicken 
dishes to Hollywood Park) designed Dive!'s menu. "It's a reinvention of the 
classic submarine sandwich," says the spokeswoman. Customers can also pick up 
Dive! fashion separates, which include T-shirts, caps and boxer shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported by Calendar, Spielberg has been fascinated with 
underwater adventures ever since he read "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" as a 
child. Although "seaQuest DSV" -- his TV series launched last year on NBC -- is 
currently tied for No. 74 in the Nielsen ratings, it's not stopping him from 
investing in future submarine-themed restaurants. More Dive!'s will open in Las 
Vegas and other undisclosed locations. 
</P>

<P>
 SEEING WHITE: Ever since Cafe Blanc was busted by the Los Angeles Department 
of Health Services two years ago for operating without a public health permit, 
fans kept asking whether the tiny Franco-Japanese restaurant would reopen. 
They'll be happy to hear that chef/owner Tommy Harase has opened Nouveau Cafe 
Blanc, this time with an indoor kitchen. Located on Little Santa Monica 
Boulevard near Wilshire in Beverly Hills, the new restaurant -- which seats 32 
-- opens for dinner Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 GRILL CHEF: The crab cakes weren't the only thing Morton's left behind when it 
moved across the street. To the surprise of some customers, owner Peter Morton 
brought in Brian Keller to oversee the new kitchen. But fans of former chef 
Michael Shaheen can rest easy: He can now be found cooking just across the 
border at the Grill in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hired (Shaheen) to become our chef," says Grill owner Bob Spivak, "but 
there will be absolutely no changes to our menu. Morton's menu wasn't that 
different anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A REWORK OF ART: Art Ginsburg says he's not planning to move his restaurant to 
Pasadena. Rumors had the owner of the 37-year-old Art's Deli in Studio City -- 
destroyed by fire after the quake -- looking at the space recently vacated by 
Tra Fiori. But, Ginsburg says, "There's no truth to the Pasadena rumor. We love 
Studio City and we are rebuilding at the old location." 
</P>
<P>
 The deli owner says construction begins in three weeks; if everything goes 
according to schedule, the project will take three to four months to complete. 
"We have to change a few things that were grandfathered in to bring them up to 
code," says Ginsburg, "but we will be back with the same food, the same 
employees . . . the same Art's."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most letters to the editor refer to published accounts in The Times, but I am 
writing about a flagrant omission. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Academy Awards, Deborah Kerr was the only star awarded a career Oscar, 
but, except for a blurb in the briefs section of Calendar in January when it 
was originally announced, The Times has ignored this long-overdue tribute to 
one of the major stars of the '40s, '50s and '60s and arguably one of the most 
respected. 
</P>
<P>
 Calendar devoted an enormous amount of space on Sunday, March 20, amounting to 
pages and pages chock-a-block full of stories, including the views of small 
community film critics, acting coaches, the White House screening room 
upholstery, and a myriad of trivial tidbits about Oscar history, but apparently 
no room for six-time nominee Deborah Kerr. There was even an article about the 
academy's love affair with British actors, but no room for Deborah. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coverage of the ceremony itself on March 22, there was nothing about 
her tentative moments upon being introduced, then coming alive, bringing a roar 
of laughter from the audience when she demonstrated her not oft-known sense of 
humor. Nothing about the strong, clear, lyrical voice that is still there which 
in a minute and half eloquently and passionately expressed her thanks. And 
nothing about the longest standing ovation of the evening. Longer than 
Newman's, longer than Hanks', and, yes, even longer than Spielberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Calendar definitely dropped the ball on this one.

 I am very curious as to the reception of the past two best actress Oscar 
winners, Emma Thompson and Holly Hunter. Why were there no standing ovations 
for these women when the men, Al Pacino and Tom Hanks, each received a rousing 
standing ovation? Why were these women neglected the same honor? 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, when Emma Thompson delivered an acceptance speech that was 
beautifully eloquent, the audience responded with polite applause. Why do these 
strong, successful women not get the same treatment as men?

 David Gritten's article "Rue, Brittanica" was written tongue in cheek, I hope. 
It would be reasonable to assume that Britain would be proud of their 
illustrious actors who are perennially nominated for the Academy Award and very 
often win. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no finer performers than Emma Thompson, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jeremy 
Irons and Kenneth Branagh. And of course, Anthony Hopkins is in a class by 
himself because he overcame personal traumas to win the Brits' respect and 
admiration. According to Gritten, the others did the unforgivable. They 
attained fame early on without struggles with drug addiction or alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 We in America also idolize the stars are who difficult and troubled. And 
scandal always enhances their bankability. We "reward" them for being colorful 
and for selling tabloids, newspapers, movie and TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tabloids are able to convince the Brits that Day-Lewis really is 
mentally unbalanced, they may acknowledge that he truly is one of the great 
actors of our time. Meanwhile, he can laugh all the way to the bank and the 
Oscars.

 Regarding screenings in the White House movie theater, you neglected to 
mention that President Eisenhower's all-time favorite movie was 1952's "Angels 
in the Outfield," written by my mother, Dorothy Kingsley, and George Wells, 
directed by Clarence Brown, and screened at the White House 11 times! 
</P>
<P>
 Now "Angels" has been remade by Disney and will be released this summer. I 
doubt if President Clinton will screen the new version more than once, but no 
doubt he could use some angelic help right now.

 What makes you think Kalle Matso and Scott White represent the 
"twentysomething culture"? I don't want to insult them or anything but I'm in 
my mid-40s and I found their perspective on the Oscars wonderfully refreshing. 
What I can't explain is how I can identify with both sides of opposing points 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
 These two guys have a balance of irreverence and conservatism that makes me 
laugh. Let's see their act more often.

 I miss the Academy Awards of yesteryear when there was an air of mystery 
before "the Big Night." Nowadays, when the newspapers and television announce 
the winners days ahead, the whole event loses its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, had hoped the media was wrong. I hoped that "The Remains of the 
Day" would win. That film is, in my opinion, perfect! Spielberg and his film 
won because the voters felt that Spielberg deserved an award after all this 
while. The film is just another Jewish Holocaust story.

 Kenneth Turan's comment that the three Asian films up for the best 
foreign-language film Oscar "look to cancel one another out" ("Oskar's Race Is 
All but Over," March 20) reflects the subconscious racism that permeates 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he say this because all Asians are supposed to look alike, hence, all 
their films? Would Turan have made the same remark if there had been three 
films from Europe in competition? Would films from Italy, France and Poland 
cancel each other out because they were all made by Caucasians? 
</P>
<P>
 As a working screenwriter who has been asked to "de-ethnicize" his scripts to 
facilitate casting, the Eurocentric take of the academy and the powers-that-be 
in this town continues to gripe me. There are fabulous films being made in 
Asia, and Asian Americans have a lot to contribute to our industry, if given 
the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" is foreign in the 
acculturation of Asians, but my advice to them is to start squeaking, and 
loudly. Maybe studio executives, casting agents and people like Turan will 
hear.

 In your March 20 interview with Robert Wise, he explains the paucity of top 
actresses in the current market: "That whole ability for a woman to carry a 
picture is gone -- because of such an emphasis over the years on these action 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Mr. Wise, there are quite a few women who are asking for 
leading roles in these action pictures -- and countless more women who are 
writing action scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, one of the men who has the power to "green-light" a project 
will have the courage to make an action film written by women for women from a 
woman's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will that place women back on the box-office lists, but it might be 
just what's needed to revitalize a genre whose market impact is waning.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: CAN MAKEUP SERVE AS THE FOUNDATION FOR A BETTER LIFE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm not saying people who use frosted eye shadow should be thrown in jail, but 
bad makeup is definitely up there on my list of antisocial behaviors. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not on par with armed robbery or homicide, of course, but if fewer women 
used Too Too Blue on their upper lids, the world would be a better place. 
</P>
<P>
 A better-looking place, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how you would actually test this theory. I guess you'd have to 
find a concentrated population of offenders -- a local high school, maybe -- 
and institute behavioral modification procedures in which girls would be forced 
to look at juxtapositions of bad makeup and Edvard Munch's "The Scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe the local women's jail, whose inmates have most certainly committed 
-- among other transgressions -- mayhem with Maybelline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So here we are, on a weekday afternoon, at Sybil Brand Institute. It's pretty 
quiet. Attorneys confer with clients in a cramped visiting room. At the other 
end of the jail, in a mint-green auditorium (disastrous color for eye shadow, 
by the way), 50 inmates sit at small chairs with attached desks. 
</P>
<P>
 In their pale blue jail duds, which seem to have been modeled on surgical 
scrubs, they look like a bunch of orderlies. They range in age and race. Some 
look hard and mean. Others, angelic.  
</P>
<P>
 Women in jail fascinate me. What did they do wrong? How did they end up here? 
</P>
<P>
 On each desk is a basic makeup kit: foundation, sponge, eye shadow, eyebrow 
pencil and mascara. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of this 90-minute session, the women will be able to keep only the 
mascara, a gift from makeup-maven-to-the-stars and infomercial queen Victoria 
Jackson, who is standing in the middle of the room, explaining why makeup is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, soft-spoken, good-natured and seemingly devoid of Hollywood attitude, 
has been teaching Sybil Brand inmates makeup techniques for a couple of years. 
She used to visit once a month, but stopped after her second child was born 10 
months ago. Last week was her first time back in a year, so all the faces were 
fresh. More or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's sister, Audrey Honig, is director of psychological services for the 
L.A. County Sheriff's Department. It was Honig who helped Jackson navigate 
official channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victoria was doing work with cancer patients," Honig said. "What she was 
doing was building confidence and self-esteem, and our inmate population 
certainly would benefit from that. It's a benefit to the organization, too -- 
the inmates are happier, more content. . . . So I put her together with our 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 During one of Jackson's first visits, the magnitude of her challenge became 
clear when she asked the women what they were trying to achieve with their 
makeup.  
</P>
<P>
 What, she wondered, were they trying to say? 
</P>
<P>
 One inmate, a hooker, raised her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes?" Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pull over." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mariana Valles is a 36-year-old mother of five children -- 18, 17, 3-year-old 
twins and an infant. She says she is a heroin addict and is serving a 90-day 
jail term for prostitution, and has two months to go on her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 She has striking, thick eyebrows, dark eyes and a full mouth. She has gone to 
town with the Victoria Jackson makeup in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true," she says. "You feel better when you look good." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, Valles says, she has become proficient at laying tile and 
thinks she may be able to earn $9.50 an hour doing that when she gets out -- if 
she can keep clean and resist the easy money of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, she has disregarded Jackson's advice to use restraint when 
applying blush and mascara. Old habits die hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson suggests that the goal of eye shadow is not to see how many colors can 
be crammed between the brows and lashes -- one or two will do. Three shades and 
you're out.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, she adds, "this thing with razors" some of the women do to their 
eyebrows is not especially tasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jackson tells the women to use foundation to "erase the mistakes you've 
made on your face," I can only wonder whether learning to apply makeup can help 
them erase the mistakes they've made with their lives, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I ask Jackson if she has any illusions that good makeup can change the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," she replies a little wearily, "if you can get some of the women to 
stop shaving their eyebrows, it's worth it. It certainly gives a different 
message when they go out for a job interview." 
</P>
<P>
 It's tempting to dismiss Jackson's visit as a nice way to pass an afternoon if 
you happen to be in jail. But the fundamental lesson she imparts is right on 
the money: How you look has a lot to do with how you're treated.  
</P>
<P>
 And if you look like you value yourself, maybe someone else will value you, 
too.

THE BUZZ: DRESSED FOR SUCCESS

<TEXT>

 Performance artist-actor Kent Fuher has an interesting observation on the 
state of drag. Fuher is better known to Angelenos as the vibrant-lipped beat 
poet Jackie Beat, whose "Fifteen Minutes" show at Luna Park has drawn raves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the success (of drag) is that people expect so little from a drag 
queen," he said. "You get up there and you have written material and people 
say, 'These jokes would work even if he wasn't dressed like a woman!' You know 
you have them in the palm of your hand." Fuher also plays a woman in the new 
low-budg film "Grief," directed by former club owner Richard Glatzer (the film 
opened Friday at Laemmle Sunset-5). The two met when Fuher started performing 
at Glatzer's club Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the transition from live performance to film "wasn't rough at all," 
Fuher said. "It was completely different in that I had a makeup and a hair 
person. It was a dream come true, especially since I'm used to getting ready in 
the kitchens of some places." How to Get a Head: The Hollywood greeting of 
choice these days is no longer the rib-crushing bear hug (although we did see 
several examples of hugging -- and kissing -- at the Academy Awards, but then, 
everyone was quite giddy). 
</P>
<P>
 The preferred way to bond is by direct contact with someone's head. At a 
recent screening, we noticed several industry-types who greeted each other with 
a tap or rub of the head, or a mussing of the hair. We see this as a more 
intime gesture than a hug; after all, you have to be pretty familiar with 
someone to touch his head. 
</P>
<P>
 We're all for it -- as long we're not approached on a good hair day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And from the electronic frontier, according to postings on the Beavis and 
Butt-head Internet news group, the correct rendering of the duo's positive 
exclamation is kewl.

UP ALL NIGHT: A HINT OF MOTHER RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decor in the cavernous dining room is stately glitz -- gold lame curtains, 
imposing chandeliers, pink table cloths, red carpet, mirrors and U.S. flags. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling balalaika players wend their way among the banquet tables, where 
more than 300 revelers -- mostly prosperous, middle-aged immigrants in sequined 
dresses and double-breasted pin-striped suits -- gather to make melancholy 
merriment on a free-world Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow Nights bills itself as "L.A.'s Only Russian Restaurant and Cabaret." 
Despite social and political upheavals in the former Soviet Union, the mood is 
decidedly pre- glasnost . 
</P>
<P>
 Forget Boris Yeltsin. The stand-up comedians here are still lampooning 
Brezhnev, who appears briefly as a rubber-masked villain playing a violin with 
a broomstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Arkady Kivman emigrated in the late '70s. He opened Moscow Nights 10 
years ago and moved to the current location in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become popular with lots of different immigrant groups," Kivman says. 
"Not just Eastern Europeans, but Persians and Israelis, too. People who like a 
certain kind of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 The floor show, described in the club's brochure as "a Gypsy-Russian-Yiddish 
extravaganza," is a cross between "Nutcracker" and reruns of the old "Carol 
Burnett" show -- at least to the casual observer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it took Italians a while to perfect the Western, perhaps it will take 
Russians just as long to serve up the quintessence of the 
musical-comedy-variety genre. Devotees of the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" will 
find a lot to like here, as will their sweet old grannies who haven't seen a 
good show since Liberace died and Lawrence Welk went off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The show may be gaudy, but it's not, strictly speaking, high camp. It's too 
real. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the performers are well known to the club's habitues and are greeted 
with whistles and applause, and often deservedly so. One violinist did a fair 
interpretation of Jimi Hendrix, fiddling behind his back, over his head and, 
for the grand finale, holding the bow between his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The food, like everything else here, is lavish and deadly serious -- Cold War 
Continental cuisine favoring caviar, rack of lamb and the like. The feast is 
served by a staff that is both gracious and somewhat furtive. Every employee 
asked to comment quoted a variation on the restaurant's brochure, saying 
something like: "Moscow Nights is the greatest Russian night club in L.A." A 
waiter, when asked to say a word or two about his background, went away and 
never came back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to celebrate my birthday," says Armand Kay, a Swiss Elvis 
impersonator who lives in Granada Hills. Kay was seated at the head of a table 
of 10 well-wishers. "This is a great place for a big party, friends, family, 
all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 It would indeed be hard to think of a better place to throw a surprise party, 
bachelorette bash or friendly roast. Or, if you just want to soak up a little 
atmosphere -- and a little vodka -- the velvet stools at the bar have an 
excellent view of the stage. With more than 130 varieties of imported vodka on 
hand, it's worth a pilgrimage.  
</P>
<P>
 And who knows -- after a few shots of Terminator, Denaka or the murky, peppery 
elixir known as pertsovka , you might even see Elvis.

REMEMBER TO EXERCISE YOUR SENSE OF BALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *As a personal trainer for more than 13 years, I have seen the type of burnout 
described in Jeannine Stein's article, "From Fitness Fan to Sure Sloth" (March 
1) many times. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what I call the "pendulum syndrome," or the classic case of a person who 
overtrains, stressing the body mentally and physically to the point where the 
person stops exercising completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnout occurs when people are not at peace with themselves, placing too great 
an emphasis on their external appearance. Their lives become unbalanced and 
exercise is taken to an extreme in an effort to reach physical perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 This follows the typical American philosophy that if a little of something is 
good, then twice as much must be better. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise is a tool to make people feel better, reduce stress and retard the 
aging process. When someone feels good about who they are, exercise will fall 
naturally into its proper place in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this type of moderate approach is unpopular with many trainers, 
who are also guilty of taking their bodies to physical extremes and 
perpetuating this unhealthy trend of overtraining.

ABUSE TAKES MANY FORMS -- EVEN SARCASM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Dr. Laura's Life Lessons" (March 13): Laura Schlessinger is bright and 
funny, and one can benefit from much of what she has to say. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one trait I think she should lose: her apparent delight in sharpening 
her sarcasm skills on her callers.  
</P>
<P>
 A case in point: A young woman called and told her that she had lived with and 
married an abusive man and had a child with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Laura's initial response was, "You knew the guy was abusive, yet you 
married him and made a baby with him? Good choice, real good choice." 
</P>
<P>
 After this, the caller was possibly more troubled than before.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Laura appears to be a compassionate, well-intentioned professional. These 
callers are in pain and in need of assistance, not put-downs. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Laura Schlessinger seems to have a lot of the qualities many good therapists 
have. For example, her Popeye-like "I am what I am" courage makes her a good 
role model for anyone who has a hard time being assertive. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, she seems to care more about using those who call her at KFI as 
unpaid straight men for her show than in trying to make sure they get the help 
they need. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take a lot of time or extraordinary perceptiveness to identify the 
things people do that get them in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the most inept or self-defeating things people do usually 
represent attempts to solve important problems, and even the smartest solutions 
often have unforeseen or unavoidable consequences. That's why a responsible, 
dedicated therapist will take the time to learn as much as possible about a 
person before offering advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Schlessinger may be preaching the right sermon, but in the wrong 
church. Whatever relevance her ideas may have for people who behave "stupidly," 
my hunch is that it is these people who allow themselves to be used by 
shoot-from-the-hip, love-'em-and-leave-'em media personalities. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Your piece on Laura Schlessinger, whom I appreciate and admire on many scores, 
helped me put my finger on what was giving me a sense of inconsistency about 
her message.  
</P>
<P>
 Schlessinger urges women to take control of their destinies, which is 
excellent advice. She then insists that, in order to be decent parents, they 
abandon their careers to stay home full-time with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 These two points comprise a double message. As much as there is to be said in 
its favor, quitting work to stay home with children is arguably the single most 
disempowering decision women make. 
</P>
<P>
 If Schlessinger wanted to advocate for women and children simultaneously, she 
would use her considerable influence to lobby for a workplace in which both 
parents can work part-time.

WESTSIDE WATCH: IN THIS RACE, SHE'S NOT JUST A FACE IN THE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly all 15 people seeking seats on the county Democratic Central Committee 
in the 41st Assembly District are household names -- in their own households. 
</P>
<P>
 But one candidate seeking one of the seven seats in the Westside and San 
Fernando Valley district is familiar to just about anyone who has watched 
television since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Hack, an actress best known for replacing Farrah Fawcett-Majors on the 
action series "Charlie's Angels," is running for the non-paying board, which 
makes endorsements in nonpartisan races, conducts fund-raising, recruits 
candidates and handles other party functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Pomerance, an Encino resident who practices law in Century City and is 
one of the other candidates in the race, said he believes that Hack's fame from 
acting "will definitely help her" chances in the election to be decided in the 
June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (her candidacy is) a good thing for the Democratic Party," Pomerance 
said. "She'd be a great asset to the county committee. I think she wants to do 
the right things. She wants to get involved and feels like she can make a 
difference. It's great that someone like that wants to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Hack, who declined to be interviewed last week because of illness, recently 
appeared in the pilot of NBC's "seaQuest DSV" and an episode of "L.A. Law."

 ITCHING TO GET OUT: As the storm season draws to a close, we give you one more 
tale from the muddy trenches of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 First, a little background. The November wildfires apparently burned off all 
the poison ivy and poison oak, releasing the misery-inducing oils into the 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the mud came down from the hillsides after the recent storms, 
residents like Kent Knudsen did the natural thing: They got in the slop to dig 
out. In the muck were the oils. In pain was Knudsen, who along with some of his 
fellow Malibuites, came down with a nasty rash that his doctor believes came 
from the poison ivy and oak oils in the mud. (Knudsen got secondary infections 
from the septic flow that came down with the gook). 
</P>
<P>
 So is it any wonder that he is now looking for some mystical relief? 
</P>
<P>
 "I ordered a gargoyle from one of my wife's mail-order catalogues," said 
Knudsen. "It was made by a nun and it is a very famous gargoyle. I am putting 
it on top of my house to keep evil spirits away."

 A MATTER OF DEGREE: Beverly Hills City Council candidate Les Bronte has come 
up with an explanation for the confusion over his academic record. At a recent 
candidates' forum, Bronte was accused of fibbing about his education on his 
official ballot statement, which is mailed by the city clerk's office to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte stated on the form that he went to UCLA and has a bachelor of arts 
degree in industrial management. Bronte now acknowledges that he dropped out of 
UCLA after two years and completed his degree at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronte says he did not intend to deceive anyone. His staff said his campaign 
workers simply left off the reference to Cal State L.A. when they were typing 
up the document. Furthermore, he maintained, the city clerk's office compounded 
the error when the ballot statement was printed by putting UCLA and his degree 
on the same line, according to a press release from his campaign office.

ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE THIN BLUE LINE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert K. Tanenbaum, a former New York prosecutor who touts himself as one of 
Beverly Hills' staunchest law-and-order council members, has come to an ironic 
parting of ways with most of his competitors in the City Council race. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the only one of eight candidates in the April 12 election who has not 
enthusiastically proposed hiring more police officers to stem the city's rising 
crime, most of it robberies and thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum, who is seeking a third four-year term, instead suggests that the 
department could be more efficient in its deployment of officers -- perhaps 
even putting lieutenants and captains on the streets instead of behind desks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remark that angered the police union, which has broken from its tradition 
of endorsing the incumbent, he urged that the city "not add more police desk 
jockeys in suits." 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over crime has dominated the race for two seats. According to police 
statistics, crime last year increased 15.4% over 1992. The city recorded 2,825 
crimes in 1993, an increase of 377 over the previous year, according to the 
report by Chief Marvin D. Iannone. Thefts of valuables from vehicles, the 
largest crime category, posted the biggest jump, rising from 574 to 849 
incidents, while residential burglaries declined. Robberies rose from 212 to 
281. Violent crime remains low, with one homicide last year and few rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The force this year dropped to 128 officers from its authorized quota of 132 
because of recent retirements and a hiring freeze that was only recently 
lifted, Lt. Joe Lombardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of officers, however, is considered by experts to be above average 
for a city of Beverly Hills' size and population (31,971 residents in 5.5 
square miles), Lombardi said. The city has four officers per 1,000 residents, 
according to city statistics. In neighboring Santa Monica, the ratio is about 
2.25 officers per 1,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We constantly have been told (by consultants) that we have as many police as 
we need," Tanenbaum said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is . . . we need to make sure we're maximizing the number of 
police on the street," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum and his competitors, however, question how many officers are on 
patrol. Of the 128 sworn officers, Lombardi said, 81 are assigned to street 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanenbaum said the city has commissioned a study to evaluate police 
deployment, including whether the city has too many ranking officers off street 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Tanenbaum's remarks about police deployment have drawn criticism from 
the Beverly Hills Police Officers Assn. as well as candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union, in a letter to residents, said it is supporting candidates 
MeraLee Goldman and Les Bronte, who favor beefing up the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Alan Robert Block, an attorney; Mary Levin Cutler, an investor; 
Bernie Hecht, a retired business executive; Trisha Roth, a pediatrician; and 
Herm Shultz, a retired business executive, all support increasing the force to 
varying degrees. The average annual cost for a new police officer is $75,000, 
which includes salary and benefits (the city generally hires only experienced 
officers). 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, a planner, said she would like to see 10 more officers added to the 
force to beef up residential patrols. She contends a volunteer panel of 
financial experts from the community could find the money for the officers in 
the city's $74-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Block says he thinks the council should reconsider its practice of contracting 
for legal services, which cost the city $1.4 million last year, to free up 
money for more officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has to have detectives following up on crimes. Everybody can't be on 
the street patrolling," he said. "We need more than just a better allocation of 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, who is president of a renters coalition group, said Tanenbaum's idea 
of deploying lieutenants and captains won't work. "It's like asking Bill 
Clinton to get out on the street and asking all of his staff to do the same," 
Shultz said. "Somebody has to mind the store." 
</P>
<P>
 He and Bronte, a business executive and former Chamber of Commerce president, 
urged the city to encourage new business to locate in Beverly Hills as a way of 
bringing in more tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, who is endorsed by the Municipal League of Beverly Hills along with 
Tanenbaum, contends the city should use the projected $1.2 million in annual 
revenue from a recently passed increase in the hotel bed tax to hire more 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht said he'd like more civilian volunteers trained to handle clerical 
duties in the Police Department, and changes made in budget priorities to pay 
for more police. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth said the city can always use more police, but residents need to take a 
more proactive approach in protecting themselves and their homes such as by 
forming Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a victim of our publicity," Roth said. "We advertise our city as 
elegant, luxurious and wealthy. It's like asking a bank robber, 'Why do you rob 
banks?' Because that's where the money is."

WEST HOLLYWOOD COUNCIL RACE OFFERS FEW FIREWORKS; ELECTIONS: THE USUAL HUBBUB 
IS ABSENT FROM THIS YEAR'S CONTEST AS 11 CANDIDATES VIE FOR THREE SEATS. MOST 
OF THE HOPEFULS TARGET CRIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a wide-open race for the West Hollywood City Council. Toss in enough 
candidates to field a football team. Aim the spotlight on crime issues and what 
do you get? 
</P>
<P>
 A campaign so stunningly drab, it's hard to tell everyone apart. 
</P>
<P>
 With three of the council's five seats up for grabs, most people expected a 
bruising, high-stakes affair. All of the candidates are men. And all but one of 
the 11 hopefuls is gay, providing the chance for the council's first gay 
majority since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, the race is remarkable for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the dullest City Council race we'll ever have, unless something 
happens (by Election Day)," said Councilman Paul Koretz, who is not up for 
reelection this year but is seeking a state Assembly seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected calm probably will help the two incumbents, John Heilman and 
Sal Guarriello, since voters may already know their names before the April 12 
vote. Councilwoman Babette Lang decided not to seek another four-year term, 
ensuring the council will gain at least one new member. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates say a shortage of cash to pay for mailers has dampened the race in 
a town where elections often get down and dirty. Causes dear to many voters -- 
such as rent control and gay rights -- face no local challenge; battles over 
those issues are being waged at the state and federal levels. Recession has 
smothered debate about development, and the controversial idea of forming a 
city police department is expected to go directly to voters this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacuum has been filled somewhat by an urgent focus on crime, a first for 
the 10-year-old city. Though figures show no marked increase in crime in West 
Hollywood, most of the candidates have jumped on the anti-crime bandwagon, 
calling for more policing while offering few details on how to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime issue is a kind of Rorschach test in West Hollywood, with vastly 
different audiences at work. Crime means street hustlers and drug-dealing to 
residents of the depressed East End, burglaries and car thefts to homeowners 
across town and bigoted attacks on gays and lesbians all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Timothy P. Olson, a leader of an unsuccessful 1992 ballot 
initiative to create a city police force, has hammered the crime theme hardest. 
Citing FBI figures, he asserts that on a per capita basis, West Hollywood is 
one of the five most dangerous cities in California. Per capita crime 
statistics, however, are criticized as misleading in small tourist meccas such 
as West Hollywood because they do not account for the large number of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the campaign's first direct attacks, a group supporting Olson mailed 
a campaign flyer last week charging that the Heilman-led council majority had 
made big cuts in the portion of the city's budget slated for public safety. 
City officials dispute that, saying the dip is far less than Olson claims and 
resulted from the city's decision two years ago to reassign parking enforcement 
to a private company. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Martin, a gay-rights activist who sits on the city's rent board, has 
proposed spending up to $1 million more to boost patrols by the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department, which now provides law enforcement to the city 
under an $8.5 million-a-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign forums have produced a chorus of similar-sounding calls for more foot 
and bicycle patrols and for a new substation on the East End. The field is 
about evenly split on whether to create an independent police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rhetoric, FBI statistics for West Hollywood indicate a 6% drop in 
serious crime -- from 4,532 cases to 4,254 -- since 1986, the first year for 
which city figures are available. Totals for the most violent crimes fluctuated 
the past three years: 4,083 in 1990; 4,712 in 1991; and 4,264 in 1992. Six 
people were murdered in 1992, the last year homicide statistics were available. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood mirrors an ironic national trend -- sinking crime figures 
accompanied by growing panic that streets are unsafe. That perception may be 
made worse in West Hollywood by street prostitution that occurs nightly in 
public view. 
</P>
<P>
 "People really are more afraid," said City Manager Paul Brotzman. "Is it 
reflective of the circumstances on the street? No. But people really feel it." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime may resonate, but it hasn't sparked a debate that would help overwhelmed 
West Hollywood voters weed through all the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a voter, I'd be confused," said Koretz, who is undecided. "In fact, 
I am a voter and I am confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Heilman -- the council's only gay member and its only member to have served 
since cityhood -- has emphasized the city's trailblazing record in social 
services. His campaign is closest to a referendum on City Hall itself. A law 
professor, Heilman is also a walking directory of city programs and policies, 
ticking them off at debates (he was the only candidate who knew the city has a 
law against car alarms that disturb residents). Though targeted by a failed 
recall attempt in 1991, few hard shots have come Heilman's way this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, Heilman is endorsed by the Coalition for Economic Survival, a 
renter's rights group whose support has been tantamount to winning office in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Guarriello, the campaign's only heterosexual, is trying to capitalize on being 
the only senior in the field -- he's 74 -- and on his maverick role on the 
council. His gruff outsider's approach to city government often leaves him at 
odds with the Heilman-led council majority, though Guarriello managed to crack 
it last year in blocking a utility tax and special business levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Four challengers are trying to reap votes from their past involvement in local 
politics -- from inside and outside City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Jeff Richmond, who heads the city's planning commission, is Heilman's 
running mate and the only challenger to get the Coalition for Economic Survival 
endorsement. He has run almost as an incumbent, endorsing and defending the 
city's liberal programs, and is the only candidate from the East End, where 
many residents have felt ignored by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin represented the city's political Establishment as a leading opponent of 
police initiative, but he has clashed with the council majority in the past by 
opposing a business tax and the proposed construction of a civic center in West 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, Olson and activist Michael W. Radcliffe sound parallel themes -- 
crime, City Hall spending and the need for a friendlier business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, a fund-raiser for Aid for AIDS, a local AIDS assistance group, got his 
start in city politics pushing the police department measure, though he has 
played down the idea during debates and instead emphasized the immediate need 
for more sheriff deputies. Still, he is banking on the votes of those who 
favored the police measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Radcliffe, the sole Republican in the race, is the candidate City Hall most 
hopes will lose. He has spent years criticizing and infuriating city 
administrators and council members on business issues as head of the West 
Hollywood Community Alliance, a rival to the city's Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Of four political newcomers, Christopher Patrouch, a shopkeeper and former 
city transportation planner, boasts the quirkiest platform: Get rid of cars. 
Patrouch, who rode a bicycle cross-country when he moved here from New York in 
1990, has proposed taxing valet parking and suggested the city consider a 
rush-hour fee on lone drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton Cutler, a transportation consultant, wants the city to take over the 
local library, a county facility open only three days a week because of funding 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Kovatch, an insurance sales supervisor who said he wants a career in 
politics, has underlined the need for more business. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher S. Dietrich, a writer and legal clerk, supports strong animal 
protections and proposes a city film festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven S. Chapman is on the ballot, but suspended his campaign.

BRIEFLY; ARTS: PHOTOS BY SURREALIST MAN RAY DISPLAYED AT COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An exhibit of photographs by the surrealist Man Ray will be on display through 
April 23 at the Santa Monica College Photography Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Great writers and Paris society were among the subjects Man Ray photographed 
during the 1920s and '30s.Man Ray, who died in 1976, was also known as one of 
the most important artists of the Dada and surrealist movements. He recorded 
the lives of the rich and famous, including Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, 
Salvador Dali and Aldous Huxley. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Browner, a Culver City resident and brother of the late Juliet Man Ray, 
Man Ray's wife, has been the curator of Man Ray photographic exhibits across 
the country since 1990. He set up the Santa Monica exhibit, which opened two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Juliet) said she would like Americans to know Man Ray as an American artist, 
a creator of ideas," said Browner, 72. Although Man Ray was celebrated in 
Europe, his work is not quite as well-known in his native country. The best way 
to carry out her wish, said Browner, "was to put on these shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallery hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
Friday, and 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. The gallery is closed April 9 through 
17. Information: (310) 450-5150, Ext. 9550.

PEOPLE: BOOKSTORE IS A 'BRIDGE' FOR CULTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting on a dark green milk crate in front of his bookshop on a bright 
afternoon, C. Edward Moondance is doing what he loves best: talking about the 
beauty of the written word. 
</P>
<P>
 As Moondance and a customer discuss Toni Morrison's recently published Nobel 
Prize lecture, he cradles the 20-page hardcover book as if it were a long-lost 
treasure. On his lap rests a light gray cellular phone, anchoring him to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he glides into a monologue on one of his heroes -- mythology scholar 
Joseph Campbell -- and points a visitor to the shelf in the Santa Monica 
bookstore where the Campbell selections are kept. "First editions," Moondance 
announces. 
</P>
<P>
 Moondance, 43, has run Moondance Bookshop in a converted little house at 1512 
16th St. since 1988. He is proud of the bookshop's eclectic titles and his 
9-year-old daughter, who "read 200 books last summer." And he is thankful for 
his longevity in the book business. 
</P>
<P>
 Located next door to a health food store, the bookshop is a cramped repository 
for 10,000 books. Moondance says he knows where every title is. "You just name 
the book and I can find it," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 New and used books are stacked in boxes here and there and on cluttered 
shelves. Out front, about 15 copies of Kazuo Ishiguro's "The Remains of the 
Day" are stacked in his $5 sale bin. "I try to keep my thumb on the pulse," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moondance has a frenetic, intense energy that is easily ignited. He laughs a 
lot, yet his tone turns serious when he talks about why he is here. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, he chose to live in Santa Monica -- it reminds him of hometown of 
Memphis -- with his wife, Sarabanda, and daughter, Hana, and run a bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a bookshop in Santa Monica, he says, has a twofold importance: He sees 
himself as an example of successful African Americans. At the same time, he 
promotes cultural exchange through his store's diverse selection. 
</P>
<P>
 The bookshop, he said, is "an oasis for multiculturalism, a bridge for other 
cultures to use to gain access to each other's literature." 
</P>
<P>
 "A beachhead has been set for another generation," he said. "A viable African 
American presence has been established." 
</P>
<P>
 Autobiographies such as Dizzy Gillespie's "To Be or Not to Bop" and David 
Hockney art books are shelved a few feet from editions of Russian composer 
Sergei Prokofiev's biography. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child in Memphis, however, Moondance wasn't fortunate enough to have such 
a vast selection at his fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bookmobile served African Americans once a week," he said. Because of 
discrimination laws, African Americans were allowed to use Memphis' public 
libraries only once a week. The bookmobile stayed for only four hours, 
Moondance said, but "I got to know where the good books were. You learn to get 
real quick, or else you lose." 
</P>
<P>
 A descendant of Cherokees and West Africans, Moondance spent a few years in 
college, and then hit the road, holding a number of odd jobs, including wine 
steward and gas company inspector. "I'm a jack of all trades, a master of one," 
he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 When he opened his store, Moondance encountered some skeptics -- what he 
refers to as his "horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
 "A European American woman came in and asked, 'What are your credentials to 
own a bookstore?' " he recalled. "I told her to look around the store." 
</P>
<P>
 The customer later complimented him on his "wonderful selection." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not by accident. These books were all handpicked," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Moondance doesn't see the other 15 bookshops in Santa Monica as competition. 
Mega-chains like Bookstar and Crown, he said, are "supermarkets." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a neighborhood bookstore," he said. "I remember regular customers by 
their names, and the books they buy." 
</P>
<P>
 It is more than a bookstore, said longtime customer Althea Miller. 
"Interesting people stop in and talk," said Miller, a View Park resident. "You 
could make an afternoon out of it."  
</P>
<P>
 Alyce McDonald has been shopping at Moondance since it opened. "I've kind of 
made it my home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, these days, is a little cramped. 
</P>
<P>
 Moondance admits, somewhat embarrassedly, that he is still trying to 
straighten things up after January's earthquake. But Moondance Bookshop is a 
one-man operation. And, he says, he has outgrown the small space. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial constraints, he says, have prevented him from moving to a bigger 
place. Business has been off because of the quake too. 
</P>
<P>
 So for now, Moondance says he will stay where he is, at his beachhead on 16th 
Street, next to the health food store.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MALIBU; MERCHANTS OPPOSE FARMERS MARKET PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A handful of Malibu merchants are fighting an effort to set up a farmers 
market in the city, asserting it would sap local businesses and cause traffic 
tie-ups and parking shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Certified Farmers' Market Assn. is working on a proposal to 
set up shop in Malibu every Friday for three hours. Among the sites being 
studied are Malibu Bluffs Park and the Civic Center area. 
</P>
<P>
 The association made a pitch to the City Council in January, but was 
instructed to work on the proposal with the city Parks and Recreation 
Department and the Chamber of Commerce. The council is scheduled to hold a 
public hearing on the issue at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the opposition is the Cosentino family, owners of a flower shop and 
two nurseries, and Mike Osterman, owner of Pacific Coast Greens, an organic 
grocery store. Malibu merchants, they argue, have already suffered in the wake 
of fire and floods in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a Malibu farmers market or a little-house-on-the-prairie, quiet 
kind of thing," said Marco Cosentino, one of five children of Joseph and Jo Jo 
Cosentino, who began selling produce from a cart on Pacific Coast Highway and 
Las Flores Canyon Road 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're bringing big business to Malibu with farmers who make a killing and 
leave the merchants holding an empty bag," he said. "We have 5,000 homes here. 
Can Malibu support local business and the farmers market?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Wetzel, business manager of the Ventura County farmers market 
association, argues that it can. The market, composed of 25 farmers including 
flower growers, would be open to Malibu farmers, though Wetzel acknowledges 
that the city is no agrarian bastion. Three local farmers have expressed 
interest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about one day a week for three hours, so only some people can 
take advantage of it," said Wetzel, pointing out that farmers would be charged 
a fee to use city space. "You are not going to service all residents' needs 
from one farmers market. Buying a vine-ripened tomato usually gets people 
thinking about buying good quality produce at other local businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Osterman says farmers market vendors will have unfair advantages. "When I say 
a product is organic, I have to have it certified by a national organization, 
and they don't have to do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also contends that the market, which draws up to 3,500 shoppers to its 
other locations, would attract a glut of people from outside Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic and the parking would be a nightmare," said Osterman. "All we 
have is one access road: PCH." 
</P>
<P>
 The council appears poised to give the market a trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Councilman Walt Keller: "We could let local merchants set up booths at 
the market, of course, we would have to charge them rent. I would like to try 
it for three months and see if it cuts into (local) business." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Carolyn Van Horn said business was suffering from a downturn but could 
benefit from the people the farmers market would draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Davis recently on business and they were having their farmers 
market," she said. "At first the chamber was against it, but it's been 17 years 
and now they love it." KATHLEEN KELLEHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: WESTCHESTER; LOYOLA STUDENTS MOVE AIDS BENEFIT OFF CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a group of undergraduate students in a business management class at 
Loyola Marymount University was given an assignment two months ago to organize 
a fund-raiser, they thought they had the perfect concept. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided to set up an AIDS awareness dance at the school, with proceeds 
going to a Culver City hospice that cares for HIV-positive infants and children 
with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But the project hit a snag: The students say the Catholic university banned 
the group's plans to distribute free condoms and brochures promoting safe sex, 
prompting the students to move the event off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Shubert, a 21-year-old member of the group, said university health 
officials told her the condoms and safe-sex information were prohibited because 
the Catholic Church believes they advocate premarital sex, a violation of 
church doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a Catholic institution and we subscribe to Catholic teachings on 
premarital sex," said university spokeswoman Jill Perry. "Condoms are certainly 
readily available to students off campus if they want them." 
</P>
<P>
 That position disturbs some students, Shubert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the '90s. We're at a university. It's ridiculous to pretend that sex 
isn't happening," Shubert said. "The kids here should have this information 
available to them. I feel we're not just fighting the school, but also the 
Catholic Church." 
</P>
<P>
 Shubert said the event will take place at Sharkeez, a Santa Monica nightclub, 
on April 14. But the group worries that attendance will suffer because many 
students who live on campus do not have cars, and public transportation is not 
convenient, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers plan to charge a $5 entry fee and hope to raise $1,000 for Caring 
for Babies with AIDS. The nonprofit organization cares for 14 children, ages 5 
and under. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the hospice were puzzled by the university's position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very troubling to us -- they've always been very supportive and included 
us in their on-campus unfurling of the AIDS quilt about a year and a half ago," 
said Ginny Foat, executive director of Caring for Babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Foat said many of the babies' mothers are themselves college age or younger 
and could have benefited from the type of information that will be distributed 
at the dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't bury your head in the sand on an issue like this," Foat said. 
"This epidemic is not about just gay and old people. The disease is growing in 
the heterosexual community and Catholic kids are not immune." ADRIAN MAHER

FOR SENIORS; DISHING UP LOVE, OFFERING COMFORT TO THOSE WITH AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even the prestigious Mayo Clinic Health Letter calls chicken soup an excellent 
remedy for "uncomplicated head colds and other viral respiratory infections." 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us without a medical license to lose, we know it cures everything 
from the common cold to depression. But we also know it's more than medicine: 
It's love. Linda Greene makes great chicken soup and unabashedly declares, "I 
am a Jewish mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the stereotype of being overbearing, a Jewish mother's real power 
is expressed in the kitchen, cooking for her family -- and anyone else who 
happens to fall under her spell. That's why Greene decided to express that 
power of love to people living with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago the office administrator devised Project Chicken Soup, which 
once a month gathers volunteers to cook and deliver traditional Jewish hot 
meals to people with AIDS and HIV, the virus that causes the fatal disease. 
</P>
<P>
 She formed the group when, after losing several friends to AIDS, she found the 
Jewish community's response to the disease lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a lack of responsibility, as if, 'It doesn't happen to us, it happens 
to 'them.' I called the Gay and Lesbian Synagogue and invited some HIV people 
to my house for Passover. I felt it was the right thing to do even though I was 
treated as straight, in other words, not able to understand the gay world. That 
didn't stop me from finding a place to connect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project covers the Westside, Hollywood and San Fernando Valley. Every meal 
includes chicken soup. The brochure reads: "If you're Jewish and have HIV, a 
little chicken soup couldn't hurt." (You don't have to be Jewish to get 
involved or to be served). 
</P>
<P>
 Greene creates the menu, supplies the recipes, gathers the ingredients, gets 
donations and cooks with the volunteers. "It's a way to show that we care, and 
a way for people to connect with the Jewish community, though there are no 
restrictions on financial need or religious involvement," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be in the group you just have to believe in the Jewish value of bikur 
cholim -- the Hebrew term that loosely translates to active caring. It 
literally means visiting the sick. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is precisely what volunteers Mollie Pier and Ernest and Gerda Kohn 
do. For Pier, it's very personal; her son died of AIDS four years ago. But for 
the Kohns it's about leading a useful life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kohns, both in their 80s, met in Palestine more than 50 years ago when 
they were members of the British army. Both escaped Nazi death camps by leaving 
Germany in the early '30s. They understand suffering. They also understand the 
value of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always brought chicken soup to sick friends. We should have a tanker 
filled with it in every neighborhood," Ernest Kohn says. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Gerda Kohn: "When we saw an ad for an involvement opportunity we called. 
Coincidentally, it was called Project Chicken Soup." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Kohn wishes that more people would get involved in caring for people 
with AIDS. "None of our friends do it. They would have less problems to think 
about if they were active. So, you get a little slow. Cooking for people and 
delivering food speeds you up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kohns believe that people are misinformed about AIDS and that ignorance 
creates fear. But they never feel afraid. "Some people are friendly, some are 
so sick they just stretch out their hand and take the food. AIDS is AIDS -- no 
limitation on age, financial status," Gerda Kohn says. 
</P>
<P>
 (According to the National Institute on Aging, individuals older than 50 
represent 10% of reported AIDS cases in the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Kohns may not be doctors, but they believe in the healing powers of 
chicken soup. If bringing someone chicken soup interrupts the isolation that 
all sick people feel when their illness cuts them off from the world, who's to 
say that isn't part of some remedy? 
</P>
<P>
 Pier's son, Nathaniel, was a doctor. He treated AIDS patients in his New York 
practice. "I was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family where women were treated 
like second-class citizens. I educated myself. At first I thought of 
homosexuality as a sin, but when I found out my own son was gay I learned all 
that I could. I was hurt not because he was gay but because he was afraid to 
tell me. He was afraid of rejection and he visualized me as a square -- a 
Jewish mother who could reject her son," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Pier died with loving people around him, and that impressed her. A 
volunteer all of her life, such activity took on a different role after her 
son's death. In addition to Project Chicken Soup, she lectures on homophobia at 
the USC Andrus Gerontology Center and gives talks on the positive aspects of 
aging. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one goes through life unscathed and we have a lot to learn from one 
another. The key is education," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 When Linda Greene launched Project Chicken Soup, she expected the Jewish 
community to say: "You're right, we should take care of people with AIDS." But 
now she's lowered her expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see there's an acknowledgment, a little inroad, but the subject still makes 
people uncomfortable. But when I think about one of our clients who received a 
meal during Hanukkah (Festival of Lights) and how happy he was to connect once 
again to the familiar smells and tastes, I can only feel in my heart that we 
are doing the right thing. That's why the Hebrew word for the project is 
nechama : comfort. For ourselves and for people living with AIDS." 
</P>

 Project Chicken Soup is part of the Jewish Family Service and the Los Angeles 
Jewish AIDS Services .

WALK WITH WORDSWORTH; NO, NOT WILLIAM, THE FAMOUS POET, BUT HIS LESS FAMOUS 
SISTER, DOROTHY WORDSWORTH. A WRITER IN HER OWN RIGHT, DOROTHY KEPT EVOCATIVE 
JOURNALS OF THE WALKS SHE TOOK IN ENGLAND'S BEAUTIFUL LAKE DISTRICT. TODAY'S 
TRAVELER CAN TRAVEL IN HER FOOTSTEPS. 
</P>

<P>
By L.N. FRANCO, Franco is a retired English professor who lives in Sierra 
Madre.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is no accident that the Lake District in northwest England has been called 
the most beautiful corner of the country. Located in the county of Cumbria, 
some 250 miles north of London, virtually the entire area (about 35 miles 
square) has been set aside as a national park. It is known for England's 
19th-Century "Lake School" poets, the most famous of whom is William 
Wordsworth. And it is a walker's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 On previous trips, often with students from Pasadena City College's Semester 
Abroad program, I have walked the Lake District trails with a volume of William 
Wordsworth's poetry or his descriptive "Guide to the Lakes," a sort of tourist 
guidebook of its day. But on a trip last April I discovered his sister 
Dorothy's delightful "Grasmere Journals." From now on, she will be my guide for 
walks in that scenic wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Dorothy Wordsworth and not her famous brother? Simply because she seems 
closer to, and more intimate with, her surroundings. She was unpretentious, and 
not afraid to react with passion and a deep love for the fells (barren hills), 
becks (streams), crags, tarns (small mountain lakes), meres (larger lakes), 
flowers, woods and the countless other natural features of that pastoral 
landscape. Grasmere was the tiny village by the lake where she and her brother 
lived in a simple little country house known as Dove Cottage from 1799 until 
1808. This is where William composed much of his best-known Romantic poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dove Cottage, which is furnished much as it was in their day and is open to 
visitors, Dorothy and William (and, later, his wife Mary) practiced "plain 
living and high thinking." Dorothy cooked, baked, sewed, washed and ironed. She 
had problems with her teeth and suffered from severe headaches. She also wrote 
out poetry for her brother and spent many hours reading with him. She devoted 
her life to his talent, but she had great talent as well. She never married and 
remained with her brother until his death in 1850. (Dorothy died five years 
later.) As William said, "She gave me eyes, she gave me ears." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Wordsworth's "Grasmere Journals" cover a period from 1800 to 1803, but 
they are as real to today's visitor as they were in the days they were written. 
Her journals contain poetic images that William used in some of his poetry. 
Perhaps his most popular poem, "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud," owes much of its 
descriptive beauty to Dorothy's observations. While on an outing to a nearby 
lake called Ullswater, Dorothy came upon some daffodils along the lake shore. 
She wrote in her journal: 
</P>
<P>
 " I never saw daffodils so beautiful . . . some rested their heads upon these 
stones as on a pillow for weariness & the rest tossed & reeled & danced & 
seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the 
lake, they looked so gay ever glancing ever changing. Her brother borrows her 
imagery to start one of his most famous poems: I wandered lonely as a cloud 
That floats on high o'er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A 
host, of golden daffodils ; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and 
dancing in the breeze. " 
</P>
<P>
 It's wonderful to have both versions, the one in diary form, the other in 
verse. But it is Dorothy's diary that gives the personal touch. Here is a 
woman, devoted to her brother's talents, giving him and us a microscopic view 
of nature, of the beauties of a world she deeply loved. 
</P>
<P>
 In her journals, she can be both matter of fact and poetic: " It rained very 
hard, Rydale (the lake now called Rydal Water) was extremely wild and we had a 
fine walk. " Or: " A fine morning...in the afternoon flashing light from beams 
of the sun as it was ruffled by the wind. " Or: " There was a most lovely 
combination at the head of the vale -- of the yellow autumnal hills wrapped in 
sunshine and overhung with partial mists, the green and yellow trees and the 
snow-topped mountains. It was a most heavenly morning. " 
</P>
<P>
 All of the scenes that Dorothy Wordsworth described so vividly nearly 200 
years ago can be shared today by the visitor who enjoys country walks. Views 
abound of romantic, sweeping valleys dotted with sheep, charming stone 
cottages, lakes, streams and waterfalls in a valley protected by high rolling 
hills and craggy mountains. There are more shades of green in the Lake District 
than one can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are hundreds of walks, from very easy lakeside strolls to strenuous 
rock and crag climbing. To see the daffodils in bloom, one must get to the Lake 
District by early spring; by early April they usually reach full bloom. But I 
have visited the area in all seasons, and each has its special beauty. One word 
of warning: In June, July and August, the lakes are crowded with tourists -- 
particularly the British, but relatively few Americans -- and good 
accommodations can be hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather can be unpredictable in northern England, so it's advisable to 
take some very effective rain gear, as well as a good pair of walking shoes and 
a copy of Dorothy's journal (recently reissued by Oxford University Press and 
available at many bookstores in England) on three of her favorite walks in the 
Lake District.  
</P>
<P>
 I have selected three walks from her journals which I feel best represent her. 
Since she walked virtually every day, rain or shine, as long as she was not too 
ill, I had to do some combining of her favorite pathways. Often she took these 
walks alone or in company, most often with her brother, day or night, and in 
all seasons. She wore long skirts over petticoats, tight-fitting shoes, a sun 
bonnet, and, depending upon the season and the cold, a shawl or a sturdier, 
water-repellent wrap or coat. Dorothy Wordsworth Walk No. 1 
</P>
<P>
 " From Dove Cottage, Town End Grasmere, to Rydal Mount and return. Distance: 
About 5 miles depending upon side excursions and choice of return route. 
Difficulty: Easy; some road, wide footpaths, fairly level walking. For some 
marvelous insights into the lives led by Dorothy and William, I recommend 
visiting Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum, both in Town End Grasmere , 
the day before you take this walk. " 
</P>
<P>
 Start at Dove Cottage and follow the narrow, paved road up a slight hill to 
the old Rydal-Grasmere Road. You will first come to John's Grove, named for 
William's brother, and a lovely grove of beech trees. Walk through the grove 
and follow the upper road to White Moss Tarn. Some people speculate that this 
is where William and Dorothy met the leech-gatherer, a character who shows up 
in William's poem "Resolution and Independence." 
</P>
<P>
 Continue along the road until it joins the footpath to Rydal. This section was 
one of Dorothy's favorite places to walk and to sit, and you can see why. You 
are under Nab Scar and should have a wonderful view of both Grasmere and Rydal 
Water. Dorothy writes: " Then we went to look at Rydale (Rydal Water) , walked 
a little in the fir grove (John's Wood), went again to the top of the hill and 
came home -- a mild, sweet night. " Continue along this path with Rydal Water 
down below you on your right and Nab Scar, a craggy knoll towering above you on 
your left. The path leads directly to Rydal Mount, the home the Wordsworths 
moved to in May, 1813. 
</P>
<P>
 Rydal Mount is now a Wordsworth museum, and there is a fine small bookstore 
where one can buy tickets to visit the house and the gardens. After visiting 
Rydal Mount, you can return to Town End via the same path. The views are very 
different going in this direction; I found that the lakes are constantly in 
view on the return, as is the River Rothay that connects Grasmere and Rydal 
Water. As you get closer to Dove Cottage, you will be near the spot that 
Dorothy refers to in her journal as her favorite above John's Wood, a place 
where she would "go backwards and forwards . . . all colors melting into each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer a different (though longer) route back to Town End, walk down 
the road passing Rydal Hall, formerly the home of Lady Fleming, who owned Rydal 
Mount. You then pass Rydal Chapel, a small church that Lady Fleming had built 
in 1824 and where the Wordsworths attended services. Cross the main 
Ambleside-Grasmere Road, go through the stile and cross the River Rothay over a 
footbridge. You will find yourself in a beautiful wood along a fast-moving 
river, and soon will emerge on the west side of Rydal Water on a path called 
Loughrigg Terrace. Dorothy loved this path. She writes: " I lay upon the steep 
of Loughrigg my heart dissolved in what I saw when I was not startled but 
recalled from my reverie by a noise as of a child paddling without shoes, I 
looked up and saw a lamb close to me. It approached nearer and nearer as if to 
examine me and stood a long time. I did not move. At last it ran past me and 
went bleating along the path seeming to be seeking its mother. " 
</P>
<P>
 The views from Loughrigg Terrace are some of the best in the entire Lake 
District. You see both lakes, Rydal and Grasmere, as well as Nab Scar, 
Loughrigg Fell and Nab Cottage where poet Hartley Coleridge, Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge's son, lived. There are now benches along Loughrigg Terrace where 
Dorothy once lay on the grass. Between Rydal Water and Grasmere there are 
woods, the River Rothay and a small park. There is also a footbridge now where 
Dorothy crossed on the stepping stones. She writes: " We came home over the 
stepping stones the lake was foamy with white waves. I saw a solitary butter 
flower in the wood. I found it not easy to get over the stepping stones. " It 
is still the same today. If the water is high, you too may find it not easy to 
get over the stepping stones. Cross the highway at White Moss and rejoin the 
path to Dove Cottage. Dorothy Wordsworth Walk No. 2 
</P>
<P>
 " Grasmere to Easedale Tarn via Sour Milk Gill. Difficulty: Moderate, but can 
be very messy after heavy rains, especially climbing up the path along the gill 
(narrow stream). Distance: 5 miles. " 
</P>
<P>
 From Grasmere village, walk along the Easedale Road for one-half mile. You 
will pass Goody Bridge Farm and will see a signposted footbridge for Easedale 
Tarn. Cross the bridge through a small wood to an iron gate. As you go through 
the gate you come to an open area where you will see sheep grazing, fells and, 
directly in front of you, a white mass that appears to be spilled milk 
coagulating on the side of the mountain. That is Sour Milk Gill or what Dorothy 
called "Churn Milk force" (from the the Norse word for cascade). 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy writes: " When we (Dorothy and Mary Hutchinson, who later married 
William Wordsworth) got into Easedale we saw Churn Milk force like a broad 
stream of snow. At the little footbridge we stopped to look at the company of 
rivers which came hurrying down the vale this way and that; it was a valley of 
streams and islands, with that great waterfall at the head . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 As you proceed to the falls, you will see a gray stone cottage on your left. 
This is still known as the Greens' cottage. In March of 1808, George and Sarah 
Green walked to Langdale to a farm sale, leaving six children in the cottage. 
On the way home they apparently became disoriented in a snow storm and 
perished. At William's insistence, Dorothy Wordsworth wrote a narrative of the 
events describing in detail how 11-year-old Jane Green looked after the other 
children for two days when their parents failed to return, and how a committee 
of ladies found homes for the orphaned children. The narrative is entitled "The 
Greens of Grasmere" and was first published by Oxford University Press in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 The path along the falls can be slippery and often water-logged. Small streams 
also like to adopt the footpath. There are many rocks along the way where a 
rest stop will be well rewarded by some spectacular views back toward Grasmere 
and across the fells toward Langdale. Arriving at the top you are greeted by 
the sight of the delightful, small Easedale Tarn. It is possible to walk around 
the tarn and enjoy the solitude of the fells. As you look toward Langdale Pikes 
you get the feeling that you have arrived at the top of the world. It is a 
wonderful spot for a picnic, or at least a long meditative rest. You can return 
to Grasmere by coming down the other side of the falls and following the path 
to a footbridge across Far Easedale Gill. The path passes a farm house and ends 
at a gate, which lets you pass back onto Easedale Road and return to Grasmere. 
Dorothy Wordsworth Walk No. 3 
</P>
<P>
 " Grasmere to Elterwater, to Skelwith Bridge, to Clappersgate and back to 
Grasmere. Difficulty: Moderate to difficult. Distance: 8 miles, depending upon 
optional routes; allow a full day. Pub stops along the way. " 
</P>
<P>
 Start the walk at the far end of Grasmere at the Information Center and take 
Red Bank Road as it climbs above and away from the lake. It is a narrow road 
with some car traffic and many turns, so be careful and walk to the side. The 
road takes you to Loughrigg Tarn, another small lake in a beautiful setting. 
Follow the road until it joins an even smaller road which goes down the hill to 
Elterwater. Dorothy loved Elterwater. She writes: " When William went fishing 
in Langdale I sate at the foot of the lake till my head ached with cold. The 
view exquisitely beautiful . . . The evening grew very pleasant -- we sate on 
the side of the hill looking at Elterwater. " 
</P>
<P>
 Elterwater village is at the head of the lake and has a wonderful pub/inn, The 
Britannia. On a summer evening it is possible to sit outside, surrounded by 
lovely views, and be entertained by musical programs. If you arrive at midday, 
the plowman's lunch is especially good, if filling. It requires a nap on the 
side of the hill overlooking the lake, a site favored by Dorothy. In the spring 
you will be surrounded by lambs. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue the walk along the path that follows the River Brathay through an 
open grazing area and into another wood where you will come upon Skelwith 
Force, a lovely waterfall you can walk to, sit above on a rock and have all 
other sounds drowned out by the water's roar. As you follow the path beyond the 
force, you pass through a wonderful quarry, and a gift shop-restaurant, the 
Kirkstone Gallery. It specializes in items made from a green slate indigenous 
to the area. As you leave the quarry, you will see Skelwith Bridge and the 
Skelwith Bridge Hotel, a 17th-Century inn with a fine restaurant and a pub, The 
Talbot, which also dates to the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Just beyond the hotel and a phone box is a narrow steep road that goes up to 
Mill Brow and joins Red Bank Road near Loughrigg Tarn. This is a more direct 
way to return to Grasmere than following the road to Clappersgate, which is 
narrow and busy. However, it is worth going to Clappersgate because it leads to 
a favorite route that Dorothy followed to Grasmere. When you get to 
Clappersgate, take the Rothay Bridge road that follows the River Rothay under 
Loughrigg. This is a fairly level route along the river and eventually you will 
come to another set of stepping stones favored by Dorothy, still very much as 
they were in 1800. As Dorothy writes: " Before dinner we set forward to walk 
intending to return to dinner. But as we had got as far as Rydal, William 
thought he would go on to Mr. Luff's. We (Dorothy and Mary) accompanied him 
under Loughrigg and parted near the stepping stones. It was very cold. Mary and 
I walked quick home. " 
</P>
<P>
 My Lake District visit last April was a richer, more rewarding experience 
since discovering Dorothy Wordsworth. I saw as she did "Rydale with a sullen 
face." I also experienced "the north sky chastened yet rich yellow fading into 
pale blue & streaked & scattered over with steady islands of purple melting 
away into shades of pink." I expect to return again and again with Dorothy as 
my companion, my poet in prose, to share her views of nature and life and her 
poetic imagination. GUIDEBOOK: Walks in England's Lake District 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Trains to the Lake District run six times daily from London's 
Euston Station to Windermere (changing to a local line at Oxenholme); fare is 
about $100 round trip. For information, call BritRail at (800) 677-8585. Local 
buses serve Grasmere, Ambleside and other villages of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Or purchase a rail/drive pass and explore the area by car. There are two 
superhighways, the M-40 and M-6, that lead from London to the Lake District. 
</P>
<P>
 To bypass London, British Air also offers nonstop flights from Los Angeles to 
Manchester, about 80 miles south of the Lake District; current restricted 
advance-purchase fare is about $711 round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: For a short stay in the Lake District, the Skelwith Bridge 
Hotel (near Ambleside, Cumbria LA22 9NJ, England; telephone 011-44-53-943-2115, 
fax 011-44-53-943-4254) is a comfortable 17th-Century inn with modern 
conveniences, located near all of Dorothy Wordsworth's walks. Double rooms are 
about $60 per night weekdays, $70 weekends; rates with three meals included 
start at about $80. 
</P>
<P>
 For longer stays (a week or more), Cottage Life and Heart of the Lakes (Rydal 
Holme, Rydal, Ambleside, Cumbria LA22 9LR, England; tel. 011-44-53-943-2321, 
fax 011-44-53-943-3251) are agencies that provide self-catering accommodations 
in well-located, excellently equipped cottages. Send for brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking guides: Walks in the Countryside leaflets, prepared and published by 
the Lake District National Park Information Service, Windermere, Cumbria, are 
available at local bookstores. Also recommended is the Ordnance Survey Tourist 
Map 3: Lake District.

TRAVEL INSIDER: GOT A FAVORITE DESTINATION? IT MAY HAVE A NEWSLETTER; 
PUBLICATIONS: THEY'RE MOSTLY MONTHLIES, FOR READERS INTERESTED IN SPECIFIC 
COUNTRIES, CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

the newspaper's expense, accepting no special discounts or subsidized trips.

<P>
 The travel newsletter business continues to boom, with nearly 200 such 
publications now circulating in North America. They offer facts and opinions on 
subjects from Mexico to Germany, gay travel to railroads, and can be a prime 
source of fresh information for travelers with special interests. But these 
enterprises also suffer a high mortality rate, and subscribing sometimes can 
seem a large leap of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 This column offers a sampling of newsletters with track records -- all listed 
here have published since at least 1992 -- that focus on specific geographic 
destinations. (Last week's column listed a sampling of special-interest travel 
newsletters, from the Consumer Reports Travel Letter to the International 
Railway Traveler.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most newsletters are 8 1/2-by-11 inches, and tend to use graphics and line 
drawings but not photography. Subscriptions usually run $35-$60 for six to 12 
issues a year. (Some newsletters won't accept under-writing or freebies from 
hotels, restaurants or airlines, and say so. Other publishers accept such 
offers, yet provide valuable information. Travelers should keep possible 
built-in biases in mind.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are many publications of merit that couldn't be included here. To see a 
more complete listing, readers may consult the Oxbridge Directory of 
Newsletters, available in the reference department of most large public 
libraries. (For Southern California residents, another option is to browse the 
in-house collection of newsletters at the Traveler's Bookcase bookshop at 8375 
West 3rd St., Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 * British Travel Letter (361 Post Road West, Suite 194, Westport, Conn. 06880;

</P>

or 201-535-6572). Editor Howard M. Isaacs started the newsletter in October, 
1988. Detailed reviews of restaurants and lodgings, and no shortage of strong 
opinions. In its January "Thumbs up/thumbs down" issue, the newsletter bestows 
awards for "most inept housekeeping" (Hotel Centro in Milan) and "least helpful 
tourism bureau" (Ischia). Eleven issues yearly. Typical issue: eight pages.

</P>
<P>
 * Gemutlichkeit (2892 Chronicle Ave., Hayward, Calif. 94542; tel.

(pensions in Vienna for as little as $44 nightly) possibilities. Twelve issues

issues yearly. Typical issue: eight pages. Circulation: about 1,000. One-year

 * Island Escapes (3886 State St., Santa Barbara, Calif. 93105; tel. 
800-477-3575). Founded in 1991 by the publishers of Islands magazine. While the 
magazine leans toward literary journalism about islands the world over, the 
newsletter concentrates on service information and focuses on one island per 
month. In February, it was Palau (formerly a U.S. trust territory in the 
western Pacific, now independent); in March, Galiano (a Canadian possession 
near Vancouver Island); this month, it's the Malaysian island of Tioman. Twelve 
issues yearly. Typical issue: eight pages. Circulation: about 2,500. One-year 
subscription: $39.

 In an effort to stop the resale of multi-day tickets that have already been 
used by the purchaser, park officials are slapping visitors' mug shots on four- 
and five-day passes. The ID pictures are snapped at the gate and the passes 
assembled in minutes, says spokesman Rod Madden.

 If you're planning a spring or summer trip to Washington, D.C., and you want 
to take the kids on a guided tour of the White House or Supreme Court, now's 
the time to talk to your congressional representative about tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Advance-reservation tours of the ground floor and state floor rooms of the 
White House, led by the Secret Service, are given Tuesday through Saturday at 
8:15, 8:30 and 8:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain the free tickets, visitors should contact their congressional or 
senatorial representative's office at least three months before they plan on 
visiting Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Do-it-yourselfers can bypass the advance tickets, but they may face some 
formidable lines when they get to the District. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular self-guided tours of the White House are available Tuesday through 
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. during the summer, and 10 a.m. to noon in other 
seasons. During the spring and summer, visitors must obtain same-day tickets -- 
which assign visitors a time in which to stand in line for general entrance -- 
at a booth on the Ellipse grounds. The Washington Convention and Visitors Assn. 
(202-789-7000) recommends arriving early in the morning to get tickets. A Fancy

DESTINATION: NEW YORK; STAYING LONGER, PAYING LESS IN THE HEART OF MANHATTAN; 
THE BIG APPLE'S EXTENDED-STAY HOTELS OFFER THE TRAVELER FEW AMENITIES . . . BUT 
THE PRICE IS RIGHT

 If you're planning to visit New York and intend to stay at a well-known hotel, 
you can probably count on one hand the number of nights you'll be in town. With 
double rooms fetching an average of $285 a night, New York is among the most 
expensive places to visit in the country. But if you need to stay seven nights 
or longer, must you part with $2,000 a week for a room? Or should you sublet an 
apartment, which means having to look for one, not to mention deposits, 
background checks and references? 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is necessary if you reserve a place at one of Manhattan's 
lesser-known hotels that specialize in extended stays. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the Hotel Olcott, where I've lived for the past two years. 
Located in a tranquil, residential area on the Upper West Side, the Olcott's 
weekly rate is just $500 for a studio with a kitchenette. A week's stay, 
including taxes, is just $595 -- less than the cost of two nights in a 
first-class hotel. And total costs are cut even more, since meals can be 
prepared in the kitchenette. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you haven't heard of the Olcott and places like it, you are not alone. 
Few people realize that Manhattan has many such reasonably priced 
accommodations that can be rented by the week, the month or even the year -- 
some with discounts of up to 50% off daily rates. In fact, a spokeswoman for 
the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau -- which receives dozens of 
requests each week from travelers seeking deals on extended stays -- told me 
that, as far as she knew, "those discounts don't exist." 
</P>
<P>
 I found out differently while researching a book on extended stays in New York 
and other U.S. cities. I contacted more than 300 hotels and residences in 
Manhattan and visited nearly 100, ranging from nauseating dives in the East 
Village's Bowery district (average price, $53 per week) to the opulent Plaza 
Hotel on Fifth Avenue, where a week's stay in the Presidential Suite costs 
$105,000 and is actually sometimes rented for that period of time. At some 
hotels, I pretended to be a prospective long-term guest. At others, I checked 
in and stayed at least a week, never mentioning the article or book I was 
writing. In both cases, I tested beds and baths, checked out the clientele and 
inspected the neighborhoods. I spoke with general managers, front desk 
personnel, housekeepers, even guests when I could. Many properties were simply 
unacceptable. But I did discover a few treasures, which I've included here. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the budget properties listed, there are dozens of more upscale 
establishments serving the extended-stay market. Perhaps best known is 
Manhattan East Suite Hotels (telephone 800-ME-SUITE), with nine properties 
scattered through Midtown and the Upper East Side. Monthly and annual rates are 
available on all their accommodations, which include studios and one- and 
two-bedroom suites and fully appointed kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the newer entries in the deluxe category is the recently restored Sutton 
Hotel (tel. 212- 752-8888, fax 212-752-2605). Roughly 10 blocks north of the 
United Nations, this plush hostelry features elegantly appointed suites and a 
private health club with a 55-foot swimming pool. Monthly rates at both the 
Sutton and Manhattan East Suite hotels begin at about $3,000 for the least 
expensive studios. 
</P>
<P>
 If the good news is the steep discount some hotels offer on extended stays, 
the bad news is that there are taxes on those rates. That works out to an 
additional 16.25% plus a $2-per-room, per-night occupancy tax for most of the 
accommodations listed here. (Rooms averaging more than $100 per night are 
subject to an additional 5% "luxury tax.") All rates quoted below do not 
include taxes, except where noted. Hotels stop charging approximately half the 
tax after the first three months and won't charge any after a six-month stay. 
In addition, the New York sales tax law requires a hotel to issue residents a 
full refund of all taxes paid after a stay of six consecutive months. BASIC 
BUDGET HOTELS 
</P>
<P>
 If the basics are all that's necessary, then one of the bargain-basement 
establishments that follow may be appropriate. A bed, a dresser, a table or 
desk and a chair or two are usually the only furnishings provided at these 
dirt-cheap hostelries. Some rooms have sinks, but bathrooms are usually located 
in the hall and shared with several other guests. Don't expect much more than 
functionality at most low-end budget hotels. The cooking facilities rarely 
exceed a hot plate atop a small refrigerator, and the view from the window will 
probably be the wall of an adjacent building. Color TV and air conditioning are 
considered luxuries at this level, but are sometimes available at extra cost. 
Still, these lodgings are exceptional values for Manhattan, and what they lack 
in creature comforts they more than make up in practicality and savings. 
</P>
<P>
 At the top of my list of low-end budget hotels is the Malibu Studios Hotel, a 
150-room establishment on upper Broadway at 102nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovated in 1990, the Malibu is a favorite among international tourists and 
students. The cozy singles and doubles have full-size beds with new comforters, 
dressers and vanities that double as kitchen sinks. I was disappointed that 
there were no closets in any of the rooms I looked at, but each room had a pole 
to hang clothes on near the door. All rooms are equipped with small 
refrigerators and two-burner gas hot plates. Bathrooms, shared with several 
other guests, are well lit, roomy and clean and have good, strong showers. 
There are no phones in the rooms, but messages are taken at the reception desk. 
Color TVs are available for a nominal charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Singles start at $140 weekly and $450 monthly. Larger doubles begin at $200 
weekly and $650 monthly. Nearby are dozens of shops and restaurants; subway and 
bus service are at the corner. The management suggests you make your 
reservation at least one week before your anticipated arrival. A unique budget 
choice. 
</P>

(212) 222-2954 or (212) 663-0275, fax (212) 678-6842.  
</P>
<P>
 Another low-end budget hotel is the Dynasty Studio Hotel, which has tiny 
rooms, some of which have old-fashioned water closets and fireplaces, and a 
coin-operated laundry. Singles start at $130 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynasty Studio Hotel, 850 West End Ave., New York 10025; tel. (212) 749-7104.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in this category, there's the Parc Lincoln, just three blocks from a 
major subway hub. Rooms, a bit on the cheerless side, start at $125 a week with 
full private baths (among the cheapest lodgings with private baths in 
Manhattan) and $90 without. Some rooms are equipped with jacks for cable TV and 
local telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Parc Lincoln, 166 West 75th St., New York 10023; tel. (212) 873-3000. HIGH-END 
BUDGET HOTELS 
</P>
<P>
 While the most inexpensive budget hotels generally offer a few amenities, 
those in the high-end category usually offer a more sophisticated atmosphere, 
larger rooms, private baths, color TVs, air conditioning, direct-dial 
telephones and kitchenettes. The comfort level rises discernibly in this class 
of hotels, but so does the cost. Rooms are generally better furnished, though 
not luxurious. Suites, if available, are especially good deals, particularly if 
two people will be sharing the accommodations. These hotels often attract many 
short-term guests, because daily rates are typically far lower than those at 
most tourist-class hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally footsteps west of Central Park, the venerable Hotel Olcott is quite 
possibly the best extended-stay deal -- make that steal -- in all of Manhattan. 
For years, it has unobtrusively hosted travelers from around the world with its 
cosmopolitan-yet-casual atmosphere, friendly staff and rock-bottom rates. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find a wide range of accommodations at the Olcott, from roomy studio 
singles to one- and two-bedroom apartments. The feeling is decidedly homey. All 
accommodations come with completely furnished kitchenettes, dining tables, 
dressers, desks and chairs in the living rooms. Some even have fireplaces; a 
few have terraces. The bathrooms are modest but the showers are terrific. As 
for the closet space, a one-bedroom suite I stayed in had four of them. Air 
conditioning is standard on weekly stays and available at extra cost on monthly 
stays. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly rates begin at an unbelievable $500 for studios and $680 for 
one-bedroom suites. Monthly rates are $1,400 and $1,600, respectively; annual 
leases are even better deals. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Chelsea Hotel has been home to Isadora Duncan, Arthur Miller, Dylan 
Thomas, Edie Sedgwick, Eugene O'Neill and Sid and Nancy, all of whom lived (or 
died) here. Even Madonna couldn't stay away, and picked the Chelsea as the 
setting for some of the pics that appear in her book, "Sex." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chelsea is as offbeat as they come. I stayed there on two separate 
occasions, not long ago, each time for several weeks. I found that the hotel 
lives up to its reputation: the lobby is a mini-museum of sculpture and 
paintings donated by former residents. Dogs, which are allowed in the rooms, 
also roam freely about the lobby and ride the elevators. Upstairs, the 
corridors are stark and sterile -- except for the half-finished canvases and 
artist's supplies lying around in the hallways outside the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The first room I stayed in, on the ninth floor, was dreary and badly in need 
of new furnishings, and the bathroom plumbing bordered on unacceptable. More 
cheerful, however, was the second room I stayed in, though it was in a noisy 
location. Overlooking busy 23rd Street, its shuttered windows opened onto a 
wrought-iron balcony. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a ceiling fan -- a welcome touch since it was late summer and the 
room did not have an air conditioner. Although the water pressure was low, I 
was pleased that everything at least worked. A refrigerator was supplied in 
both rooms, and I could have had a hot plate if I'd wanted one. Larger 
apartments have kitchenettes with full gas stoves, and the hotel's housekeeping 
department will furnish utensils upon request. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chelsea continues to attract a diverse clientele populated by artists. 
Currently, a number of rooms and suites are undergoing renovation, and the 
hotel has just installed cable TV. (TVs may be rented for a few dollars a day.) 
</P>
<P>
 Studios with kitchens begin at $495-$594 a week (depending upon the length of 
stay) and $1,225 monthly. One-bedroom suites start at $625 per week and $1,750 
monthly. Monthly rates apply to stays of eight months or longer and are 
tax-exempt.

</P>
<P>
 I immediately liked the quietly bustling Gramercy Park Hotel, directly across 
from exclusive Gramercy Park, just off Park Avenue, the only private park in 
Manhattan. Just inside the main entrance is a pleasant cocktail lounge, and 
there is no shortage of places to sit in the large, winding lobby. There is 
also a well-stocked newsstand that sells everything from newspapers to T-shirts 
and baseball caps, with a restaurant that specializes in pasta dishes just off 
the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Both studios and one-bedroom suites are offered. All have private baths with 
excellent water pressure, wardrobe-size kitchenettes and ample closet space. 
Cable TV and air conditioning are standard.  
</P>
<P>
 Weekly rates are not available at the 509-room Gramercy Park, but substantial 
discounts are given to guests able to stay a month or longer. Studios begin at 
$1,500 per month; one-bedroom suites are $2,500. An "application for extended 
stay" (sent to you if you say that you plan to stay for at least a month) must 
be completed and returned with a $200 check or money order, applied toward your 
first month's rent.  
</P>
<P>
 The gates to Gramercy Park are closed to the public, but keys are available to 
hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A country inn in Manhattan? You might actually think so the moment you arrive 
at the rustic Gracie Inn, on the Upper East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 The white brick facade, green shutters and coach light at the entrance echo 
the simplicity and serenity of rural American life. Inside, the rooms are 
warmly furnished with antiques, live plants and alarm clocks. Kitchens are 
equipped with a variety of conveniences and cooking utensils. The tile 
bathrooms -- all new -- are immaculate. Other amenities include color cable TV, 
air conditioning, an on-premises laundry and complimentary muffins and coffee 
every morning. Upon request, guests may bring pets. Bus service is available at 
the corner. Shopping, banks and a library are all near this Manhattan treasure. 
Weekly rates begin at $650 for studios and $820 for one-bedrooms. Monthly rates 
start at $2,025 and $2,500, respectively.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: ARIZONA: NO GLITZ GRUB; SEARCH FOR ROAD FOOD IN AND AROUND 
PHOENIX UNCOVERS COWBOYS, BURGERS AND LOCAL COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT HANNA KUEHL, Kuehl is a free-lance writer based in Denver. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If I had to choose my last meal, I'd request the crema Catalan at the 
Scottsdale Princess hotel's Marquesa restaurant. I might also order the lobster 
and roasted corn chowder from The Phoenician hotel's Windows on the Green 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But I wasn't near death, I'd blown half my vacation budget on two nights' 
dining in Scottsdale's upper-crust resorts and I still didn't have a clue about 
the area's real flavors. That's when I turned to my friend Jim Vaughan and 
asked where I could find regional food seasoned with local color. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan is a Sonora Desert Huck Finn at 40; a self-educated wild man and local 
tour operator who roars along Arizona back roads in a van, country music tapes 
blaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan considers himself an expert on Arizona road food -- the dining (and 
diners) he encounters as a local tour operator. He has his own way of rating 
restaurants and is slow to award his Five Beer Star rating. A place should have 
real food, he believes, not that fancy stuff. Lots of local color -- miners, 
ranchers and cowboys. No line dancing. No wimps. 
</P>
<P>
 "And a place loses a notch if it has more than four Harley Davidsons out 
front. Nowadays, Harleys usually belong to Yuppies. But the place would get its 
rating back if they were real bikers," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Vaughan who introduced me to such "culinary attractions" as the Rusty 
Spur Saloon cowboy bar in the Old Town Scottsdale area, where the big 
enticement is "worm tequila" ($4.50) and buffalo burgers with green chili sauce 
($5.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Any adventurer's trip to Mexico includes an introduction to mescal, the 
tequila cousin that hosts a shriveled-up cactus worm in the bottom of the 
bottle. The Rusty Spur's Dos Gusanos includes two such worms in alcohol so 
potent Trish Braun, the barmaid, warned me, "It's not wise to light a cigarette 
while you're drinking that stuff" -- even though I wasn't smoking. Ten to 15 
cowboys a week get it down, dried out worms and all, and win the honor of 
having their names burned into the wall as members of the bar's Rusty Spur 
Club. I was told it helps the high- stepping when the Western band starts up at 
2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop on our tour was the Greasewood Flat Restaurant in the Pinnacle Peak 
area north of the ritzy resorts. "There's only one Greasewood in the world," 
Vaughan boasted, as we drove up the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 When we slipped through the ranch gate into a paddock area that houses what 
was once a bunk house and is now the restaurant-bar, we found a long line of 
dusty pickup trucks interspersed with heavily chromed Harleys and spiffy new 
Mercedeses. I noticed bumper stickers on the backs of the parked pickups: 
"Shooting is my aim in life," "An armed man is a citizen, an unarmed man is a 
slave" and "My gun killed fewer people than Ted Kennedy's car." Across the 
parking lot, tied to a hitching post, four saddled horses dozed in the sun, 
awaiting their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 It's wise to make a first visit to Greasewood Flat at night. In full daylight 
it looks startlingly like a junkyard, surrounded as it is by prickly greasewood 
shrubs that bristle the dusty mountainside like 5 o'clock shadow. A wagon train 
of buckboards piled high with empty beer and liquor bottles encircles 100 or so 
weathered wooden picnic tables resting on hard-packed dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But at night, gaslights and 10 or so huge metal fire barrels encourage a 
kinder, gentler feeling. With bonfires blazing, the country singer weaving his 
magic up on the stage opposite the bunkhouse, and all ages and income levels 
trading stories around the picnic tables, it's the essence of Southwest 
camp-out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Sunday afternoon we visited, most of the outdoor tables were empty, but 
inside the converted bunk house, imposing bikers in black leather jackets 
barely cleared the ceiling where they stood drinking at the bar. Every inch of 
wall and ceiling was covered with business cards, notes, drawings and 
autographed dollar bills. A service window to the kitchen carried a sign 
warning, "If you're not prepared to wait for your food, please don't order." 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Johnson, Greasewood's restaurant manager, makes a mellow green chili 
sauce that tops their thick, juicy cheeseburgers ($4.75.) "My chili recipe won 
a People's Choice Award at a local culinary festival," she bragged. "There's no 
meat in it and it's not really hot, just very flavorful. We go through 450 
chili cheeseburgers on a Saturday night. A burger comes with lettuce, tomato, 
onion, pickles and chips. One of those should do you unless you're a big 
eater." Regulars give her nachos with homemade salsa rave reviews, too ($4.25). 
</P>
<P>
 Greasewood Flat can accommodate up to 500 customers. The overflow heads for 
Toolie's Country, a barn of a place on the west side of Phoenix with enough 
room for 850 cowboys and cowgirls to twirl and strut with abandon. Toolie's 
Country consistently wins plaudits from the Country Music Assn. and the Academy 
of Country Music as one of the top five country music clubs in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 For Friday night fish fries, Toolie's is the place to go -- $3.95 for a plate 
of fried fish and French fries delivered to tables that frame the enormous 
dance floor. Toolie's also has free Western dancing lessons on Monday, 
Wednesday and Sunday evenings (6:30 to 8 p.m.). That's when we can learn 
everything from the Arizona two-step to country cha-cha, West Coast swing to 
the shuffle. Most popular of all are the line dances -- the Electric Slide, 
Achy-Breaky, Boot Scoot. Warning: No tank tops or Harley T-shirts allowed, 
according to the management. 
</P>
<P>
 The much smaller Handlebar-J, in north Scottsdale, has its own following of 
true cowboys (as well as the pin-striped suit crowd) -- all drawn by cowboy 
hats nailed to the ceiling, barbecued ribs, steaks, a country band and 
high-gloss dance floor. The beef barbecue dinner -- which locals devour with 
gusto -- will set you back about $14. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sterile place Vaughan would go along with was Sam's Cafe in the 
downtown Phoenix Arizona Center. The restaurant overlooking a palm-tree-shaded 
oasis surrounded by business offices is justly famed for its poblano chicken 
chowder topped with tortilla chips and mixed cheeses ($3.95 for a big bowl). 
The bunuelo -- a fried tortilla shell dusted with cinnamon and sugar that 
serves as a bowl for vanilla ice cream drizzled with hot caramel -- was 
wonderful ($3.95). 
</P>
<P>
 We had to drive all the way to Cave Creek, a one-time mining town north of 
Phoenix near Carefree in quest of a "Navajo taco" in an unlikely setting. The 
Indian Village shop -- just up the hill from the touristy Frontier Town, 
complete with a gallows in the parking lot -- didn't look like it could 
possibly contain anything authentic. We made our way through the shop's vast 
souvenir collection to a snack counter at the back. There we selected from a 
menu on the wall, and watched tentatively as a ball of dough, thrown into a 
boiling kettle of oil, exploded into an eight-inch puffy crust. The choice of 
toppings was anything from beans and cheese to honey and powdered sugar. But 
the real deal was the Navajo taco: pinto beans, red chile sauce, shredded 
lettuce and chopped tomatoes on the puffy, eight-inch crust ($4.95). It's the 
closest you'll come to the Navajo tacos served on Native American reservations. 
I know this from experience. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back into Phoenix, we stopped at Frontier Town, just long enough to 
check out the Black Mountain Brewing Co. chile beer at Crazy Ed's Satisfied 
Frog Restaurant. Crazy Ed Chilleen is a Phoenix institution, of sorts. His beer 
-- pilsener spiked with Serrano chiles -- goes all over the world. Just the 
thing to wash down your 32-ounce porterhouse steak ($16.95). 
</P>
<P>
 I wanted to sample menudo so we headed for south Phoenix, though Vaughan was 
not turned on by the thought of what he referred to as "that stomach food." 
(It's made of honeycomb tripe -- part of a cow's stomach -- simmered with dried 
corn, chiles and sometimes tomatoes.) Judging by the prevalence of the signs in 
restaurant windows, menudo is a hot seller on Sunday mornings, when it is 
downed as a hangover cure, according to my friend Vaughan -- an authority on 
such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Mosqueda, owner-chef at Adrian's Restaurant, sells 80 gallons of menudo 
during an average three-day weekend, but it is in demand all week long ($4.50 
for a big bowl), he said. Other offerings on his printed menu that boasts 
"Taste the Real Mexican Food": beef tongue tacos ($1.40), goat meat barbecue 
($5.75) and baked chicken in mole , served with rice or beans and tortillas 
($5.75). 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered fish tacos at the San Carlos Bay Seafood Restaurant -- two to a 
plate with rice and beans ($5.25). Strips of moist red snapper wrapped in a 
soft corn tortilla came topped by half a lime and the traditional garnish of 
chopped tomato and lettuce. (Yum.) Next time I'll try the Seven Seas Stew, 
which looked and smelled marvelous: a huge, steaming bowl of snapper, crab 
legs, squid, octopus, abalone, carrots and green chiles in a tomato broth 
($9.75). (Little English is spoken.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our next stop was El Tianguis en Guadalupe Plaza, one of Vaughan's favorite 
haunts in south Phoenix, an area that is home to many Latinos. The park behind 
a whitewashed adobe church is an echo of a tranquil border town on a Sunday 
afternoon. An arcade of shops offers everything from pinatas to sombreros to 
guava paste. A couple of musicians with amplified guitars played for dancing on 
the plaza, and families sat at little tables outside El Taquito Restaurant, 
plates piled high with such delicacies as cabeza burrito ($2.50), marinated 
meat from the cow's head; a Spanish sesos taco of stewed beef brains in a crisp 
corn tortilla ($1). I opted for more conventional fare and ended up with a 
generous serving of carne asada (strips of beef briefly marinated in a vinegary 
mix before grilling) with rice and beans on the side. It was terrific ($6.75). 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few blocks away, our last stop -- and most fun because of a meeting 
with its owner-chef Victoria Chavez -- was Los Dos Molinos. Chavez greeted us 
in her cooking clothes: a pert hat with a concho band, a stylish yellow, black 
and green floral print dress under an apron and comfortable shoes. The eyes 
behind the owlish red-frame glasses sparkled when we admired the distinctive 
adobe dining room with tile-topped tables that Chavez and her husband had 
created in what was once a chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "My food is hot, Hon. I mean to tell you, it's real hot. My chili comes from 
Hatch, New Mexico, and I buy it by the truckload," Chavez said. "The best thing 
on the menu is the ribs marinated in red chili sauce -- carne adovada. That's 
done in a homemade tortilla in one version ($5.25); in another, it's ribs on a 
big plate with tortillas on the side ($6.95). It's really good but I always 
warn people." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Dos Molinos doesn't advertise. "I'd rather just let people who have been 
here tell their friends so they'll know what to expect. As it is, people have 
to wait around outside to get in and then they can't eat the food. Then they 
get mad. I just give them their money back." 
</P>
<P>
 I sampled her red chili sauce -- just the tiniest drop on the end of a 
homemade tortilla chip. The burn started on the tip of my tongue, leaped to the 
back of my mouth, catapulted up my nasal passage and exited as tears in my 
eyes. Then I sneezed. Vaughan hooted. But I noticed he wasn't touching the 
stuff . . . Five Beer Star rating or not. 
</P>
<P>
 When we paid our bill and were heading out the door, Chavez noticed my misty 
eyes. "Oh, Hon. You did try my chili!" GUIDEBOOK: Desert Delights

DESTINATION: OMAN; SANDCASTLES AND SKYSCRAPERS; OLD TRADITIONS LINGER IN THIS 
PERSIAN GULF SULTANATE, WHICH HAS LEAPED INTO THE 21ST CENTURY AFTER A LONG, 
XENOPHOBIC ISOLATION

<P>
 With its oil wealth, the little Persian Gulf sultanate of Oman has taken a 
bold leap into the 21st Century during the past two decades, but old Arab 
traditions linger. As I departed the Holiday Inn in Salalah, on the nation's 
southern coast, I was escorted to a corner of the lobby where exquisite rugs 
and pillows had been arranged as if in a Bedouin tent. There I was seated and 
served a basket of fresh, sweet Omani dates and a cup of kahwa, a strong 
aromatic coffee laced with cardamom powder, saffron and rose water that had 
been brewed over an ornate charcoal brazier. The scent of frankincense, which 
Oman has exported for centuries, perfumed the air. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an odd moment, this ancient ritual of hospitality played out slowly and 
graciously within full view of the bustling registration desk of a big American 
chain hotel. But no more odd, I suppose, than countless similar clashes of old 
and new I witnessed in this exotic country -- the legendary homeland of Sinbad 
the Sailor -- which until 1970 had been trapped for decades in a grim, 
xenophobic isolation that shunned even the most modest of 20th-Century 
advances. There were few schools, a single electrical power plant, no 
newspapers, no radio or television -- and only a few miles of paved roads. Oman 
was, as government officials concede, one of the most backward nations in the 
Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
 This has all changed now, and Muscat, the capital -- draped across a dramatic 
landscape of desert, mountain and sea -- is a gleamingly up-to-date city of 
grand, landscaped boulevards, new office high-rises, swank beach-front hotels, 
blooming gardens, modern hospitals and schools as well as ornately embellished 
mosques and a lavish new seaside palace for visiting dignitaries. The absolute 
monarch, British-educated Sultan Zaboos bin Said al-Said, launched his people 
on their pell-mell race to progress after deposing his father in a bloodless 
coup in 1970. So intent is he on polishing the nation's image that Omani 
motorists, many of them driving Mercedes limousines, can be ticketed if their 
cars are too dirty. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet for all Muscat's dazzling freshness -- indeed, the many huge homes in 
the city's lushly landscaped desert terrain reminded me of posh Palm Springs -- 
Oman's ancient Arab heritage as an adventurous seafaring and trading empire has 
not been abandoned entirely. Most men in the capital and elsewhere still wear 
carefully wrapped turbans and the sleek, white ankle-length tunics called 
dishdashas, and the women, whose faces generally remain uncovered, are wrapped 
in a riot of color that invariably includes a scarf across the head and lots of 
dangling silver and gold jewelry. To my Western eye, the sight of Omanis in 
their traditional garb, men and women alike, seemed curiously out of place in 
Muscat's modern, computer-furnished offices. As I was learning, the old and the 
new in today's Oman are intricately entwined. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to go far into the desert outside Muscat to spot a herd of 
camels, but they are now kept mostly for their milk or for camel racing rather 
than transportation. Fishermen on the Arabian Sea still pull sardine-heavy nets 
ashore by hand -- although when the water is rough they may hook the net to the 
bumper of a pickup truck and let it do the muscle work. And a visit to the 
tangled streets of the Muscat souk, the city's open-air marketplace, continues 
to be a journey into the past -- even if many of the old stalls sell fancy 
luggage, mechanical toys and practically anything else you might find in your 
local Kmart. Tucked in odd corners, however, are stalls offering fresh spices, 
frankincense burners and hand-worked silver jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 I flew to Oman via London in late October, a 22-hour journey that proved 
exhausting. But I dismissed the drawback as a modest price for the chance to 
see a new and very different land undergoing rapid change. I toured Oman for 
five days, not nearly enough time to do it justice. 
</P>
<P>
 I scrambled through ancient mud forts; waded in warm surf on beautiful empty 
beaches on the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea; bounced in a Land Rover 
through an intimidating bleak and empty desert to visit the ruins of the fabled 
city of Ubar; witnessed the busy morning fish market in Muscat; admired good 
examples of Arabic architecture old and new; was mobbed by youngsters eager to 
have their photos snapped; nibbled more dates than I've ever eaten in all my 
life, and dined quite nicely on such Omani specialties as viazi va nazi, which 
my English menu described as braised beef and potatoes layered and simmered in 
a coconut sauce and served with rice. And I met unfailingly friendly and 
courteous people, many of whom spoke English fluently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As an independent traveler, I found Oman reasonably easy to explore. Almost 
every sign, whether it is a road marker or a shop marquee, appears in both 
Arabic and English. Detailed guidebooks and maps in English abound in hotel 
bookstores. Even the license tags on Omani autos are in both languages. Good 
paved roads extend to much of Oman, although four-wheel drive is recommended 
for unpaved roads into the desert and mountains. Outside the city core, traffic 
is nonexistent -- as, apparently, are speed limits.  
</P>
<P>
 I ventured into the countryside on two half-day trips, one from Muscat and 
another from the southern seaside city of Salalah, accompanied by a guide whom 
the Ministry of Information had provided me as a foreign journalist. But both 
excursions can be duplicated by joining a commercial tour -- brochures are 
available in most hotels -- or renting a car. I had been warned about the 
summer heat and humidity of the Persian Gulf area, but by late October the 
worst heat had abated, and I was fairly comfortable -- although drenched in 
sweat whenever I toured on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 As desolate as this rugged land may seem, it nevertheless displays a wild 
beauty, like the Badlands of the American Dakotas, and I found the scenery 
fascinating. The red sand dunes looming on the horizon make a vivid splash of 
color against the deep blue sky, where I never saw a cloud during the entire 
week of my trip. 
</P>
<P>
 To tour the mud fort at Nakhal, which dates back before the 9th Century, I set 
out one morning with a Portuguese political writer and an Omani government 
guide for the half-day drive into the mountains southwest of Muscat. Nakhal's 
is one of numerous Omani forts that are being preserved. As our driver sped out 
of Muscat on an express highway, I heard a pinging sound in our Land Rover -- a 
warning, I soon learned, required in all Omani cars to alert motorists that 
they are exceeding 75 m.p.h. The bell didn't faze our driver; we pinged almost 
our entire way to Nakhal and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Restored in 1990, the fort is well worth the trip. Ringed with high walls, it 
is perched on the rocks above the village, and mountains tower in the 
background. Inside, stair-step passageways lead to six cylindrical towers and 
several rooms furnished comfortably with rugs, pillows and ceramics as they 
might have been when the fort was in use. In one large room, the wood beams of 
the ceiling were colorfully painted with quotes from the Koran -- a traditional 
form of Omani home decoration. From the parapets, I could see the village 
below, where dozens of schoolchildren played at recess. The boys were dressed 
in youthful versions of the dishdasha, and girls wore bright scarves on their 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To visit Salalah at the southern tip of Oman, where the sultan maintains a 
summer palace, I could have taken one of the daily air-conditioned buses that 
cover the desert route in 12 hours over the new paved highway linking the two 
cities. But my time was short, so I flew on Oman Air (about $130 round trip), 
which makes the flight with 737 jets in just over an hour. The lures of Salalah 
were its magnificent, miles-long white-sand beach, acres of frankincense trees 
growing wild and the archeological ruins of Ubar. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to Ubar climbs steeply through the hills north of Salalah, where 
herds of free-roaming cattle and goats graze on the thick grass, which turns 
brown at the end of the monsoon season. Suddenly our driver made a left turn on 
a barely discernible path across the desert floor. For more than another hour, 
we bounced over the hard-packed sand in the direction of the Rub al-Khali, the 
infamous Empty Quarter on the Saudi Arabian border. I have never seen a more 
desolate landscape. The terrain was almost perfectly flat, except for an 
occasional rocky lump in the distance, and barely a blade of grass was visible 
anywhere. Sand devils whipped across the horizon. Twice on our excursion, our 
guide stopped for a few minutes of private prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ubar is celebrated in the Koran as a profitable center for the frankincense 
trade, I was informed, dating back as early as 3000 BC. According to legend, it 
was a wealthy and powerful fortress city. But the stone city was mistakenly 
built above a limestone cavern, so the theory goes, and one day the cavern 
collapsed from the weight, swallowing Ubar like "the Atlantis of the sands" -- 
as T. E. Lawrence, the Lawrence of Arabia, dubbed it. Last year, it was 
announced that a team of California archeologists, using high-tech satellite 
imagery, had rediscovered Ubar buried beneath the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, there is not much yet to see there, except for a few crumbling walls 
and a deep sinkhole. I was just as intrigued by the adjacent oasis and the new 
village constructed nearby for archeological workers. Each small home, 
encircled by a wall, looks like a miniature fort -- as do dwellings and other 
structures in Oman. 
</P>
<P>
 For perhaps 5,000 years, as the Ubar site suggests, Oman has traded in 
frankincense, shipped by sea and camel caravan to markets in India, the Middle 
East and Europe. Since it is produced only in southern Oman and nearby Somalia, 
this famous gift may have originated from near Salalah. There in the souk, I 
bought a small, locally made incense burner of painted pottery, and the 
shopkeeper, an old woman seated barefoot on a rug, filled it free with 
frankincense. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oman, frankincense is burned in charcoal after coffee or after a meal, 
signaling that it is time for guests to leave. Men waft the aroma into their 
beards and hair and women perfume their skirts. In the departing coffee 
ceremony to which I was treated at my Salalah hotel, the aroma of burning 
frankincense filled the lobby. In much the traditional way, I too was enveloped 
in the fragrance and carried it away with me as I left Oman. GUIDEBOOK: 
Venturing to Oman 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: The best connecting service from Los Angeles to Muscat, Oman, 
is through London on United Airlines or British Air, or through Frankfurt on 
Delta; current best round-trip fare is about $3,060 until the end of May, then 
about $3,320 until October. However, you may be able to trim that fare by 
$1,000 or more (depending on departure date) if you are flexible in your travel 
plans and make use of a consolidator offering off-price tickets. For 
consolidator fares, consult a travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Omani immigration rules, if you fly into Oman you must fly out of 
that country; you cannot fly into Oman and travel overland, for example, to the 
neighboring United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
 American citizens must carry a passport and obtain visas in advance to visit 
Oman. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to stay: Oman offers a choice of excellent hotels ranging from 
moderately priced to expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Muscat, I stayed at the Muscat Inter-Continental, a splendid high-rise on 
the beach, where a room was about $110 a night. At the Al Bustan Palace hotel, 
another Inter-Continental beach-front property and one of the Persian Gulf's 
most luxurious hotels, a room is about $260 a night. In Salalah, on Oman's 
southern coast, the principal hotel is the beach-front Holiday Inn, where a 
room is about $90 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to eat: Visitors should have little problem finding excellent, 
moderately priced restaurants in Oman. Every menu I was handed carried an 
English translation. Choices range from Middle Eastern, Persian and Indian 
cuisines -- which I favored -- to European menus, pizza and American fast food. 
Locally caught fish and locally grown fruit and vegetables are plentiful. I 
paid $18-$23 for a full dinner in each of my hotels and about $12 for a filling 
buffet breakfast.

CRUISE VIEWS: THE FUTURE OF PASSENGER SHIPS LOOKS BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines.

<TEXT>
<P>
 What will tomorrow's cruise ships be like? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, they will either be very large or very small, says Stephanie 
Gallagher, vice president of World City Corp., a New York City-based cruise 
line still in development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are plenty of very small ships already, so the area for innovation is 
in the very large," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ships are going to get bigger, that's inevitable," says Kai Levandar, head of 
research and design at Finland's Masa-Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Levandar's own design group has, for more than a decade, been promoting 
various 10-story resort hotels set atop twin hulls that are like self-contained 
resort islands in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could be speaking of Gallagher's proposed Phoenix World City project as 
well. That nearly quarter-mile-long ship will have a capacity of 5,600 
passengers in its 250,000 tons, with three high-rise hotels, 16 restaurants, 25 
shops, courtyards, swimming pools and 100,000 square feet of meeting and 
educational space. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Farcus, designer of the splashy new Carnival Cruise Lines ships, envisions 
shipboard life as "like a movie . . . but in this movie the audience is not 
watching, but is on the screen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early last year, Carnival announced the construction of a 95,000-ton vessel -- 
the largest passenger cruise ship built so far -- which will cost more than 
$400 million and carry nearly 3,000 passengers. Due in late 1996, the 
still-unnamed ship is jocularly referred to by Carnival executives as "Big 
Bertha." 
</P>
<P>
 (The biggest ship currently in service is Norwegian Cruise Line's Norway -- 
76,049 gross registered tons, 1,035 feet long and capable of carrying 2,032 
passengers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Leading cruise ship architect and designer Bjorn Storbraaten of Norway, whose 
firm (with partner Pette Yran) has virtually invented the modern luxury 
suite-cabins aboard Sea Goddess, Seabourn, the Royal Viking Queen and Song of 
Flower, doesn't see a big change in ship design coming up any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Storbraaten thinks that cruise lines should focus on creating more dining 
options, bigger health spas and creative uses of show lounge and deck areas. 
</P>
<P>
 He envisions show lounges of the future to be "like palladiums, multipurpose 
areas where you could have an ice rink or an arena circus layout, or move the 
seats around to create different moods and different types of theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Storbraaten's most recent design, the 296-passenger Silver Cloud (due to debut 
this month), is the first of four ultra-luxurious ships for a new line called 
Silversea.  
</P>
<P>
 Another company, Windstar Cruises, has already debuted two of its futuristic 
designs. Windstar's three 150-passenger ships, with their computer-operated 
sails, came out of a design concept called Windcruiser, and were launched in 
December, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, a very similar design was used for the 386-passenger Club Med 1 
and Club Med 2. On each of the five ships, the remote-control sails and booms 
can be operated from the bridge by one person.  
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic twin-hulled Radisson Diamond utilizes a design principle called 
SWATH (small waterplane area twin hull). The 26-foot-draft twin hulls allow 
propulsion machinery to sit below the water line, providing considerably less 
engine and propeller noise and vibration, while stabilizer fins on the back and 
front of each hull reduce pitching and rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 The boat's wider-than-average beam means companionways are more spacious, and 
cabins and public areas roomier than in a traditional vessel of similar length. 
The twin-hull, 354-passenger vessel debuted in spring, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the potential headliner, the gigantic Phoenix World City, is still very 
much alive, despite numerous predictions of its demise. This billion-dollar 
project has been seven years in development so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Three ships are planned, one based on the East Coast, one on the West Coast 
and another in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 World City's Gallagher thinks the proposed Phoenix, with its wide variety of 
restaurants, shops, meeting space, classrooms and workshops -- "set up not for 
transportation but for an experience" -- typifies the future of cruising. She 
estimates a maiden voyage as early as Christmas, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not a theme park, we're a small town," she says. "We think (our ship) 
is a first step toward an inevitable use of our ocean. Remember, the ocean is 
real estate, and in the future there are going to be large platforms (similar 
to oil-drilling platforms) in use that could be built here in the United States 
. . . (to) hold hotels, resorts, universities, hospitals, prisons, senior 
citizen housing, parking structures -- all of it real estate that can be moved 
in case of impending natural disaster or bad weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises is constructing the 
1,950-passenger Sun Princess, a 77,000-ton vessel that is due for delivery in 
late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Princess promises that 70% of the outside cabins will have private verandas, 
and that passengers can expect a wider variety of entertainment and dining 
areas on board than on the line's previous mega-ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Still to come are other designs that range from a trimaran (three-hull) base 
to a proa (outrigger) concept with pontoons that could make one-day sailings 
following the sun, so passengers could spend all day on the outdoor decks.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: HOTEL DEALS IN HAWAII AND AROUND THE WORLD 
</P>

<P>
 The hotel industry in Hawaii has traditionally been "senior friendly," and 
continues to demonstrate it with a flurry of special offers for mature 
travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Coconut Plaza Hotel, in Honolulu's Waikiki area, is offering a generous 
"Seniors Romance Package" that is loaded with features. The deal includes seven

 It wasn't even 7 a.m. but Matt, just 3 at the time, was wide awake, determined 
to make the most of the bright Caribbean morning by alternately shrieking in 
the pool and smashing coconuts on the stone terrace of our rental house on St. 
Martin. Unfortunately, my dad, brother-in-law and sister were trying to sleep 
in rooms directly overlooking the terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years later, we're still getting ribbed about the coconut-smashing. But 
we were paid back royally on a fishing trip to Minnesota when my infant nephew 
didn't sleep more than an hour at a stretch. We still laugh about those gaffes 
. . . as we discuss where we should go next. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips with the entire family -- siblings and grandparents and cousins -- are 
admittedly crazy and difficult to plan. They can be downright awful for those 
who don't get along, but they can be wonderful for those who do. The keys to 
making sure that your family experiences the latter are cooperation, planning 
and realistic expectations, with careful attention paid to the difference in 
ages that may be part of the mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone being there together was a big piece of making it so special," said 
New Yorker Eleanor Mascheroni, whose husband's family rented a house together 
in Tuscany. "It sounds so bucolic but we really had a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mascheronis had such a good time two years ago that they are contemplating 
a similar vacation this summer. "Since that trip, we've spent even more time 
together," Mascheroni said. "This isn't a way to patch up anything. You've got 
to have a good relationship to start with. But it sets the stage for future 
experiences together." 
</P>
<P>

</P>

 "One of the real attractions is that the cousins get to know each other," said 
Los Angeles resident and television writer Jeff Melvoin, whose siblings and 
parents have gathered in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles to ski, ride horses 
or, most recently, celebrate his dad's 65th birthday in Santa Fe, N.M. "And 
just about the time you're remembering what gets on your nerves about each 
other, it's time to go home again," Melvoin said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tufts University child psychologist Don Wertlieb, chairman of the child 
studies department, recognized the value of compromise on a recent trip with 
his parents. During a long walk -- something he, his wife and their children 
enjoy -- he noticed his parents getting tired. At that moment he realized that 
his family's fondness for long walks was too much for his parents. "We took a 
bus back," he said. That experience is one reason why Wertlieb recommends that 
families plan destinations, and at least some activities that "will appeal to 
different generations and interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Family therapist Cheryl Rampage agrees. "Many of us haven't vacationed with 
our families since high school and now it's 20 years later," said Rampage, of 
the Northwestern University-affiliated Family Institute in Chicago. "Remember, 
it's going to be really different." 
</P>
<P>
 If there are family tensions, they will no doubt be present on a cruise ship 
as much as in a kitchen at home. Rampage recalled the family that had a major 
fight in the middle of a week in a remote location. "They all had come in one 
van and no one could really escape even for a few hours to cool off," she said. 
"It made it awkward for the rest of the trip." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Discipline can be another thorny issue -- especially for grandparents who 
don't spend a lot of time around their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone should bend a little," said Dr. Arthur Kornhaber, founder of the 
Foundation for Grandparenting, a nonprofit organization devoted to 
intergenerational involvement. "When grandparents and parents are together, the 
parents are the police force," he acknowledged. "But it's also important for 
parents to respect that grandparents might do things a little differently," and 
to teach children that especially on vacation, it's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 To make certain everyone knows what they're in for, it's important to choose 
the locale carefully and discuss the trip thoroughly -- ahead of time. How much 
baby-sitting will the grandparents provide? How much time does the family 
really want to be together? 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the foibles is that everyone has to always be together on a trip like 
this," said Philadelphia Child Guidance Center psychologist Marion 
Lindblad-Goldberg. "Split up and get back together for dinner," she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Mascheroni, for one, has sometimes stayed at the family's vacation 
rental house and gone swimming with her husband and two young daughters while 
her brother-in-law went off to paint and her in-laws to sightsee. Other days, 
her in-laws have watched the children so she and her husband could take a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that really helped was that we had our own car," Mascheroni 
explained. "Don't have huge expectations of what you'll do," she added. "The 
idea is to be together." 
</P>
<P>
 While the family still can be together, that is. We didn't know it then, but 
our St. Martin trip would be the last vacation we would have together. My dad 
died a few months later. The memories count for a lot.

HIKING: SONOMA COUNTY: A REDWOOD FOREST AND AN OAK-SHADED CREEK NEAR THE 
RUSSIAN RIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve/Austin Creek State Recreation Area, near 
Santa Rosa, is one place on the map, but two distinct environments on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong Redwoods is a 700-acre tall-tree preserve, a cool and dark forest. 
Austin Creek, in contrast, offers open, sun-drenched, grassy hillsides dotted 
with oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parks are a welcome respite from the Russian River resort traffic and all 
those wine country tourists in the flatlands below. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parks offer good hiking -- a gentle saunter through Armstrong Redwoods, a 
moderate-to-vigorous hike through the Austin Creek foothills. Armstrong 
Redwoods is a place to cool off in the summer; it's so shady and shadowy that 
Native Americans considered it a "dark hole" and avoided it. Austin Creek's 
exposed slopes are a bit too hot in summer; hiking there is far more pleasant 
in spring and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong Redwoods was set aside as a preserve by mega-logger Col. James 
Armstrong, surely one of the few 19th-Century timber barons who recognized both 
the beauty and the commercial value in California's redwood groves.  
</P>
<P>
 Best hike through the redwoods is the self-guided nature trail. As you wander 
among the trees past interpretive displays, you'll visit the 310-foot Parson 
Jones Tree and the 14-century-old Col. James Armstrong Tree. After you walk the 
short mile along Fife Creek to the picnic area, loop back to the trail head via 
East Ridge Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Austin Creek's 20 miles of trail follow creeks -- East 
Austin, Gilliam, Schoolhouse and Fife -- through an environment of alder, big 
leaf maple and Oregon ash. Paths also traverse slopes forested with Douglas 
fir, oak and madrone. 
</P>
<P>
 Three back-country camps -- Tom King, Manning Flat and Gilliam Creek -- 
suggest that Austin Creek State Recreation Area would be an ideal location for 
a weekend getaway or family backpacking trip. 
</P>
<P>
 My two favorite hikes in this park are a short (four-mile) and a longer 
(nine-mile) loop that head down Gilliam Creek and climb back to the trail head 
along Austin Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever loop you choose, it's downhill first, uphill last; save some energy 
for the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: Exit U.S. 101 on River Road, four miles north of 
Santa Rosa, and drive west some 16 miles to Guerneville. Turn north on 
Armstrong Woods Road and drive two miles to Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve. 
Continue up the steep park road to a fork; the main park road continues to 
Bullfrog Pond, but you veer left to parking for the signed Gilliam Creek Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Descend north into a mixed forest of oak, Douglas fir and redwood. 
Half a mile out, you'll climb a bit and see some coastward views of the 
multiple ridges rolling to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail turns west and descends through woods, then grassland, to 
Schoolhouse Creek, about a mile from the trail head. You'll cross the creek and 
one of its forks as you descend another mile to a trail junction, near the 
meeting of Gilliam and Schoolhouse creeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those opting for the four-mile hike will go right at this trail junction, 
cross Schoolhouse Creek again, then follow the banks of Gilliam Creek up-creek 
a short distance to meet Austin Creek Trail (a fire road). Hike the fire road 
back toward the trail head. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the mood for a longer hike will continue along Gilliam Creek, 
crossing and recrossing the stream a couple of times as the path leads past 
ferns, flowers (in spring), cascading water and quiet pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Three miles out you'll cross Gilliam Creek for the last time, then climb 
gently above the north bank and descend again. A short side trail leads to 
Gilliam Creek Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the confluence of Gilliam and East Austin creeks, you'll ford the latter 
and climb briefly, but steeply, to meet a fire road. Turn right on the fire 
road, which climbs gradually north through a forest of oak, madrone and fir. 
</P>
<P>
 Five miles out you descend to cross East Austin Creek and meet East Austin 
Creek Trail (another fire road). To visit Manning Flat Trail Camp, head left to 
the shady camp perched on the west bank of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn right on the road, which follows its namesake East Austin Creek and 
passes a great swimming hole. Soon after, your path begins an earnest half-mile 
ascent, passes the side trail leading to Tom King Trail Camp, and leaves Austin 
Creek behind.  
</P>
<P>
 Next comes a half-mile descent and meeting with the short spur connecting to 
Gilliam Creek Trail. Returning from here to the trail head involves a stiff 
climb, regardless of which way you go. 
</P>
<P>
 One way back is to retrace your steps on the Gilliam Creek Trail. Or you can 
continue a "killer climb" on East Austin Creek Trail toward Bullfrog Pond 
Campground. It's a long mile with a 1,000-foot elevation gain. When you reach 
the paved park road half a mile from the campground, pick up a short footpath 
on your right that leads to the trail head. Gilliam Creek, East Austin Creek 
Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve/Austin Creek State Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 4-mile loop, with 800-foot elevation gain, or 8-mile loop, with 
1,000-foot elevation gain. Longer options possible. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Maple-shaded creeks, oak- and fir-forested slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Contrasting environments of cool redwood groves and open slopes 
seasonally sprinkled with wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate to strenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: After first losing elevation, the return to trail head is very 
steep. 
</P>
<P>
 FOR MORE INFORMATION: Contact Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve/Austin Creek 
State Recreation Area, 17000 Armstrong Woods Road, Guerneville, Calif. 95446, 
or call (707) 869-2015.

NORMANDY NOTES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Stavro should receive an "E" for Excellence for the outstanding story on 
the Normandy D-day beaches ("Stormin' Normandy," March 13). He paints a most 
descriptive picture of the region. However, if you are going to Normandy, visit 
the Museum of Peace north of Caen -- a world-class museum that tells one story 
of the beginnings of World War II.

 It was generous of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to accept blame "in case things 
went wrong." Lest we forget: In the forward to "Great Battles and Their Great 
Generals," Drew Middleton wrote, "The landing at Normandy at 1944 was a classic 
example of what the military call the 'set piece battle.' An attack on a known 
static position. Fortunately for the Allies, Field Marshall Montgomery, who 
commanded, excelled at that type of battle. After the war, both Gen. Eisenhower 
and Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, his chief of staff, told me that no one but 
Montgomery could have planned and won the battle."

 How impressive to see the pictures, the maps, the article chronicling the 
Allied invasion at Normandy and photos of the countryside. How serene is the 
"Normandy American Cemetery at Omaha Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 How unbelievably tasteless for L.A. Times editors to have such a feature 
commemorating the heroism of the 6th of June written by an author who proclaims 
that "I never wore a soldier's uniform -- one of my cherished mementos, in 
fact, is my student deferment card from the Vietnam era." 
</P>
<P>
 What reverence, what respect is instilled in the reader to know that the piece 
was written by someone who cherishes his escape from citizens's duty! Do you 
have any idea of the revulsion that fills a loyal patriot, a citizen with the 
courage to serve when called, a once-youthful male who valued respect and 
loyalty among his peers -- and still does?

 Barry Stavro's fascinating account was marred by the inaccurate photo caption 
that credited Winston Churchill for the floating artificial harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "D-Day: From the Landing at Normandy to the Liberation of Paris," 
edited by Bernard C. Nalty, the original plan for Mulberry was agreed to at the 
Quadrant conference in Quebec in 1943 and the design and construction of the 
piers and pontoons was carried out by several agencies and builders. Churchill 
may have had an idea or a wish for an artificial port structure, but he most 
certainly did not design it.

BLEAK HOUSE; AS PATIENTS DIED ONE BY ONE, A WASHINGTON D.C. HOME FOR THE 
MENTALLY RETARDED BECAME ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST DEADLY INSTITUTIONS. 
EVENTUALLY, FOREST HAVEN WAS CLOSED, BUT QUESTIONS LINGER ABOUT HOW THE NATION 
CARES FOR THOSE ENTRUSTED TO ITS PROTECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Murray Waas, Murray Waas is a Washington-based investigative reporter. He 
wrote this story as a fellow at the Alicia Patterson Foundation. Jesse Drucker 
and Jason Serman provided research assistance. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the early morning hours of Aug. 8, 1989, two detectives were summoned 
to the grounds of Forest Haven, Washington, D.C.'s institution for the mentally 
retarded "to investigate the report of a dead body." At the scene, they 
discovered the "body of a B/M (black male) . . . lying on his right side in his 
bed in a fetal position . . . ." Their report further related: "He was wearing 
a hospital gown and white socks with red stripes. . . . There was what appeared 
to be dried blood on his mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 The body was identified as that of Arthur Harris, a severely retarded young 
man known to his family and friend as Arkie, who had spent more than 17 years 
institutionalized at Forest Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long before his death, Arkie's family had celebrated his 22nd birthday at 
Forest Haven, 300 acres of wooded, campus-like grounds located outside 
Washington in suburban Laurel, Md. In one of the 22 cottages, many with 
pleasant-sounding names like Athelia, Dogwood and Camelia, they ate ice cream 
and cake and snapped photographs. But when it came time for them to go home, 
Arkie's older sister, Brenda, did not want to leave. For reasons she could 
never explain, she was filled with fear and despair as she said goodby to her 
brother. "We said we got to go, but she just stood there," recalls their 
mother, Gloria Mae Harris. "So I waited about a half an hour for her, and I 
went back in the ward and she's laying in the crib with him. She said, 'Mom, I 
don't want to let Arkie go.' I said, 'Honey, he's OK, nobody's going to hurt 
him here.' So she looked back and she busted out crying and she went right back 
and held him again. That's when I said 'Brenda, come on,' 'cause I was trying 
to be strong for her. But she kept crying and soon we both ended up crying, and 
I went back there and I said, 'He's fine.' She looked at him and said, 'I love 
you Arkie.' And he just took his hand to her face. She said, 'I feel better 
now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Arthur Harris would soon become one of at least 10 Forest Haven residents 
who, during a two-year period, died of complications related to aspiration 
pneumonia, an infection that can be caused by entry of food into the lungs when 
patients are fed while they are lying down instead of sitting up. 
</P>
<P>
 Those deaths, says John Dunne, the assistant attorney general for civil rights 
during the Bush Administration, constitute the deadliest known example of 
institutional abuse in recent American history. "Based on our various 
investigations around the country" says Dunne, "there was no other institution 
of any kind in America where so many people died from abuse and neglect over 
such a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate death toll at Forest Haven may never be known. The problem dates 
back at least 20 years, according to city records and interviews, when the 
population of the facility averaged more than 1,300. Yet the Justice Department 
and city only began to monitor deaths there between May, 1989, and March, 1991, 
while the institution was in the process of closing and roughly 200 residents 
remained. "There is nothing to indicate that there was a dissimilar rate prior 
to that," says Joseph Tulman, a law professor at the District of Columbia 
School of Law who worked on behalf of Forest Haven residents. "What we 
discovered in 1991 was only the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
 Social problems such as homelessness, street crime and drugs generate 
headlines, but less public attention has been focused on the often 
life-threatening conditions facing people living in prisons, mental hospitals, 
institutions for the mentally retarded and public nursing homes. Especially 
threatened are those left behind at institutions such as Forest Haven, 
forgotten as communities debate whether to maintain such facilities or to close 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Bray, an occupational therapist who has investigated conditions at 
facilities for the mentally retarded as an expert for the Justice Department 
and advocacy groups, says that Forest Haven is hardly unique and residents all 
across the country are still in danger of dying of aspiration pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 200,000 people in institutions who are immobile and rely on others for 
eating are at risk. Others such as the mentally retarded, high-risk infants, 
children and adults with developmental disabilities are also at risk," says 
Bray. "Part of the problem is that the parents and relatives of a good number 
of these people have long since forgotten them. So there is no one to make sure 
they are not neglected or abused." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department and private advocacy groups have sued state governments 
in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Oregon, Tennessee, Oaklahoma and many other 
states for violating the constitutional rights of mentally retarded residents 
of state-run institutions. In a number of cases, lawsuits have charged that 
residents had died unnecessarily from aspiration pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, a federal judge ruled that the State of Tennessee had violated 
the constitutional rights of mentally retarded residents of a state institution 
known as the Arlington Developmental Center. Among other things, the judge 
ruled that it was "virtually conceded by the state of Tennessee that 
psychiatric and psychological services were virtually nonexistent." Medical 
care, he found, was "below any minimum standard and well below the medical 
malpractice standard." A Justice Department expert in the case estimated that 
at least 25 residents of the institution had died of aspiration pneumonia, and 
that many of those deaths could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Green McGowan, also a Justice Department expert witness, says that the 
extent of the problem across the country has never even been exposed: "Someone 
dies of aspiration pneumonia and they (state authorities) will say they died of 
heart failure or respiratory arrest or that they stopped breathing. Everybody 
who dies has stopped breathing or their heart has stopped. And so the real 
cause of death is often not identified. What we have here are quiet little 
murders. They're killed one day at a time because people don't pay attention 
and then no one finds out the real cause of death." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say they believe that the story of Forest Haven is an example of 
what is to come, as municipal and state budgets become tighter, institutions 
face overcrowding and understaffing, and the public's attention is focused 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN ARTHUR HARRIS DIED, ONLY A HANDFUL OF FAMILY AND PEOPLE who knew him 
attended his funeral. The city that had been responsible for his care during 
his life concluded it was too expensive to pay for a tombstone, so his grave is 
designated only by a numbered metal disk. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Harris' death was the result of inaction by representatives of the 
government of the District of Columbia, the federal judiciary, the medical 
profession, advocacy groups and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was warned repeatedly over a 15-year period about the abuse and 
neglect of patients at Forest Haven, and specifically that aspiration pneumonia 
was killing them. But despite the warnings and a court order to improve 
conditions, the city government did nothing until it was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department civil rights attorneys presented evidence eight times over 
a period of 18 months to federal district Judge John Pratt, who was enforcing 
the court order, that Forest Haven patients were dying because of improper 
mealtime practices and substandard medical care. But Pratt did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical profession was also indifferent. One physician, according to city 
documents, provided substandard care to five Forest Haven residents who died of 
aspiration pneumonia. Another was allowed by the Maryland medical licensing 
board to continue practicing at the facility even after it suspended his 
license and declared that his continual practice of medicine would pose a 
"grave risk and imminent danger to the health, safety and welfare of the 
citizens of Maryland." Justice Department and city documents say he later 
provided inappropriate care to Forest Haven residents who died. 
</P>
<P>
 After most of the deaths, the U.S. Park Police, which had jurisdiction because 
Forest Haven is located on federal park land, were called to investigate. With 
their daily mission of policing the nation's national parks, they had little 
experience at probing institutional abuse or medical negligence. And so the 
cops did nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Haven is now closed, its doors shut on Oct. 14, 1991. But the story has 
not ended. Retarded citizens continue to die as a result of abuse and neglect 
by the city government -- in city-run group homes and in a municipal nursing 
home.

 A multimillion-dollar civil suit alleging wrongful death filed by the families 
of six Forest Haven residents is scheduled to begin Monday in a District of 
Columbia Superior Court. And perhaps there will finally be answers to the 
lingering questions about how so many people over so many years could have died 
at the institution, and how even though so many powerful people in the 
community knew what was going on at Forest Haven, nothing was done to stop the 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
 IMPROPER MEALTIME PROCEDURES CAN KILL IN A NUMBER OF WAYS, EX-Mary Bray, the 
occupational therapist. "There is a valve we all have called the epiglottis," 
she says. "The epiglottis opens and closes depending on whether you're 
breathing or eating. Under normal circumstances, the epiglottis closes off when 
you're drinking or eating, and it prevents food from going down in the lung," 
which eventually can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you're fed lying down, or too quickly, or a combination of the two, 
the epiglottis does not function properly, the consequence of which is food 
lodging in your throat or going down into your lungs," she says. If food or 
fluid builds up in the lungs, the result can be a fatal infection or 
asphyxiation caused when so much scar tissue builds up around the foreign 
material that the lungs can no longer function. Other times, as the person 
coughs repeatedly, trying to expel the food, he can choke to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Improper feeding and lack of movement can also cause potentially fatal 
gastrointestinal conditions, including one known as volvulus, in which the 
intestines become so twisted that they may eventually, in the words of one 
physician, "resemble an entangled telephone cord." The inability of the 
intestines to function can, in turn, cause the crowding of other nearby body 
organs, internal hemorrhaging or asphyxiation if the intestines pressure the 
diaphragm. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the 10 Forest Haven residents who died from complications 
related to improper feeding died in these ways, according to reports prepared 
by experts retained by the civil rights division of the Department of Justice 
and in internal reviews by the District of Columbia. Yet aspiration pneumonia 
need hardly be fatal. Only because the conditions went untreated, the medical 
reviews concluded, did the residents die. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTHUR HARRIS WAS 5 YEARS OLD WHEN HE WENT TO LIVE AT FOREST HAVEN in 1973. 
For the first years of his life, Arkie had seemed like any other little boy, 
except that he was developing a bit more slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a happy child, always smiling; it's just that he wasn't performing 
like my other children when they were born," Gloria Harris recalls. But she 
soon began to notice problems with Arkie, which she reassured herself at first 
were not serious. When he started to walk and play and tried to keep up with 
his two older sisters, his left leg would always drag, slowing the little boy 
down. And his left arm seemed to be "always in a clench." 
</P>
<P>
 When Arkie was 2, doctors told Harris that her son was mentally retarded, and 
she kept him at home, where he continued to receive medical treatment and 
therapy. "They prescribed glasses for him because his eyes, the left side would 
always go nearly in the corner," says Harris. "They were just cute little 
glasses. They had very thick lenses. And we used to always mess with them 
'cause we'd have to put them on him. And then he would always with his right 
hand take them off." 
</P>
<P>
 When Arkie was 5, a social worker warned Harris that her son would "have the 
strength of 20 men" when he was a teen-ager and be impossible to control. And 
not long after that, Arkie went to live at Forest Haven, taking only his 
clothes and a few stuffed animals, including his favorite, a green alligator. 
During her first visit to her son, Gloria noticed the alligator was missing. 
"They said it probably got knocked on the floor and the cleanup man probably 
put it in the trash, and I've never seen the alligator since." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, as a movement toward removing the retarded from 
institutions swept the nation, the now-defunct Antioch Law School filed the 
class-action lawsuit that eventually led to Forest Haven's closing. The 
lawsuit, Evans, et al. vs. Washington, charged that the constitutional rights 
of residents were violated because they were victims of inhumane treatment. The 
Justice Department joined the suit two years later as a co-plaintiff. Betty 
Evans, mother of Joy Evans, the name plaintiff in Evans. vs. Washington, later 
provided a sworn affidavit to Judge Pratt. "Dogwood, the cottage where Joy 
lived, was a veritable snake pit," she wrote. "I once witnessed a nurse open 
the cottage door only to find 80 half-clad screaming women come running to the 
door; the nurse quickly closed it shut."  
</P>
<P>
 She also described the constant physical abuse her daughter had been subjected 
to: "The more simple injuries ranged from chipped teeth to scratches, 
lacerations and bruises all over her body. . . . On one occasion we found Joy's 
entire back raw." The Evanses were later to learn the injury was the result of 
"urine burns from being restrained on a rubber sheet." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 14, 1978, the plaintiffs and the city agreed to settle the case, 
signing a consent decree ordering that Forest Haven would be closed and its 
residents moved to community group homes. In the meantime, they would no longer 
be subjected to "acts of physical or psychological abuse" and would receive 
proper "medical, dental, and health related services." (The consent decree came 
too late for Joy Evans, who had died at Forest Haven, at the age of 18, in 
July, 1976.) 
</P>
<P>
 Buried in the lengthy court order was the following promise by the city 
government: "No class member shall be fed in a position less than the maximum 
upright position consistent with his or her capabilities or handicaps." 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted 15 years later, Bob Catz, the attorney who initiated the Evans vs. 
Washington case and drafted the consent decree, explains: "There were a large 
number of people who were dropping dead like flies. What was happening was that 
way back then they were dying from being fed lying down, which caused them to 
eventually choke on their food. It was common knowledge. So we put the language 
in to require them to be fed sitting up." Unknown to Catz, however, aspiration 
pneumonia deaths continued. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1986, the District of Columbia Association of Retarded Citizens, 
which had been appointed by the court to monitor conditions at Forest Haven, 
asked an expert in developmental disabilities to submit a proposal for training 
Forest Haven staff to feed patients properly. The proposal, with a modest 
budget of $24,698, called for assessing the aspiration risk for each resident 
and training workers at the facility. But the expert, Karen Green McGowan, says 
she was told later that the proposal was turned down when the city said it had 
no funds for such a program. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that training, many well-intentioned workers fed residents improperly 
out of sheer ignorance. "Nobody ever instructed them that it was wrong to feed 
the residents lying down," says Bray, the occupational therapist. "The sad 
thing is that many of the workers were the only people in the world who cared 
about many of the clients." 
</P>
<P>
 I observed that mix of care and ignorance when I visited the institution in 
1990. A nurse lovingly washed a profoundly retarded boy, holding him in her 
hands, cleaning him, singing to him. ("From what you read in the newspapers, 
you'd think we're all monsters," she good-naturedly scolded me.) Later, while I 
still looked on, she fed the boy while he was lying down. 
</P>
<P>
 But even had there been proper training, a number of workers and medical 
personnel say that staffing levels at Forest Haven were so low that it still 
would have been all but impossible to feed residents in a responsible way. 
</P>
<P>
 When she visited her son at mealtime, Gloria Harris wondered why the staff did 
not sit up Arkie in his bed but spoon-fed him bits of food while he was lying 
down. At home, she had taken care to prop him up with pillows. But she was not 
one to question the staff procedures, often watching as a single worker 
attended a roomful of hungry residents. "I knew the nurses had their hands 
full," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Senior, a social worker who volunteered at Forest Haven, recalls that 
"it would take me 20 to 30 minutes to properly feed one (resident). A lot of 
workers were required to feed eight or 10 residents in that time. And it's made 
quite clear to them that they'll lose their job if they don't get all their 
people fed." 
</P>
<P>
 A constant source of wonderment for Harris was why her son was kept in a crib 
even as an adult. "But I figured that was the way Forest Haven procedures 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 It was difficult for Brenda to see her brother that way, says Harris. "When 
Arkie got to be 11 or 12, she could not stand to leave him there, and I 
remember when I took here there, she wouldn't want to leave. . . . She said, 
'Somebody gonna hurt my brother.' I'd say, 'No. He'll be fine.' And she'd look 
back and she'd just bust out crying." 
</P>
<P>
 On their final visit, Harris recalls, "We brought him half a sheet cake and 
had his name put on, put 'Happy Birthday Arkie' on it. There were a couple of 
children that came down there. We were having a ball with giving him ice cream 
and cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris knew Arkie was happy that day: Arkie and Brenda blew out the candles on 
the cake together. Then Arkie "turned around and patted Brenda's face, like 
that," Harris says, imitating her son's mannerism, "and that would show he's 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Gloria had trouble persuading Brenda to leave, it was only after 
Arkie once again patted her on the face that she agreed to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time of that final goodby, early 1989, the original target date for 
Forest Haven's shutdown had come and gone, with 252 residents remaining. 
Medical care and living conditions were so bad that the federal Health Care 
Financing Administration had taken the unusual step of cutting off $8 million 
in Medicaid funding for Forest Haven. The city, which could have continued the 
funding for months simply by appealing the decision, took no action to recover 
the money. And now, without this substantial funding, conditions deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 By now the civil rights case had been turned over to Joe Tulman. An intense, 
soft-spoken, bearded man of 40, Tulman was stunned by reports of inhumane 
conditions at Forest Haven. Convinced that the residents needed more forceful 
advocacy, Tulman called the Justice Department's civil rights division, where 
attorney Laurie Weinstein, alarmed about the Medicaid cutoff, recommended that 
the department become re-involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her first actions was to arrange a tour of Forest Haven with Dr. Robert 
Kugel, an expert on medical care of the retarded, who concluded in a report 
that "medical care and practice at Forest Haven . . . expose residents to 
unreasonable risks of harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, on May 2, 1989, Sheila Dabney, 39, a profoundly retarded 
Forest Haven resident, died suddenly, the first of three deaths over the next 
few months. Medical records indicated that the cause of death was related to 
either aspiration pneumonia or an infected bedsore that had gone untreated for 
such a long time that the infection had spread and killed her. John Schneider, 
a 60-year-old resident, was the next to die, and a city report concluded that 
"aspiration may have been a factor in the demise of the patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, on Aug. 8, 1989, Arthur Harris died, and the Justice 
Department asked Kugel to investigate. He concluded that Arkie had suffered 
from symptoms related to aspiration pneumonia since 1986, but no aggressive 
action had been taken to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city would repeatedly argue before Judge Pratt that nothing was 
wrong with medical care at Forest Haven, it had been monitoring care at the 
facility and had concluded in many instances that treatment was even worse than 
the Justice Department was alleging. 
</P>
<P>
 A city-sponsored peer review of the medical care Arkie received noted that he 
had apparently had many episodes of vomiting in the three months prior to his 
death. "The vomiting was so severe that (Harris) had dehydration," the report 
said, and at various times he was admitted to the hospital or Forest Haven's 
infirmary. His medical records show that between February, 1988, and August, 
1989, he was sent to D.C. General Hospital at least seven times to be treated 
for symptoms associated with improper feeding, such as upper gastrointestinal 
bleeding, vomiting and aspiration pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vomiting appeared controlled . . . but on June 28, 1989 . . . there was 
continued vomiting including a large amount of dark brown material. . . . On 
July 17, 1989, nurses' notes show (ashen) color, bluish lips, rapid pulse. . . 
. (This) suggests shock probably due to a massive GI (gastrointestinal) 
hemorrhage." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kugel, in his report to the Justice Department, concluded that despite all 
this, Arkie could have still been saved on the last day of his life if someone 
had called 911 and rushed him to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 A police report shows that more than six hours passed between the time medical 
personnel believed Harris' life was in danger and an ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:30 on the morning of Aug. 8, 1989, the report related, a nurse checked on 
Arkie and "noticed that Harris had vomited." At 8:30, the same nurse checked 
once more and Arkie vomited again, an event that did not alarm the nurse, who 
explained to the detectives "that any time Harris was moved he would vomit." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkie was finally examined an hour later by a Forest Haven physician who 
waited nearly two hours before writing "an order to have Harris taken to D.C. 
General Hospital." The nurse, the report says, contacted a local ambulance 
service "to arrange transportation" but was told they could not send an 
ambulance until 3 p.m. At 1 in the afternoon, the nurse again called the 
ambulance, and asked if "they could not make the transport sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 Around that time, the nurse noticed that Arkie was "choking and in some 
respiratory distress." She rolled him onto his side then noticed that "vomit 
(which) consisted primarily of blood and mucus . . . gushed from mouth and 
nose." 
</P>
<P>
 CPR was attempted, but proved futile. By the time the ambulance arrived, 
Arthur Harris was long dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Harris only learned about her son's death by happenstance, from a 
relative whose daughter worked at the facility. Panicked, Harris called the 
institution, eventually reaching a social worker. "She said, 'Mrs. Harris, I 
have bad news for you. I regretfully have to say he passed at 1:35 p.m.,' " 
Harris recalls. "My son could have died and nobody told me for months." 
</P>
<P>
 After the funeral, the nurse gave Harris Arkie's belongings: "There was a new 
pair of camouflage fatigues and two little stuffed animals. I told her that the 
clothes were not his, that I had never seen Arkie wear them. And those are not 
the stuffed animals I gave him. And I said, 'This is all his belongings?'; she 
told me 'yes.' And I still have it all in the same bag and a picture of him 
they gave him. I just left it in a plastic bag up in my closet." 
</P>
<P>
 The city paid for Arkie's burial at the Harmony Memorial Park cemetery in 
suburban Maryland. There, in the Garden of Eternal Rest, his grave is marked by 
a small metal disk engraved with four numbers, one in each corner, each 
signifying a different grave. Arkie's number, 174, in the upper right corner of 
the disk, indicates that his wooden coffin is buried in the area above and to 
the right of the marker. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the burial, the Justice Department filed a motion with Judge 
Pratt relating that "Dr. Kugel discovered that the medical records of all three 
deceased residents revealed an absence of appropriate medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with such evidence, the attorneys prepared for a hearing in federal 
court, where they would seek a contempt ruling and fines against the city for 
neglecting to obey the consent decree. They were confident that the dying would 
finally come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 THE COURT DATE SOON CAME. BUT LAURIE WEINSTEIN, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT civil 
rights attorney, hardly had the chance to make her case. Judge Pratt told 
attorneys for both sides that he had decided to review the matter in another 
120 days, telling them to try to work it out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein rose to object, but the judge was in no mood to listen. "Thank you, 
Ms. Weinstein," he said, gesturing that the court session was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulman noticed that Weinstein's eyes welled up with tears as she pleaded with 
the judge. "Your Honor, may I add something?" she asked. "I really feel that it 
is important to do something immediately about the situation currently at 
Forest Haven. The court monitor and our own expert . . . have found that every 
day the residents are out there, they are in serious risk of harm. Now you have 
just given them another 120 days of danger, and I really feel that we have got 
to do something better than that, Your Honor." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pratt had already made up his mind: "I appreciate your concern. Thank 
you," he said and recessed the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Five more Forest Haven residents would die of complications related to 
aspiration pneumonia before Judge Pratt held his next hearing on Jan. 12, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 11, 1989, Marcia Carter, 31, died of hypothermia and pneumonia, 
according to an autopsy report. Despite having been diagnosed with a disorder 
of the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature, and previous 
hospitalizations for hypothermia, Carter did not receive appropriate medical 
care for either condition, a Justice Department review found. 
</P>
<P>
 One week later, 22-year-old Joseph Hardy Jr. died suddenly from complications 
associated with aspiration pneumonia. Joe Joe, as he was known to his friends 
and family, was placed in Forest Haven when he was 3. Joseph Hardy Sr., a 
former police officer who visited his son almost every weekend, recalls that he 
often complained about the way his son was treated, but he was ignored: "They 
never moved him too much out of the position that he was laying in. His bed 
sheets sometimes were filthy," and he constantly had bedsores. "They were 
feeding him baby food," Hardy says. "They wouldn't even give him time to 
swallow what he had in his mouth. They would be pouring it in him like they 
were pouring water down his throat and it would all just come back out of his 
mouth and nose." 
</P>
<P>
 "From the (medical) record," says Kugel's report for the Justice Department on 
Joseph Hardy's care, "it is clear that this man had repeated episodes of 
aspiration pneumonia and many episodes of vomiting. He was hospitalized on 
several occasions because of these problems. . . . Obviously, the staff was 
aware of the somewhat fragile nature of this patient and the likelihood of 
acute gastrointestinal disorders." 
</P>
<P>
 Kugel concluded that "one is astonished to see how little attention was given 
to this patient on the night prior to his transfer to the hospital and 
subsequent death. . . . There is no evidence that any of the physicians stopped 
by to see him or were asked to see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kugel said his study of the death of Joseph Hardy was incomplete because he 
was hampered by "the lack of autopsy results." But the report concluded that 
his death was "due to acute bowel obstruction" or "volvulus." The report 
concludes: "Joseph Hardy died of inability to breathe because of twisting of 
the intestines." 
</P>
<P>
 After Joe Joe's death, the city paid for his funeral. "It was a very pretty 
casket he was in," recalls Hardy. "I'm not gonna lie to you. They dressed him 
up real nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue was Joe Joe's favorite color and Joe had asked the chaplain to find him a 
blue suit for the funeral. And there would be other funeral preparations as 
well: Because he had never received physical therapy, "his hands were like 
someone who had a stroke. Their fingers get real stiff and turn in," says 
Hardy. At the funeral home, they broke the bones of Joe Joe's hands, so they 
could be straightened, at his side, looking good and proper for viewing at the 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 9, 1989, the Justice Department told Pratt of the deaths of Carter and 
Hardy and asked him to more quickly consider their motion to have the city held 
in contempt. Pratt declined to move up the hearing date.  
</P>
<P>
 There were two more deaths in December. On the 8th, Mary Elizabeth Reeves, 35, 
died as the result of having suffered "volvulus of the intestine," according to 
an internal city report. Then, on the 17th, Willie Marie Gil, 21, died of 
complications related to aspiration pneumonia. At the time of death, she 
weighed only 28 pounds. And on Jan. 10, 1990, 20-year-old Walter Tolson died, 
also of complications related to aspiration pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report for the Justice Department, Dr. Renee Wachtel, an expert in the 
care of the retarded, concluded that poor medical care was responsible for all 
three deaths: "There was no investigation of the role recurrent aspiration 
might be playing in her respiratory distress," she wrote regarding Willie Marie 
Gil. And despite the fact that Walter Tolson was regurgitating an average of 10 
times a day just before his death and had "recurrent aspiration and GI 
bleeding" there was no medical intervention to save him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 29, 1990, Judge Pratt finally heard arguments about whether to impose 
sanctions. Dr. Wachtel's report, which had been presented to the judge, 
concluded: "Medical care and practice at Forest Haven is inadequate . . . (and) 
exposes (Forest Haven residents) to unreasonable risks of harm." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pratt praised the city, noting that it had reduced the number of residents 
from 1,300 in 1978 to a current level of 232. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most significant outplacement they've done is that they've buried five 
more people since the last meeting," Weinstein responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether they would have died anyway," Pratt told Weinstein. 
"These people . . . are not in the best of health probably, any of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, he issued an order concluding that although the district was in 
"consistent and continuing violation" of his court orders, he still would not 
make a final decision about sanctions until a March 1, 1990, hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Pratt declined to be interviewed for this story, saying he makes it a 
practice not to comment about cases over which he has presided and noting that 
his ruling and comments from the bench explain his actions.  
</P>
<P>
 The 83-year-old jurist, who won a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in World War 
II, was appointed to the federal bench in 1968 by Lyndon B. Johnson. His 
judicial trademark has been to press litigants to settle their differences out 
of court, an often complex and time-consuming process. 
</P>
<P>
 At the March 1 hearing, Weinstein argued that Judge Pratt should fine the city 
each day it refused to properly feed Forest Haven residents and provide 
appropriate medical care. Again he ruled against her. And the dying continued. 
Just a week before, a patient named Michael Pipkin, a city report would later 
charge, had died after having received deficient medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, Judge Pratt issued an order threatening the city with stiff fines 
if his schedule to close Forest Haven was not met, but he still refused to 
address the issue of medical care there. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the Justice Department once more petitioned Pratt to 
impose sanctions, entering into the record a report by Victoria Therriault, a 
registered nurse, who warned: "Meal times remain a nightmare in terms of 
aspiration risk . . . . I continue to be horrified at the feeding techniques . 
. . used by staff. The sound of coughing and choking permeates the area at 
mealtime." 
</P>
<P>
 But again, Pratt rejected the Justice Department's motion. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 14, 1990, a year and three months after its original motion charging 
the city of Washington with contempt, the Justice Department took the rare step 
of petitioning the United States Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus. The 
little-used legal maneuver asks an appellate court to compel a federal district 
court judge to adjudicate a case or make a ruling when the judge refuses to do 
so on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The petition related: "At least eight Forest Haven residents died between May 
1989 and January 1990 . . . . Yet the court inexplicably has refused to decide 
whether sanctions are necessary to force defendants to comply with its orders." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court denied the writ three months later, saying that not enough 
time had passed yet for it to take action. But the three-judge panel also 
commented: "Although we understand that Forest Haven is to be closed by 
September of 1991, we are cognizant of the potential risk to residents in the 
interim. Thus, we are confident that the District Court will act with all due 
haste . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 It took another two months for Pratt to hold a hearing to consider the 
contempt motion and request for sanctions. In listening to the arguments, Pratt 
was at a disadvantage because the city was withholding vital evidence it had 
obtained in its own investigation of Forest Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had, in August, 1990, provided Pratt with sworn affidavits from two 
top city officials denying that there was anything wrong with medical care at 
the institution. One of the officials said in the affidavit that "current 
medical and nursing services" were better than they ever had been before. Mary 
Tierney, a physician and an official with the city's Commission of Public 
Health, informed Pratt that "overall medical care and practice at Forest Haven 
is adequate to meet the health care needs of its residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither official was telling the full story. Indeed, Tierney had overseen an 
investigation that concluded that a single city doctor working at Forest Haven 
had provided substandard care to five of the eight residents who had died in 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Arthur Harris. The investigation concluded that despite nurse's 
notes since June 28, 1989, showing "continued vomiting of blood, decreased 
blood pressure and rapid pulse, which suggests massive gastrointestinal bleed," 
the doctor never ordered the blood test that would have revealed the extent of 
the internal bleeding that eventually killed Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 A month before Tierney entered her affidavit into evidence, the city had sent 
a letter of termination to the doctor, telling him they were firing him for 
"inexcusable neglect of duty." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators say that the city never alerted them to the 
investigation of the doctor, despite a request that the city keep them informed 
about medical care at the facility. And so when Weinstein and Tulman appeared 
in federal court, they had no knowledge of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although kept in the dark, they still argued that the only way to force the 
city to provide appropriate medical care was to impose sanctions. But Pratt 
once more told the lawyers that he did not believe their charges that poor 
medical care was killing Forest Haven residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are assuming a nexus between being in Forest Haven and dying," Pratt 
admonished Tulman. "There is not necessarily that nexus. In some cases, there 
may be, but you've got a number of people who are elderly, a number of people 
who are suffering from serious disabilities, whose life expectancy is 
completely different from that of the average member of the population. These 
people are going to die quicker and die more often than other people . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Tulman indignantly challenged the judge: 
</P>
<P>
 "All I'm saying, your honor, is if they put me in that bed and didn't move me 
every two hours, or if they put you in that bed and didn't move you every two 
hours, we would end up with a high chance of dying of aspiration pneumonia. It 
has nothing to do with mental retardation." But Pratt remained unconvinced: 
"You will agree that the reason they are there in the first place is because of 
mental retardation?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulman was now beside himself: "There was a case of a twisted intestine in one 
of the deaths. . . . If you go out and look at these folks, Your Honor, many of 
them have teeth that are gone. Why do they have teeth that are gone? . . . The 
reason these people's teeth are rotting out is that they're regurgitating their 
food constantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein warned Pratt that in the meantime, others would die: "People are 
getting sicker and sicker out there. . . . They've got somebody out there now 
who is bleeding internally. The best they can do about it is say, 'Golly, gee. 
She's bleeding internally.' . . . This court now has the power to do the things 
that need to be done. You have the power to keep people from choking; you have 
the power to make sure people get their medical care." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pratt closed the hearing by saying he would render a decision about 
sanctions against the city at some later, unspecified date. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 21, 1991, two weeks after the court hearing, Charisse Marcella Gantt, 
a 28-year-old resident of Forest Haven, died suddenly; the cause of death was 
once more aspiration pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 ASKED HOW SHE HAD COME up with such a beautiful name for her second child, 
Charisse Marcella, Sheila Gantt answers without hesitation: 
</P>
<P>
 "Romantic heart. I was always wanting to go to Paris. I don't know if I will 
ever go. So my oldest child's name is Paris Deseree." She gave her two youngest 
girls French-sounding names, too: Charisse Marcella and April Rochelle. 
</P>
<P>
 While Charisse was home, Gantt worked from 10:30 p.m. until 7 in the morning 
at the neighborhood post office: "That way I was home during the day to tend to 
her. I could still get some sleep during the day and still do for her. You 
know, feed her and dress her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a strong child. She tore up her crib. She would shake it. I was 
beginning to wonder how in the world I was going to contain her." 
</P>
<P>
 Charisse was sent to Forest Haven in 1967, when she was 5. "I could no longer 
lift her every day," Gantt recalls. "I knew she needed special attention. I 
thought that's what she would get." 
</P>
<P>
 Gantt had trouble visiting at first. "I was crying all the time. So for a 
while, I just got myself together and accepted the fact that that's where she 
was going to be. That she would be there and be OK there." 
</P>
<P>
 Charisse's roommate was another severely retarded girl, Christine. Even though 
they could barely speak, they still could communicate with each other "making 
little sounds sometimes," touching, playing. Charisse, always the mischievous 
one, came up with her own version of institutional bumper cars: "Charisse would 
fly her wheelchair into Christine's. Sometimes she'd run right into her and 
she'd laugh." Christine could barely talk, but Gantt could see the love between 
the girls -- "her eyes would be smiling."  
</P>
<P>
 When Christine attended Charisse's funeral, someone rolled her up to the open 
casket to view the body, but she refused to look. Gantt looked for some 
expression on Christine's face, but all she could see was emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Charisse Gantt died, the Justice Department filed yet another 
motion seeking a ruling from Pratt, asserting: "On April 21, 1991, a 
28-year-old resident of Forest Haven, who was otherwise in good health, died . 
. . due to aspiration (pneumonia and) the recent death indicates that medical 
care deficiencies at Forest Haven continue." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 15, 1991, Judge Pratt finally responded to the request made almost two 
years earlier by the Justice Department. He refused to impose sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 ON OCT. 14, 1991, FOREST HAVEN closed its doors forever, but the abuses 
continue for mentally retarded citizens in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet Judge Pratt's schedule to close Forest Haven in 1991, at a time when 
there were still not enough beds in the community homes for all the residents 
leaving, the city relocated 21 former Forest Haven residents into a city-run 
nursing home called D.C. Village, where conditions are little better than at 
Forest Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Tulman went into federal court and expressed fears that the abuses that 
went on at Forest Haven would now continue at other facilities, including D.C. 
Village. The transfer of residents to the nursing home, he asserted, was a 
means by which the city could evade the court order to deinstitutionalize, and 
in not abiding that order, the city was continuing to place the lives of 
mentally retarded wards at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 5, 1991, John Dunne, then the Justice Department's civil rights 
chief, wrote to Washington Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, charging that mentally 
retarded individuals had been improperly placed at D.C. Village and that their 
constitutional rights were being violated because they were forced to live in 
life-threatening conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mentally retarded residents of D.C. Village, Dunne wrote, were inappropriately 
drugged, physically restrained and were not receiving proper medical care. 
Dunne also charged: "Our consultants observed physical restraints . . . 
routinely fastened backwards, which places residents at the risk of 
strangulation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has since commenced a new investigation to determine 
whether neglect and substandard medical care might have contributed to some of 
the eight deaths of former Forest Haven residents at D.C. Village. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two deaths were the results of conditions associated with aspiration 
pneumonia, according to city records. Willie B. Reese, who had been 
institutionalized at Forest Haven at the age of 3, died on June 2, 1992, at age 
26. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, 24-year-old Donna Cook also died. A union grievance filed 
by a physician working at the nursing home charged that Cook's death was the 
result of negligence, alleging that "due to a lack of staff to monitor her 
feeding, she had repeated aspirations and died." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 2, 1992, the families of Arthur Harris Jr., Joseph Hardy Jr., Charisse 
Gantt, Mary Elizabeth Reeves, Walter Tolson Jr. and, later, Marcia Carter filed 
suit against the city of Washington, D.C., for the wrongful deaths of their 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Brown, a spokesman for the city, said he could not discuss the pending 
lawsuit or other allegations of improper care of the mentally retarded. But, he 
said, "We are concerned about the welfare of all the citizens we serve. It is 
our practice to provide the best possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Tulman had first come up with the idea of suing the city for wrongful 
death in 1990, after one of his many frustrating appearances before Judge 
Pratt. Tulman knew that juries often award plaintiffs in medical malpractice 
and wrongful death cases large monetary judgments. The prospect of the city 
being held liable for millions of dollars, he reasoned, might serve as an 
incentive to improve conditions at Forest Haven, and also provide some small 
measure of justice for the families of those who died. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tulman had a difficult time finding a law firm willing to take the case. 
What he had not previously known was that in Washington, D.C., unlike some 
other jurisdictions in the country, damages in wrongful death cases are largely 
limited to what would be the earning potential for the rest of the life of the 
person who had died. Since profoundly and severely retarded persons have 
little, if any, potential to earn money, Tulman was told that even if the city 
lost, there would very likely be no financial recovery. As one lawyer who had 
earlier been approached by the family of Marcia Carter to sue the city 
explained, "I could make as much money suing someone for the wrongful death of 
your cat as I could from suing the city for the wrongful death of Marcia 
Carter." 
</P>
<P>
 SINCE THE BEGINNING OF my investigation of the deaths at Forest Haven, I had 
been determined to understand how so many people could have died with nothing 
done to end the dying. I concluded that although individuals and institutions 
were responsible for what happened there, they, in turn, represented the city 
government, the legal profession, the medical profession and law enforcement. 
The ultimate, terrible truth is that these institutions reflect the values of 
the larger community. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nobody understood this better than Betty Evans. Her daughter, Joy, who 
died of aspiration pneumonia, was the name plaintiff in Evans vs. Washington, 
the lawsuit that ultimately closed down Forest Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pratt decree had been signed in 1978, Betty Evans declared the court 
order a vindication of sorts. But the following year, after finding that little 
had changed at Forest Haven, she wrote an angry, despairing letter to the 
editor of the now-defunct Washington Star. Despite the death of her daughter, 
Betty Evans now said, she only felt "relief that Joy no longer had to endure" 
the "indifference of the human race that moves through the streets, parks, 
houses and churches of the District of Columbia." An entire community was to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 From the 18 years of the Evans vs. Washington litigation, in the tens of 
thousands of pages of records, is a sworn affidavit, prepared for Judge Pratt, 
by Miles Santamour, a former special assistant to the President's Committee on 
Mental Retardation, describing a visit he had made to Forest Haven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Late one evening I visited the residence of a group of older women, all of 
whom were gathered in a large 'day room,' idly watching television or working 
on some piece of embroidery or knitting. As I circled the group, asking 
questions and explaining who I was, and why I was there, I began to sense the 
dominance of a large, matronly woman who had positioned herself on a couch in 
the center of the room. She watched my every move and as I began to leave, she 
summoned me back. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that all could hear, she began a series of questions to which she answered 
'yes' without waiting for me to respond. Are you from downtown? . . . Are you a 
big shot? . . . Are you here to see how bad we live? . . . Are you here to make 
this place better? . . . Are you going to get us out of here? -- at which point 
she turned to her assembly and began to laugh uproariously, almost 
hysterically, along with many of the other residents. My usefulness had been 
fulfilled, and without responding I left. Their laughter continued as I made my 
way out of the room and did not subside for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "These women had spent a lifetime observing the likes of me evaluating their 
situation and then disappearing with no meaningful aftereffects upon their 
lives. One wonders how many times the likes of me carried on similar 
investigations, how many 'big shots' from 'downtown' had been responsible for 
raising the hopes of these individuals, how many times they had waited for such 
visits to change their lives, and for how many people the changes had never 
come." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Santamour's affidavit was filed with Judge Pratt's court in April, 1977. 
The following year, Joy Evans was to die. Twelve years later, Arthur Harris, 
Joseph Hardy and Charisse Gantt would die at Forest Haven. Fourteen years 
later, the institution finally closed, but the dying has not stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering my own first visit to Forest Haven, I realize how little has 
changed, including the quiet rage.

PUMPED UP; DODGER CATCHER AND 1993 ROOCKIE PHENOM MIKE PIAZZA SPENT THE 
OFF-SEASON LIFTING WEIGHTS, BUILDING CONFIDENCE SO HE CAN WARD OFF THE DREADED 
SOPHOMORE JINX 
</P>

<P>
 MICHAEL JOSEPH PIAZZA'S EYES SMOLDER WITH DEFIANCE. HE GLISTENS from two hours 
of pumping iron, his cheeks flushed with adrenaline. Now, the final exercise. 
He scoots his sweat pants up to his knees. He steps his 220-pound, 6-foot-3 
frame onto a tiny metal platform in front of a mirror and rises on his toes to 
flex his calves. He gazes. He scowls. "Bird legs," he grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 For 23 minutes, Piazza, statistically the greatest rookie catcher ever, the 
most exciting Dodger since Fernando Valenzuela, works his calves with weights 
and leg lifts. He's pumping iron against the wishes of his father and his team 
manager. His voice is hoarse, concerned. "This is not for baseball . . . or my 
father. This is for me, the girls . . . the beach." Piazza eyes his calves 
again and sighs, "I have flamingo legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, OK, in Piazza's 25-year-old world of cyborg prowess and power, his legs 
must seem spindly under massive shoulders, biceps and forearms that bulge and 
ripple with a twitch, a flick of wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Those muscles produced extraordinary numbers in 1993. His 35 home runs are the 
most ever by a major-league rookie catcher. His 112 RBIs are third highest by a 
National League rookie. His .318 batting average led the team and was seventh 
highest in the league. Defensively, Piazza threw out 58 base-stealers, which 
set a Dodger record and was highest in the major leagues. He was named to the 
Associated Press and United Press International All-Star teams, and was awarded 
National League Rookie of the Year by the Baseball Writers Assn., only the 
ninth unanimous decision in the award's 47-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the strongest set of hands I've ever seen," says former Dodger catcher 
Mike Scioscia. "Piazza is so strong . . . so powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, Piazza is Robocatcher. Emotionally, Piazza is an intense 
perfectionist given to tantrums and smashing bats and helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Piazza is a hothouse tomato nurtured and cultivated by his father, 
a high-school dropout who parlayed a used-car lot into a $100-million empire. 
Vince Piazza, 60, deservedly self-indulgent, admittedly obsessive, shamelessly 
self-centered, boasts without hesitation: "It was me that gave Mike the tools. 
I'm living my life through him." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince decided that his son -- like it or not -- "was gonna play baseball." 
When Mike was 11, Vince fashioned a batting cage from scrap wood outside their 
first home in Phoenixville, near Philadelphia. Mike hit 200 to 300 balls each 
day -- rain, shine, sleet or snow. Aluminum bats shattered from the cold. 
Wooden bats splintered from Mike's growing power. Vince, in his euphoria, would 
whisper: "Dear God, is it possible?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vince left nothing to chance: Money, influence, his boyhood friendship and 
business dealings with Tommy I-Bleed-Dodger-Blue Lasorda, when necessary, to 
get his son into colleges, the minors and, eventually, the Dodgers. "Vince 
Piazza spends so much time on the field and around the dugout; he'd like to be 
wearing a uniform," says Johnny Bench, the Cincinnati Reds catching legend and 
Hall of Famer who covered baseball for CBS Radio. Young Piazza cringes at his 
father's incessant puppeteering. "Nobody really knows the bitterness, the 
adversity, I went through," Mike says. He quit the Dodger organization in a 
snit in 1990, claiming that he was being tormented because of Lasorda's 
perceived favoritism. After talking to Lasorda and Dodger management, he 
returned to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Piazza must face the improbability of back-to-back miracle years, also 
known as the second-year wheeze, the sophomore jinx. The jinx is well-founded 
statistically and a dreaded curse in superstition-steeped baseball. Consider 
this: Since 1970, 18 of 35 non-pitcher rookies of the year have dropped at 
least 17 points in their second-year batting averages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll see what this Piazza kid's made of," says Yogi Berra, the New York 
Yankee Hall of Fame catcher who has seen more than one rookie rocket crash and 
burn for lack of guts and grit. 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Johnny Bench: "This kid didn't get that power, that arm, put up those 
numbers, from reading his name in the newspaper." But he cautions: "The big 
thing mentally the second year is you're starting from zero. If you don't get 
off to a good start, well, I don't know what's inside Mike Piazza's head." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza ponders the 1994 season after a grilled chicken dinner at his parents' 
Valley Forge, Pa., home, where he spent much of the off-season. He wears 
designer jeans and T-shirt. His voice is firm. "I don't care about the 
sophomore jinx. I'm not impressed . . . just go out and don't give a s- - -. 
It's not the end of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses, nibbles warm banana bread baked by his mother, brushing crumbs from 
a weak Fu Manchu: "Life, sports, everything is relative. My first job is to 
catch. My priority is to be strong defensively . . . win ballgames, not just to 
duplicate what I did last year. My thing to do is to first help the ballclub 
behind the plate. Catching keeps my feet on the ground. In a strange way, being 
a good catcher helps my hitting, takes the pressure off me. I'm gonna do just 
what I did last year. This year I'll know the pitchers, be more relaxed, I'll 
do better. I know I can do it. My philosophy is, if it's not broken, I'm not 
gonna fix it. I'm confident in my ability and my work ethic." 
</P>
<P>
 PIAZZA BEGAN HIS CAREER HITTING BALLS AGAINST MATTRESSES IN THE basement of 
his home. Then his father built the outdoor batting cage. "It would get so 
cold, we would have to warm the bats and balls by the stove and wrap pipe 
insulation around the bat handles," Vince says. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince took other measures to enhance Mike's success. He strengthened his 
relationship with Lasorda, a boyhood friend in Norristown, Pa. He leased a 
building for a restaurant owned by Lasorda's three brothers and "put Tommy into 
a car dealership" in Pennsylvania. The car dealership, Vince says, was sold and 
Lasorda took a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dodgers visited Philadelphia, Mike was the batboy. When Mike was 16, 
Vince tracked down hitting great Ted Williams, who was visiting a town nearby, 
and drove him to the Piazza house to coach his son for an afternoon. After 
Mike's graduation from high school in 1986, Vince persuaded Dodger bullpen 
coach Mark Cresse to let Mike live in his California home for part of the 
summer and attend Cresse's baseball camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Vince for 20 years," Cresse recalls. "I did it as a favor. Our 
first objective was teaching Mike to play first base because he had grown quite 
a bit and it was a coordination thing . . . awkward. His body hadn't caught up 
with his legs yet. First base was the best place to hide him defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Piazzas turned to Lasorda to get Mike into the University of Miami, a 
top baseball college. "Tommy knew the coach," Mike recalls. "Tommy stuck his 
neck out to get me on. I couldn't fit into the program. I didn't even make the 
travel team. One of the things I did wrong was rely too much on Tommy. We put 
all our eggs in one basket. I should have gone to another school where I would 
have played more." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza was disillusioned, demoralized. "I asked Tommy to call the coach at 
Miami Dade North Community College. I became the starting first baseman there." 
</P>
<P>
 But near the end of the 1988 season, a collision split two knuckles and tore 
ligaments in Piazza's left hand. "I went home," he recalls. "My father asked: 
'What do you think about becoming a catcher? It's your best chance at making 
the majors.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Piazzas called on another Dodger, former catcher Joe Ferguson, now an 
assistant coach with the team. After a 10-minute tryout, Ferguson told Lasorda 
and the Piazzas, "The kid's got the arm. You can't teach arm strength. He can 
be a catcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza got a break in the fall of 1988, when the Dodgers used their 62nd draft 
choice on him. "It was a meaningless courtesy pick," Piazza concedes. "But it 
would look good on my resume." Vince offered to pay for his son's airplane 
ticket to Los Angeles if Dodger scouts would watch Mike hit and catch. Lasorda 
was warned not to meddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching to Piazza was an old friend. "Cresse helped me out. He threw me good 
pitches." Cresse remembers: "Didn't matter what I threw him. Piazza crushed 
me." The Dodgers offered a $15,000 signing bonus. "I was finally a professional 
baseball player," Piazza recalls with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Piazza had to learn to be a catcher. Lasorda called in more favors. Piazza 
was sent to Campo Las Palmas baseball academy in the Dominican Republic. Here's 
the rub: "This camp," according to Dodger publicity, "is dedicated to the youth 
of the Dominican Republic . . . " No Americans needed. Piazza became the camp's 
first American -- without the knowledge of Charlie Blaney, director of Dodger 
minor league operations.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep it low profile," Lasorda explains. "Blaney's got nuthin' to 
do with me. That kid had talent." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only place to go," Piazza says. He went home six weeks later, at 
Christmas, complaining of food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to spring training in Florida in March of 1989. "I got the flu. I 
didn't make the team." He was sent to the rookie-league Salem Dodgers in Oregon 
in June of 1989. "I started hitting. I made starting catcher." 
</P>
<P>
 He was promoted to the Single-A Vero Beach Dodgers in March, 1990, as 
first-string catcher. Piazza says he lost the starting spot in June, partly 
because he got mononucleosis. But the real reason, he insists, "was political. 
Coach (Joe) Alvarez didn't like my attitude. Said I was not rah-rah enough." 
Piazza says Alvarez ridiculed him publicly, daring him to call Lasorda. "I 
asked Alvarez why he was treating me like this. And Alvarez said, 'I was 
ordered to play with your head.' " Piazza threw a fit. "I was pissed off enough 
not to want to play baseball anymore. Screw it. I walked out and went home to 
pack." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, "Charlie Blaney called me and said what a terrible thing I had 
done by walking out." Lasorda called Piazza. Blaney called back. "He said he 
had a meeting," recounts Piazza, "and if I paid a $250 fine and apologized to 
the coach, I could go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls Lasorda: "I told them, 'I don't want you jerking that kid around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls Blaney: "It's true that Tommy didn't tell me Mike went (to the 
Dominican Republic), but Tommy's the major-league manager and whatever he wants 
to do is OK with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike in those early years was not a proficient catcher. Tommy was right on 
that one. No problem with me and Tommy on that one. I don't tell any (minor 
league) managers to play with anybody's head. Mike is still here and Alvarez 
isn't. I let him go at the end of the season. What happened with Mike is part 
of it. But Michael did jump the club after a game. Mike was trying to be his 
own man. I told him, and Tommy (told) him: 'You don't jump the club.' Mike 
realizes that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, who spent 10 years with the Dodgers, now manages the Lotte Giants in 
Pusan, Korea. "I was told by Mr. Blaney that Mike Piazza was supposed to share 
the catching spot. His father had one discussion with me. He said, 'I want my 
kid to play more. My kid should be getting more playing time.' Mr. Piazza was a 
gentleman, but I had a whole team to manage. I had to treat everyone equal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike considered himself a free spirit. He had his own ideas. I had mine. Next 
thing I know, Mike walks out, jumps the club, after a game. I called Tommy 
Lasorda. Tommy said, 'Joe, I'm not taking any sides. It's your club. You did 
what you had to do. I would have done the same thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez adds: "Maybe I made a mistake, but I did what I was told to do -- 
treat Mike Piazza like anybody else, an equal. Sure, four years later, Mike is 
Rookie of the Year. Hindsight is 20-20. Physically, Mike has all the tools. 
Mentally, I believe Mike is his own worst enemy. Time will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 After Vero Beach, Piazza went to the Single-A Bakersfield Dodgers, where he 
led the Dodger minor-league system with 29 home runs in 1991. The next year, he 
was promoted to the Triple-A team in Albuquerque, where he hit a team-high .341 
in 94 games. Suddenly, last year, Piazza got his chance. Scioscia, the popular 
veteran catcher, left as a free agent when the Dodgers refused to guarantee him 
the starting position. Piazza beat out two other catchers for the spot in 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 SPRING TRAINING THIS YEAR IS QUITE DIFFERENT FOR MIKE PIAZZA, superstar. He 
has just signed a $4.2-million, three-year contract, the second largest in 
baseball history for a second-year player. The first day, Piazza enters the 
batting cage trailed by reporters and curious Dodgers. Towering above the swarm 
is 6-foot, 6-inch Darryl Strawberry. During spring training, Piazza will bat 
third in the lineup, Strawberry fourth. They're going to be the Dodger power 
combo, in theory, when the team's season opens April 5 against the Florida 
Marlins. The Dodgers have been struggling the last two years because of 
Strawberry's missing bat, shaky relief pitching and an error-plagued infield. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda is optimistic this year as he watches Piazza and Strawberry warm up. 
Piazza smacks line drives. Then he hits two dribblers. Piazza talks to himself. 
Strawberry winces. Piazza blasts eight rifle shots in a row. Strawberry's eyes 
crinkle. He turns to the throng of reporters, faces upturned, pens poised. His 
tone is condescending: "With Piazza batting third, and me fourth, we'll have a 
real power lineup this year." Reporters scribble. Noses twitch skeptically. 
Last year, Piazza carried the batting order. Strawberry, suffering back 
problems, played only 32 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the clubhouse, Lasorda pulls on his skivvies and Dodger blue high-top 
socks. He announces: "Mike Piazza is one of the great success stories in this 
country. Here's a guy that nobody wanted. That young man had to go through 
quite a lot. People told me that I was wasting my time." Lasorda clenches his 
fist. His voice becomes a growl. "But I know my business! He's no fluke. He's 
got the best batting mechanics around. I begged our people to draft him. Nobody 
wanted this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his business dealings with Piazza's father, Lasorda says coolly: "Sure. 
He made money for me. So what? I put up money, but how much doesn't need to be 
public. Vince Piazza and I are close personal friends. If anybody should (get 
credit), it should be Vince. We should be honoring him. He was the guy who 
directed Mike, motivated Mike, worked with him every day. He taught Mike 
dedication, determination and discipline. This kid ain't gonna have no 
sophomore jinx. There's no such thing as a sophomore jinx." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeing with Lasorda in spirit is "Super" Joe Charboneau, a 1980 
rookie-sensation outfielder for the Cleveland Indians. A character, Charboneau 
dyed his hair red, white and blue, opened beer bottles with his eye socket and 
inspired a hit disco song, "Go, Joe Charboneau." He batted .289, with 87 RBIs 
and 23 home runs. He was out of the majors within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Charboneau now runs a baseball school in suburban Cleveland. "I was having an 
excellent second year in spring training," he recalls. "Then I dove headfirst 
into second base. I ruptured two discs in my back. I had injections and 
prescription muscle relaxers. I was medicated heavily. I knew when the season 
started I wasn't prepared. The Indians wanted me to keep playing. In those days 
they expected you to play. It ended my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Charboneau's advice to Piazza: "There is a Santa Claus, but there is no 
sophomore jinx. I don't believe in it. Just don't overtrain. I was a pro boxer. 
A lot of guys leave their fight in the gym, the weight room." 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbling Piazza this season has become the National League's cottage industry. 
"Now they're gonna go after him, looking for holes," says Yogi Berra. "Pitchers 
are gonna start working on him." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Pete Harnisch of the Houston Astros is typical. "Hey, Piazza doesn't 
have any big holes by any means. He uses a freakin' redwood as a bat. He hurt 
us as a team. He can ruin your day. I don't know if 'sophomore jinx' applies to 
Mike Piazza. But we have a plan, an idea, how to pitch to Piazza, but I'm not 
going to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Observes Dodger Coach Cresse: "There's no way to say for sure how Piazza's 
going to do this year. There's no sure thing. It's scary. Look at (Eric) 
Karros," he says, referring to the Dodger first baseman who was 1992 Rookie of 
the Year, when he batted .257 with 20 home runs and 88 RBIs. In his sophomore 
year, Karros' batting average fell to .247 and, although he hit 23 homers, his 
RBIs fell to 80. "He tried to live up to media expectations and didn't have the 
best year. I hope Mike doesn't do like Karros . . . all this media exposure." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza realizes mental toughness may decide his fate. "I've got to learn to 
keep it a game." Piazza is harder on himself than necessary. After a bad day, 
or a bad play, he might rant, rave, sling water jugs, slam batting helmets. He 
broke so many helmets on the road, when the team carries a limited supply, that 
the Dodgers became concerned. Once, Piazza made a bad throw to second and hit 
Dodger pitcher Tom Candiotti on the butt. Dodger pitchers wore paper 
bull's-eyes on the backs of their pants at the next game. Piazza wasn't amused. 
"Mike was screaming and cursing," recalls Karros, who shares a Manhattan Beach 
apartment with Piazza. "He takes it so personal, so serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Piazza learned that his girlfriend was accidentally denied 
admittance by Dodger security. "I broke bats, smashing things, breaking things 
against the wall," Piazza recalls sheepishly. "I ran through the underground 
tunnel screaming, swearing. I said some threatening things." 
</P>
<P>
 VINCE PIAZZA SLOWS HIS MERCEDES and points to the crumbling remains of a shack 
in a stand of trees. "That's where I grew up," he mutters. The son of an 
impoverished welder, he quit school at age 16 to help provide. He was an Army 
corporal in Europe during the Korean War. "Then I worked nights at the B.F. 
Goodrich tire plant . . . fixed up used cars during the day and sold them." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1968, he had amassed $35,000. Datsun was offering dealerships if you had 
$1,000 in cash for parts. Soon Piazza added Honda to his growing Datsun 
dealerships. Then came the fuel crisis of the early 1970s. Gas-guzzling 
American cars caused many dealerships to fold. Piazza swooped in and gobbled up 
choice bankrupt franchises and, more important, the real estate. "I knew 
American cars would come back eventually." By 1992, Piazza owned about 50 
dealerships across the country. He expanded into real estate and a computer 
service company, Phoenix Technologies, now with 66 offices nationwide. The 
computer business generated $200 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I had a couple armies (of money) behind me, I began to indulge my love 
of baseball," Piazza says. He sold all but 20 of his dealerships, raised $25 
million in cash, and for the last decade has tried to buy into the Pittsburgh 
Pirates, San Diego Padres and San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since rejection of his 1992 bid for part-ownership of the Giants, Piazza and a 
partner, Vincent Tirendi, have filed suit against Major League Baseball, 
alleging violations of antitrust, civil rights and contract laws. He also 
charges in the suit that he was libeled and slandered in remarks by 
major-league officials hinting that he has links to organized crime. Baseball 
officials have retracted those comments. Piazza is still furious. "My lifelong 
ambition is to own a team, but I won't allow those slurs to go unchallenged. It 
was an injustice." The suit is pending in federal court in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Piazza hosts lunch at the Westover Country Club. He owns the place. Snow 
blankets the golf course. The parking lot and modest dining room are nearly 
empty. Seated with Vince are five friends and employees, and Mike. The luncheon 
is to discuss the Mike Piazza College Scholarship Fund for high school baseball 
players. Three months earlier, Vince spent $20,000 for a fund-raising gala. 
Twelve-hundred people attended. The event netted $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince wears a custom-tailored black wool suit and heavy gold Rolex watch with 
diamond-encrusted dial. He dominates the luncheon in style and presence. Vince 
speaks, the table listens. Vince eats, the table eats. Vince laughs, the table 
laughs. Vince is ebullient, animated. "We can do this every year with the theme 
that Mike wants to give back something to the community." Heads nod. Good idea. 
"It'll be a natural for the media," Vince concludes. "We'll call a press 
conference every year." Heads nod. Good idea. Someone suggests awarding 
scholarships from the interest created by the fund so that it will be 
self-perpetuating. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince scowls and wags his finger. He doesn't want the money sitting in a bank. 
Everybody scowls. Bad idea. Vince decides to distribute the $25,000 immediately 
among four local high schools. Better idea. Quietly, Mike chews turkey and 
stares at his plate. There is an uneasy silence. Vince asks softly: "What do 
you think Mike?" Mike shrugs. He's concerned that if the coaches are allowed to 
control the money, they might play favorites, the media will find out and he'll 
get bad press. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince's eyes arch with alarm. "Mike's right on this. How we gonna protect 
Mike?" The table buzzes with concern. Vince decides coaches can't be trusted 
with total control so they'll have to share responsibility with the high-school 
principals. Terrific idea. Mike shrugs. "Sounds OK." Vince stands. The luncheon 
ends. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, Piazza heads for his alma mater, Phoenixville Area High School, 
to pay his respects. Today is the first meeting of the 1994 baseball team. His 
brother Tony is trying out for the varsity. "Nobody knows I'm coming," Piazza 
says. "Not even Tony." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why the secrecy?" I ask. Piazza sighs. "You'll see." 
</P>
<P>
 Autograph hysteria sweeps the high school. For nearly 30 minutes, Piazza signs 
hats, gloves, T-shirts, scraps of paper, balls, cards. His pep talk begins 
with: "Work your ass off . . . first one on the field, last one off . . . 
excuses are for losers . . . read every book on hitting and throwing." The 
coaches nod, smile. Piazza continues: "Sure, go out and drink beer. I did it. I 
partied hard, but I knew when to go home. Go out, party, but always be in 
control . . . keep your dignity." The coaches' smiles vanish. They stare at the 
floor. Piazza ends with: "Remember to be your own person and be in control." 
</P>
<P>
 The head coach, Doc Kennedy, holds up two color photographs of Piazza mounted 
on wooden plaques that are for sale at the school. "Normally, we sell (school) 
T-shirts to raise money for the team, but if we can't push Mike this year, 
there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza grimaces at the commercialization of his fame. Coach Kennedy turns to 
Piazza: "Is it OK if the players tell people if they buy a plaque, you'll sign 
it?" Piazza tries to hide his irritation. His voice is strained. "Well, I'll 
sign some of them." Coach Kennedy unscrews the plexiglass over Piazza's 
pictures and asks: "Could ya sign your name up the right leg on this one and 
across the chest on that one?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then Piazza autographs 30 blank cards, one for each student. "Coach says these 
are worth money," a player whispers. Piazza signs a poster on the bulletin 
board. After the meeting, two assistant coaches and students rush home for 
pictures, cards and magazine covers. Piazza signs autographs for another hour. 
As we drive away, he mutters: "Think what would have happened if they knew I 
was coming -- 9 million kids and parents with 9 million baseballs and bats to 
sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza shakes his head in disgust. "I can make $10,000 an hour signing 
baseball cards at shows. The promoters line the kids up and you can sign 800 to 
1,000 cards an hour and I get $10 to $15 a card. I did one show and it made me 
sick. I felt like a piece of meat with a pen. To sign an autograph strictly for 
money is a turnoff. It's not worth the hassle. I just don't like it. I don't 
want to do it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened is the value of my signature is really high. But it's a 
turnoff to see little kids running up to you with a handful of cards they want 
signed in certain ways to make them more valuable, and two or three baseballs 
they want signed on the 'sweet spot' to make it worth more." 
</P>
<P>
 PIAZZA IS HITTING BALLS IN THE basement batting cage in his parents' home. He 
has programmed the pitching machine to throw sinkers at 88 m.p.h. "Sinkers are 
designed to make you hit grounders." The balls come every 10 seconds from in 
front of a dull white, unlit wall. "I designed the backdrop to make the ball as 
hard to see as possible. When I go to spring training, the balls look like 
grapefruits." He blasts the next pitch high into the netting. "That ought to 
drive a run in." He smashes a line drive. "Hit to right." He fractures the bat 
on the last pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 It is his last night at home before spring training. He eats takeout pizza in 
the kitchen and regales his mother, Veronica, with stories of making a 
commercial for Topps baseball cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director was really interested in my ideas," Piazza says. He is relaxed, 
boyish with his mother. She is petite, attractive, quick to smile, but of few 
words. Piazza giggles. "It was so cool. The makeup people made a scratch on my 
face, jelly to look like sweat, like after a game. It was sooo cool. The 
director said to look tough -- walk toward the camera looking tough . . . like 
this." He glowers fiercely and strides across the kitchen, his powerful chest 
thrust forward. His mother forces a weak smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just how big is your chest?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty-six inches, I think." He pauses. "Mom, go get a tape measure." 
</P>
<P>
 He flexes while his mother measures: chest, 46 inches; biceps, 18 inches; 
forearms, 15 inches; waist, 33 inches; thighs, 25 inches. Piazza frowns. "My 
thighs could be bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost 9 p.m., time to leave for the gym. Tonight his muscle-building 
session is devoted to legs and thighs. "I spend four nights concentrating on a 
different part of my body," he explains. "One night, chest, triceps; then back, 
biceps; then shoulders and, finally, legs, thighs. Then I take a night off." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's father enters. He sees the gym bag in his son's hand. His face 
tightens. His voice is alarmed. "The gym again? Don't overdo the weights! 
You're doing too much! It worries me. You'll lose your bat speed! Please!" 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza glares at his father and leaves. In the car, he sighs. His voice is 
muted. "I love my father, but he pushes me too hard sometimes. I need the gym, 
the weights, for myself." In 1991, Piazza says, he went "ballistic for the 
first time" on weight training. "It was kind of addicting as I saw my power 
grow." His compulsion with bodybuilding also concerns Lasorda; bigger muscles 
can slow flexibility, bat speed. "I told him to lay off the weights!" Lasorda 
has growled. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's gym, Body Transit Fitness Center, is in Collegeville, 30 minutes from 
the Piazza home. It is 9:30. The gym is officially closed. Owner Marc Polignano 
stays to work with Piazza each night. "I have nothing but respect for Mike," 
the owner says. "He's where every professional athlete should be." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza hoists a barbell onto his shoulders and begins with 44 leg squats, 
slowly increasing the weight from 135 to 300 pounds. "He could probably do 350 
pounds," the owner whispers. "That puts him in an elite group." Next, Piazza 
does 34 leg presses on his back, pushing weights ranging from 350 to 625 pounds 
at a 45-degree angle. His face contorts. A deep, throaty, guttural growl bursts 
from his mouth with each pump. "Come on! Go, big man!" the owner whispers 
hoarsely. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's face glows. His eyes shine. "I was here New Year's Eve and Christmas 
Eve," he rasps proudly. During the two-hour session, he pumps iron some 253 
times on eight different machines to strengthen his hamstrings, knees, lower 
back. "Some guys don't have to do this," he grunts. "I think I do." He takes a 
breather. His chest heaves. "I do this for myself. It makes me feel strong, 
powerful . . . tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he goes to work on his calves . . . for the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 VINCE, HIS WIFE, AND FOUR OF their five sons, Vince Jr., 26, Mike, Tony, 16, 
Tommy, 12, (Danny, 23, is away at college) gather in their spacious, 
cathedral-ceiling living room of white Italian marble floors and black marble 
fireplace. Their trilevel, 12,000-square-foot house sits on a bluff with a 
magnificent view of the Valley Forge National Historical Park. The Piazza 
estate includes stables, caretaker quarters and a farmhouse deemed a national 
monument. George Washington slept there during the infamous winter of 1777-78. 
This lavishness is new to the Piazzas. Despite their wealth, their lifestyle 
was unpretentious until they moved to Valley Forge Mountain seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Over brandy at the living-room bar, Vince tries in vain to articulate his 
fixation with baseball, conceding that it helps explain his obsessiveness with 
Mike's career. He glances at his two oldest sons. He makes small talk until, 
out of boredom, they wander out of earshot. He leans close and whispers, "I 
really don't want to hurt my oldest's feelings but, the truth is, when Vince 
Jr. and Mike were kids, I looked at both of them and asked myself, 'Which one 
has the best chance of playing pro baseball?' Mike was younger, 11, but bigger. 
I chose Mike. I pushed and pushed that kid. I was relentless. When other kids 
were going to the beach, I dragged him to the ballpark. As he got better, I 
drove him harder." Vince's eyes mist. His voice cracks. "I know he's getting 
tired of me now." 
</P>
<P>
 It is 10:30 p.m. Tommy, the youngest, enters the living room. Lasorda is 
Tommy's godfather. Like Mike, he is big for his age. He has returned from his 
first skiing trip. His voice crackles with excitement. Vince smiles and listens 
patiently. Finally, Tommy sags. "I guess I'm gonna go to bed, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince brightens. His voice is upbeat. "Tommy, how about hitting some balls 
first?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy's eyes droop. "I'm kind of tired, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince's face and voice grow sad. "Aww, just hit a few, Tommy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy stares dully. "Geez, I'm really tired."  
</P>
<P>
 Vince is gentle but insistent. "Then we'll hit some balls tomorrow, OK son?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy sighs. "Yeah, I guess so. OK."  
</P>
<P>
 Vince stares through me. His eyes glitter. "Tommy can be like Mike. I can give 
him the tools."

 Tim Salmon is candid: "Mike Piazza's approach is totally different than mine, 
just as our lives are different. From here on, we'll take different paths. But 
I wish him well." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, rightfielder for the American League California Angels, and Piazza, 
catcher for the National League Los Angeles Dodgers, were unanimous Rookie of 
the Year choices in 1993 by the Baseball Writers Assn. Salmon, square-jawed and 
blue-eyed, reflects, "Piazza and I both identify with hitting the ball, but 
Piazza is really into bulk. He wants the power. 
</P>
<P>
 "He must feel he needs it, I suppose, because he's a catcher. I don't lift 
weights for the bulk. I don't need that bulk. I want to stay loose and limber. 
I'm concerned about bat speed. Maybe Mike isn't. But you can't second-guess the 
numbers he put up." Piazza hit 35 home runs with 112 RBIs and led the team with 
a .318 batting average. Salmon hit 31 home runs with 95 RBIs and a .283 batting 
average. Salmon, though, was out 18 games with a broken finger in September. 
Last month, the Angels signed him for $7.5 million over four years, the largest 
second-year contract in baseball history. Piazza's $4.2-million, three-year 
contract is second largest. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza and Salmon are statistical clones: They're both 25, born 11 days apart, 
and they bat and throw right-handed. Both are 6-foot-3 and weigh 220 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 They are just as dissimilar in their roots, their journeys to the Bigs, their 
lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Joseph Piazza: Easterner. Pennsylvania born and bred. Millionaire 
father obsessed with son's baseball career. Private batting cages. Professional 
grooming. Powerful allies such as Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy James Salmon: Westerner. Born in Long Beach, grew up in Texas and 
Arizona. Shunted between divorced parents of middle income. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey: 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza struggles early on. Flu. Food poisoning. Mononucleosis. Split knuckles. 
Torn ligaments. Difficulty converting from first baseman to catcher. Perceived 
himself victim of Dodger minor-league politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon progresses steadily. Named Phoenix's high school Player of the Year. 
Sets career records at Grand Canyon College with 225 runs, 51 home runs, 192 
RBIs. In 1991, played a full season with the Angels' Double-A team in Midland, 
Tex., hitting .245 with 23 home runs and 94 RBIs. In 1992, led all Pacific 
Coast League (Triple-A) outfielders with .992 fielding percentage. Selected by 
Baseball America and The Sporting News as Minor League Player of the Year. 
Named the Pacific Coast League's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifestyle: 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, single, lives in a Manhattan Beach pad. Into golf and heavy metal 
music. Favorite word is "cool." Favorite garb is $2,000 leather jacket he got 
in a trade for a baseball jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, married since 1989. Wife, Marci. Daughter, Callie. Into mowing his 
lawn at his home in Phoenix. A born-again Christian four years now.  
</P>
<P>
 Concerning the 1994 season, Salmon says: "I don't fear the so-called sophomore 
jinx. First, I don't believe in superstitions. Second . . . if it works, don't 
fix it." MICHAEL J. GOODMAN

LITTLE ROCK LAW; THE ROSE FIRM PROUDLY SENT FOUR PARTNERS TO THE CLINTON 
ADMINISTRATION -- AND IT'S FACED DISASTER EVER SINCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John M. Broder and James Risen, John M. Broder is a White House 
correspondent in The Times' Washington Bureau. James Risen is Times national 
correspondent based in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A shift in fortune was signaled, as it so often is, by the most prosaic of 
events. The phone rang.  
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Carroll, at 68 one of the grand patriarchs of Little Rock's legal 
community, was at home on a midsummer night in the affluent Heights 
neighborhood. He was the first to receive the news that would rock the rich, 
sheltered way of life enjoyed by partners at the Rose Law Firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 10 p.m., an old friend with close ties to the Clinton White 
House, federal appellate Judge Richard Arnold, called to impart the 
incomprehensible. Vince was dead. A suicide. His body had been found in a park 
in Virginia. Carroll could barely breathe. Vince Foster. Carroll had been his 
mentor and confessor, godfather to his eldest son. Dead by his own hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Rose partner George E. Campbell's phone rang. It was Ann 
Pincus, a Little Rock native, wife of a Washington Post reporter and lifelong 
friend of Campbell's wife, Joan. Pincus had attended a Washington dinner party 
for David Gergen during which the presidential counselor received an urgent 
call from the White House with the awful news. 
</P>
<P>
 It was July 20, 1993, and deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster Jr., 
48, once the soul and spine of the Rose Law Firm, boyhood friend of the 
President and close confidant of former Rose partner Hillary Rodham Clinton, 
had apparently committed suicide with an antique .38 Colt revolver in an 
isolated park overlooking the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the Washington-Little Rock nexus of lawyers and politicians went 
into action. The news spread across the network like a cascading wave. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Kennedy III, now White House associate counsel and former chief 
operating officer at Rose, quickly called several of his former colleagues at 
the firm. Trying to learn more about Foster's death, Carroll sought the 
Washington home number of Webster L. Hubbell, also a former senior partner at 
Rose and then the No. 3 official at the Justice Department, who was in a key 
position to monitor the Foster investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Washington, Foster's boss, White House counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum, 
was searching Foster's modest office in the West Wing, looking for a suicide 
note or a blackmail demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he say anything?" a bewildered Nussbaum kept asking himself as he riffled 
through papers on Foster's desk. Nussbaum, the New Yorker who had made a 
fortune on Wall Street in the 1980s putting together corporate mergers, was out 
of his element when confronted with violent death, and his amateurish handling 
of Foster's suicide deepened suspicions that the White House was trying to 
conceal some hidden scandal involving the First Family.  
</P>
<P>
 Not until six days later did a White House lawyer find a torn-up suicide note 
in the bottom of Foster's briefcase. It hinted at dark conspiracies by the FBI, 
the media and Republicans to destroy the Clintons and everything they were 
trying to accomplish. Foster, in a restrained but anguished cry, wrote that he 
"was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here, 
ruining people is considered sport." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most traumatic, unfathomable and searing event of the Clinton 
presidency. Why was Foster -- whom the President described as the "Rock of 
Gibraltar," the man once anointed to guide the Rose Law Firm into the next 
century, the man people in trouble turned to for help -- dead at the pinnacle 
of his career? 
</P>
<P>
 That question remains unanswered. But what is clear is that in the wake of 
Foster's death, the prosperous and peaceful life of Little Rock's Rose Law Firm 
has been shattered. Foster's death has immersed the firm in the rapidly 
unraveling Whitewater scandal, a tale of Arkansas banking and real estate deals 
gone bad and the White House's clumsy efforts to contain the continuing damage. 
It set in motion a series of events that subjected Rose's 59 lawyers to 
unaccustomed stress. That pressure now appears to threaten an implosion of the 
oldest law firm west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the firm's response to the harsh glare of national scrutiny has 
turned into an ugly internal blood bath. On March 14, Hubbell resigned from his 
job at the Justice Department amid charges that he improperly billed as much as 
$100,000 in personal expenses to the firm while he was a partner. The Rose 
investigation of Hubbell was only tangential to the Whitewater probe, but "It's 
Whitewater that created the climate, that gave the dissidents in the firm the 
opportunity to go after Hubbell," observes one source close to Hubbell.  
</P>
<P>
 There is bitter talk, especially among the younger generation of Rose 
attorneys now taking control, of the tarnished legacy bequeathed them, and they 
are trying to distance themselves from Hillary Clinton and her departed 
cronies. In mid-March, Rose partners voted to file charges against Hubbell with 
the Arkansas Supreme Court ethics division. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Rose has become the favorite target of every conservative 
conspiracy theorist in America, assuming the secret-villain mantle once 
reserved for the Trilateral Commission. The firm has been portrayed by Clinton 
critics, most often in the Wall Street Journal, as a secretive fortress at the 
center of political and economic life in Arkansas that has now extended its 
sinister influence into the highest reaches of the federal government. Hubbell 
and Hillary, assisted by the aggressive but shadowy Kennedy and Foster, 
surreptitiously took over the government to advance their hidden agenda of 
federal intervention into every cranny of American life, according to this 
view. The firm, playing on its capital connections, added a tentacle by sending 
partner Allen W. Bird II to open a Washington office last fall, feeding the 
suspicions of the conspiracy theorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is more mundane but in some ways more profound. The lawyers of the 
Rose firm became entangled in the careers of the Clintons mainly by the 
accident of Foster's birth in Hope, Ark., and by a rising politician's wife's 
need for a job in 1977. But the lives of these 59 people have now become 
hostage to the consequences of the Clintons' actions and to the President's 
past business dealings with a two-bit real estate investor and S&L operator 
named James B. McDougal.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the four Rose partners who assumed major roles in Washington after Bill 
Clinton's election, one is dead, a second has resigned, and a third, Kennedy, 
is under scrutiny for nonpayment of taxes for a nanny. The fourth, Hillary 
herself, is caught squarely in the middle of Whitewater, her effectiveness as 
an advocate for health care reform and other legislative efforts increasingly 
in doubt.  
</P>
<P>
 No one could have predicted when Rose hired Hillary Clinton that, 17 years 
later, the firm's reputation would be hanging by a thread, a 174-year-old 
institution facing oblivion because of a rotten little land deal.  
</P>
<P>
 UNTIL THEN-GOV. BILL CLINTON OF ARKANSAS ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDAcy for the 
presidency at the end of 1991, the Rose Law Firm was little known outside the 
region. The firm, whose partners only recently gave up the Old South style of 
seersucker suits and white buck shoes in summer, never recruited from farther 
away than Tennessee or Texas. While its ambitions were to be an important 
regional legal player, it never acquired the stature of larger and 
better-connected firms in Memphis, Houston and Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, its partners enjoyed whatever luxuries Little Rock had to offer -- 
gracious old homes or newer mini-mansions, the golf course and large swimming 
pool of the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock, expensive cars, civilized 
working hours and close association with the small circle of Arkansas leaders 
who wield true political and financial power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton candidacy brought national focus on Rose because of Hillary's 
employment there, but it has not been the attention the firm would have wished. 
Beginning early in the campaign, Rose was the subject of hundreds of news 
stories and dozens of rumors about potential conflicts of interest, the sale or 
purchase of political influence, and office intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Rose, the pressure has only gotten worse in the months since Foster's 
death. At first, many tried to rally around Lisa Foster, Vince's widow, when 
she moved back to their white-pillared home in the Heights with her three 
children. But now, like barracudas in an overcrowded tank, Rose lawyers have 
begun to turn on each other and their former colleagues. These were just the 
latest and most overt signs of the poisonous climate at Rose. Even longstanding 
friendships within the firm have been eroded by Whitewater. Senior Rose 
partners Herbert C. Rule III and W. Wilson Jones have practiced together for 
more than 20 years and consider themselves the best of friends. But during a 
joint interview, Jones repeatedly interrupted whenever Rule drifted into a 
discussion of the effects of Whitewater on the firm. "I thought we agreed we 
weren't going to talk about that," Jones upbraided Rule more than once, his 
voice growing edgier each time. Asked later about the evident tension, Rule 
dismissed it as "the bickering of an old married couple."  
</P>
<P>
 Many in the firm grumble that the price the remaining lawyers are paying for 
their association with the Clintons is far too high and the rewards far too 
low. True, another former Rose lawyer, Richard B. Steinkamp, has just found a 
home in the Clinton Administration, recently named general counsel of a new 
oversight board for federal mortgage financing agencies. Yet the White House 
connection has done little for Rose's new Washington office; the firm's name is 
now radioactive in a city where clients looking for political pull don't like 
to read about their lawyers and lobbyists in lurid newspaper headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the remaining partners are loath to express such a view publicly, in 
conversations one hears an undercurrent of resentment at the Clintons and their 
pals for robbing Rose of a lucrative obscurity, for bringing its lawyers' 
integrity into question, for the loss of the beloved Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rely heavily on our reputation, which until recently has been 
untarnished," says Chief Operating Officer Ronald M. Clark, weighing his words 
judiciously, trying to mask his bitterness at being forced to deal with 
insatiable federal authorities and prying media. "Here we are defending stuff 
that took place six or eight years ago and which most of us know absolutely 
nothing about. A lot of us here complain that when you speak of 'the firm,' 
you're talking about an entity. But we're all individuals, and I knew nothing 
about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is our 15 minutes of fame," the 39-year-old tax specialist laments, 
"I'd just as soon it end." 
</P>
<P>
 The tribulations of the Rose Law Firm have caused few tears to be shed in the 
inbred legal community of Little Rock. Oh sure, there are the ritual 
expressions of sympathy for Foster's widow and the clucking of tongues over the 
breathless media coverage. But beneath a veneer of Southern manners there is 
barely disguised glee at the decline of a collection of lawyers whom many of 
their competitors consider arrogant, aloof and overrated. "They're nothing 
special, just another Little Rock law firm with big pretensions," says one 
attorney in a small Little Rock partnership. He adds that a lawyer will chide 
any colleague who grows full of himself by saying, "Now don't go acting like a 
Rose firm lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal competitors are quick to pounce on the latest allegation about Rose and 
brag about the cases they won or clients they stole from the powerhouse on East 
Fourth Street. Always on background, of course; Little Rock is a small town, 
and it's not polite to cut up your fellow country club members on the record. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the country club locker room to the barroom of the Capital Hotel, 
wherever Little Rock's lawyers gather, Rose and Whitewater are the hottest 
topics. Rumors abound about who's been subpoenaed and what records have been 
shredded. Some of it is just politics, old enemies of the Clintons getting 
even. Some is the old-fashioned delight in the misfortunes of the better-off; 
the Rose firm traditionally was among Little Rock's most profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, what the Rose firm is going through today mirrors Foster's 
transformation last year, when he surrendered a privileged and private 
existence in Little Rock to serve in Washington at the behest of the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 After arriving at the White House, the taciturn and tightly wrapped Foster was 
quickly bombarded by crises of a sort he had never encountered in Little Rock, 
from battles over controversial Clinton appointments to the botched firing of 
the White House travel staff. He was painted as part of the insidious Rose 
cabal in Washington. He worked harder under more pressure and with more painful 
results than he ever had in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 A corporate litigator from a quiet Southern town who some former colleagues 
believe initially saw a White House job as the answer to his midlife crisis and 
growing restiveness as a lawyer, was thrust into a political hurricane for 
which he was dramatically ill prepared. And whether because of these pressures, 
some unbearable secret or, as many of his friends believe, an undiscovered 
medical event that triggered his suicidal depression, he snapped and ended his 
life six months to the day after Clinton was inaugurated.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have all been trying to understand what happened to Vince ever since," 
says Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the effects found in Foster's White House office were a dim 
black-and-white photo of Foster and Bill Clinton in kindergarten and a thin 
manila file folder labeled "Whitewater," which contained tax records and other 
documents relating to the Clintons' Ozark Mountain real estate deal. Nussbaum, 
considering it the personal legal business of the Clintons, forwarded it to 
their private attorney in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 When it was revealed that Nussbaum removed Whitewater-related papers from 
Foster's office while holding at bay police officers investigating the death, 
the political equivalent of hell broke loose for the Clintons, raising the ugly 
specter of a White House cover-up. That finally forced the White House in 
January to accede to the appointment of a special counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., 
a veteran New York prosecutor who has set up shop in Little Rock.  
</P>
<P>
 Rose falls under Fiske's scrutiny because Hillary Clinton and the firm 
represented James McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan in front of state 
regulators appointed by her husband in an attempt to shore up the foundering 
thrift. Four years later, in an unrelated matter, Rose solicited legal business 
from federal regulators and was hired to sue Madison Guaranty's auditors for 
negligence; that case has raised allegations of a conflict of interest because 
of Hillary's earlier representation of Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose partner Bird represented Hillary Clinton in a Whitewater-related land 
transaction. And Foster also acted as the Clintons' personal lawyer in dealing 
with Whitewater, at least in the later stages, and handled the 1992 sale of 
their share of the venture. There have also been hints, from Rose partners and 
federal investigators, that the firm's lawyers handled far more Whitewater 
transactions than have been publicly acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm first felt the effects of notoriety during the 1992 presidential 
race, when its most famous partner took a leave of absence to campaign for her 
husband. Rose hired security guards after catching reporters pawing through 
their trash and snooping around their document storage facility. The firm also, 
for the first time, bought a shredder to destroy confidential documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention during the campaign was nothing compared to the floodlights now 
shining on the firm. Its elegantly appointed offices -- which include a 60-foot 
basement swimming pool, salvaged from the building's days as a YWCA -- have 
been visited by agents of the FBI, the Resolution Trust Corp., the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Department of Justice. At least a dozen times a 
day, reporters from as far away as London and Australia call with questions 
about Whitewater and the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent visit to the firm, a reporter observed half a dozen boxes of files 
relating to Whitewater being wheeled down the bird's-eye-maple-paneled 
hallways, being prepared for submission under subpoena from Fiske.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not in my wildest dreams would I have imagined what has happened," says 
George Campbell, at 61 one of the firm's elder statesmen. He contends that the 
Rose firm is "an innocent bystander who happens to be around when politicians 
are slinging mud at each other." He believes that the firm's name and 
reputation will be vindicated, but the effects of the trauma will linger.  
</P>
<P>
 "If there's an insight I've gained from all this, it's about the pain involved 
in national politics," Campbell says, sitting primly on a sofa in his office. 
"There are people who spend every waking moment trying to tear somebody else 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 NO ONE OUTSIDE ARKANsas' legal community would ever have heard of the Rose Law 
Firm if Vince Foster had not walked into then-Chief Operating Officer C. Joseph 
Giroir Jr.'s office one day in 1976 and urged him to hire a sharp young law 
professor he knew, 29-year-old Hillary Rodham. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham was then teaching at the University of Arkansas Law School in 
Fayetteville, where Foster, an alumnus, often handled recruiting for the Rose 
firm. Hillary was moving to Little Rock because her husband had just won the 
Democratic primary for state attorney general. For Rose, it seemed like a 
fortuitous match; Bill Clinton was clearly on the way up in politics, and 
Hillary was going with him. Giroir recalls that the firm, which at the time 
only hired two or three associates a year, was not trying to fill an opening. 
Rose just made a slot for Hillary. "We had a policy that if we found someone we 
really wanted, we would go after them," says Giroir.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, partners refuse to voice regret at Hillary's hiring. Those who played a 
role say one of the only concerns expressed at the time was whether her 
marriage might force the firm to turn away some state business because of 
potential conflicts of interest. Others worried that Little Rock was not ready 
for a "lady lawyer," particularly a feminist Northerner educated at Wellesley 
and Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary was a liberal woman in a staid, Southern white-male-dominated firm 
that had been founded before Arkansas was granted statehood, a firm that did 
not hire its first black attorney until 1988. (It currently has none.) 
Ultimately, she would bring high-profile politics into a corporate law firm 
that shunned publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary was naturally drawn to Vince Foster, then only 32 but already 
considered a major asset at the firm because of his legal skills and attention 
to detail. One of the leading civil trial attorneys in the city, "He won by 
following the rules," observes one former colleague. Older clients liked his 
discretion and his ability to cut to the heart of a legal problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger associates referred to him as "Vince the Knife," for his legal acuity 
and for his cool, assassin-like manner that could wilt a witness or an 
underachieving associate. He developed a reputation within the firm for 
moodiness, temperamental behavior and even extended spells of silence. Former 
colleagues say that for one 18-month stretch, he refused to talk to his 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 His austere demeanor could intimidate those around him. Kennedy, a recent hire 
at the firm, was transferred out of the litigation department because he and 
Foster, his supervisor, couldn't get along, Rose sources say. The two later 
came to terms as Kennedy, a Pine Bluff, Ark., native, proved his worth by 
billing more hours than any other Rose lawyer for several consecutive years.  
</P>
<P>
 Webb Hubbell, who followed Foster as managing editor of the University of 
Arkansas Law Review and joined the firm two years after his older friend, also 
became part of Rose's inner circle. Hubbell was Foster's fun-loving opposite, a 
beefy former Arkansas Razorback lineman who was as outgoing as Foster was 
reserved. His minor football fame was a draw in a state where the Hogs rule, 
but former associates say that Foster's brain and Kennedy's prodigious capacity 
for work brought in a lot more revenue. (Clinton, Hubbell and Kennedy all 
declined to be interviewed for this article.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, consciously sought to keep her head down, shying 
away from highly visible cases that could raise questions about her 
relationship to the attorney general who would later become governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Rock lawyers and reporters on the legal beat say that in her 15 years 
in the Rose firm's litigation section, she was seldom seen in court, preferring 
to find a way to settle disputes outside the glare of public pleading. One 
attorney who opposed her on a commercial matter in the late 1980s said that 
Hillary led him to believe that she wanted a trial, but on the eve of their 
court appearance she called to offer a settlement "on very favorable terms to 
our side. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very worried about a high-profile loss. She had to take politics into 
account on each matter," says the attorney, who worked at Rose for several 
years and now is at another Little Rock firm. He asked not to be identified 
because the Little Rock local legal community is so small. "She was afraid to 
tie it up and go to court. She ended up settling most matters."  
</P>
<P>
 Even her supporters at Rose say Clinton was less than a full-time lawyer, 
having to attend to state business, service on corporate boards, political 
campaigns and a variety of public advocacy pursuits. Her pay reflected her 
relatively modest contributions to the firm's bottom line -- just over $100,000 
a year when many of her contemporaries were making twice that or more. Her pay 
was also reduced because she did not take a share in work done by Rose on 
behalf of the state government, mostly the handling of the sale of state bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 She was missing so often that former Chief Operating Officer Giroir says she 
was often assigned to assist Foster. "We couldn't give her a full load of cases 
because we were never sure she would be around to handle them," Giroir says. 
Indeed, in 1982, Hillary Clinton had to turn down Giroir's offer of a promotion 
to become administrative partner, which would have given her significant 
management duties in the firm; she was interested in the post, but she was too 
busy that year helping her husband launch his bid to regain the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite her efforts to keep a low profile, Hillary Clinton still entered 
into some business arrangements that gave rise to potential conflicts. The firm 
developed its own ethics guidelines in the mid-1980s that were supposed to 
limit partners' business dealings with firm clients, but those guidelines were 
apparently informal.  
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Clinton didn't refrain from mixing business and legal work. For 
example, she sat on the board of directors of two major Rose clients, TCBY 
Enterprises, the yogurt franchise, and Wal-Mart Stores. Her most serious 
potential conflict, of course, came from the fact that she represented Madison 
Guaranty at the same time that she was in business with its chairman, James 
McDougal. Most troubling of all was that while she had other firm partners 
handle work for Whitewater, she apparently did not disclose her business 
relationship with McDougal to the firm's COO. "I never knew that she was in 
business with him," says Giroir. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no denying that her departure, along with those of Foster, 
Hubbell and Kennedy, took a heavy toll on the remaining partners. One legal 
competitor refers to the firm today, with its senior management gutted and its 
legal expertise and political connections sorely missed, as "Home Alone III."A 
HUNDRED MILES OR SO north of Little Rock, down the road from the Ozark village 
of Yellville, are the 240 acres of land along the White River that the Clintons 
and James and Susan McDougal bought amid dreams of real estate riches. Oddly, 
it was along this same river more than 150 years ago that one of the founders 
of the Rose firm first brought the partnership into disrepute and caused its 
temporary demise. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1832, 12 years after forming the partnership that grew into the Rose Law 
Firm, Robert Crittenden decided that Little Rock could not contain his 
ambitions. He tried to unseat the incumbent delegate from the Arkansas 
territory, Henry W. Conway, but the campaign deteriorated into a bitter 
exchange of insults and a challenge to a duel, which left Conway mortally 
wounded, Crittenden disgraced and the law partnership with Chester Ashley 
disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm was re-established in 1837 -- without the trigger-happy Crittenden 
but with its political yearnings intact. Ashley went on to the U.S. Senate, 
where he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. His new partner, George 
Watkins, later became chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm adopted its current name in 1865 with the addition of noted jurist 
U.M. Rose, a founder and later president of the American Bar Assn. A 
"Northerner" from Kentucky who arrived in Arkansas on a Mississippi riverboat, 
he was a linguist, legal scholar and diplomat who was cited by Supreme Court 
Justice Felix Frankfurter as an important early influence. Rose family members 
were associated with the firm until the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the partnership was a breeding ground for Arkansas' political 
and legal elite, producing six members of the state Supreme Court, dozens of 
state legislators and officers of the state bar association. But the past 
decade has been unquestionably one of the most traumatic periods in the firm's 
history. Just as the rise of Hillary Clinton and her colleagues increased the 
firm's political profile throughout the 1980s, Joseph Giroir sought to 
radically transform the firm's relationship with the Arkansas business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Giroir never quite fit the Rose image. A small, dapper man partial to flashy 
suits and custom-made shirts, he considered himself half businessman, half 
lawyer. Yet his vision of turning Rose into an entrepreneurial player in 
mergers and acquisitions throughout the region ultimately collided with the 
firm's conservative traditions. "The firm almost came apart over Giroir," says 
one Rose partner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Giroir's major lender, First South Savings & Loan, was taken over by 
regulators from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., funding for his 
personal ventures suddenly dried up. In 1986, the agency not only cut off 
Giroir's line of credit, it seized $12 million in assets he had put up as loan 
collateral.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had no choice but to sue," Giroir says now. "They had just about all my 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that Rose represented the FSLIC in other thrift cases -- a 
conflict of interest that became the central management issue for nearly two 
years. Finally, by early 1988, Giroir resigned and set up his own firm, taking 
with him some of the best young lawyers in Rose's profitable securities law 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, he took key clients with him, including corporate and personal 
legal work of Jackson Stephens, the patriarch of a family financial empire and 
arguably the most powerful figure in Arkansas. It has taken years for Rose to 
rebuild its securities business since Giroir's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose today is not Little Rock's most political firm; there are one or two 
rival powerhouse firms in town that have traditionally had closer ties to the 
state Legislature. Yet Rose still exerts influence through its heavyweight 
client base, which has remained intact during the current controversy, 
according to Rose lawyers. "My clients almost never even mention it, except to 
sympathize and ask how we are doing," insists senior partner Wilson Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the coming months will pose a stern test of client loyalty. By March, 
congressional Republicans were smelling blood and had forced the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. to reopen an investigation of whether Rose had a 
conflict of interest in its legal work involving Madison before state and 
federal regulators. "Hillary Clinton and Rose got money going in and got money 
going out," charged Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.).  
</P>
<P>
 The mysteries of the firm are slowly yielding to the persistence of the press 
and the pressure from Fiske, who is still in the opening stages of his inquiry 
into Whitewater. Stories detailing grand jury testimony from former Rose 
couriers and clerks about shredded documents, potential conflicts of interest, 
shadowy real estate deals and political connections blare almost daily from 
newspapers and TV reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose partners are certain to be forced to testify before Fiske's grand jury 
throughout the spring. Fiske's self-described mandate is to investigate, among 
other things, the death of Foster and the possible complicity of the Rose firm 
in fiscal and legal shenanigans involving McDougal's failed businesses and his 
relationship with the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 Besieged with subpoenas and under intense media scrutiny, Rose has hired its 
own legal counsel, the giant Houston firm of Vinson & Elkins, to represent it 
in possible federal prosecution. The firm's legal fees could easily run into 
hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of the serious questions still surrounding Foster's violent death, 
Fiske has named Roderick C. Lankler, former chief litigator in the New York 
district attorney's office, to concentrate solely on the Foster suicide. And, 
of course, if any proof of shredding of Whitewater-related documents surfaces 
in grand jury testimony, Rose attorneys will be facing obstruction of justice 
charges.  
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, that's enough potential trouble to make almost any client 
think twice. "It's not the sort of reputation one would go searching for," 
sighs senior partner Herb Rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose partners deny they are covering up any scandal and deny their shredder 
has been working overtime to hide the truth about the Clintons and Whitewater. 
Former couriers at Rose have testified before a grand jury in Little Rock that 
they were asked by clerks to shred documents marked with Vincent Foster's name 
but have acknowledged that they don't believe any of the papers were related to 
Whitewater or Madison Guaranty. One sardonic Rose partner asks: "Now, if we 
were really going to shred documents about Madison and Whitewater, do you think 
we would do it in the middle of the day and call in the clerks and say, 'Hey, 
we're shredding the Madison files, can you help us?"' 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, deservedly or not, Rose is now smack in the middle of the hottest 
political scandal since the Iran-contra debacle. And suddenly, Rose of Little 
Rock is the most famous law firm in America -- for all the wrong reasons.

<P>
 Leon Degrelle, Belgium's foremost Nazi collaborator and the man Adolf Hitler 
once praised as "the ideal son," has died. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Thursday in Spain, almost 40 years after his native country sentenced 
him to death.He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Degrelle, who founded a fascist party and rode it to electoral success in the 
1930s, headed the Walloon Legion, a Belgian unit in the German army during the 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Degrelle was condemned to death for collaboration in 1944, but escaped to 
Spain and the protection of right-wing leader Gen. Francisco Franco. Belgium 
tried to kidnap him a year later but failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Degrelle was naturalized in 1954 and his new Spanish citizenship effectively 
ruled out his extradition to Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 He denied the existence of the Holocaust, in which more than 6 million Jews 
were killed by the Nazis before and during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hitler's army invaded Belgium in May, 1940, Degrelle actively 
collaborated with the Nazis and founded the Walloon Legion in 1941, which 
fought the Soviet Communists on the Eastern Front. The legion was integrated 
into the Waffen SS in 1943.

BILL TRAVERS; 'BORN FREE' STAR, ANIMAL CONSERVATIONIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Travers, who co-starred in the 1965 movie "Born Free" and was so moved by 
the experience that he devoted much of his later life to animal conservation, 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Born Free Foundation said the actor and animal conservationist was 72 and 
died in his sleep Tuesday.No cause of death was given. 
</P>
<P>
 Travers and his actress wife, Virginia McKenna, played George and Joy Adamson, 
the couple who taught dozens of lions orphaned or born in captivity to survive 
in the wild, starting with Joy Adamson's pet lion cub Elsa. 
</P>
<P>
 After the film's success, Travers and McKenna set up the Born Free Foundation 
to support animal rights and conservation. Their son, William Travers, 35, is 
the chief executive of the foundation in Coldharbour, 25 miles south of London. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, a documentary by Travers and McKenna called "The Lions Are Free," 
about the lives of the lions they had turned loose, was shown on U.S. 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Travers' other film roles was "Wee Gordie" in 1956, in which he played 
the strongest man in the world, and "Bhowani Junction," starring Ava Gardner, 
also in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot, 4-inch actor also was seen in "The Browning Version," a 
British-Italian production of "Romeo and Juliet," "The Barretts of Wimpole 
Street" and the 1968 version of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Their real-life "Born Free" counterparts came to violent ends. 
</P>
<P>
 George Adamson, a former game warden, was killed in 1989 by armed bandits at 
his home on a remote game reserve in Kenya. Joy Adamson, the author of "Born 
Free," was killed nine years before in a wage dispute with a servant.

TOM FRANDSEN; VETERAN LOS ANGELES TV HOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Frandsen, the smooth-talking but affable TV host and newsman on the Los 
Angeles scene for nearly 40 years, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said Frandsen died Friday of the complications of a stroke 
at Scripps Hospital in Encinitas.He had been living in retirement in nearby 
Rancho La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, Frandsen's appearances were a fixture in Southern California 
living rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 He began at KNBC after graduating from the University of Notre Dame's Navy 
flier program after World War II. He wrote news and was host of an afternoon 
movie and talk show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Frandsen FYI" became one of the highest-rated afternoon shows in the area 
but was eventually canceled to make room for a network talk show hosted by a 
new national talent -- Mike Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The network wanted my slot," Frandsen told The Times in 1985, because of the 
additional revenue generated by a national program. "But I had a contract and 
they had to pay me -- and handsomely," he added with obvious satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Frandsen moved to KHJ, where he became vice president of community affairs and 
editorial director. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he officially retired more than a decade ago, he continued for a time 
to host "Meet the Mayors," a 30-minute series of interviews with the mayors of 
Southland cities on Channel 9, and another public service program, "Government 
Scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his wife, June, two sons and four grandchildren, who ask 
that donations in Frandsen's name be sent to the Shriners' Hospital for 
Crippled Children.

GRETZKY'S MAGIC DOES THE TRICK . . . BOY HOWE; HOCKEY: EVERYBODY PLAYS WITH THE 
SAME PUCK, SKATES IN THE SAME RINKS AND PLAYS UNDER THE SAME RULES, BUT THE 
GREAT ONE SOMEHOW GETS DIFFERENT RESULTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We marvel at the magician who pulls a rabbit out of his hat or makes someone 
disappear. That same kind of illusion is what has allowed Wayne Gretzky to keep 
hockey fans on the edge of their seats for 15-plus professional seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky doesn't have Mario Lemieux's tremendous size or reach. He doesn't have 
Bobby Hull's powerful slapshot or Rocket Richard's dazzling speed. He doesn't 
have Phil Esposito's presence in front of the net or Jean Beliveau's elegance. 
He doesn't have Gordie Howe's bruising elbows or Bobby Clarke's scalpel-like 
stickwork. 
</P>
<P>
 But just put a hockey stick in Gretzky's hands and it becomes a magic wand. 
Everybody plays with the same puck, skates in the same rinks and plays under 
the same rules, but Gretzky somehow gets different results. Pure magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver Canucks goaltender Kirk McLean had promised not to let Gretzky out 
of his sight in the historic March 23 game at Inglewood, Calif., but quicker 
than you could say "abracadabra," Gretzky flicked a wrist shot into the net 
from the edge of the left faceoff circle at 14:47 of the second period to give 
him 802 career goals -- one more than Gordie Howe's National Hockey League 
career record. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: To score 800 goals, a player would have to average 40 goals for 
20 seasons, or 20 goals for 40 seasons. Gretzky, whose record-setter was his 
37th goal of the season, has averaged 55 over 15 seasons. It took him 1,117 
games, 650 fewer than it took Howe. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's feat would be comparable to Hank Aaron reaching Babe Ruth's record 
of 714 career home runs in 1,582 games -- 1,383 games earlier than he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I promised myself I wouldn't lose sight of Wayne, but it was like he was in 
one spot one second and somewhere else a second or two later," McLean says. 
"Wayne doesn't shoot as much as he used to, but his shot is still as accurate 
as any in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite Gretzky's talk about retirement after playing in the Stanley Cup 
finals last spring, he will not be disappearing from the Kings' lineup anytime 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see 900 goals," he says. "I see 1,000. I don't know if I'll get there, but 
I'll give it an effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky is about 10 pounds heavier than in 1979, when he entered the NHL as a 
player for the Edmonton Oilers. That's the result of an offseason weight 
training program he says he needs at age 33 to survive in his world of 
crosschecks, bodychecks and hipchecks. But he's still a whisp at 6 feet, 170 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times I've said I wish I was the size of Mark Messier or had the strength 
of Gordie Howe," Gretzky says. "But size has never bothered me. I've always 
played within myself and I've done OK." 
</P>
<P>
 OK indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky learned to skate on the frozen Nith River, near Brantford, Ontario. He 
remembers scoring his first goal against his grandmother Mary, who was seated 
in a reclining chair in the Gretzky home. Many goalies have been tested since 
-- from an upright position. Vancouver's Glen Hanlon, for one, surrendered 
Gretzky's first NHL goal October 14, 1979. Hanlon, who allowed 12 of Gretzky's 
goals before retiring, now is a Canucks goaltending consultant who watched as 
McLean, his pupil, was victimized by No. 99 for the record-setter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky was 2 years old in 1963 when Howe surpassed Richard's record of 544 
goals. That Howe's name stood atop the NHL goal-scoring charts for more than 30 
years makes Gretzky's accomplishment even more amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He scored 85 more points one year than the next guy," Howe says. "I scored 85 
one year and set a record." 
</P>
<P>
 No one other than Gretzky has scored 200 points in a season -- and he has done 
it four times. No one else has scored more than 90 goals in a season -- he 
scored 92 in 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating his boyhood hero was nice, but Gretzky still wonders how he ever got 
himself into position to challenge anybody's goal-scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask me to name hockey's great goal-scorers and I'll name Gordie Howe, Phil 
Esposito and Rocket Richard," Gretzky says. "That's what makes this so unique 
to me because nobody, especially me, dreamed I'd be this close to breaking 
Gordie's record. 
</P>
<P>
 "My forte is playmaking. When people talk about me, they say, 'Watch how he 
passes,' or 'Watch how he sees the entire ice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 No athlete in any team sport approaches Gretzky's level of dominance. If 
Gretzky goes on to win the league scoring title this season, it would mark the 
11th time he has accomplished the feat. Still, Gretzky's greatest asset is his 
ability to make his teammates better than they should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting up numbers like he has for 15 years, it's amazing, especially when 
you consider he's still only 33," Bruins defenseman Ray Bourque says. "He has 
been unbelievable for the league, on and off ice. The guy has been a phenomenal 
ambassador for the game at a time when we needed a hero the most." 
</P>
<P>
 In discussions about the athlete of the decade for the 1980s, many talk about 
Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and Michael Jordan. But none of those basketball 
stars approached Gretzky's success: seven scoring titles, four world 
championships and nine Most Valuable Player awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's accomplishments are even more amazing when you consider that hockey 
stars average between 25 and 30 minutes of a 60-minute game, compared with 35 
to 40 minutes per 48-minute game for basketball stars. To be such a force in a 
team sport while playing only half the game underscores Gretzky's greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 "What separates him from everyone else is the way he's able to come out and 
play his best, night after night, for all these years," says Jari Kurri, 
Gretzky's longtime linemate in Edmonton and Los Angeles. "Wayne is proud of the 
fact he has never missed the playoffs. He wants his competitiveness to be 
contagious." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's greatest achievement is not noted in a record book. His biggest 
contribution goes beyond goals and assists, beyond bringing a Stanley Cup to 
Los Angeles, which he says is his final challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's trade from Edmonton to Los Angeles on August 9, 1988, shocked the 
hockey world, shaking the very roots of the game in Canada. But in retrospect, 
Gretzky's move to the United States has been a blessing for the sport, widening 
the game's fan base beyond boundaries anyone thought possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings, who sold fewer than 5,000 season tickets in 1987 and averaged about 
10,000 fans per game, have averaged crowds of 15,619 in a 16,005-seat building 
over five seasons since Gretzky's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the success of the Kings has spawned new interest in the Sun 
Belt areas, with teams succeeding in Anaheim, Dallas, Miami, San Jose and Tampa 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gretzky's contribution to hockey transcends his performance on the ice," 
Mighty Ducks General Manager Jack Ferreira says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gretzky revitalized hockey in Los Angeles, and he is responsible for the 
success all of the Sun Belt teams have enjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Goal No. 802 was just a short pause in Gretzky's great film. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things went through my mind -- my dad's illness, the four Stanley 
Cups in Edmonton and much, much more," Gretzky says. "But I have to admit, I've 
never had a greater feeling than when that puck went into the net." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman often says the NHL has to show the world that the 
things Gretzky, Mario Lemieux and the other league stars do on the ice is as 
great as what Michael Jordan used to do in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, Bettman said, "You've always been the Great One, but tonight 
you became the Greatest."

ARIZONA'S WEAPON TURNED AGAINST IT; GAME 1: THE WILDCATS GO COLD FROM 
THREE-POINT RANGE AND ARKANSAS WINS, 91-82. WILLIAMSON HAS 29 POINTS AND 13 
REBOUNDS.

 Arkansas lived by the three-pointer and Arizona died by it Saturday as the 
Razorbacks moved into their first NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Corliss Williamson gave Arkansas all the muscle it needed inside, scoring 29 
points and grabbing 13 rebounds, to give the Razorbacks a 91-82 victory over 
the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas, No. 1 much of the season, ran its record to 30-3 and will play Duke, 
a 70-65 winner over Florida, for the national title Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton watched his beloved Hogs from a private skybox, chin in 
hand. He nervously clenched his fists when things got tense and provided 
running commentary to his boxmates -- mostly local businessmen and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very worried. It was a hard game. I'm glad we don't have to replay it," 
said Clinton, who planned to return for Monday night's final. 
</P>
<P>
 First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea watched from an 
adjoining skybox. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (29-6) claimed it had college basketball's best backcourt, but it 
didn't look like it against Arkansas. Damon Stoudamire made only two of 13 
three-point attempts and Khalid Reeves missed all nine of his. Overall, the two 
made only 11 of 43 field goal attempts. Reeves finished with 20 points, 
Stoudamire with 16 on five-for-24 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Razorbacks weren't launching shots from 30 feet or so -- and making 
seven of 24 -- they relied on Williamson under the basket. Arkansas coach Nolan 
Richardson called Williamson "pound for pound the strongest kid in the 
universe," and Williamson didn't do anything to diminish that appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson's strength wore down Arizona in the second half, after the score 
was tied at 41 at halftime. Arizona pulled ahead by 67-62, but the Razorbacks 
broke it open with a 16-3 run that put them ahead, 78-67. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked up the intensity," Williamson said. "We wanted to go to the final 
game. It feels great to get a chance to play in the championship game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Arizona Coach Lute Olson: "Williamson was a load the whole ball game. No 
matter what we tried to do with him, he did a great job in every regard. 
Williamson was just too tough for us down there. He's just so good, just so 
smart. You double-team him, and some guys in that situation are going to lose 
their poise. He doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said defense would make the difference in this game, but it wasn't 
so much defense as Williamson's sheer strength and Arizona's cold shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to play all season, hit your shots, and then come into a 
game in the Final Four and have an off game," Stoudamire said. "I make three or 
four of those open shots I had, and we win the game. It's just very frustrating 
to sit here and think about what just happened out there on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas had some spectacular three-point shooting. Al Dillard made two from 
30-foot range within a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just put constant pressure on you and it just takes its toll," 
Stoudamire said. "With about 10 minutes left in the game, you're just so 
fatigued, you're trying to suck it up. But it's just kind of hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's seven steals in the first half -- Arkansas had one -- helped the 
Wildcats overcome two-for-16 shooting from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Arkansas nor Arizona had ever reached the championship game. Arkansas 
lost in the semifinals of the Final Four in 1942, 1945 and 1990. Arizona's only 
trip to the Final Four, in 1988, ended with a loss in the semifinals.

THE NEW CLEVELAND GATEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK MELVIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can call the Cleveland Indians' new home "Jacobs Field," or "Gateway," or 
simply "Indians Park." Just don't call it a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A stadium, you see, is what the Indians left behind: huge, musty old Cleveland 
Stadium, whose countless empty seats served to remind the players every night 
how bad they were. 
</P>
<P>
 "A stadium is a multipurpose facility. This is a baseball park," said Bob 
DiBiasio, Indians vice president of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 DiBiasio skipped his annual six-week trip to spring training this year because 
there was so much work to be done back home preparing the park for an April 2 
exhibition game against Pittsburgh and the April 4 opener against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is exciting work for him and for all the Indians' employees, hopeful 
the new park heralds a new era for a team desperately in need of one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians haven't won a pennant since 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be the thing that really turns the corner for us," said 
pitcher Charles Nagy. "Anybody who goes to work every day knows that the 
atmosphere is a big key. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you used to go down to the old ballpark, you had to drag yourself there. 
It's big, old, cavernous. It's dismal. So you'd go to the park as late as 
possible. With the new place, everybody's really excited." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42,400-seat, natural-grass park is part of a $425 million project that 
includes a 20,750-seat arena, built to lure the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers back 
downtown from neighboring Summit County. The arena will open this fall, in time 
for the Cavs' 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both facilities were squeezed between two busy streets at the southern edge of 
downtown, on 28 acres that formerly held rundown warehouses and shops. The 
project is being paid for by a complicated public-private financing package 
anchored by a 15-year tax on cigarettes and alcohol sold in Cuyahoga County. 
</P>
<P>
 County voters approved the tax in 1990 to keep the Indians from leaving town. 
The county will own the place once all the loans and bonds are paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gateway Economic Development Corp., a non-profit organization formed to 
oversee the project, left the naming of the buildings to anyone willing to pay 
a total of $20 million for the privilege. On Wednesday, trustees accepted the 
$13.8 million bid of Indians owner Richard E. Jacobs to call the ballpark 
"Jacobs Field" for the next 20 years. The arena naming rights remain to be 
sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, it may be difficult to shake the "Gateway" label that has been 
used to identify the project for several years. And the Indians' literature for 
this season, printed before any name was chosen, refers to the baseball field 
as "Indians Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the architects -- who also designed Baltimore's Camden Yards and 
Chicago's new Comiskey Park -- had so little room to work with, the park's 
dimensions can fairly be described as quirky. 
</P>
<P>
 The fence in left field is 19 feet high and angles from 325 feet deep down the 
line to a point in left center that is 410 feet from home plate. The 8-foot 
fence in dead center is 405 feet deep, and the 8-foot right-field fence goes 
from 375 feet in the power alley to 325 feet down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 119 luxury suites that lease for $45,000 to $100,000 a year. The 
most expensive are 10 small apartments at field level between the dugouts, some 
of them situated closer to home plate than the pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest seats, $6 each, are in the left-field bleachers and the upper 
deck in right. 
</P>
<P>
 A statue of Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller will greet fans at one of the 
busiest entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the features are concession stands with views of the field, so fans can 
go for refreshments without missing a pitch; seats down the lines that are 
angled toward the infield, to avoid neck strain; seating for 400 handicapped 
people; a children's play area behind the right-field stands; and a beer garden 
(14 varieties on tap) behind the left-field stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking will be restricted to six areas, none in view of the playing field. 
That has angered some smokers who paid the special tax that's funding the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Indians players, meanwhile, will find a clubhouse that is more than three 
times the size of their cramped quarters at Cleveland Stadium. Included are a 
steam room, a sauna, a weight room, a hydrotherapy area with whirlpools and a 
"swim-in-place" pool, a video room, and batting cages close enough to the 
dugout to let designated hitters keep loose by taking extra swings during a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you spend a million dollars on a player, you want to have a place where 
they can stay in condition," DiBiasio said. "We have 11 guys who live in the 
Cleveland area year-round now, and the whole reason is they knew this was 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Unquestionably, it's an improvement over Cleveland Stadium, which remains the 
home of the NFL's Cleveland Browns. But is it enough to help the Indians 
contend in their new and presumably weaker division, the American League 
Central? 
</P>
<P>
 Fans apparently think so. A full month before the opener, they had already 
bought nearly 1.8 million tickets; the franchise attendance record of 2.6 
million, set in 1948, seems sure to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it makes a big difference," catcher Sandy Alomar said. "It's going to 
make players come to the ballpark with no excuses."

JITTERY WINDMILLER SHOWS HER NERVE IN FRESNO; COLLEGE SOFTBALL: SHE SETTLES 
DOWN AND FINALLY BEATS BULLDOGS TO GIVE NORTHRIDGE SPLIT, 3-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That pesky monkey that rode the back of Cal State Northridge ace Amy 
Windmiller through three losses to Fresno State last season is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller, a senior right-hander who left Fresno State after her freshman 
season, buried that burden by throwing a four-hitter to help Northridge salvage 
a split Saturday against Fresno State in a Western Athletic Conference 
doubleheader in front of 1,246. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-ranked Northridge lost the opener, 5-2, before bouncing back for a 3-1 
victory behind Windmiller. 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (14-1), who was 0-3 against the Bulldogs last season, shook off the 
nerves that plagued her performances a year ago. After a shaky first inning in 
which she surrendered three hits and the first earned run against her in 68 
innings, Windmiller was all business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew going in that they were gonna hit the ball," Windmiller said. "But, I 
knew if we could get out of (the first) inning the defense would take care of 
it after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Windmiller took care of it, allowing only one hit in the final six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was finished, she even had a dozen young Fresno fans eating 
out of her hand, asking for her autograph after the game. After all, she was 
the first pitcher to beat the fifth-ranked Bulldogs at Fresno in 15 games this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you always look mean?" asked one young fan who was waiting to get 
Windmiller's autograph. The question prompted a smile from the shy Windmiller, 
and the little girl had her answer. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little to smile about, however, in the first game for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State (26-9, 7-1 in conference), eager to avenge its 1992 regional 
playoff loss to the Matadors, came out swinging against Northridge starter 
Kathy Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs bunched four hits and scored three runs in the first inning for a 
3-1 lead. Kim Maher, a Buena High graduate who hurt the Matadors all day, drove 
in two runs with a double in her first at-bat. Maher went four for six with two 
doubles and three runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State, which pounded nine hits off Blake (9-4), added runs in the 
second and fourth innings for a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (26-5, 5-1), which continued to make mistakes on the basepaths, 
scattered eight hits, never grouping more than two hits in an inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors squared the nightcap, 1-1, on a RBI single by Beth Calcante in 
the third and took control in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 With bases loaded, Calcante hit a fly ball to right. Vicky Rios tagged at 
third and hurdled catcher Christa Yorke, who appeared to make the tag. But 
umpire Bruce Lankford signaled safe, bringing Fresno State Coach Margie Wright 
out of the dugout for a few choice words to Lankford. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Ivie followed with a suicide squeeze, but Terri Pearson was out at the 
plate. Ivie was hung up in a rundown trying to reach second, but second baseman 
Randi Berg made an errant throw and Jen Fleming scored for a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Matadors were happy to go home with a split.

PRO BASEBALL / MIKE HISERMAN; CAMARILLO'S WILLIS FINDS RELIEF IN TRADE FROM 
CHICAGO TO PITTSBURGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Travis Willis is not a particularly hard thrower, but the Pittsburgh Pirates 
apparently think he will be a greater asset than a speedy Scott Bullett. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullett, a top outfield prospect who batted better than .300 and hit nine home 
runs in the Arizona Fall League, was shipped to the Chicago Cubs last week in 
exchange for Willis, a right-hander who starred at Camarillo High and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal made sense for both teams considering the Cubs are set in the bullpen 
with Randy Myers and the Pirates are short on pitching and well stocked in the 
outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw an opportunity to pick up a player who had done a good job pitching 
against us in Double-A," said Chet Montgomery, the Pirates' director of minor 
league operations. "Our scouts say he has three good pitches and we know he had 
those 24 saves (for Orlando). You don't do that in a good Double-A league 
unless you have some good pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis was hitting fungoes before a spring training game in Mesa, Ariz., on 
Wednesday when he was called off the field and informed of the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good opportunity for me," Willis said after arriving at the 
Pirates' Bradenton, Fla., training base. "They traded a guy on their 40-man 
roster for me, so that makes me think they must have some interest in me 
pitching. In Chicago, I couldn't figure out where I was going." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Pirates, Willis' first regular-season stop will be Buffalo, where he 
joins a triple-A staff that includes Danny Miceli, another apprentice closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis, who has 50 saves in his only two professional seasons as a closer, 
said he won't mind sharing the load or even changing roles. "It doesn't matter 
to me," Willis said. "Anything would be fine with me as long as I get to 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 What on paper seems like a demotion in reality was a promotion. Craig Clayton, 
who in the off-season was placed on the Seattle Mariners' 40-man protected list 
and assigned to triple-A Calgary, has been optioned to double-A Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, a third baseman the past 2 1/2 seasons, will be tried as a 
short-relief pitcher after impressing club officials as a pitcher during the 
fall and spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was an All-American utility player for Cal State Northridge in 1991, 
batting .364 while also winning a school-record-tying 14 games as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 After drafting him in the sixth round, the Mariners tried him as an infielder. 
"They made him a third baseman, for what reason I don't know," said Sammy 
Ellis, Seattle's pitching coach. "After I saw that arm I questioned it, but it 
wasn't my decision. I'm just happy we put him back on the mound." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton's fastball topped out in the mid- to high-80s at Northridge, but 
Mariner scouts clocked a few of his pitches at more than 90 m.p.h. last summer 
during a pair of mop-up outings for Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good-looking young pitcher, one of our most impressive pitchers in 
camp," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella said. "With a little improvement and 
experience, he's not far from pitching in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was placed in double-A because Jacksonville offered more of an 
opportunity to pitching regularly, club officials said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rich Aude has re-established himself as the first baseman of the future for 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. The former Chatsworth High standout had a huge 1993 
season, hitting 22 home runs and leading the Pirate organization with 89 runs 
batted in, 252 total bases and 83 runs scored while bouncing between double-A 
Carolina, triple-A Buffalo and Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Arizona Fall League, Aude batted less than .100 and struck out a 
lot. Aude rebounded with a strong spring, batting better than .300 overall and 
getting two hits in six at-bats against major league pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his problem in the fall was that he was dead tired," said Montgomery, 
the Pirates' director of minor league operations. "He'd never played that much 
before. It was a long season. Plus, we moved him back and forth a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said Aude will be the first baseman at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Scott Sharts, Northridge's career home run leader, has retired from baseball 
after 2 1/2 seasons in the Indians' organization. Sharts, a former Simi Valley 
High star, was a 10th-round draft choice as a first baseman and designated 
hitter in 1991. However, the past two seasons he was used primarily as a relief 
pitcher.  
</P>
<P>
 Sharts had a 3-3 record, a 3.99 earned-run average and six saves last season 
for the Indians' Class-A affiliate in Columbus, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Van Burkleo, a longtime Angels farmhand who also played in Japan, has 
resurfaced on the triple-A roster of the Colorado Rockies.  
</P>
<P>
 Van Burkleo, 31, a first baseman out of Chatsworth High, was released by the 
Angels last season. He batted .296 in 27 at-bats for the Rockies this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Down on the farm: As major league teams pared their rosters during the past 
week, several former area standouts found themselves back in the minor leagues. 
Among them: Cincinnati Reds infielder Kurt Stillwell, a former first-round 
draft choice from Thousand Oaks High; Chicago White Sox pitcher Wally Ritchie, 
a left-hander from Glendale College; Seattle Mariners right-hander Roger 
Salkeld, a former first-round pick from Saugus High; and Chicago Cubs pitcher 
Chuck Crim, from Thousand Oaks High.

MONTCLAIR PREP HAS ITS DAY WITH PARQUE OUT OF THE WAY; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: 
WHEN CRESCENTA VALLEY ACE LEAVES, MOUNTIES RALLY TO WIN, 4-3, IN BABE HERMAN 
TOURNAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Batters sometimes wish pitcher Jim Parque of Crescenta Valley High would 
simply go away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, those carrying the aluminum for Montclair Prep got their wish. 
</P>
<P>
 After three superb innings of corner-painting, Parque was forced to exit after 
reaching the weekly 10-inning limit under state rules. With Parque on the pine, 
Montclair Prep went on to post a 4-3 victory at Stengel Field in the opening 
round of the 31st Babe Herman tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep (7-3) built a 4-1 lead after six innings, then held off a 
seventh-inning Falcon rally. After managing only one hit off Parque, the 
Mounties tagged senior right-hander Garrett Lee (1-2) for six hits, including 
four in a two-run sixth highlighted by a run-scoring double by Eli Reichline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure if (Parque) stays in, it's a different ballgame," Montclair Prep 
Coach Walt Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parque, who improved to 4-0 Tuesday with a 10-2 victory over Hoover in which 
he struck out 14, has been unhittable at times. Last week, he pitched 6 2/3 
perfect innings with 12 strikeouts against Muir before settling for a 
one-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Montclair Prep, Parque struck out 10 of the 11 batters he faced. The 
first seven fanned at the expense of only 28 pitches from the 5-foot-9 
left-hander. Four were caught looking at his curve. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Parque left trailing, 1-0. He yielded a one-out single in the third 
to Scott Stark, who stole a base, then scored from second on a passed ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be overshadowed was junior left-hander Jared Sandler of Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandler (5-0) went the distance, striking out three and yielding six hits. He 
twice stranded baserunners with inning-ending strikeouts and survived the 
seventh after yielding a leadoff walk and two consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt pretty good about my pitches," Sandler said. "I just came out like it 
was another game." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Kirk Hagge, who was two for four, delivered a run-scoring single for 
Crescenta Valley (7-2) in the seventh. Jesse Mitchell added a double in the 
inning and scored on a fielder's choice.

 Page Jones of Torrance, the son of two-time Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones, 
passed pole-sitting Ron Shuman in the first turn and led the rest of the race 
to win the 30-lap USAC midget main event Saturday in the Ventura Raceway season 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones survived three caution flags and an apparent handling problem to win the 
race.He opened up a quarter-lap lead by the fifth lap before the first caution 
flag came up on Lap 8 when his teammate, Jason Leffler of Long Beach, spun. 
</P>
<P>
 John Cofer of Macdoel, Calif., won the 12-lap midget semi-main event in 
2:09.50. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three-quarter main event, Simi Valley's Scott Hansen, who was the 
fastest qualifier at 13.388, led 11 of 20 laps and notched his second victory 
in three races. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen led for five laps before giving way to Rick Atkins of Fullerton on Lap 
9, but regained the lead on Lap 13 when Atkins almost spun out through the 
first turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gregory of Elk Grove took the three-quarter semi-main in 1:53.91. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Drake of Val Verde won the first midget heat in 1:43.01, Cary Faab of 
Yorba Linda took the second heat with a 1:45.25 clocking, Tony Stewart of 
Indianapolis won the third heat in 1:43.35, and Sun Valley's Walt Johnson won 
the fourth heat.

 Scott Dinger followed up a record-breaking qualifying run by winning the Pro 
Stock oval main event during the 55th season opener at Saugus Speedway Saturday 
night before 4,624. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley resident started on the inside of the third row, but quickly 
improved his position with the help of a caution flag that slowed the action 
only one circuit into the 25-lap event. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinger, second in the Pro Stock class the past two seasons, moved past 
polesitter Kenny Marshall of Canoga Park heading into Turn 1 on the fourth lap 
and pulled away despite three more caution flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Dinger eclipsed Sean Monroe's qualifying record by .13 seconds with a 
time of 17.62 and also won the figure-eight heat race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsman driver Pat Mintey Jr. of Lancaster (16.06) and Grand American 
Modified driver Dave Blankenship (16.06) of Reseda also broke qualifying 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Rose of Van Nuys (Sportsman), Canyon Country's John Watkinson III (Grand 
Am), Rich Ocheltree of Sherman Oaks (Pro Stock oval) and Reseda's Richard 
Karvasek (Pro Stock figure eight) each won trophy dashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat races were won by Bruce Erickson of Littlerock and Riverside's Dave 
Brandon (Sportsman), Gary Nazaroff of Covina and Northridge's Tad Friday (Grand 
Am), Jeff Schrader of Santa Clarita and Northridge's Keith Spangler (Pro Stock 
oval) and Dinger (Pro Stock figure eight).

MORGAN RETURNS AS SOFTBALL COACH AT NEWBURY PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Morgan, who took over the Newbury Park softball team on an interim basis 
after Wally Thornhill's resignation last week, was named to the post 
permanently by the Conejo Valley Unified School District on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan coached the Panthers three years ago, but resigned, giving way to 
Thornhill. A full-time police officer coaching the Panthers as a walk-on, 
Thornhill unexpectedly resigned last week. Some have speculated pressure from 
parents unhappy with the team's play forced Thornhill out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (7-3), were 4-2 when Thornhill resigned.

GALLERY: A LIGHT TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fine artist is a master manipulator of light, color, form and texture. Neon 
sculptor Michael Flechtner also needs the skills of a chemist, electrician and 
carpenter.The only trait his whimsical creations share with the universally 
familiar neon signs is their unearthly glow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that neon is not always a sign," he chides. Nor must the 
artist's imagination stop with "that ubiquitous glowing cactus in a pot, palm 
tree, flamingo or telephone." 
</P>
<P>
 Bending colorful glass tubing over a 1,700-degree flame, he coaxes it into 
intriguing designs sketched on a fireproof layout sheet, then purges it of air 
and impurities with a vacuum pump and an 18,000-volt bombardment of 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then does he add the magic ingredients from his ethereal palette: Neon 
produces the familiar red-orange. Argon creates pale lavender, but add a drop 
of mercury and it glows electric blue. Krypton makes a silvery white light; 
helium, a warm pink; xexon, a pale blue wisp. Flechtner has been invited to 
exhibit in Europe, Japan, Canada and across the United States, including the 
Museum of Neon Art at CityWalk. His work is currently featured with David 
Svenson's at the Wignall Museum/Gallery in Rancho Cucamonga.

MEXICO COVETS ORDER -- AND FINDS IT IN RUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rumor swirled through Mexico last week. Following the assassination of Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the ruling party's presidential candidate, Mexico was filled 
with rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor thrives in uncertain times as the least-enlightened tool of reason. 
Rumor feeds on chaos, even as it attempts to understand chaos, to detect a 
design. For though the rumor may be, almost always is, of dark conspiracy, 
there is within rumor a hope that the core of chaos is comprehensible and 
worldly, even expected. Greed. Pride. Love. 
</P>
<P>
 We Americans understand something of what Mexicans are going through. In the 
aftermath of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, rumor has become a 
permanent part of our political life. Whether or not Mark Lane and his fellow 
conspiracy theorists uncovered what "really happened" that November afternoon 
in Dallas, they have made us disrespectful of any official version. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican colleagues, Mexican friends, were on the phone last week. I hear that 
the Mexican army is on the move in southern Mexico. I hear that the accused 
assassin is a Jehovah's Witness -- enraptured, visionary. I hear that the 
accused assassin is part of a Los Angeles brigade of leftists. I hear that the 
assassination of Colosio was orchestrated by the old guard within his own 
party, those unhappy with changes wrought by President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the century, Mexico has purchased civic peace with a one-party 
political system. The Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, has provided 
stability at the price of corruption. Mexicans are apt to complain now about 
the PRI, describing it as something imposed upon them. But the PRI was a 
Mexican invention, and true to the authoritarianism and paternalism within the 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Every six years, the Mexican president would emerge from a political conclave 
to announce his successor. Thus was democracy rendered as theater. Everyone 
understood that the candidate would, despite token opposition, become 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, they never bothered to conceal the strings that made the puppets 
dance, and that was comforting, in a way. Corruption is comforting, in a way. 
And rumor, in old Mexico, was simply a matter of remarking on the visible 
strings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans are beginning to say publicly that the PRI has outlived its 
usefulness. Some Mexicans will even say publicly that Salinas, the 
international symbol of modernity, stole his election. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are Mexicans who will tell you, to this day, that the PRI has worked 
because there is a distinctly Mexican genius to the system of party chieftains 
who take care of their own more efficiently than the new breed of politicians 
-- technocrats (many with Ph.Ds from the United States) -- who think that a 
country's destiny can be charted and graphed, like some Harvard Business School 
case study. 
</P>
<P>
 It is odd that technology has restored rumor to realms of mystery and occult 
in Mexico. For all the wires have gone underground. You needn't actually steal 
a ballot box -- in the grand 19th-Century manner; you need only alter the 
electronic tabulation. The result has the quality of miracle: The PRI wins 
again! 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Salinas stepped forward to name the new PRI candidate for 
president. He named Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, a Yale-educated economist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor has it that the old guard within the PRI is displeased with the choice. 
Zedillo has been in disfavor since his days as education minister, when he 
tried to disengage fact from fable in Mexican history books -- sensitive 
subjects like the Mexican-American War or the 1968 slaughter of Mexicans by the 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Mexico, as a country, has been wedded to myth. In Mexico, there 
are only four roles: the Indian, the Spaniard, the Virgin and the gringo . 
</P>
<P>
 Last January, when Indians in the state of Chiapas revolted against Mexico 
City, Mexicans were immediately interested in the narrative possibilities posed 
by the insurrection. Here again was the 16th- Century myth of the Indian versus 
Cortes. Only this time, the Mexican government was cast in the role of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking to Mexicans last week, I had the sense that Chiapas and the consequent 
sympathy for the Indian (a sympathy that momentarily put aside anti-Indian 
racism throughout Mexican society) gave Mexicans an opportunity to complain 
about the PRI and its corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting rumor circulating throughout Mexico since January has it that 
Subcommandante Marcos, the phantom behind the Indian rebellion, is, in fact, a 
Jesuit priest. A Portuguese Jesuit priest. Lawrence of Mexico. (The Virgin.) 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, two ex-presidents issued fatherly advice to their Mexican children. 
Miguel de la Madrid spoke darkly of the "participation of the Mexican clergy in 
politics" (the Spaniard). And Jose Lopez Portillo, the man who, not so many 
years ago, brought Mexico to the brink of economic ruin, emerged from his 
luxurious disgrace to warn of "outside forces" threatening Mexico (the gringo 
). 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Mexican soul is the fear of disorder, a fear shaped by 
counter-reformation Spanish Catholicism as it was honed by anti-Catholic 
politicians of modern Mexico. Order . I have heard it all my life. My own 
Mexican father looks at America's chaos on the TV screen and prescribes the 
Mexican solution: What the United States needs is order. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has had order for seven decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Mexicans were in a frenzy wondering why Colosio was killed, Americans 
last week were busily speculating about Vincent W. Foster Jr.'s relationship to 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and did he really kill himself in his car or was his 
body transported to the park? And who was that mysterious man who phoned the 
park rangers? 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, for the last three decades, rumor has left us a 
politically passive people, cynical, skeptical of the possibility that the 
individual can make a difference. Such could be the fate awaiting Mexicans. On 
the other hand, true democracy might be born from this dusty season of rumor in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 More inadmissible than any rumor heard on the streets is the possibility that 
no one is controlling the chaos. And: If history is not the manipulation of 
cabals or Jesuits or Masons or PRI loyalists or leftist cells or the CIA, then 
what? Then maybe history is the responsibility of individuals to shape. Then 
Mexico will have entered the modern era.

CLINTON: YET ANOTHER SCANDAL-PLAGUED PRESIDENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Phillips, Kevin Phillips, publisher of American Political Report, is 
author of The Politics of Rich and Poor. His most recent book is Boiling Point: 
Republicans, Democrats and the Decline of Middle-Class Prosperity (Random 
House).

<TEXT>
<P>
 Make no mistake: Whitewater is about a lot more than possible small-time 
financial chicanery and a minor-league Washington cover-up. We are talking 
about control of the presidency in 1996 or earlier -- and the only thing that 
matches conservative and Republican political opportunism is liberal and 
Democratic hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP stalwarts, uninterested in getting to the bottom of Watergate or 
Iran-Contra, are now suffused with patriotism in pursuing Whitewater and the 
other allegations about Bill Clinton. Conversely, there are too many 
congressional Democrats, once outraged over the immorality of earlier GOP 
regimes, whose past insistence on the public's right to know has become 
acquiescence in this Administration's desire to have the public not know. 
</P>
<P>
 No one should be surprised. This is human nature. It is also political history 
-- and given the inadequate attention paid to such precedents in the television 
age, it may be useful to examine Whitewater and other Clinton controversies in 
the perspective of past political scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Whitewater -- the land deal, with its related savings-and-loan 
chicanery -- isn't enough to bring down Clinton. Even Watergate was less a 
single event than a catchall. When Richard M. Nixon was forced out of office in 
1974, the anti-Nixon furor fed on a wide range of issues beyond the break-in: 
the Nixon Administration's larger involvement in political espionage, the 
Daniel Ellsberg break-in, the ITT scandal and others. The scandal furor of 
1973-74 was also a showdown over which party would pay for the failure in 
Vietnam -- the Democrats who fumbled militarily or the GOP who used it as a 
cover for violating civil liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if Clinton won't be brought down by any single episode, it is 
possible to see the outline of a larger GOP indictment -- a contention that 
Whitewater is but one facet of a flawed Clinton morality that began with draft 
evasion 25 years ago; then broadened with shady financial deals in 1970s and 
1980s Arkansas; took further shape with Gennifer Flowers, and may now involve a 
Washington abuse of power and cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 For the President is America's chief of state as well as the leader of a 
political party, and he is at risk if he can't measure up to a moral-leadership 
role. Nixon couldn't and was forced to resign; Lyndon B. Johnson, a well-known 
financial and political finagler, may have been investigated and ejected in the 
post-Watergate climate; Clinton may be vulnerable today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is certainly not the first financial hustler in the White House. Other 
modern Presidents have been touched by scandal. The point is that, one way or 
another, most of them -- Warren G. Harding, Harry S. Truman, Johnson, Nixon and 
Bush -- were made to leave. If Clinton fits the scandal-President pattern, 
these precedents should be discomforting. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, polls show that from the first, many Americans did not trust Clinton 
because of his draft-board maneuvers, the charges made by Flowers and his 
Arkansas wheeler-dealer roots. This poses the question: Isn't Clinton's 
behavior typical of small-state governors who get to the White House? No -- 
because past governors of the smallest states haven't gotten there. Not ever. 
Jimmy Carter of Georgia was actually from one of America's relatively large 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the 20th-Century Presidents tied to the most scandal came from a 
high-powered background: Four were U.S. senators from major states (Harding of 
Ohio, Truman of Missouri, Nixon of California and Johnson of Texas) and three 
of them had served as vice president. Harding died before he could be blamed 
for the infamous Teapot Dome scandal. Truman brought Kansas City cronyism to 
the White House. And Johnson traded on favoritism to build a 
multimillion-dollar communications business while in Congress. Still another 
President linked to scandal, Bush, had earlier been vice president and CIA 
director. If there is a scandal precedent, it should be not to promote vice 
presidents or former vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But a second moral might be: Perhaps Americans made a mistake in ignoring the 
old rule, true since Franklin Pierce in 1852, of not picking a President from 
one of the smallest states. The rule has two components: Small-state nominees 
often represented the ideological fringe: Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, in 
1964, and George S. McGovern of South Dakota, in 1972, are two examples. The 
second problem is that small-state politics often develop out of a small-time 
climate, where the practices leave something to be desired. Americans already 
had some of these doubts about Clinton even as they elected him in 1992 to be 
done with Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking ahead, it's unclear if the whole surfeit of Arkansas-hustler 
accusations made against the Clintons -- from sweetheart commodities deals to 
shredded financial records, obstruction of justice and sexual harassment -- can 
ever reach critical mass and make Clinton an Ozark Elmer Gantry, unacceptable 
to Americans. But the argument against electing another small-state governor is 
already substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if some accusations against Clinton get partly proved, the public has 
many types of recourse. Only one is legal; most are political. Because so many 
allegations involve behavior in Arkansas rather than Washington, Clinton is 
unique -- compared with the other scandal-plagued Presidents -- in having his 
controversies emerge early enough for his first midterm elections. Truman's 
mink coat, deep-freeze and five-percenter messes and Nixon's Watergate didn't 
surface until the second midterms (1950 and 1974, respectively). 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of 1994's scandals coming in time for the first midterms is 
obvious: Instead of the usual small gains made by the party out of power, the 
GOP has a larger opportunity. They could wind up gaining three to four Senate 
seats and 20 or so House seats -- enough to stalemate Clinton and his programs 
in Congress during 1995-96. True, the Republicans could be at risk if they 
overplay Whitewater, but their broader accusations against Clinton are probably 
good politics. The earlier Truman and Nixon scandals produced major opposition 
gains in the midterms. 
</P>
<P>
 For all that it's implausible today, any emerging impeachment debate would be 
significant. Of the two Presidents against whom impeachment has been sought 
since the Republican-Democratic era began, Andrew Johnson in 1867 and then 
Nixon, both confrontations were brought by an opposition Congress. Johnson, 
remember, was a Unionist Democrat picked by Republican Abraham Lincoln as his 
running mate in 1864. After Lincoln was shot, hard-line congressional 
Republicans, eager to get rid of Johnson, settled on impeachment. And, of 
course, when Nixon was impeached, opposition Democrats were carrying the 
banner. No President has ever been impeached by his own party. If the unseating 
of Clinton, far-fetched now, should become a serious issue, it could be 
devastating for Democrats -- and possibly cost them control of Congress for the 
first time since 1953-54. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the most likely political effect of the charges circling the 
President is to hurt the Democrats slightly this November and to hurt Clinton 
more if and when he seeks a second term in 1996. If some of the allegations 
against the President gain credence, he might not run for reelection, and the 
chances of strong opposition in the primaries would grow. Indeed, of the four 
Democratic Presidents before Clinton, all but the assassinated John F. Kennedy 
faced tough primary challenges to their renomination. Weak New Hampshire 
showings forced Truman and Johnson to retire in 1952 and 1968, and Carter, 
after surviving a primary challenge, was ultimately defeated in November, 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the stock market and the economy could be affected by a major political 
scandal -- especially one that generates impeachment talk. The 1994 stock 
market is already in a nose-dive -- with politics part of the explanation. It's 
worth remembering that back in 1973-74, as the embattled Nixon Administration 
fought impeachment, its impaired management of the economy overlapped with a 
major recession and the biggest bear market since World War II. Were a 
comparable financial crisis and economic slowdown to develop in 1994-95, this 
could cost Clinton the White House two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversies now embroiling Clinton may seem unique. But the politics of 
scandal are a familiar tale in U.S. history. While some lessons are encouraging 
and some aren't, they're all worth keeping in mind as the various accusations 
and stories play out.

LOCKED IN A LONG-TIME CONFRONTATION, INDIA AND PAKISTAN REPLAY THE COLD WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paula R. Newberg, Paula R. Newberg is a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott reaches India this week, and 
Pakistan a few days later, he will encounter bended knees and muted rage. 
India, con vinced that the United States has forced Indian-U.S. relations to 
their lowest point in years, hyperbolically vilifies U.S. policy and stubbornly 
resists any proposals to alter its attitudes. In contrast, Pakistan believes 
that after several strained years, it is headed for warmer relations with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Both assessments embrace elements of truth. Washington has stumbled in its 
efforts to craft a new power balance in South Asia. India feels alternately 
ignored and deified, and interprets U.S. statements with rancor and regret. 
Pakistan has yet to overcome its simultaneous dependence and defiance toward 
the American hand that has so often fed it. It is little wonder that America 
feels dismayed and bewildered. Talbott, with Assistant Secretary of State Robin 
L. Raphel, is therefore off to mend fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fences are as much historical as current. Talbott will discover that the 
Cold War has not ended in South Asia and a new Cold War between India and 
Pakistan -- provoked largely by the conflict in Kashmir -- simmers on. He will 
also discover that remaking U.S. policy requires understanding past 
misperceptions and misconceived policies. 
</P>
<P>
 For too long, the United States justified its interest in South Asia by 
viewing it as a place on the road to somewhere more important -- China, 
Afghanistan, the Soviet Union -- and foolishly took sides in bilateral disputes 
to further its goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Disentangling the United States from the old Cold War without heating up the 
new one is a complicated business. The most immediate irritant is the stalled 
delivery of F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan. They were sold to longtime U.S. 
ally Gen. Mohammed Zia ul Haq, who saw them as a reward for services rendered 
in Afghanistan and a validation of Pakistan's strategic aims in the region.  
</P>
<P>
 India believes that adding to Pakistan's stock of F-16 and Mirage jets will 
heighten tensions and warns that it will counterbalance Pakistani capacities -- 
cyclically reflecting Pakistani worries. India thus has lobbied against future 
aid to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, this concern was speculative. In 1990, the United States canceled 
not only all foreign assistance to Pakistan but also delivery of the F-16s. The 
1985 Pressler Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act required this until 
Washington certified that Pakistan cannot make nuclear weapons. But the 
Pressler amendment unbalanced South Asia even more, and the timing of sanctions 
-- invoked only after the work was done in Afghanistan -- gave Pakistan reason 
to distrust Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pakistan punished but not India, neither state had incentive to change 
direction. India points to China's nuclear capacities as the primary 
justification for its program. It feels that U.S.-mandated reductions, while 
potentially balancing its power relative to Pakistan, would weaken its posture 
toward China. To India, arms control looks suspiciously like a pro-Pakistani 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both India and Pakistan think Washington belittles their security concerns, 
and thus play the nuclear card in domestic politics, sometimes irresponsibly. 
The goal of non-proliferation was temporarily lost when Pakistan announced its 
nuclear capabilities in 1991. This winter, India tested delivery systems. India 
and Pakistan are increasing conventional-arms stocks while stirring the nuclear 
pot. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP Administrations that sold the F-16s and then suspended aid, and the 
Pakistan government that acknowledged its nuclear capacities in response, no 
longer rule. President Bill Clinton and Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto and India's Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao all inherited policies 
they did not promote, and all should put this issue behind them quickly. 
Otherwise, they will be hemmed in by policies that predate the dissolution of 
the Soviet Union. The old Cold War will determine politics on the subcontinent 
long after the world has moved on to other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan has lobbied to receive the F-16s, viewing their delivery as success 
against Pressler. It has paid $658 million for the jets, whose production to 
Pakistani specifications continued after sanctions were imposed. Washington 
held out the carrot of delivery to moderate the blunt stick of sanctions -- a 
short-term tactic that is no substitute for long-term policy changes. Pakistan 
says it capped its nuclear program in 1990, but has not agreed to 
Pressler-mandated inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States, India and Pakistan believe, as all say they do, that 
non-proliferation is imperative, it is time to change strategy. One way is for 
Washington to return Pakistan's payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this would create complex legal tangles between the U.S. government and 
its arms suppliers, these difficulties might force Congress to act more 
responsibly in setting sanctions, and provide some impetus for Congress and the 
executive branch to coordinate policy. It could also give Bhutto much-needed 
cash and badly needed negotiating room on a wide range of military and 
strategic issues. Moreover, this would remove the object of India's immediate 
concerns and force New Delhi to reconsider the substance of its arms-control 
possibilities. All parties could then reconsider contemporary security needs 
rather than outdated ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is for Washington to take a stronger stand on the Kashmir conflict. 
Pakistan considers Kashmir a war of self-determination; India considers it an 
internal dispute aggravated by Pakistani meddling. Washington treats it as a 
bilateral territorial dispute. The United States thus falls into two traps: it 
dampens the voice of Kashmiris, and it allows an explicitly international issue 
-- the protection of rights -- to be reduced to a matter of barter in stalled 
talks between India and Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Washington makes clear that Kashmiri rights must be respected as a 
matter of right -- and, correlatively, that Kashmiris should determine their 
own fate -- U.S. persuasive power in any other policy arena will be limited. 
Kashmir will remain an excuse for India and Pakistan to refuse serious arms 
limits and marginalize outside concern. 
</P>
<P>
 India and Pakistan know their democracies can be defeated by their foreign 
policies. The strength of concurrent democratic commitment in India and 
Pakistan provides a chance for the United States to help them match their 
democratic rhetoric with peaceful action. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott's visit offers a rare opportunity to highlight some important truths 
about Clinton's foreign policy. South Asia can underscore the success of the 
Administration's priorities, or witness their collective weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Preventive diplomacy, sustainable development and democracy, multilateralism, 
rights and non-proliferation -- all are clear, present and possible in the 
subcontinent today. Talbott's foray can demonstrate U.S. commitment to these 
global goals by attaching them -- rigorously and evenhandedly -- to both India 
and Pakistan. Only then will balanced development, stability and security be 
possible.

JAPAN: FROM '80S AVARICE TO HOLY POVERTY IN THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Williams, David Williams, an editorial writer for the Japan Times, is 
the author of Japan: Beyond the End of History (Routledge). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan at bay. This phrase has not credibly passed American lips in more than 
40 years. Such has been the impact on American consciousness of Japan's bold 
postwar rise to economic ascendancy in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Even U.S. critics of Asia's economic superpower greet the suggestion of 
Japanese failure with skepticism, and rightly so. After two years of bitter 
recession, Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the globe stood at $120.4 
billion in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the sense of an ending in Japan is strong and palpable. The air in Tokyo, 
the dynamo of the national economy, is tinged with a distinct weariness. The 
most depressed pundits have seized on shrinking markets for consumer durables 
and falling grocery prices as evidence not of market liberalization, but of a 
general deflation such as Japan has not experienced since the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real change may be even more radical: History may be forcing the 
Japanese elite to abandon its century-old ambition to overtake Europe and the 
United States ( O-bei ni oikose ) and to discard the philosophy of national 
sacrifice that has underwritten its drive for supremacy. The policies and 
institutions of Japanese economic nationalism -- protected markets, producer 
cartels, lifetime employment and consumer subsidies to industry -- are being 
called into unprecedented question, not by foreigners, but by the Japanese 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The urgent cries for Japan to curb the powers of the bureaucracy and business 
cartels to encourage price competition have spawned an influential literature. 
This includes Akio Morita's famous essay, "Japanese-Style Management Is in 
Trouble"; Professor Muneyuki Shindo's book-long assault on that panoply of 
bureaucratic powers that travels under the name of "administrative guidance" ( 
gyosei shido ), and the economist Ryuichiro Tachi's demand that his country 
abandon the nationalist "Japanese model" in favor of the "Anglo-American model" 
of unrestricted market forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The bursting of Japan's economic bubble has given new prestige to people such 
as Kenichi Ohmae, the business guru, who leads that country's small army of 
important advocates of economic deregulation. The proposals for reform set out 
in his "Riso no Kuni" (Ideal or Admired Country), which has sold 60,000 copies 
since last spring, are debated with a seriousness undreamed of even two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But having been marched to the brink, the Japanese people are still refusing 
to take the plunge. Ohmae's ideas are so out of step with conventional Japanese 
nationalism and business common-sense that it has taken a recession of 
unprecedented severity to force this extraordinarily rich and successful nation 
to entertain the vision of Japan reborn. It should be recalled that a similar 
vision animated the postwar labors of Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur, the American 
shogun who presided over the last attempt to alter Japan's national essence. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple fact is that many Japanese remain unconvinced that their country 
needs to be "normalized" to better conform to Anglo-American political and 
economic ideals. Japan is changing not because most Japanese have come to 
regard Adam Smith's free-market theory as sensible or desirable, but because 
they recognize the force of an irresistible global trend toward freer markets. 
Necessity, not reason, is at work here. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in a crisis of confidence, Japan is grasping after old certainties. 
Japanese intellectuals and writers are brushing the cobwebs off the refined 
language of premodern cultural idealism. One of the most remarkable 
manifestations of the new mood is Koji Nakano's "The Idea of Holy Poverty" ( 
Seihin no Shiso ). This hardback book, with its celebrations of visionary tea 
masters and parables on the venerables ancients of Japanese literary and 
religious tradition, appeared in late 1992. More than 600,000 copies have been 
sold. "Holy poverty" -- not destitution but the simple life -- has become a 
precept of post-bubble Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the expression has pricked the conscience of a public contrite from 
the greedy excesses of the 1980s. The Buddhist and Confucian verities have come 
back to haunt a nation that temporarily abandoned its rooted suspicion that to 
accumulate riches is to deprive others, that overreaching materialism is always 
linked to power, and power to corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the temptations and dishonor that attend great wealth, "holy 
poverty" forms part of the moral axis of Japanese sensibility: the imperatives 
of purity, self-sacrifice and all restraints on egotistic assertiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the pain inflicted on Japan by the bursting of the bubble, there has 
been a profound sense of satisfaction, especially among the older generation, 
at the current troubles of those who profited most from '80s avarice. The new 
psychology is reflected less in systemic political or economic metamorphosis 
than in a Buddhist bonfire of the vanities. But Japan always makes a fresh 
start by first rebalancing the scales of the psyche.

RECOVERY THAT MAY CREATE MORE ECONOMIC REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Kotkin, Joel Kotkin, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a senior 
fellow at the Center for the New West and international fellow at the 
Pepperdine University School of Business in Los Angeles. He is also

<TEXT>
<P>
 With California in the early stages of economic recovery, the state's key 
concern for the balance of the '90s may well be what to do about those left on 
the sidelines. Two emerging job realities help focus the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, workers with certain technical skills or with marketing and 
entrepreneurial savvy in such sectors as medical equipment, entertainment, 
international trade and telecommunications are much in demand. In the other 
reality, workers with less marketable skills, including many who perform 
clerical, assembly, distribution and service duties, face declining employment 
prospects and falling pay relative to the college-educated. Southern 
California, as usual, sharply reflects both these national trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Greater Los Angeles, for example, is home to one of the highest concentrations 
of college graduates in the country. According to a recent Price Waterhouse 
study, Southern California -- notably western Los Angeles County, Orange and 
San Diego counties -- boasts percentages of college-educated people between 25% 
to 50% above the national average. Similar numbers apply to regions adjacent to 
San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County epitomizes the rewards of education in a knowledge-driven 
economy. With a share of college-educated workers at almost 50% above the 
national average, and with the number of households earning $75,000 or more at 
greater than twice the national average, Orange County's unemployment rate has 
dropped to that of the country. Boosted by new entrepreneurial activity, 
research-and-development space is becoming scarce; even office vacancy rates 
are falling. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, southeast Los Angeles County reflects the other job-future 
reality. With a population one-third immigrant and with the number of college 
graduates living there about 33% below the national average, the region's fate 
in California's emerging economy seems far less assured. This is already 
evident in the state's incipient recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Job losses in aerospace and construction have been large, but growth in the 
healthier sectors of the economy -- medical equipment, textiles and 
international trade -- has yet to expand rapidly enough to pick up the slack. 
Office absorption is virtually negligible; industrial vacancies remain in the 
high double digits. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with declining economic prospects, older, less educated residents have 
been moving out of state since the mid-'80s, according to a Michigan study. But 
many in poorer parts of California -- generally younger, often minority -- 
cannot so easily cash out and leave. What were essentially healthy 
working-class communities could turn into versions of Brazil's infamous favelas 
. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term consequences of this kind of economic deterioration may prove 
catastrophic to the region's social stability. History bears this out. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the early 1960s, large-scale manufacturing in automobile and other 
consumer durables began to leave South Los Angeles. California's growing 
prosperity, pushed along by the Vietnam War, bypassed the region. In 1965, for 
example, amid a generally robust regional economy, unemployment in the Watts 
area reached nearly 35%. At the time of the riots, 35,000 jobless adults, and 
one in five families, were on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the official response to the Watts riots, and similar disorders 
elsewhere, failed to address these fundamental economic problems. Instead of 
focusing on economic development, entrepreneurship and self-help, government 
efforts centered on social-service programs, which only helped to deepen 
patterns of dependency. Despite the expenditure of billions of dollars over 10 
years, by the late 1970s, median family incomes in South-Central Los Angeles 
were growing at barely one-third the rate for the region as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as the national economy and that of Southern California recovers, the 
critical challenge will be to ensure that the new growth does not circumvent 
these poor and working-class areas. This is not only important for 
South-Central Los Angeles. As the shift to a knowledge-intensive economy grows, 
the regions that may be economically marginalized include the fringes of 
suburbia, particularly industrially oriented areas like the East San Fernando 
Valley, central Orange County and the Inland Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that California's zones of economic despair may grow even as 
the pace of recovery quickens suggests the need for a new urban policy that 
transcends both the self-defeating welfare policies of the 1960s and the 
right's fixation on building an ever expanded prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort would require that attention be paid to basically non-economic 
issues -- education and crime -- that affect business. But central to it would 
be an economic strategy that encourages growth in those sectors of the economy 
-- small-scale manufacturing and trade-related activity -- that have the best 
chance of restarting the economic engine in more depressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Among governmental initiatives that could boost regions left on the sidelines 
during previous cycles of economic growth is the $1.8-billion Alameda Corridor 
Project. Expansion of the transportation network that links the Los 
Angeles-Long Beach Harbor with Downtown and, through rail and freeways, to the 
rest of North America, would greatly accelerate the movement of goods through 
the artery, along the way creating opportunities for scores of smaller 
industrial and service companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, southeastern Los Angeles is a natural economic play. The Alameda 
Corridor runs through it, and it is home to a largely immigrant population 
eager to rise up the economic ladder. Significantly, a developed corridor would 
serve companies with strong reasons to stay put, since they rely on local 
resources. Moreover, many are owned and operated by minority entrepreneurs who 
have with ties to the local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Government certainly has a role to play in getting this economic engine on the 
move. For one, it can lighten the regulatory burden fast-growing small 
companies carry. But innovative private investment will be indispensable. The 
decision by Calpers, the state's pension fund, to lend to small business is a 
prime example of a new source of capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a course offers the best hope to reconnect the economically disconnected 
regions of Southern California. In 1965, and again in 1992, we experienced the 
man-made shocks caused by past miscalculations. The emerging recovery offers 
the opportunity to make amends.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; VIOLENT AMERICA CATCHES JAPANESE STUDENTS UNAWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Etsuko Motosugi, Etsuko Motosugi, a graduate student at Cal State Los 
Angeles, is working on her masters degree in education. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Watch out, Etsuko, America is not a big Disneyland; it is a very serious 
country," my best friend at school told me. Like ordinary Japanese women, I 
seemed a little too sensitive, too honest, too naive. "You have to be a very 
tough woman," he advised. "Otherwise, people in this country can easily push 
you around." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend's cautionary words crossed my mind when I heard about the shooting 
deaths, in San Pedro, of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura. I recalled how the words 
had opened my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Americans go abroad to study in England or France, Japanese students 
travel to other countries to attend universities or colleges. An acquaintance 
of mine went to Indonesia to learn music; another went to France to study art. 
But the United States is probably the most popular destination of Japanese 
students, because they grew up in a Japan heavily influenced by American 
culture -- Coca Cola, Mickey Mouse, Hollywood stars, music, and so on. It is 
thus quite natural for them to want to come here and see the "real America" and 
learn English, while they study their major. To many Japanese students, it is 
"gifted time." 
</P>
<P>
 But we all soon see the gap between what we were told about America in Japan 
and what our eyes and ears tell us once we are here. America is not a fair 
country. Racism abounds. The combination of racism and unfairness creates 
violence. This society likes to blame people of color for that violence. 
Americans are fond of saying "it's terrible" when people like Ito and Matsuura 
are murdered for a car, as if they never contributed to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But given all the Japanese studying in America, I don't think we are any more 
targets of violence than any other foreign students. The greater risk for us is 
that we may fall into American habits of racist thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, we are constantly warned about "dangerous areas," though in 
normal circumstances we would never think to venture into them in the first 
place. But the damage is done: We may cut ourselves off from all people who 
happen to share skin color with those who live in these "dangerous" 
communities. We will begin to stereotype them, and never ask ourselves why we 
must think this way. The irony, of course, is that we, too, are people of 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first read the news about the two Japanese students who were shot to 
death, I thought it could happen to anyone, that it was just a case of bad 
luck. But after a while, I began to worry: I have come to accept this kind of 
violence as "normal," as just part of everyday life. Maybe that's because I see 
violence on the news every day and have become accustomed to crimes involving 
the use of a gun. Whatever the reason, I have started to lose the sensitivity 
to violence I carried from my country. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, we should not become obsessed with the tragic deaths of the two 
Japanese students. We should instead focus on how to rid American society of 
racism and the violence it breeds. This is not a Japanese problem. It is an 
American problem. It should no longer be easier to get a gun than a driver's 
license.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW: JAMES LEACH; VIEWING WHITEWATER AS A MATTER OF 
PUBLIC ETHICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Ross, Michael Ross covers Congress for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not given to overstatement, Rep. James A. Leach of Iowa is the first to admit 
that, as scandals go, Whitewater is no Watergate. And yet by a twist of fate, 
Watergate was indirectly responsible for the fact that Leach now finds himself 
cast as President Bill Clinton's chief congressional accuser in the controversy 
involving a failed Arkansas thrift and its ties to a real-estate venture half 
owned by the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 Two decades ago, it was Watergate and a confrontation with another President 
-- Richard M. Nixon -- that changed Leach's life, propelling him into politics 
and setting him on a career path that would lead to the House Banking 
Committee, where he now sits as ranking Republican. Then a rising young 
diplomat with a masters degree in Russian studies, Leach had just been assigned 
to Moscow when Nixon fired Archibald Cox as special Watergate prosecutor in the 
Saturday Night Massacre. Outraged by the abuse of presidential power, Leach 
promptly resigned from the Foreign Service, saying his conscience no longer 
allowed him to serve in Nixon's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Moscow, Leach went home to Davenport, Iowa, to help run the family 
propane-gas business. When he launched his first bid for Congress in 1974, only 
four people showed up for the rally. However, one of them, architect Elizabeth 
Foxley, became his wife the following year. They have two children. Elected on 
his second try in 1976, Leach has easily won reelection ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken and almost priestly in demeanor -- a colleague jokes that when 
Leach speaks, he expects "the words to come out in Latin" -- Leach is, at first 
blush, an unlikely candidate to take on the President. Though a fiscal 
conservative, Leach is so liberal on social issues that his fellow Republicans 
frequently deride him as a "crypto-Democrat." Indeed, Leach's main targets have 
been Republicans -- Nixon for Watergate, Ronald Reagan for Iran-Contra and the 
GOP leadership for its embrace of the religious right. He was a friend and 
defender of George Bush, but often voted against the latter's positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Leach, 51, was perhaps best known for the crusade he waged in the 
Banking Committee during the 1980s, to stave off what he warned was an 
impending S&L crisis by requiring thrifts to increase their capital and 
restrict speculative investments. At the time, he was widely ignored by both 
Democrats and GOP, who now ruefully admit they were wrong while he alone was 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 In Whitewater, Leach has an issue that friends say engages his two main 
passions: banking and public ethics. And in the party pariah, the GOP 
leadership has found an unlikely but useful champion -- whose squeaky-clean 
record and history of nonpartisanship makes him nearly impervious to Democratic 
charges that he is only trying to embarrass Clinton for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The polls suggest Americans are still unsure what Whitewater is 
about and have trouble understanding the Clintons' role in it. So to start 
with, what is Whitewater about and why should Americans care about it?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Whitewater is about conflicts of interest . . . involving a 
real-estate investment in which one-half of a partnership put in substantially 
more resources than the other half. They also involve the intermixing of 
taxpayer-guaranteed resources with a private venture, to the potential 
advantage of a public official. That is what makes the circumstance a public 
rather than simply a private interest. It should be stressed that on the public 
record is the fact that a failed savings and loan infused far more capital into 
Whitewater than then-Gov. (Clinton). 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, you have a conflict of interest in multithousand-dollar 
proportions which may have contributed to multimillion-dollar losses for the 
taxpayer when the S&L subsequently failed -- due, in part, to its investment in 
Whitewater and other real-estate ventures of quasi-similar composition. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You have been conducting your own Whitewater probe and have turned over the 
results to Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. What evidence did you find to 
show that money was diverted from Madison Guaranty to Whitewater?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We provided a series of check stubs that show money flowing (into 
Whitewater) from Madison-affiliated entities. Then there is on the public 
record the Madison Marketing $7,500 check that went to pay off a Clinton loan. 
Then (RTC investigator) Jean Lewis has indicated that she found approximately 
$70,000 going . . . into Whitewater over a six-month period alone. 
</P>
<P>
 So you have three precise sets of evidence. One is the $7,500 check; one is 
the $70,000 transfer, for which, by the way, there is also a check trail, and 
thirdly, the check stubs that relate to a series of small transfers in an 
earlier time period. That is the evidentiary circumstance laid on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And do you believe the Clintons were aware of at least some of these 
transfers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: If one views the former governor and former first lady of Arkansas as 
passive investors with little involvement in the deal-making ethos of the 
politics of the time in Arkansas, then it is credible to assume that they might 
not have known. On the other hand, if one's assessment of (the Clintons) is a 
little more skeptical, one might reach a different conclusion. Those are 
judgmental elements at this time, not proven circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But let me stress that Whitewater also received an infusion of funds from a 
small-business investment corporation (Capital Management Services, Inc.) . . . 
and its former head, who has plea-bargained with the special counsel, has 
alleged that the governor urged him to make this particular loan and that the 
funds for this loan originally came from a substantial loan from the S&L 
Madison Guaranty. So these are the allegations on the table, though they are by 
no means proven. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Polls also indicate that most Americans believe the media is paying too 
much attention to Whitewater. How has the media handled it in your view?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, we have given too much attention to the issue. My own sense is that 
what you have here is an issue of public ethics that deserves being raised -- 
and then deserves being resolved. All the minority ever requested almost five 
months ago was for a hearing on the subject. If that hearing had occurred, this 
would have been a one-to-three-week issue. As it worked out, the decision to 
deny public accountability piqued public interest, and particularly press 
interest, and the issue escalated . . . . It's one of the reasons why I have 
repeatedly suggested that, with full public disclosure and full accountability, 
I am more than willing -- in fact, I am quite eager -- to bring this issue to 
resolution. It's my view that accountability is in order, but that a 
constitutional crisis is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Republicans say Democrats are trying to keep Whitewater from coming out. 
But didn't Republicans try to do the same thing with Democratic-driven probes 
like Watergate, Iran-Contra and Iraqgate -- which you yourself opposed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Wait just a minute. I am on the public record as supporting the Iraqgate 
inquiry. I was also Congress' leading critic on the legal and constitutional 
implications of the Iran-Contra policy. I supported every investigation in the 
House Banking Committee -- including those critical of a number of Republicans. 
In fact, I suggested the investigation of Republican Gov. (Fife) Symington . . 
. . The only investigation I had doubts about was the so-called October 
Surprise, which is the one issue in which George Bush was somewhat vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I didn't draw the same conclusion that everyone did (about Iraqgate) . . 
. . But I supported the decision to go ahead with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been described as moderate and nonpartisan. But now some Democrats 
are saying that ambition has driven you to the right; that you're looking for a 
party- leadership position; that you're much more partisan now. Who is Jim 
Leach, and why is he so fixed on Whitewater?  
</P>
<P>
 A: First, let me say that I'm perplexed at all of the motivational queries. In 
all of the major (congressional) probes of the last several decades, no one .. 
. . questioned the motives (for holding them). In terms of party leadership, 
I'm not a candidate for any House leadership position, and I've made that very 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you're looking for motives, part of it relates to a strongly held 
conviction that public ethics are not an issue of the left, right or the 
center. I feel this very strongly. To paraphrase Barry Goldwater, "Moderation 
in the pursuit of truth is no virtue and vigilance in defense of public ethics 
no vice." 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of happenstances, I came to be the ranking member of the committee of 
jurisdiction over the S&L circumstance . . . in which state governments in a 
small number of states played a significant role in the losses that occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 I've argued that there is a tripod of responsibility for the largest, single, 
domestic public-policy mistake of the century -- the quarter-trillion-dollar 
S&L debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 One part of the tripod relates to loose laws passed by a loose Congress; a 
second part relates to ideological decision-making within the Reagan 
Administration on deregulating an industry that demanded certain standards, and 
the third part relates to a small number of states -- in particular, Texas, 
Louisiana, Arkansas, and California -- which failed both at the regulatory end 
and at the legislative and executive levels to recognize their responsibilities 
to the deposit-insurance system . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In Arkansas, the percentage losses were as extraordinary as they were in any 
state . . . . While Whitewater started out as just a basic real-estate 
development effort, by the time it was over, it had become a real-estate 
development effort that included substantial infusions of taxpayer-guaranteed 
resources . . . . In the end, it was the taxpayer that picked up the tab for 
some of the speculative investments of a political figure. 
</P>
<P>
 So all I would suggest is that motivational aspersions are no substitute for 
full disclosure. They are not answers to the questions raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you under pressure from the GOP leadership to press ahead with your 
probe?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, sir. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the motives of some of your more partisan colleagues?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I am very ill at ease with speaking about partisanship, but I will say 
this: It is a responsibility of all minority parties in all Western democracies 
to shine the spotlight of embarrassment on the ruling or governing parties when 
they breach the law or breach public ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 I also believe it's the constitutional duty of a member of Congress to oversee 
the executive branch . . . . By chance, as the ranking member of the committee 
of jurisdiction, a little extra responsibility has fallen on my shoulders. Not 
by choice, but by circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Democrats say they will allow Whitewater hearings only if they don't 
interfere with Fiske's investigation. Are you confident that hearings will be 
held?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's more likely they will be held in the Senate than in the House . . . . 
But I have some doubts that full-blown hearings will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will you press the issue when Congress returns from its spring recess?  
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a good time for a bit of a respite. There is no individual in 
America who would be happier to put this issue behind them more than I -- with 
the possible exception of the President and the First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you saying you are not going to press for hearings, that you've made 
your case and are ready to let things lie as they are for a while?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, no . . . . But my own sense is that now would be a good time to give 
the special counsel a little bit of rope to proceed. While Congress has 
historically had in-tandem probes with U.S. attorneys or special prosecutors, 
there is no necessity that they occur at this time. A little slack isn't 
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you confident Fiske will do a thorough job in his investigation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I firmly believe Fiske is a very honorable man and that he will do a very 
honorable job. If I were to give him any advice, it would simply be to give the 
President of the United States the benefit of the doubt at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The Democrats fear Republicans will use Whitewater to sidetrack health care 
and other issues on Clinton's legislative agenda. What is the likelihood that 
Whitewater will overshadow the congressional agenda?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I personally, totally and completely concur that it's crucial we not let an 
issue like this sidetrack the three main agenda items of this year in Congress 
-- which are health, welfare reform and crime legislation . . . . But the way 
you put Whitewater behind is to have full disclosure and full accounting. 
Unless and until you do, Whitewater will continue to have a momentum of its 
own.

A 'WHIPPING BOY' SHINES IN CALIFORNIA ; AMID CRITICISM OF HEALTH CARE 
ALLIANCES, ONE PURCHASING GROUP HAS LOTS OF HAPPY CUSTOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the debate over health care reform, health care "alliances," or group 
purchasing pools, have become one of the favorite whipping boys in Washington. 
Under President Clinton's health care reform plan, a health care alliance would 
be a government-established regional agency; as a patient-doctor go-between, it 
would negotiate for the best prices for medical services. These alliances, a 
key part of the Clinton plan, have been denounced as the vehicles by which 
government would dictate how often a patient saw a physician and which 
physician the patient saw. Such alliances, opponents maintain, would prove to 
be prototypes of government bureaucracy run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it doesn't have to be that way, and it's not that way for 40,000 
workers who are members of the nation's first working alliance. It's called the 
Health Insurance Plan of California, and Times staff writer Robert A. 
Rosenblatt has found it has a lot of happy customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are key differences between the little-known HIPC alliance and what 
Clinton proposes: The HIPC is voluntary and privately run. Thus the major 
objections to Clinton's version of health alliances are removed. And while the 
HIPC doesn't have the political baggage of the Clinton alliances, it still 
retains the major advantage: Through it, consumers can negotiate better prices 
by virtue of having banding together. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it works. In Los Angeles County, a worker whose company has joined 
the HIPC can choose among 15 health insurance plans, including health 
maintenance organizations. Monthly fees vary, with the company paying at least 
half of the cost of the lowest-priced plan. The worker pays the rest. Rates are 
10% to 15% lower than many comparable conventional plans. In one dramatic 
example, a Van Nuys firm was quoted a premium of $2,500 a month for seven 
workers; last summer it joined the HIPC and now pays $780 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was in part the fear that the government would mandate health 
care alliances that gave impetus to the creation of voluntary programs. In 
Florida, where a voluntary alliance will start in May, Gov. Lawton Chiles 
admitted that the President's plan was a tremendous incentive to get moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan, which by Clinton's own admission has virtually no chance 
of remaining intact, indeed needs revision. But the important lesson offered by 
the impressive California experience so far is that labels alone mean nothing. 
Health care alliances, or purchasing pools, are not inherently evil. As a 
matter of fact, when set up properly they can work quite well.

FROM DEVASTATION TO URBAN REBIRTH; A RARE COALITION WILL BOOST AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING IN 23 CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, the Bronx and other similarly poor urban 
communities, nonprofit developers doggedly rebuild. Against seemingly 
impossible odds, these groups of activist citizens rejuvenate devastated areas. 
Their successful track records have prompted a promising and unusual 
partnership of foundations, corporations and the federal government that will 
invest a stunning $87.6 million to create affordable housing in 23 cities. Los 
Angeles, fortunately, made the list. 
</P>
<P>
 THE VISION: The expanded National Community Development Initiative, the vision 
of Peter C. Goldmark Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation, boasts 
corporate heavyweights such as the Prudential Insurance Co. of America, which 
put in $15.1 million, and J. P. Morgan & Co., which invested $12 million. 
Rockefeller donated $15 million and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation added $6 million. Others also contributed. The beauty of this 
partnership is that it allows community developers to access financing from the 
global markets. That's a remarkable connection for urban groups that often have 
had trouble borrowing a few dollars from the local bank. 
</P>
<P>
 At President Clinton's request, Congress put up $20 million for participation 
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. HUD Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros, who sees this ambitious effort as a means to direct more private 
money into low-rent housing, eagerly courts public-private partnerships. These 
creative partnerships are the new building blocks of affordable housing.  
</P>
<P>
 The money will be funneled to community developers by two experienced 
affordable housing advocates -- the Enterprise Foundation of Maryland and the 
national Local Initiative Support Corp. For years they have helped nonprofit 
developers capitalize on investments generated by the affordable housing tax 
credit and have taken the lead on low-income housing and community development 
projects across the nation. Both provide technical expertise to 
citizens-turn-builders, and a layer of protection for the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SUCCESSES: There is really little risk involved, however, in dealing with 
most experienced community developers. Projects like the successful Nehemiah 
program in Brooklyn have put homeownership within reach of low-income families. 
Los Angeles, though slow to get in on this trend, can count successes by 
community developers on Skid Row, in Watts and in the Pico-Union neighborhood, 
among others. These projects work because the developers run a tight ship. They 
screen tenants, require timely rent payments and otherwise manage competently. 
Now, a cadre of experienced activists are ready to take their skills to a 
higher level. They need money, and lots of it, but they can no longer count 
solely on the federal government.

 Few for-profit developers would clamor to build in neighborhoods synonymous 
with slums unless they could get generous government incentives. In the heyday 
of urban renewal 30 years ago, HUD provided grants, low-interest loans and 
other fiscal encouragement. Funding from HUD began drying up during the Reagan 
and Bush administrations. Shifting priorities and a HUD scandal that allowed 
politically connected "consultants" to skim off huge fees for little work 
decimated the construction programs.  
</P>
<P>
 This new partnership won't provide housing for everyone who needs it. But 
thanks to groups such as the Local Initiative Support Corp., there finally is 
greater incentive to rebuild troubled communities.

HOW TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE; ANSWERING THE ABSURDITY OF THE ROBERTI RECALL 
APRIL 12 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortness of that period offers the best representation of how silly, 
vindictive and wasteful the recall election against Sen. David A. Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys) is. Voters in the San Fernando Valley's 20th Senate District 
already were scheduled to go to the polls on June 7 for a primary. That was the 
logical first step in selecting a successor for Roberti, who because of term 
limits is set to step down on Dec. 5 anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, financially strapped Los Angeles County will have to waste $800,000 
to $1 million to conduct another election on April 12, the one in which Roberti 
either will be ousted from his seat or allowed to complete his few remaining 
months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 We have the gun lobby to thank for this stunt. It paid big bucks to gather 
signatures for the recall election and forced this mockery of the process on us 
because of Roberti's eminently sensible support of tighter gun control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitutional Rights Federation, a San Fernando Valley gun owners group, 
spearheaded the signature-gathering. One of the five little-known challengers 
on the recall ballot is a gun store owner. Another is a Valley gun club 
official. A third was the victim of a house burglary recently in which the 
thief escaped with $12,500 in guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is leading 2 to 1 in the polls, and the recall backers have managed to 
raise just $164,000 since last July (one such fund-raising idea included, of 
course, a gun raffle). Still, the recall effort should not be ignored or taken 
lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be used to send a message to any and all who would bastardize the 
recall process because they disagree with an elected official on a single 
issue. It should be used to demonstrate that such juvenile antics will not be 
tolerated by a sophisticated Los Angeles electorate. Defeat the recall on April 
12. Keep Roberti in office until the end of his term, and send that message.

RODNEY KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Rodney King was hurt pretty badly by the Los Angeles Police Department, but 
he survived and will be able to enjoy life again. Now he wants to be a 
millionaire and sues the City of Los Angeles for $9.5 million for the physical 
and mental pain he suffered. If the jury decides that he should get that 
amount, how big a pension should go to the family members of a police officer 
killed on duty by a hoodlum? I don't think that a police officer's pension 
comes even close to the amount that Rodney King wants. Are a few broken bones, 
pain, and stress worth more than a police officer's life? Was King completely 
without any responsibility when this whole ordeal happened?

 * I received a mass mailing from former LAPD Sgt. Stacey Koon wanting me to 
sign an agreement that I felt he and Officer Laurence Powell got a "raw deal" 
and were political scapegoats for ambitious and cowardly politicians, and to 
enclose a note of condolence to his family. I of course feel remorseful for the 
family, but I do not feel he got a raw deal. He claims that he followed the 
standards of the LAPD, which I doubt, and if their atrocious behavior is a 
standard of performance, the whole Police Department needs to be examined. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't care whether Rodney King was an ex-felon or high on an illegal 
substance or gave the police a little lip. None is an excuse to be beaten 
nearly to death. Clearly from the video there was mass overreaction, as 
sufficient police officers to subdue King were present. No, Sgt. Koon, you got 
exactly what you had coming as the senior police officer at the scene. The 
police must be held to a high standard of behavior or else they will all be cut 
out of the same cloth as the people they arrest.

SPORTSMANSHIP AND HANDSHAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "When Handshake Is Setback to Sportsmanship," March 25: 
</P>
<P>
 The Marmonte School District's decision to forbid post-game handshakes 
reflects much more than a school problem in east Ventura County. It goes to the 
core of the struggle for values in our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Few would condone sports violence, on or off the field. Many of us would like 
to fix the responsibility -- the blame -- for violence on someone who was there 
-- the players, the coaches, the spectators -- all pulling for a victory. But 
winning, as fun as it is, is increasingly treated as a substitute for genuine 
self-worth, as a way for me to feel good about myself because I or my team 
"won." It's a societal problem; we're all involved. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens on the sports field can teach a lot about values and identity. 
Striving mightily can teach about expanding one's capacity, about discipline 
and perseverance. Competition, including winning and losing, can promote 
excellence. All of that is good. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone can win; not even the very best can win all the time. 
Counting on winning to boost your self-worth is a dream, an impossible dream. 
However, doing your thing with totality, being "all you can be" is within the 
reach of all of us all the time. One needs only to watch the faces of the 
Special Olympians to understand this principle. 
</P>
<P>
 When you win, win with grace. When you lose, lose with the pride in having 
done your best. And, after the game, you can freely shake hands because you 
know what's really important. 
</P>
<P>

 * As a basketball coach and teacher for 12 years, I am very distressed to see 
that the Marmonte League has decided to eliminate the after-game handshake. I 
see this as a failure of parents, administrators and coaches to instill and 
support the true values of high school athletics: the spirit of competition and 
sportsmanship. We lower our expectations of our young people when we back off 
from such values and standards. And with lowered expectations we will receive 
lesser results. Instead of expecting less of our youth, we should hold them to 
high standards; we should insist that our student-athletes exhibit 
sportsmanship above all else. To do otherwise is a sign of "giving up," a 
contradiction of the spirit of competition. Let us not give up on young people, 
and let us expect them to win the battle of sportsmanship! 
</P>
<P>
 MARC PAEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Banning High School, LAUSD 
</P>
<P>
 * The Maramonte League's decision to ban the postgame handshake is a temporary 
solution to a much greater problem. I find it extremely sad that athletes are 
creating trouble during the final handshake, a time when the animosities of the 
game should be forgotten and sportsmanship revealed. These students are either 
looking for status points among their peers or are truly angered and feel that 
their actions are justifiable. In either case, society is at fault -- our 
dilapidated society. Look where we are headed. Sure, we may lose the postgame 
handshake, no big deal -- but what will follow? It appears that we are setting 
ourselves up for new rules: no contact or verbal exchanges before, during, or 
after the game, and no teaching of sportsmanship required. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportsmanship will continue to decrease, and danger to players will increase. 
By losing the handshake we are succumbing to the deterioration of civilized 
life.

GERMAN JOBLESS RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re your article on unemployment in Germany, March 9: It starts by stating that 
German unemployment figures are "climbing toward the jobless levels that helped 
bring Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler to power in 1933." 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, this statement is incorrect. Today's economic situation in 
Germany, including unemployment, is totally different from that of the early 
'30s.In February, 1932, unemployment figures reached their climax of 6.128 
million, corresponding to 44% of the total German labor force at that time. 
Since February, 1929, unemployment had doubled. On the other hand, state 
subsidies for the unemployed constantly declined during the same period, 
finally falling below the minimum living wage. German economic output in 1932 
was almost 50% lower than in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the jobless rate of 10.5% is not only four times lower than in 1932, 
but fits into a completely different picture.  
</P>
<P>
 The statement in question also contains an undertone suggesting that Germany 
might somehow be again at the brink of a new Nazi dictatorship. This, I think, 
is unfair, considering the actual situation in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly historic knowledge and awareness as well as comparisons to the past 
are necessary and useful. But sincere journalism should not revive specters and 
myths which have no relevance to the political reality and tend to nurture or 
raise prejudices and fears that are by no means justified. Rather than repeat 
them we should dissolve them by means of sober analysis, just as your 
reporter's further explanations tend to dissolve her opening statement.

8TH DISTRICT PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Ron Harris' column, "Between the Plan and Reality . . . Falls the Shadow" 
(March 25), derides Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas' efforts to plan on grounds 
that the capital necessary to make plans real is often lacking. He belabors the 
obvious point that plans themselves do not solve urban problems; people do.Only 
in passing does Harris note the councilman's efforts to involve citizens in 
planning and governing their own communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In my view, the interesting story in the 8th District is about the Empowerment 
Congress, an initiative of the councilman's which enables citizens to build 
communities and to shape and implement a strategic vision for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Please give us stories about constructive efforts to make our city work and 
applaud those individuals who are making a difference in revitalizing our city.

COLUMN LEFT / TODD GITLIN; HOW REAGAN SLID PAST THE WATCHDOGS; REPORTERS SAVE 
THEIR TOUGHEST SCRUTINY FOR DEMOCRATS, PERHAPS TRYING TO PROVE 'OBJECTIVITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD GITLIN, Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology at UC Berkeley, is the 
author of several books on politics, society and culture, and most recently of 
a novel, The Murder of Albert Einstein (Bantam). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he ran for his second term in the Statehouse, the governor refused to 
disclose his financial assets. To do such a thing, he said, would constitute 
"an invasion of privacy." "I have no conflict of interest whatsoever," he 
declared. That year, he paid not a penny in state income tax. Yet, when the 
governor moved to the White House more than a decade later, the press declined 
to rake him over the coals for his secretiveness. They did not fill the front 
pages with investigations of the "business reverses" that the governor claimed 
had entitled him to a zero tax bill, although it was well known that he 
consorted with multimillionaires who profited greatly from his gubernatorial 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor-turned-President to whom I refer is, of course, Ronald Reagan. 
Reporter Lou Cannon notes in his 1982 book, "Reagan," that the governor 
qualified for "an immense property-tax break" under a California law intended 
to reward ranchers and farmers for keeping land in agricultural use rather than 
selling it off for subdivisions. When Reagan purchased his Santa Barbara County 
property in 1974, it was a working cattle ranch for which the previous owner 
had acquired "agricultural preserve" status. Had the ranch been valued at the 
low end of its estimated market value of $1 million, Reagan's property tax bill 
for 1979 would have been $42,000. What he actually paid that year was $862. And 
what did Reagan do to keep his property zoned as an "agricultural preserve"? He 
grazed 22 head of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 My point is not that Reagan owned too few beasts to qualify for special 
treatment under the law, but that if Bill Clinton had owned the identical 
beasts, the fearless gentlemen and women of the press would have beaten the 
bushes to scare them into the light of day. The President's accountants and 
lawyers and veterinarians would have been flushed out into the floodlights. The 
minority party would have beaten their breasts in unison for a special 
prosecutor. "Ranchgate" would have dogged the President the rest of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Teflon isn't born, it's sprayed; and it's the press that does the spraying. 
How's this for a controlled experiment: During the 1980 campaign, the New York 
Times' Jeff Gerth did a series on Reagan's businessmen cronies, who were 
checking out his prospective staff members; it ran, all right -- in the 
business section. During the 1992 campaign, Gerth's comparable explorations 
into the mud of Arkansas ran on the front page, as have many sequels. 
</P>
<P>
 I have compared the coverage of Reagan's first month in office with the 
coverage of Clinton's, and the difference is astonishing. In all the New York 
Times coverage of Reagan's first month in 1981, I find a grand total of two 
front-page articles that contain any significant criticism of his policies, 
speeches, appointments or demeanor. In the Washington Post, the first month of 
coverage revealed no front-page criticism by anyone for any reason. Compare the 
front-page tattoo that has never let up on Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted that Clinton started slowly and sloppily and that Reagan was backed by 
a chorus of newly released hostages to put the press into a feel-good mood, 
there is still a discrepancy that begs for explanation. Nor is Clinton the only 
victim. Jimmy Carter ran as an outsider, but once in the White House this 
Southern Democrat was excoriated for bringing his entourage of Georgia rubes to 
the capital. Clinton ran as an outsider, too, only to be blasted for ushering 
his own home-state battalions through the portals of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Question for savvy political reporters: How many governors of American states 
build power machines without doing plenty of favors for people who can afford 
to buy them? 
</P>
<P>
 Then why does the press lean so hard on Democrats? The sanctimonious Southern 
Baptist style doesn't go over well with the pundits; Charles Krauthammer went 
so far in the March 28 Time magazine as to say that crimes aren't the point, 
that what makes Whitewater's foam worthy of front-page treatment is that it 
proves 1960s idealists are money-grubbers. (Other money-grubbers are therefore 
excused.) As for reporters, they're often Democrats themselves and bend over 
backward to prove they're "objective." Publishers and proprietors, of course, 
are more likely Republicans, though they rarely intervene to shade the coverage 
of the news. (They rarely have to.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, the press has no built-in sense of proportion. Maniacal 
competition fuels the search for the smoking misdeed. Hype is a drug, and the 
media are prone to go on binges. Thus do the guardians of public information 
put the Clintons in their place -- in the gutter, with the rest of the country.

PERSPECTIVE ON CHINA; SPEAK LOUDLY AND HIDE THE STICK; KEEP CHANNELS OPEN ON 
HUMAN-RIGHTS SUPPORT; RESERVE SANCTIONS FOR EXTREME CRIMES, SEVERE THREATS TO 
U.S. INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARVIN OTT, Marvin Ott is a professor specializing Asian security issues at 
the National War College in Washington. The views expressed here are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The diplomatic train wreck resulting from Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's trip to China highlights the urgent requirement for a workable 
U.S. human-rights policy toward Asia. The issue goes well beyond China and 
resonates powerfully in South and Southeast Asia as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Democracy and human rights have been themes in U.S. foreign policy as old as 
the Republic. In fact, the idea that America could exert influence in the world 
on behalf of these values can be traced back to colonial days, when John 
Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, evoked the 
classic image of America as "a city on a hill" -- an example to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 No successful U.S. foreign policy can long ignore these values; the electorate 
will not permit it. But the Clinton Administration's strong impulse to champion 
human rights has not been matched with a clear strategy to avoid provoking 
disputes that undercut other important policy interests. In Asia, these 
interests involve economic ties with a region that is the world's 
fastest-growing. U.S. security commitments include the Korean peninsula where, 
not incidentally, Chinese cooperation is critical to dealing with an emergent 
North Korean nuclear weapons capability. 
</P>
<P>
 America and Asia come to the human-rights debate each bolstered by recent 
historic successes. The U.S. victory in the Cold War seemed to validate 
American political and economic values. Given the region's spectacular economic 
performance over the past two decades, many Asians believe (and some Western 
observers agree) that they have developed a model for an advanced modern 
economy that differs in significant respects from -- and is demonstrably 
superior to -- the American orthodox faith in free markets and minimal 
government intrusion. Newly confident Asian leaderships are in no mood to take 
lessons from a United States that many see as deeply flawed, living well beyond 
its means with a society ill-disciplined and riven by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the cultural foundations of Asian society differ importantly from 
those in the West. Among these differences is the comparatively higher value 
Asians assign to group welfare and harmony as opposed to individual rights. 
Consequently, Asian views of democracy and civil liberties often differ 
substantially from those in America. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then is to be done? Is there a policy mix that supports vital U.S. 
interests in Asia while giving due regard to human-rights concerns? There is, 
and it can be summarized as "speak loudly and keep your stick in the closet." 
Specifically: 
</P>
<P>
 * Articulate support for democratic and human-rights values through a variety 
of political and diplomatic means: official government statements, speeches by 
political leaders, congressional resolutions and diplomatic representations, 
including contact with and sympathy for victims of political oppression and 
human-rights abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do nothing to discourage the activities of nongovernmental human-rights 
organizations like Asia Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cooperate fully in preparing congressionally mandated reports regarding the 
human-rights performance of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But: 
</P>
<P>
 * Adopt a little humility in dealing with Asia by acknowledging that these are 
some of the world's most ancient and sophisticated cultures, and maybe 
Americans do not have all the answers about how they can best organize their 
domestic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acknowledge that on some of the issues in which the United States adopted 
sanctions for human-rights purposes a full U.S. (or at least congressional) 
understanding of the circumstances and motivations was often lacking. For 
example, U.S. sanctioning of Malaysia for its rejection of Vietnamese boat 
people came despite Malaysia's years of accepting these refugees or, in the 
worst case, diverting them to refugee centers in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Understand that the most powerful agents for democratization are: 
modernization and rising living standards (including the emergence of a middle 
class); the explosion of international communications; person-to-person contact 
with America, especially through education in the United States of Asian 
college students and military officers, and the example of a successful, 
democratic and humane America. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sanctions, such as trade restrictions or denial of most-favored-nation 
status should be reserved for core national interests (to pressure China 
regarding the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, for one) not human 
rights. The only exceptions should be when the human-rights abuses are 
sustained and brutal in the extreme, as in the Khmer Rouge slaughter in 
Cambodia, or when voted by the U.N. Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 President Kennedy summarized his hemispheric human-rights policy more than 
three decades ago with the phrase: "A polite handshake for dictators; a warm 
abrazo for democrats." It is a formula as applicable today in Asia as it was 
then in Latin America.

WHY PURGING THE LAPD OF BIAS WON'T BE EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David D. Dotson, David D. Dotson, former assistant chief of police of the 
Los Angeles Police Department, is working on a book on the history of LAPD 
leadership. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within the Los Angeles Police Department, there is gender-based bias and 
widespread sexual harassment. Many officers openly express anti-gay and 
anti-lesbian feelings. Racial prejudice, personal and institutional, is still a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone skeptical of the truth of these assertions need only attend the City 
Council Personnel Committee hearings currently in progress. The first-person 
horror stories, ranging from improper comments to rape, being told to council 
members are appalling, especially in light of the LAPD's efforts to recruit 
more women. Even more appalling is the message implied by the reported 
responses of management to these complaints: We have more important things to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the department's leadership during the last 50 years -- years 
of momentous changes in society -- helps to explain why the LAPD has dragged 
its feet in dealing with hateful attitudes. It also provides an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Parker, who served as chief from 1950-66, was perhaps the nation's 
foremost voice on how to prevent police corruption and promote professionalism. 
Under him, the LAPD became a model for big-city departments worldwide. 
Functional specialization and operational efficiency were its hallmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker's view of society was rooted in the late 19th Century. Women 
officers, though they had demonstrated a capacity to assume broader 
responsibilities during World War II when their male counterparts were fighting 
overseas, were kept firmly tucked into secondary roles, with limited status and 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward M. Davis, chief during most of the 1970s, was also nationally known as 
an innovator in organizational and operational matters. Under him, a nascent 
community-based policing organization and philosophy took shape. Attention was 
paid to race relations, both inside and outside the department, resulting in 
some progress. But when women officers began pressing for equal status, Davis 
reportedly said that he would put women in radio cars when the Los Angeles Rams 
put them on their offensive line. When the city agreed to hire women as 
full-duty officers as part of a settlement of a lawsuit, Davis stopped hiring 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl F. Gates, who succeeded Davis, had been Parker's protege. As such, his 
organizational philosophy and approach to policing largely reflected the ideas 
of his mentor. This mind-set hurt efforts to improve race relations within and 
outside the department and threw up new hurdles for women officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in Gates' tenure, he reluctantly agreed to a "unisex" hiring program to 
return the department's force levels to those before Davis stopped hiring. His 
statements reflected his reservations about the capability of women to be 
full-duty officers. While his personal-staff selections suggested attention to 
matters of race and gender, Gates failed to hold his commanders accountable for 
the lack of diversity within their commands. 
</P>
<P>
 Given this history of leadership, coupled with a Police Commission unwilling 
to demand better, is it surprising that bias and discrimination and harassment 
still occur in the LAPD? 
</P>
<P>
 But just as leadership allowed these attitudes to fester, leadership can 
reform, even eliminate, them. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council committee hearings have produced a consensus that those in 
charge should be held accountable for sexual harassment within the LAPD. Some 
council members have contended that authority for investigating harassment 
complaints and disposing of them should be removed from the chief of police. 
Without outside direction and assistance, one council member suggested, reform 
will be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony of those who felt victimized twice -- once by harassers, then by 
the department -- makes clear the need for independent, high-level monitoring 
of the process. There is a clear need to not only ensure that management 
appropriately respond to complaints but that it also protect the complainant 
from retaliation, unwarranted invasions of privacy and ostracism. 
</P>
<P>
 But responsibility for elimination of the effects of bias and discrimination 
must remain with the chief. Denying Willie L. Williams full authority to 
address the issues denies the public and their representatives the opportunity 
to hold him accountable for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has indicated his willingness to be held accountable. He has made it 
clear that sexual harassment is unacceptable. He has even backed up his words 
with action by correcting the inadequate responses of subordinates to such 
complaints. He has proposed the establishment of a unit composed of specially 
trained investigators, reporting directly to his office, to investigate 
allegations of discrimination and sexual harassment. He has vowed appropriate 
and swift action when the charges prove true. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the legal machinery for holding Williams responsible is in place. In 
1992, voters approved changes in the City Charter giving the chief greater 
latitude in holding his subordinates accountable. Williams should be encouraged 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the principle that those in charge should be accountable, the 
Police Commission must assume full oversight responsibility. At the very least, 
it should set up a mechanism that assures confidentially and keeps tabs on 
complaints as they move from investigation to judgment. Commission members 
should be available to hear complainants' appeals or those of other parties. 
They should regularly review the performance of the chief and his department in 
correcting discrimination and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time the City Council and mayor work together to make available the 
resources needed to deal with misconduct in the LAPD. The relatively few 
dollars involved would be a pittance when compared with the harmful 
consequences of anything less.

COMMENTARY; HE CERTAINLY ISN'T THE FIRST; THE COMEDY OF MARTIN LAWRENCE HAS 
CAUSED SOME CONTROVERSY OF LATE. BUT, WE'VE BEEN HERE MANY TIMES BEFORE. WHY IS 
THE STAR OF FOX TV'S 'MARTIN' BEING SINGLED OUT WHEN SO MANY HAVE ALREADY BEEN 
BLUE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEL WATKINS, Mel Watkins is the author of On the Real Side: Laughing, Lying 
and Signifyingthe Underground Tradition of African-American Humor That 
Transformed American Culture, From Slavery to Richard Pryor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Check out most any social gathering involving the under-30 crowd these days, 
and you're likely to hear such exclamations as "You so crazy," "Wass up?" and 
"You go, girl!" punctuating the conversation and eliciting peals of laughter. 
It's no accident, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first comic performance, one measure of a comedian's popularity has 
been how readily his or her signature lines have been accepted in everyday 
speech and offstage joking. The stage banter of the 19th-Century minstrel 
characters Tambo and Bones, for instance, produced puns and riddles ("Why did 
the chicken cross the road?" and "Why does a fireman wear red suspenders?") 
that became a part of the culture and even today remain popular among children. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, many of the funniest or most poignant lines introduced by African 
American comics have become commonplace in black street talk. Among them are 
quips by comics from Moms Mabley ("Ain't nothin' an old man can do for me, 
'cept introduce me to a young one") and Mantan Moreland ("Feets, don't fail me 
now") to Flip Wilson ("The devil made me do it" or "What you see is what you 
get") and Richard Pryor ("I got to have eight hours sleep . . . and a bowl of 
Wheaties" or "I went down there looking for justice. That's what I found, just 
us. ") 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, then, nowadays African American social chatter and repartee 
often echo lines by the fast-rising and, of late, controversial comic Martin 
Lawrence. Most were popularized on his Fox Television sitcom "Martin," where as 
Martin Payne, the zany deejay at WZUP (as in, "Wass up") radio in Detroit, 
Lawrence has attracted an avid following that cuts across racial lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The show revolves around problems and misunderstandings arising from Martin's 
attempt to establish an honest relationship with his girlfriend (they've 
considered moving in together in recent episodes) while maintaining the macho 
image expected by his two single buddies. That scenario allows the 
elastic-faced Lawrence to exploit the broad, physical humor at which he excels. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Martin," Lawrence combines the manic physical style displayed by Jimmie 
Walker on "Good Times" and the charm and exuberance of Flip Wilson with his own 
brand of hip-hop posturing, lunacy and bravado. That bravado, however, only 
barely conceals the vulnerability and sensitivity that have led one writer to 
call the comic a "teddy bear on caffeine." Lawrence adds another dimension to 
the irreverent, cocksure humor popularized by Eddie Murphy in the '80s. His 
ability to expose the softer, lovable side of his macho homeboy character 
accounts for much of the show's popularity, particularly among young people. It 
has ranked as one of the top five shows among viewers age 12 to 17 and has even 
ranked near the top among viewers 11 and under. "I'm huge with the under-5 
crowd," the 29-year-old Lawrence has joked. 
</P>
<P>
 But much like Redd Foxx (who in NBC's "Sanford and Son" made the lovable but 
irascible old junkman Fred Sanford a household word during the 1970s but never 
abandoned his blue stand-up act), Lawrence is not content with cornering 
Nielsen ratings among the Pee-wee Herman set or in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood. 
While hosting "Russell Simmons Def Comedy Jam," an HBO showcase for black 
comedians that often strains to surpass its own reputation for outrageous, 
in-your-face ribaldry, Lawrence touted it as the show "where we black 
comedians" could open up. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when free of network TV censors, Lawrence usually casts off all 
restraints. For a sample of his unadulterated work, pick up "Martin Lawrence 
Talkin' Sh-t," his debut comedy album, which was released last fall and quickly 
climbed to a Top 20 ranking on the R&B charts. The album, recorded before 
audiences in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, ventures into the same terrain mined 
by "Def Comedy Jam" performers. Drugs, homosexuality and sex are frequent 
topics, and shock often seems as important a goal as wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, like many young comedians, Lawrence relies on themes explored by his 
comic mentors. He never quite eludes the shadow of Richard Pryor. Bits about 
getting high on "herb," his short-lived boxing career, the difference between 
black and white women's sexual preferences and even the hip, streetwise 
intonation that Lawrence sometimes affects make you think you're back in the 
'80s, live on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 And a riff on pre-coital hygiene harks back to Foxx's old party records. These 
echoes of the past notwithstanding, Lawrence insinuates enough of his personal 
style into the performance to prove that he's a comic force to be reckoned 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's impressive, since Lawrence -- like such older African American comics 
as Dusty Fletcher ("Open the door, Richard") and Pigmeat Markham ("Here come 
the judge") -- is foremost a physical comedian. Watching him, even when he's 
reprising a familiar routine, adds another dimension to his humor. He is a 
master at duplication and parodying the postures and gestures (the 
hunched-shouldered bounce step and patterned hand movements) associated with 
the macho attitude projected by black youth in the '90s. With his beguiling 
smile and an arsenal of facial expressions that might have incurred the envy of 
actor Lon Chaney, Lawrence is as adept at re-creating today's homeboy presence 
in his stand-up routines as Pryor was at enlivening the hustlers, winos and 
junkies that peopled his routines. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Pryor is a satirist who heightens his humor with mime and eerily 
accurate enactment of his characters' physical movements, Lawrence generally 
approaches comedy from the opposite direction. In the venerable tradition of 
the stage clown, Lawrence's humor derives most often from the exaggerated 
physical action that accompanies and punctuates his jokes and observations. The 
cartoonish characters that people "Martin" and the show's youthful following 
reflect the harlequin-like bent of Lawrence's comedy style. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that clowns appeal only to children. Charlie Chaplin, one of America's 
most celebrated comedians, always insisted that despite other descriptions of 
his work, "I remain one thing only and that is a clown." Moreover, many of the 
greatest African American comedians -- among then Bert Williams, Dusty 
Fletcher, Mantan Moreland and even Flip Wilson -- have based their humor more 
on comic antics than verbal wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, of course, is part of another well-established comic tradition: blue 
humor. And that tradition's roots probably extend back to shortly after man's 
first utterances. In terms of African Americans, explicit humor can be traced 
at least from early 20th-Century toasts and ballads like "The Sinking of the 
Titanic" or "Shine" to the party records of artists like Rudy Ray Moore and 
such shows as "Def Comedy Jam." As Lenny Bruce, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor 
have found, however, it can be troublesome for performers who seek mainstream 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 After his impromptu jests about oral sex and female hygiene (material that is 
rendered more explicitly on his comedy album) during his "Saturday Night Live" 
monologue in February, Lawrence found himself embroiled in controversy. Despite 
his disclaimer -- "It was not my intent to insult anyone. . . . I enjoy finding 
the humor in everyday life" -- NBC banished him from future appearances on the 
network. In addition, Miramax Films postponed the scheduled March release of 
his concert film "You So Crazy" when the Motion Picture Assn. of America 
refused an appeal to change its NC-17 rating to R. The Samuel Goldwyn Co. 
announced this week it has acquired the film, and will open it -- unrated -- 
April 27. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the controversy and setbacks, Lawrence still promises, "I'll go down 
as one of the greatest comics, ever!"  
</P>
<P>
 For most performers that boast would quickly be dismissed as mere hubris. But 
with Lawrence we might well give the claim some thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Eddie Murphy emerged as the bridge between Richard Pryor's 
blues-based humor and the in-your-face comedy of the hip-hop crowd. Martin 
Lawrence has crossed the bridge. As "Def Comedy Jam" producer Stan Lathan 
asserts, Lawrence "is like a mirror of the current hip-hop generation," but 
that designation has its pros and cons. At his least creative, his comedy 
mirrors mediocre rap that settles for reworking well-known R&B classics by 
superimposing staccato hip-hop beats, defiant gesticulation and prosaic, 
insistently profane verbiage. At his best he is a riveting physical comic and 
clown whose female impersonations and send-ups of machismo are hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, seemingly mired somewhere between the blue and the banal, Lawrence 
seems confused and discontent. Perhaps, like the characters in "Alice in 
Wonderland" that he lampoons in his stand-up act, he needs to find a missing 
part. To move beyond the caricature that defines "Martin," what he needs most 
is a satiric voice that complements his astounding array of comic facial 
expressions and his mastery of the physical style of African American comedy, 
but is not so mercilessly laced with gratuitous profanity. 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't bet against him finding it . . . soon.

TECHNOARTS; IN CYBERSPACE, CAN ANYONE REALLY APPRECIATE ART?; CD-ROMS ARE 
GIVING HOME COMPUTER USERS ACCESS TO MUSEUM AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS. BUT SOME 
INSTITUTIONS ARE HOLDING BACK FROM THE DIGITAL AGE FOR FEAR OF LOSING CONTROL 
-- AND DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, Suzanne Muchnic writes about art for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japanese art collector Joe Price hunkers down at his computer in his Orange 
County home, pops a disc in his CD-ROM drive and calls up a digital image of 
one of his prized possessions -- an exquisitely detailed 18th-Century painting 
of a rooster by Ito Jakuchu. Zooming in on the feathers, Price points out bits 
of artistry that might go unnoticed in the painting itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look here," he says, magnifying a fluid stripe on one feather. "There are no 
brush strokes, just a continuous flow of color. Isn't that amazing?" 
</P>
<P>
 Price claims to understand no more than the next computer dunce about how 
photographs of paintings are transformed into digital reproductions. The 
process of converting an image to electronic signals in a series of ones and 
zeros, or digits, and then reassembling them in a precise likeness of the 
original is a mystery, he says, but he is enthralled with the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired oil man who gave the Los Angeles County Museum of Art $5 million to 
launch its Pavilion for Japanese Art, which opened in 1988, Price has promised 
a major portion of his collection to the museum. Now he is making the artworks 
available to the public on a $195 CD-ROM published by Digital Collections Inc. 
in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most fascinating way of looking at art. You can see and learn 
more from the computer than from the painting," he says. "You can color correct 
the images to natural light. You can enhance and sharpen the picture. You can 
even compare the real thing with a fake," he adds, bringing up a pair of images 
to demonstrate differences between the work of Jakuchu and an imitator. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapping up a demonstration of his CD-ROM's bells and whistles, Price presents 
his visitor with a souvenir -- a startlingly high-quality color reproduction of 
the rooster painting, which rolls off a printer connected to the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the brave new age of art appreciation, and Price is far from its only 
acolyte. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Masterworks of Japanese Painting: The Etsuko and Joe Price Collection" 
offers art lovers more than 1,100 full-color images (including 350 complete 
works and nearly 800 details), along with seven searchable data fields, 
descriptive commentary, artists' biographies and an introductory movie with 
narration and music, other products just now coming on the market provide 
equally enticing access to museums' art collections: 
</P>
<P>
 * DCI has published a $250 CD-ROM featuring 138 paintings at the venerable 
Frick Collection in New York. The disc includes an introductory essay by Frick 
Director Charles Ryskamp, descriptions of artworks by the museum's curatorial 
staff and detailed artists' biographies by art historian Joseph Goldyne. The 
Berkeley firm -- a spinoff of AXS/Optical Technology Resource Inc., which 
developed the Image Access software program -- is now at work on a CD-ROM of 
the Brooklyn Museum's ancient Egyptian collection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft Corp., the computer software giant masterminded by Bill Gates and 
located in Redmond, Wash., has published "Art Gallery," a $79 CD-ROM featuring 
more than 2,000 images from the collection of London's National Gallery. The 
program is based on the London museum's Micro Gallery, an interactive 
information system, designed by the British firm Cognitive Applications Ltd., 
which allows visitors to peruse the collection at computer kiosks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another Gates company, Continuum Productions Corp. in Bellevue, Wash., is 
purchasing non-exclusive digital reproduction rights to works in other museums' 
collection for an immense archive of pictures that can be viewed 
electronically. So far, Continuum and its predecessor, Interactive Home 
Systems, have purchased rights to the entire collection of London's National 
Gallery and large portions of holdings in the Seattle Art Museum, the Russian 
Museum in St. Petersburg, the Philadelphia Art Museum and the Barnes Foundation 
in Merion Station, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trident Software, Inc. in Vienna, Va. is producing a series of $39.95 
computer-savers, called "ArtScreens," which add an element of art education to 
software programs designed to prevent burn-in when a computer is turned on but 
not in use. The first of the series, "Great Master Collections," features 40 
reproductions of works from such renowned institutions as the Louvre in Paris, 
the National Gallery in London and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The 
images can be programed to appear at random or sequentially, and users can call 
up descriptive text on any of the artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Gallery of Art in Washington, which already has produced two 
videodiscs on portions of its art holdings, recently announced plans to install 
its own version of London's Micro Gallery, in collaboration with Cognitive 
Applications Ltd.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Art Institute of Chicago has produced and marketed an interactive 
computer game -- inviting children to go on a pre-Columbian treasure hunt or 
deconstruct a Louise Nevelson sculpture by touching a color monitor -- as well 
as laser discs based on the permanent collection and an electronic catalogue of 
the complete works of Chicago painter Ed Paschke's work. A current project, 
undertaken with Voyager of New York, is an interactive program on ancient art 
that will enable museum visitors to view both sides of coins, rotate statuary 
and connect the objects to appropriate maps and illustrations -- all by 
touching a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles, the J. Paul Getty Trust's Art History Information Program is 
establishing an information and standards organization for digital imaging in 
the visual arts. And the trust has joined Eastman Kodak Co. in a new venture, 
LUNA Imaging Inc., which will offer digital imaging services and electronic 
publishing to the academic community. As its first project, LUNA is compiling a 
digital archive of architect Frank Lloyd Wright's drawings for an electronic 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
 But stunning as all these developments may be -- particularly to art 
specialists who developed their expertise by studying actual artworks, books 
and slides -- digital imaging hasn't exactly taken the art world by storm. For 
every collection that is turning up on a disc or being scanned for future 
multimedia projects, there are many museums that haven't joined the revolution 
or are merely using the new technology for in-house operations and collections 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they haven't been invited. Electronic publishers who are hungry for 
content have been knocking on museums' office doors for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither are museums holding back because of concern that digital images will 
replace real artworks or that their audience will turn into mouse potatoes, the 
computer-literate generation's version of the couch potato. Art professionals 
agree that digital imaging can be expected to increase museum audiences through 
education and outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's keeping museums from plunging into the digital age of art reproduction 
is fear of losing control -- of both a lucrative licensing system and the 
artworks' integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many uncertainties," says Mary Grace Whalen, of the education 
department at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has made extensive 
in-house use of digital images but has declined to license large blocks of 
images to electronic publishers. "We don't know what the market will be. We 
don't know the value of the material or how it will be used. And, as material 
and technical processes tend to become cheaper, it may not be necessary to get 
some big company to do the conversion process," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Sorkow, director of photo services at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, 
agrees. "Digitalization is a reality and it is only going to get better," she 
says. "One of the missions of the museum is education and dissemination of 
information. But once you give permission for digital reproduction, you don't 
know how it will be used. We are wrestling with policies and standards for 
getting the information out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Museums hold copyrights to photographic images of many, though not all, works 
in their collections. The exceptions are works whose copyrights have expired 
and are now in the public domain, and pieces whose copyrights are held by 
artists or their estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers who wish to reproduce museums' copyrighted images -- or the 
museums' photographs of works in the public domain -- must have their requests 
approved and pay for one-time publication rights, at a cost of $200 to $500 per 
image. This practice not only generates income for museums, it allows them to 
control how the images are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending digital images of artworks out into the world renders the concept of 
one-time use obsolete and exposes the images to an unimaginable range of use 
and abuse, many museum technicians and administrators say. Even fervent 
advocates of digital imaging agree that opportunities for piracy and 
manipulation are inherent in the technology -- and that apparent obstacles can 
be subverted with the right equipment and expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a primeval stage in this ooze," says Maxwell L. Anderson, director 
of the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University who is organizing a panel 
on digital technology for the Assn. of Art Museum Directors, to be held June 
1-4 in Seattle. The directors are expected to study a complicated maze of 
legal, technical and commercial issues concerning digital reproductions of 
artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the speakers will be Bill Gates, who is widely credited with pushing 
museums into the Digital Age. His early attempts, starting in 1989, to buy 
reproduction rights for an encyclopedic visual data base -- of which fine art 
is but one component -- met considerable resistance. Although Gates easily 
engineered a hometown deal, persuading the Seattle Art Museum to sell rights to 
1,000 images, personnel at many other museums claim that his representatives 
were so aggressive, persistent and ignorant about art that they alienated 
potential clients. "The word went out, if they call, don't answer the phone," 
says a staff member at a major East Coast institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Other vendors have approached museums as well, but many of the institutions 
have responded by reconsidering their licensing policies and trying to figure 
out how to turn the technology to their advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the very, very, very early phase of discussing policies and what we 
want to do in this area, first inside the museum and later outside," says 
Mickey Carpenter, director of photographic permissions and services at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Caution is wise, according to attorney Christine Steiner, of the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington, who frequently speaks and writes about protection of 
intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Museums have lots of experience with publishers and rights," Steiner says. 
"What's different about this (onslaught of requests) is volume, variety and 
velocity." Electronic publishers pursue museums because they have vast 
quantities of a desirable product, museums' names have a market value, and 
vendors assume that the fewer sources they deal with, the easier the rights 
issue will be to resolve, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But museums hold works of art in trust. They have a responsibility to protect 
the art and they need to know how the material they license will be used, 
Steiner says. She warns against selling exclusive rights and signing contracts 
that contain confidentiality clauses, while advising museums to keep a tight 
rein on quality control. 
</P>
<P>
 Since no standard contract exists, electronic publishers negotiate every 
museum deal individually, working with curators to select images and using an 
electronic camera to scan photographs provided by the museums. The museums 
generally receive a cash advance against royalties and a promise of future 
royalties if the product produces sufficient income. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The push toward marketing digital reproductions of artworks is but a tiny 
indicator of the electronic publishing industry's quest for multimedia content 
of all descriptions. What Continuum wants from museums is "premier visual 
information," according to attorney Steve Davis, acting head of the firm. His 
characterization of fine art may make purists squirm, but he says the cultural 
community itself has defined this top echelon of "information." 
</P>
<P>
 The images licensed by Continuum will be used for two products, Davis says. 
One is "an on-line relicensing service . . . a one-stop shopping opportunity 
for publishers, producers and creators." The second is "a very sophisticated 
data base" of artworks and descriptive text that could be linked to other kinds 
of information -- say, photographs of related cities and landscapes, historical 
text or appropriate music -- delivered on up to 50 electronic pathways. "The 
possibilities are pretty mind-boggling," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With five museums under contract, Continuum has made significant inroads. A 
press release announcing the Philadelphia Museum of Art's collaboration with 
the firm solemnly announces "a long-term working relationship" and quotes the 
museum's director, Anne d'Harnoncourt, as saying she hopes the digital database 
will help the institution "find new audiences to appreciate and learn from our 
vast collections." 
</P>
<P>
 Continuum's conception of fine art as a consumer product and its plans for an 
archive that mixes artworks with many other kinds of material still raise 
eyebrows in art circles, but the company has made some smart moves. One was to 
woo art historian Hal Opperman, a specialist in 17th- and 18th-Century French 
art, from the University of Washington. Having left his ivory tower to 
"participate in a fabulous opportunity to be an educator on a grand scale," as 
he puts it, Opperman characterizes digital technology as the biggest revolution 
ever in the reproduction and dissemination of art. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps Continuum's most inspired gesture was to hire as consultant J. 
Carter Brown, the former director of Washington's National Gallery and the very 
personification of the cultural elite.

 Beating the drum for the digital revolution is a great part-time gig for 
Brown, who is something of a visionary and appears to enjoy the spotlight. The 
upcoming AAMD conference proves that digital technology is "topic A" in museum 
circles, Brown says. And he cheerfully dispels techno-qualms, which he likens 
to "that old thing we all had when we were children: fear of the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling off behind-the-scenes advantages for museums, he notes that digital 
reproductions are far more accurate, permanent, accessible and compact than 
photographs. The technology also can be immensely helpful to conservators, who 
can clean a tiny section of an artwork and predict the results of a complete 
restoration on their computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital reproductions also are likely to expand museums' audiences, Brown 
says. Just as films based on books have created a huge market for authors E. M. 
Forster and Edith Wharton, CD-ROMs on art will whet appetites for original 
artworks, he says. "What keeps people out of museums is a lack of familiarity 
with the subject. The more access people have to art, the more they will want." 
As for questions about copyrights and piracy, Brown says, "I think the market 
will work that out." Offering an analogy of fear about pirated videotapes, he 
says the low cost of renting videotapes offers little incentive to would-be 
pirates and notes the enormous volume of business done by video rental stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunities for pirating reproductions are already available, according to 
Brown and other advocates of electronic publishing. Anyone can snap a 
photograph and have it digitalized on a Kodak Photo CD or go to a copy shop and 
have a plate from an art book scanned. But spokesmen for software companies say 
that protection of intellectual property is fundamental to the industry and 
that they are pumping considerable effort into developing protective devices 
for licensed imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, technology marches on. And if there is any consensus on the 
digitization of fine art, it is that technology will drive the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very exciting environment to work in right now," Steiner says. "No one 
seems to have an absolutist view. But I am convinced that museums can control 
their own digital future."

TELEVISION; FROM THE HALLS OF IVY . . .; . . . TO A TABLE AT THE IVY; HARVARD, 
YALE AND CO. ARE TURNING OUT MORE THAN JUST LAWYERS AND BANKERS; PRIME TIME IS

 When Mike Reiss and Al Jean were in college, they spent a lot of time in 
darkened corners, having clandestine meetings and speaking in what amounted to, 
in their particular universe, tongues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had decided we wanted to write comedy," said Reiss, who palled around with 
his eventual comedy-writing and -producing partner, Jean, when they attended 
Harvard University in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Harvard Lampoon (the legendary campus literary magazine) was high art 
compared to what we were doing. We were thinking stand-up comedy and -- gasp! 
-- writing for television." 
</P>
<P>
 In those years, network sitcoms were pretty lame. "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" 
had died. "MASH" and "All in the Family" were on the fade. "Taxi" hadn't hit 
its stride. The Nielsen Top 20 was filled by the likes of "Laverne & Shirley," 
"Three's Company," "Welcome Back, Kotter" and "The Ropers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like we had to meet in closets and not tell anyone what we were 
doing for fear of being labeled fools. Ivy Leaguers writing sitcoms?" said 
Reiss. "Things sure have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 My, how they have. Over the last several years, folks from the Ivy League and 
other Eastern elitist colleges and universities have all but taken over 
sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiss and Jean most recently were the executive producers of "The Critic," an 
animated comedy on ABC. Prior to that, they were executive producers of "The 
Simpsons," a veritable coven of Ivy League writing talent, the most prominent 
of whose alumni is Harvard grad Conan O'Brien, who has moved on-screen as host 
of NBC's "Late Night With Conan O'Brien." 
</P>
<P>
 Highbrow, middle- and low-, people in their 20s and 30s who have graduated 
from schools such as Harvard and Yale, Columbia and Penn, Swarthmore and 
Brandeis write what America chuckles at. Ivied hands have penned scripts and, 
in many cases, executive produced for "Murphy Brown," "Martin," "Roseanne," 
"Full House," "The Wonder Years" and "Married . . . With Children." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the image of the TV sitcom writer was either that of someone who 
had perfected timing by writing for or performing in the Borscht Belt/variety 
show circuit, or of someone who had been the class clown in UCLA's or USC's 
film programs and giggled through the course on "Auteurs of the Weimar 
Republic." 
</P>
<P>
 As with all stereotypes, this was not completely accurate, but by and large 
the sitcom writers of a generation or more ago were either older or had been 
educated in life's knocks rather than in high-level academia.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Ivy Leaguers writing comedy in Hollywood these days, though, are 
post-Baby Boomers, attracted to the sitcom life soon after or during college. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it because we can. It's a great racket," said Jeff Martin, a 1982 
Harvard grad who was an editor of the Harvard Lampoon in college and is an 
executive producer of "The Good Life," an NBC sitcom that premiered in January. 
Before that, he worked on "Late Night With David Letterman" and "The Simpsons." 
"The Lampoon was a great training ground. It can be inconsistent and sometimes 
sophomoric, but it is a place to get your chops learning to write comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think it's an interesting phenomenon," said Martin's producing partner, 
Kevin Curran, who preceded Martin by three years at Harvard and in the 
editorship of the Lampoon. "In the 1940s and '50s and '60s, Harvard grads 
didn't think of doing this. They were lawyers or businessmen or who-knows-what 
else. But this is a job for well-educated people and, eventually, people from 
Harvard found their way to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction of the TV comedy-writing life came to the Ivy campuses with the 
advent of "Saturday Night Live" in the mid-1970s and was supplemented when 
"Late Night With David Letterman" began in 1982. Both shows survived on hip 
(sometimes hipper-than-thou) humor that could hardly be written by Borscht 
Belters. Irreverent wisecracks satirizing both the Baby Boomers and their 
antecedents, not formed jokes, became the order of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The young and the hip who had the most ready training in this type of humor 
were the men -- and at the time, the group was almost entirely male -- who had 
practiced it at places like the Harvard Lampoon or the University of 
Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club. They were elite institutions that mocked even 
themselves and, certainly, had no equivalent at most state universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like we took courses in comedy writing in college," Curran said. "We 
just found doing it interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Myer, the executive producer of the now-benched ABC sitcom "Joe's Life," 
met his original writing partner, Bob Young, a producer on ABC's "Dinosaurs," 
while directing the undergraduate satirical revue at Penn's Mask and Wig Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wrote, produced and directed the fall show there for three years and said, 
'Hey, we're pretty good at this!' " said Myer, who has also written for 
"Roseanne," among other shows. "We decided to work out our own act, got into 
clubs, on radio, doing anything we could to stay alive comically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, an agent who had come to see us perform said, 'Hey, have you guys 
ever written anything for TV?' It was nothing a Penn grad would have thought 
of," Myer recalled. "That year (1982), the hot writing spec sample was 'Taxi.' 
Fortunately, it was an intelligent show. We did one, came out here, eventually 
got a job on 'The Facts of Life' and never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'm not surprised at the new wave of Ivy-type people writing out 
here," he said. "It's definitely a business. You have to look at what a TV 
writer makes money-wise, and how he makes it, and say, 'I want to do that!' Ivy 
people are over-achievers and that's probably got a lot to do with it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The money that Myer talks about can become astronomical. According to Emmy 
magazine, staff writers for sitcoms make $2,291 per week, and that is the 
chicken-feed job. Producers make from $8,000 to $20,000 an episode. Executive 
producers, the head honchos of sitcoms, start at about $18,000 an episode and 
can sometimes get high five-figure checks per episode. And if you create and 
produce a successful sitcom, you become a multi-millionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 An article about Ivy League comedy writers in the magazine GQ about a year 
ago, titled "Smart People, Dumb TV," angered a lot of the Ivy-bred sitcomers. 
They felt the article intimated that they were writing and producing drivel 
merely because they could get well-paying jobs doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story seemed to lament that the only things our greatest institutions of 
higher learning were putting out were people who wrote for 'Full House,' " 
complained Michael Saltzman, a "Murphy Brown" writer and supervising producer 
who graduated from Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no one's aspiration I know. We want to create great television, great 
shows, and there are only five or six in any given era. 'Taxi,' "Mary Tyler 
Moore,' 'Seinfeld' -- the best of TV can be hysterically funny or can be as 
moving as anything you can read. You want to do the stuff you looked up to and 
admire as a viewer. That's why people, why good Ivy League people, go into it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are Ivy League grads in sitcom writing who have a contrarian viewpoint, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kirschenbaum, a 33-year-old University of Pennsylvania grad who is 
co-executive producer of the ABC hit "Coach," doesn't think it's such a good 
thing that sitcoms are going all-Ivy. 
</P>
<P>
 "By definition, Ivy League schools are not of the masses," said Kirschenbaum, 
who before his "Coach" stint was executive producer of Fox's "Down the Shore" 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids now know they want to write TV comedy when they are 19 years 
old. Supposedly, the best sitcoms reflect some sort of life experience. If your 
life experience is studying to be a sitcom writer in high school and then going 
to an Ivy school and becoming a story editor on a sitcom at age 22, I don't 
know that you can have a wealth of material for a good sitcom." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirschenbaum's father, Freddie Roman, quit a steady salesman's job to become a 
stand-up comic, eventually getting to the Las Vegas and Atlantic City showrooms 
before creating the hit revue "Catskills on Broadway." Kirschenbaum tried to 
become a harness-horse-trainer in New Jersey after graduating from Penn, and 
only turned to comedy writing when the business wasn't going well after four 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 "At least I failed at something. At least I saw my father struggle at 
something," Kirschenbaum said. "Sure, these people are smart and witty, but the 
best sitcoms have depth. In the end, this trend might be harmful for TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Reo, the creator of "Blossom" and "The John Larroquette Show," started his 
comedy writing career a generation ago right out of high school, going on the 
road as a straight man and gag writer for stand-up comic Slappy White. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you write a little harder after you've been on stage, because you are 
there when the joke dies," said Reo, who came to Hollywood to write for Jimmy 
Durante's variety show and "Laugh-In" during the late 1960s. He sees a bit of 
what he calls "snideness" in many of the younger Ivy-educated writers, but 
quickly makes clear that "I don't look at where someone went to school when I 
hire them. 
</P>
<P>
 "No amount of education is going to make you amusing," Reo explained. "Now, to 
be sure, there are Harvard graduates who are successful, but that is not 
because of where they went to school. It's because they are also funny human 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to say that college can't actually help someone become funnier, 
argue Martin and Curran, the Harvard team that created "The Good Life." 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school," Martin said, "I thought I had some creative talent, but when 
I came to Harvard and the Lampoon, I realized I had some work to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin was awed by the first revue he saw at Harvard, produced by an 
upperclassman named Andy Borowitz. Borowitz eventually came West and wrote for 
"Family Ties" before creating "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" with his wife, 
Susan, also a Harvard grad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's stuff was so professional, I knew I had to pick up my game," Martin 
said. "I was inspired. I studied comedy writing. I learned to adapt to changes. 
That's what being around so many smart people in college can do for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Curran concurred. "If I hadn't gone to Harvard," I never would have developed. 
I would have been a funny guy, but I never would have been challenged enough to 
be successful."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What inspired most of his Ivy sitcom compatriots, said Curran, was bad 
television itself. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Simpsons' is the best at mocking this kind of stuff," he said. "Our 
generation became so informed by TV that we learned its forms early. But the 
best TV now is the stuff that is absurdist, that twists the conventions around 
just a little bit. We're making fun of our generation's shared TV culture." 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up with a certain kind of humor and that's what we write," said David 
Rosenthal, a 1989 University of Pennsylvania grad who is co-executive producer 
(with Swarthmore College graduates Neal Marlens and Carol Black, who created 
"The Wonder Years") of the new ABC sitcom "These Friends of Mine," starring 
Ellen DeGeneres. "The past generation had something else and the next 
generation, no doubt, will be spoofing us with their brand of humor."  
</P>
<P>
 "Look, we're the group that's able to translate humor to television at the 
moment, that's all it is," said Brandeis University grad Marta Kauffman, who, 
with her classmate and writing partner, David Crane, created the sex-romping 
HBO sitcom "Dream On" and this season's now-defunct "Family Album" on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I'm 39, I could be out of a job. This year, it's East Coast kids. 
Next year, it's kids from the University of Illinois. In any case, it's not all 
television, just a select part of television that Baby Boomers and their 
younger brothers and sisters seem to like right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a "Simpsons" episode, "The Front," mocked the show's own cadre of 
Harvard-bred writers and producers. In the program, Bart and Lisa Simpson, 
upset at the lousy writing on their favorite cartoon show, "Itchy and 
Scratchy," submit a script of their own to the series. To get it read, they 
sign it with the name of their half-senile grandfather, Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reading that script, the cigar-chomping head of "Itchy and Scratchy 
Int'l." berates a young writer, "You call this writing? If I puked in a 
fountain pen and mailed it to the monkey house, I'd get better scripts." 
</P>
<P>
 The young writer, in upper-crust tones, tries to speak up: "But, sir, at 
Harvard, they . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, at Harvard they taught you," bellows the boss. "Hit the streets, Egghead. 
You should have majored in not getting fired."  
</P>
<P>
 Later on, when the big boss pounces on the Simpsons' script, he signs up 
Abraham and takes him into a room of button-down-shirted young guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right, leeches, I want you to see what a good writer looks like," he 
says. "His name is Abraham Simpson and he's got something you couldn't get at 
your fancy schools: life experience."  
</P>
<P>
 One writer pipes up, "Actually, you know, I wrote my thesis on life experience 
and . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quiet!" the boss screams at his quivering Ivy minions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conan (O'Brien) wrote that," said Reiss, who was a "Simpsons" executive 
producer at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd gotten weary of all the criticism of Harvard guys who wrote sitcoms 
without knowing life. We all laughed. That's what this stuff is all about, 
right?"

MUSIC; A SHIFT IN COMPOSITION; ASIAN AND ASIAN AMERICAN MUSICIANS INCREASINGLY 
CAN BE FOUND PLAYING IN U.S. SYMPHONY ORCHESTRAS. 'THIS IS A MANIFESTATION OF A

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last fall, Ben Hong walked with his cello onto the stage of the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion to play his first concert with his new employer, the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic. For Hong, then 24, it was a triumphant moment in an 
arduous journey that began 15 years ago in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The voyage was one of intense pressure: Hong remembers his parents sitting 
beside him as he practiced the instrument he'd taken up at the age of 9. "I 
love music now, but it would have been nice if I had had a chance to learn to 
love it myself when I was young," he says wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also a voyage of loneliness: When Hong was 13, his parents sent him to 
New York to live with a guardian so that he could attend the Juilliard School 
of Music's pre-college program on Saturdays. Of rebellion: In New York he often 
didn't want to practice. And, at last, of pleasure and achievement: He followed 
his teacher, cellist Lynn Harrell, from Juilliard to the USC School of Music, 
where after four years of college and two of post-graduate study, he was hired 
into one of the eminent orchestras of America. 
</P>
<P>
 This young man is remarkable only for his early and striking success. 
</P>
<P>
 All over America, but especially on its West and East coasts, young people of 
East Asian ancestry are studying Western classical music in large numbers, the 
newest in a long line of immigrants to enrich the American musical scene with 
their talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a manifestation of a normal cycle in American musical life," said 
Joseph Polisi, president of Juilliard. "Various immigrant groups have been 
dominant in classical music in this century. First it was the Italians and 
Germans, and after World War I people from central Europe. After World War II 
we had the Israelis, and then by the mid-1960s people of Asian heritage began 
to become involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Engaged heavily in strings (and increasingly in other instruments and voice), 
Asians and Asian Americans are in ever-growing numbers entering America's 
symphony orchestras, whose style of playing they may well subtly but 
unmistakably alter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where would the great American orchestras be without the Asian input?" asks 
Zubin Mehta, 57, conductor of the Israel Philharmonic and former conductor of 
the New York Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Rattle, 38, the conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra 
in England and frequent guest conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and 
other American orchestras, said he sees the future "face of the orchestra in 
America" in the students he worked with at the Tanglewood music festival last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them were of Asian descent, and many of those female, he says, and 
they were "very alive, alert, passionate." Rattle predicts that as the younger 
Asians and Asian Americans increasingly work their way into American 
orchestras, the orchestras will play "with a faster burn." He thinks that 
eventually most string players in American orchestras will be of Asian 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 At USC's School of Music, 17% of the 827 undergraduate and graduate students 
are Asian American and 15% are Asians from abroad. At Juilliard, the figure is 
about 35% to 38%, divided roughly 50-50 between Americans and Asians from 
abroad. At the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston the percentage of 
Asian descent is 20. It's 28% at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 With these numbers in music schools and conservatories, people of Asian 
descent are entering the leading American orchestras in increasing numbers. Of 
the 105 members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 10 are of Asian descent. In 
San Francisco, 12 of 106 are; seven of 101 in Boston, four of 105 in Cleveland; 
four of 107 at the New York Philharmonic. When the 4,000-member Music Teachers 
Assn. of California presents its top students to play at its annual convention, 
the majority of them are Asian or Asian American. 
</P>
<P>
 These people of Japanese, Korean and Chinese backgrounds come from families 
that share the Confucian values of discipline, honoring parents and teachers, 
pride in family achievement and respect for culture. Nearly all of them have 
strong and supportive parents who encourage, or force, their offspring to do 
the countless hours of childhood practice without which few musicians, and 
certainly no instrumentalists, can achieve excellence later on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asian parents do tend to push their children to do well and have a better 
life than they had," says Nicole Lee, 21, a senior at USC's School of Music who 
was born in Vancouver to parents of Chinese ancestry. In Vancouver, where she 
grew up, "the music world was 80% Asian," she said. "There is a fierce level of 
competition in the society." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asian mother has taken the place of the Jewish mother," Mehta said. 
"Especially in this country, I find the Jewish mother has taken herself out of 
the talent market" -- meaning that as American Jews have grown more 
assimilated, some of the old drive has dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mehta's father, Mehli Mehta, 85, said that in his American Youth 
Symphony, composed of 105 young musicians in the Los Angeles area, 40 have 
Asian names. When he founded the group in 1965, 99% were American-born, and 40% 
or 45% of them were Jewish. (The Mehtas, among the relatively few Western 
musicians from India, are Parsis from Bombay.) 
</P>
<P>
 If culture explains the requisite discipline, what explains the attraction of 
Western music for Asians? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers are various: The opening of Japan to the West by Commodore Matthew 
C. Perry in 1854 led to a fascination there with all things Western; for people 
in societies that to Western eyes may seem conformist, the desire to express 
themselves in the highly individualized medium of Western music; the hope that 
one's children will do better than one's self, a wish that becomes more 
possible to fulfill as incomes rise; for Asian immigrants to the West, a means 
to confirm one's identity, and, in China's Cultural Revolution, simply 
spiritual survival. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century a course of music study for schools published by Luther 
Whiting Mason of Boston was adopted by the Japanese government. Laurence 
Lesser, president of the New England Conservatory of Music and husband of the 
Japanese-born violinist Masuko Ushioda, said that his father-in-law remembers 
attending popular concerts of classical music in Tokyo in the early 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time Shinichi Suzuki, who had studied violin in Europe, was creating 
the Tokyo String Orchestra and developing the Suzuki technique for teaching the 
violin and other instruments to very young children at a high standard of 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest vastly increased after World War II. Suzuki founded his music school, 
which expanded rapidly and became an international model for his style of 
teaching. The eminent Toho Gakuen School of Music, from which Japanese 
conductor Seiji Ozawa graduated, was founded in Tokyo in 1955. Today there are 
six concert halls in Tokyo alone; concerts are packed with serious, respectful 
audiences. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is standard New Year's Eve fare in 
concert halls all over Japan. And as further evidence of the commitment to 
classical music, the compact disc was designed by its Japanese producer to be 
the length it is to accommodate a symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korea, traditional culture values music and song. Western music was first 
introduced in 1885 with the arrival of American missionaries, but during the 40 
years of Japanese occupation that began in 1905, it did not flourish. Interest 
grew with the liberation of Korea from the Japanese in 1945. The first Korean 
symphony orchestra was founded that year. The Korean War of 1950-53 halted 
musical development, but with the end of the war and the subsequent economic 
development Koreans increasingly turned to Western music, and now there are 
music schools in the universities and a National Conservatory of Music.  
</P>
<P>
 In China, classical Western music was introduced on a substantial scale with 
the turmoil in Russia that culminated in the 1917 revolution; Russian Jews 
fleeing pogroms and people fleeing the revolution, bringing their talents with 
them, sought refuge in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Such refugees taught the grandfather of Weigang Li, the 29-year-old first 
violinist of the young Shanghai String Quartet, based at the University of 
Richmond in Virginia. "People often ask me how I can understand Western music," 
he said while in Los Angeles working on a recording session. "It's a kind of 
silly question, since I am the third generation of my family in Western music. 
In my family we have a dozen violinists." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Soviet-Chinese connection brought a second round of Russian musicians to 
China after the triumph of the Communists in 1949, and Chinese students to the 
Moscow Conservatory. Then, in 1966, Mao Tse-tung's "Great Proletarian Cultural 
Revolution" brought new peril and with it a kind of grim opportunity to China's 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Bright Sheng, 37, the Shanghai-born composer-in-residence at the Seattle 
Symphony, tells the story. (His name is the translation of his Chinese given 
name, Liang.) His parents were intellectuals; his grandfather, a large 
landowner. The family was denounced in the Cultural Revolution as enemies of 
the people, and their piano, which the boy loved, was taken away.

 "Everybody from the city had to be farmers, he says. "The exceptions were 
artists, because Mao's wife (Ziang Qing) encouraged the performing arts." So 
the boy made it to remote Western Qinghai province, where for eight years he 
worked on the piano -- "I was basically self-taught" -- and collected folk 
songs. "At that time there were thousands of young people all over China 
playing the violin to avoid being made farmers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the death of Mao in 1978, China returned to more stable times, and Sheng 
went to Shanghai Conservatory, from which he made his way to New York, where he 
was a student of the late Leonard Bernstein. His music is intellectual and 
strenuously modernist, marked by both Chinese and Western influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Asian and Asian American musicians have experienced Sheng's travail, but 
no matter how tranquil their lives, a respect for discipline and zeal for the 
subject prevail. Here are some tales:

 "The scholar was a very highly valued person in society, while the businessman 
was at the bottom," Yo-Yo Ma said when he was at the Hollywood Bowl in 
September to play the Dvorak Cello Concerto with the L.A. Philharmonic. Ma, 
born 38 years ago in Paris to Chinese parents, is one of the Asian superstars 
of classical music, like Ozawa, Japanese violinist Midori, the Tokyo String 
Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each piece of music presents a complete world," Ma said. "Listening or 
playing means you have to go outside of yourself. . . . It's an empathetic 
feeling that makes music powerful. Certainly for people who have to struggle, 
or who have suffered, or who have had upheavals in their lives, music is a 
healing force. Maybe this is part of the immigrant process."

 Michelle Kim, 20, studies violin at the USC School of Music. She was born in 
Korea, where both her grandfathers were Presbyterian ministers. The family 
moved here in the 1980s. She started playing the instrument at age 10, "fairly 
late," she said, looking pensive. Her father, who now works in Los Angeles in 
Korean-language television, was a musician by training. Her teacher quickly put 
her in a competition. "I lost," she says, "so I decided I would do better and 
beat the people who beat me, and I did. I'm very competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, I hated the violin, but I couldn't stop, because we had put so 
much money into playing it." She had the same teacher, USC professor Robert 
Lipsett, for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim says her mom was so tough she insisted on additional practice time to make 
up for a trip to the bathroom. "Asian moms are so tough on kids," Kim says with 
a merry laugh, happy now that her mother insisted that she practice. 
</P>
<P>
 She says of her lofty goal to be a soloist: "If I aim for the highest goal, I 
can always drop back. If I don't aim for the goal of soloist, I won't be able 
to achieve anything else. If you just aim for the middle, you won't be able to 
achieve what you should." Her ultimate goal is to be a teacher -- "to pass on 
what I've learned."

 Sam Wong, 31, born in Hong Kong to music lovers, studied piano from the age of 
4. When he was 9, his family moved to Toronto. From there he went to Harvard 
College, where he took up conducting and led Harvard's Bach Society Orchestra. 
After college he went to Harvard Medical School and got his MD degree even 
while conducting a local community orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not continue medicine, but instead moved to New York and became 
director of the New York Youth Symphony, where Zubin Mehta heard him conduct 
Stravinsky's "Rite of Spring" and invited him to become assistant conductor of 
the New York Philharmonic. In his three years there, he conducted 30 concerts, 
including those scheduled for Leonard Bernstein when he died and those 
scheduled for Mehta when he went to Israel to be with his orchestra during the 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 He is working through the repertoire, gaining experience. He has conducted in 
several Asian nations. In China, he says, he found at concerts "an electric 
atmosphere, spontaneous and real. This love of classical music is not studied 
or contrived." 
</P>

<P>
 Roy Tanabe, American-born, has been a violinist with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic since the 1960s, before the wave of musicians of Asian descent 
began to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of myself as different" from the younger Asian musicians, Tanabe 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his family were expelled from Los Angeles by the U.S. government during 
World War II because they were of Japanese lineage; they were not sent to the 
infamous internment camps, but to Ann Arbor, Mich., where his father taught 
Japanese at an Army intelligence school. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanabe met music in the various accompaniments for children's radio serials -- 
Rossini's "William Tell" overture for "The Lone Ranger," Reznicek's overture to 
"Donna Diana" for "Sergeant Preston of the Yukon."  
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't interested in the stories as much as I loved the music," Tanabe 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 When the family returned to Los Angeles after the war, he was drawn into 
playing music by a grade-school music teacher, who persuaded Tanabe's father to 
buy a violin for him. "It was a pretty sizable (financial) sacrifice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was blessed by the fact that I came into the Los Angeles public school 
system in those days," he says. "It had a large and active music program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt in my mind," Tanabe says, "that if we had the music 
education in the schools now that we had then, there would be an enormous 
number of persons of color in the field." But as it is, the field is left open 
to those whose parents have ambition and some means. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By no means is all the ambition for the love of music itself. Fung Ho, 38, 
born in Hong Kong, teaches violin from his studio in Monterey Park. He 
encounters many parents -- Asian and non-Asian -- who don't care much for 
music, but believe that if their children are disciplined to study it they can 
organize the rest of their lives better. They believe it also helps their 
children to get in the best schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have a student who really doesn't like the violin and is good at 
something else, like baseball, I tell the parents to let him do baseball and 
just quit the violin." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho himself started at "8 or 9 . . . but I never liked it, I never practiced. 
My parents got very mad at me for that." He took the violin up seriously in his 
middle teens but nevertheless studied biology and got a master's degree in 
hematology Long Island University. Then he switched to the Manhattan School of 
Music and got a master's in violin. Now he teaches half of the time and works 
as a free-lance violinist. With friends he founded the local Olympia 
Philharmonic Orchestra to feature Asian and Asian American musicians and to 
"promote more classical music among the Chinese community" through 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heiichiro Ohyama's parents were not as indulgent about baseball as is Ho. Now 
46 and the conductor of the Japan America Symphony of Los Angeles, Ohyama 
longed to play baseball with his friends in Japan instead of practicing the 
violin after school. "In the Orient," he says, "when a parent says, 'Do this,' 
you don't say, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ohyama went in 1968 to England for three years, then to America. He switched 
to the viola and was principal violist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic for 13 
years and assistant conductor for three. Perhaps more than the younger 
musicians, Ohyama says he found that being a foreigner in this country is "not 
easy," though the West Coast, with its large Asian population, is more 
hospitable, he says, than the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanabe says, though, that he never felt discriminated against. "It was our 
parents who had to fight that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The increase of Asian musicians in America is not matched in Europe, the 
birthplace of the art. Rattle, the conductor, says he knows of a couple of 
free-lance Japanese musicians in London but of no Asians on the roster of any 
English orchestra. The concertmaster of the Berlin Philharmonic, Tooru 
Yasunaga, is Japanese, Rattle says, and there are some Asians playing in the 
Netherlands, but "the vast majority are in America," adding that "it's perhaps 
because you pay better." 
</P>
<P>
 It is widely believed by musicians that the Asians and Asian Americans coming 
increasingly into the profession are of high quality. As USC music school Dean 
Larry Livingston put it, "They have what we musicians call 'chops' -- 
horsepower." 
</P>
<P>
 Then why do people outside the profession still ask whether Asians have the 
"soul" for Western music?  
</P>
<P>
 One contributor to the question may have been the familiar international sight 
of young children playing so neatly in unison in the Suzuki method. 
</P>
<P>
 Another, curiously, may have been the 1979 documentary film about Isaac Stern 
"From Mao to Mozart," which traced his three-week trip through China teaching 
and giving concerts at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Huang Hua. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern himself said in the film: "Their approach to Western music was somewhat 
limited. They were not accustomed to playing with passion and color. . . . They 
have not had the experience of living with Western music, as we have, for 
hundreds of years." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dorothy DeLay, the eminent violin teacher at Juilliard, whose students 
have included Midori and many others of Asian descent, says "if you have 
musicians play behind a screen, I would defy anyone to pick the Asians out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rattle talks about Yo-Yo Ma's "staggering talent" with the cello. "It is not 
possible to finger scales the way he does," Rattle says. "Any cliche you say 
about musicians of Asian descent completely dissolves with talent like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Polisi of Juilliard said: "I have heard thousands of musicians. That talk 
about Asians is a very old stereotype that should be discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few musicians before the public who can uplift the human 
spirit. That is a very special gift. It has nothing to do with ethnic origins."

COVER STORY; WE'RE LISTENING, TED; TED TURNER RECENTLY BOUGHT TWO MOVIE 
COMPANIES -- IT WOULD APPEAR THAT HE'S NOT JUST INTERESTED IN OLD MOVIES. BUT 
WHAT ARE HIS PLANS FOR NEW MOVIES? A Q&A WITH TURNER AS HE MOVES FULL SPEED 
INTO MOGULDOM

 Being ushered in to see Ted Turner in his basketball-court-sized office is 
like being ushered in to see the Wizard of Oz. Past a boardroom corridor lined 
with movie stills, Oscar statuettes (acquired from MGM) and an oil painting of 
Rhett Butler (an early hero of Turner's, even before he acquired rights to 
"Gone With the Wind"), Turner opens the door to an office that has a wall of 
gleaming silver yachting trophies, a bank of TV screens and a small sign with 
his trademark slogan: "Lead, follow or get out of the way."  
</P>
<P>
 Turner, 55, is one of the great success stories in American business, and many 
competitors have lost money underestimating the driven, brash, impulsive 
Southerner who crashed the network television business in 1976 the way he 
crashed the genteel America's Cup yachting world.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, after amassing a fortune of more than $2 billion in the advertising, 
cable-TV (his company operates five cable networks -- CNN, TBS, TNT, Headline 
News and the Cartoon Network -- and later this month will launch a sixth, 
Turner Classic Movies) and sports businesses (he owns baseball's Atlanta Braves 
and basketball's Atlanta Hawks), he has become a Hollywood mogul -- albeit long 
distance, from his headquarters here.  
</P>
<P>
 His Turner Broadcasting System purchased the MGM library in 1986, acquired the 
Hanna-Barbera animation studio in 1992 and last year bought two movie 
companies, New Line Cinema ("Nightmare on Elm Street," "The Player") and Castle 
Rock Entertainment ("City Slickers," "A Few Good Men," "In the Line of Fire," 
TV's "Seinfeld").  
</P>
<P>
 They join the in-house production unit he already had, Turner Pictures, which 
had concentrated on TV movies but now is stepping up theatrical production 
after its first venture into that area last year with "Gettysburg."  
</P>
<P>
 "Turner has really created a de facto mini-major studio at a significantly 
lower price than anyone else has been able to do," said Allan Kazzan, 
entertainment analyst for the Morgan Stanley investment firm in New York. 
"Castle Rock has great creative talent, and New Line has had the highest market 
share for any of the independents. If they can put it all together creatively . 
. . I think Turner may have pulled off the deal of the century."  
</P>
<P>
 Turner has grown more serious over the years, and his $1.2-billion purchase of 
the MGM library forced him to take on partners (Time Warner and 
Tele-Communications Inc.) that have prevented him from acting unilaterally. 
Nevertheless, he remains passionate in his opinions, funny and disarmingly 
candid, both about his competitors and his own plans. In an interview, Turner 
discussed movies, his desire to own one of the Big Three broadcast networks and 
his marriage to Jane Fonda.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why did you want to buy Castle Rock and New Line? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The main programming element of our entertainment networks (TNT and 
TBS) is movies. We are starting a third network, Turner Classic Movies, that 
will show classic movies. We are expanding abroad, and we need to keep our film 
library fresh and alive to program our networks. We were producing a couple of 
theatrical films already, and we want to be in the movie business as well as 
the TV business because theatrical films get so much more attention and 
promotion than TV films. Plus, with interactivity (coming to television), we 
need to be involved in home video as well as theatrical films and pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you envision Castle Rock, New Line and Turner Pictures operating 
separately? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. They're certainly going to operate separately from a creative 
and marketing standpoint. They've been operating successfully that way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So the executives who run Castle Rock, for example, will continue to do so 
from a creative standpoint? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see yourself getting involved in the kinds of movies that New Line 
might make? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not really. I'm excited about what they're doing. Whenever you do as many 
as 20 movies a year, as they are doing, you're going to personally like some 
and not like others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of movies do you personally like? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I like a wide variety of films, but I guess I prefer historical dramas -- 
"Gone With the Wind," "Dr. Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia." I would drift more 
to those than even the best of the comedies, like "9 to 5" and "Airplane." I 
paid cash money to see "Aladdin," "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Little 
Mermaid." I'm in the cartoon business, but I probably would have gone to see 
them anyway. These are supposed to be kids' movies, but I'm 55 and I went to 
see them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've been outspoken on the subject of violence. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's right: gratuitous violence. There was a lot of violence in 
"Gettysburg," but I consider it anti-violence and anti-war. The type of 
violence in "Single White Female" -- I get some of this from Jane -- where sex 
and violence and attacks on women are mixed together, I think it's tragic that 
movies are made that titillate about violence in that way.  
</P>
<P>
 There are so many people going in and out of jail for violent crimes against 
women, for rape, for child molestation. You know that everything we're exposed 
to influences us -- our teachers, our parents. Those films influence us and the 
TV programs we see influence us. The weaker your family is, the more they 
influence you. . . . The problems with families in our cities are catastrophic 
-- but when you put violent programs (before) people who haven't had a lot of 
love in their lives, who are angry anyway, it's like pouring gasoline on the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 I went for four or five years where I refused to air movie trailers for 
R-rated movies (on TBS). Every one of the movie studios told us, "If you don't 
take the R-rated movies, you're not going to get the Gs and PGs." For five 
years, we had a virtual total boycott. And it was a time when we really needed 
the revenue. Today, we carry trailers for R-rated movies, but we review them 
and we don't carry anything with gratuitous violence in it. 
</P>
<P>
 I was offered the Carolco library several years ago, with one of the worst 
movies, the "Rambo" series, and I wouldn't buy it. I saw the first "Rambo." 
Here we are trying to heal the country and what that movie did was to make 
people hate the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese were innocent. We're the ones that 
started that war; they never attacked the United States! 
</P>
<P>
 We've run some of Chuck Norris' films on our networks. "Rambo" to me is a 
pro-war film -- making it look like fun, blowing people away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: New Line Cinema has made a lot of money producing some violent movies, 
including the "Nightmare on Elm Street" series. Are you going to say to them, 
"Don't do 'Freddy Krueger 12' "? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I'm not. I've basically given them creative control. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen the Freddy Krueger movies. Horror, to me, when it's obviously 
tongue-in-cheek, is not as bad as the mixing of sex and gratuitous violence. 
With a horror movie, a genre that goes back to Bela Lugosi, you know it's a 
scary movie. Nobody is going to put knives on their fingers like Freddy 
Krueger. 
</P>
<P>
 ("Nightmare on Elm Street") is not the thing I'm proudest about from (New 
Line). I'm prouder of "Menace II Society." That had violence in it, but it 
wasn't pushing violence. To me, it was a movie that abhorred violence. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line has made some movies with violence in them, and I guess they will 
continue to do so. Will it give me some trouble? Yes. Does it give them some 
trouble? I'm sure it does. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've heard that there was one script that New Line wanted to buy, and you 
said it had too much violence in it. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. A long time back, before we made the deal, they may have asked me about 
a particular project that they turned down on their own.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: On your own networks you've done a series of movies about Native Americans, 
an upcoming project on women's history and the "Captain Planet" cartoon series 
for children about the environment. These all reflect your personal interests. 
Are you going to say to your movie studios, "I want you to do a movie about the 
environment"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I've got Turner Pictures for that. If I've got a movie like "Gettysburg" 
that I just want to do, I can make it through Turner Pictures. New Line and 
Castle Rock have their own bonus plans and their own goals. I'm not going to 
force them to take projects that they don't believe in. Bob Shaye has been 
running New Line for 25 years, starting from nothing, and he's one of the few 
successful independents left; all the rest are gone. I've known Alan Horn 
(chairman of Castle Rock) for 20 years, since he was with Norman Lear and I 
bought "All in the Family" and "Sanford and Son" from them. I know what they 
stand for.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you going to look at scripts from your movie companies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No. Well, I may occasionally. I didn't even read the script for 
"Gettysburg." I read the book and Jane read the script. But, I mean, I don't 
know a good script from a bad script -- I really don't. I can say what I like 
and what I don't like. I haven't had enough time in the movie business to 
really feel confident that I know what people are going to come see. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is Jane Fonda going to play a role in your movie studios? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Her company is producing a film for TNT, called "Lakota Woman." She has 
bought the book "Pigs in Heaven" (by Barbara Kingsolver), which her company is 
going to do for Turner Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you think she wants to come back and star in movies? 
</P>
<P>
 A: She says no. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you think you're regarded in Hollywood -- as an outsider or an 
insider? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It all depends on the person; I know some people better than others. I 
don't feel like an outsider. We've been a major customer of all the studios -- 
licensing television and movies -- for years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've been told that you would like to buy ABC or NBC. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Buy, merge, acquire -- whatever. I've said for years that I would like to 
buy a network. I made that clear when I made the unfriendly offer for CBS (in 
1985). . . . I'd like to buy a network. I would like to have a studio -- in 
fact, I'd like to have three or four studios and all four TV networks. And I'd 
like to have all the newspapers and magazines. I'd like to own the BBC, too -- 
it's not for sale; it belongs to the British people. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to own General Motors and General Foods, while we're talking about 
it. And let's not forget Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines -- two companies that I 
can see out the window! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you been talking to NBC and ABC recently? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a lot of talk that goes on from time to time. But under our 
ownership with Time Warner and TCI, as long as there are FCC regulations 
regarding cross-ownership, you can't own (broadcast-network) owned-and-operated 
TV stations in the same market with cable. So the rules won't allow us to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 We've been partners with Time Warner and the other cable operators since 1986, 
when they helped us after MGM. That partnership has worked very well. If the 
rules change, certainly I would like to own a network. The networks are coming 
back, and I believe they've proven they're going to be around for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you willing to surrender your 52% voting control of your company to buy 
a network or make some new alliance?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I haven't really had control for a long time. When you have two different 
owners of this company besides me that can veto any expenditure over $2 
million, what kind of control is that, over a company that's doing close to $3 
billion (in revenue)? I have day-to-day operating control, but really only so 
long, I think, as I'm doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel hamstrung by these arrangements? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sometimes I feel hamstrung -- restrained would be a better word. Yes, there 
are times when this relationship is restraining, but there are lots of other 
times when it's highly beneficial. Hopefully, the benefits will outweigh the 
restraints. There's no way you can have partners without being restrained in 
some way. 
</P>
<P>
 I think my net worth has increased 10 to 20 times in the last seven years, and 
so has their investment. So from a financial standpoint, it's been a very, very 
good relationship. And it's been a lot of fun. I never regretted taking the 
partners I did. . . . I just don't have enough money to own the company myself 
any more. You just can't accumulate the billions of dollars in capital that are 
necessary -- not in my lifetime, not today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you and Time Warner going to separate at some point? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know. I doubt it. We're getting along fine. We do compete in some 
areas, and we cooperate in some areas. In this industry, you do business with 
your competitors because there are only so many companies, and it makes sense 
to go through one or the other for various things. Here we are releasing a 
movie with Fox ("Pagemaster"), who's a competitor. Rupert Murdoch is one of the 
largest customers for "CNN News Source" for his television stations, and we 
also buy programs from Columbia, another competitor, and they're going to be 
distributing the Castle Rock movies for the next 3 1/2 years. Everybody needs 
everybody else in this business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Would you ever sell CNN? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I have considered it a couple of times and come up with a big no. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: From your heart? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I don't want to sell it. I don't want to sell anything. I want to buy. 
(In fact, since the interview, Turner has been exploring the purchase of the 
Home Shopping Network.) There are no assets here that aren't pretty integral to 
the company. We've stayed in the programming and television business. CNN is an 
extension of that. Getting into the movie business is an extension of that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You were interested in making a bid for Paramount recently, then dropped 
out. A lot of people in the entertainment industry are saying the deal cost 
Viacom too much ($10 billion). What do you think of the deal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's no question it's a lot of money to pay. It all depends on how 
successful they are with the assets they have. I think it's important that the 
Blockbuster deal go through to give Sumner Redstone enough capital to spread 
that debt over and enough cash flow to help him retire the debt. Wayne Huizenga 
(Blockbuster chairman) is one of the smartest guys around -- he's proved that 
in two fields (waste management and home video) -- and (Viacom Chief Executive) 
Frank Biondi's smart, so it's up to them. . . . It's like asking who's going to 
be the winner in the television of the future. It depends on who makes the 
right moves between now and then. Who's going to win the World Series the year 
after next? Who knows? The team that makes the best moves. You can't predict 
things statically.

 Q: The Paramount merger is happening, but the TCI-Bell Atlantic merger fell 
through. When you look down the road, do you see mega-mergers as the way the 
business is going? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It depends completely on your circumstances and what end of the business 
you're in. I think a cable operator is very different from a motion-picture 
studio. If you're going to be in the motion-picture business, you have to be 
big enough to compete in a major way. I think time has shown that the little 
independents just making a few pictures and depending on somebody else to 
distribute them without the income of a library -- that's not a viable 
operation. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The whole business is like there's a medium-sized fish, and there's a big fish 
coming behind you, and a little fish in front of you, and you're trying to eat 
the smaller fish before the bigger fish gets you.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Which one are you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think basically you have to look ahead and you have to look over your 
shoulder, too. We're competing with the four broadcast networks. We're 
competing with Viacom. ABC owns ESPN, and (Rupert) Murdoch has a studio and a 
TV network (Fox). NBC has a cable network, CNBC, and another one starting -- 
and they've got General Electric behind them. Everyone has their problems and 
their opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Rupert Murdoch recently bought Star TV, the company that owns the huge 
communications satellite over Asia, carrying MTV and the BBC's TV news channel. 
Murdoch has said that he wants to take CNN on internationally. Do you think 
you're vulnerable there? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Virtually everyone in the TV-news business would like to go head-to-head 
with us and are trying. NBC has a Spanish network in South America. They 
recently bought (European superstation) SuperChannel, but they're running "The 
Tonight Show" and the "Today" show on it. I don't see how telling people the 
weather in Iowa plays in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert said he was going to do an international news network, but they keep 
delaying it, don't they? The BBC is trying to compete with CNN International. 
It takes a lot of money and commitment to do a 24-hour news service. CNN has 
been available around the world for the past five years and we were the first 
to connect the whole world. We've got a big head start, and nobody has mounted 
a credible challenge yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Years ago you used to delight in trashing the networks, saying you wanted 
to lower their share of the audience. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A: We did. Their share of audience has gone from 90% to 60% in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you started out with your superstation TBS (in 1976), did people take 
you seriously? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When I was first getting going, people fell out of their chairs laughing. 
The TV station I bought was going bankrupt; I couldn't afford to buy a network 
affiliate. The smaller you are and the bigger you aim, the more hooting and 
hollering you're going to get. That's not just true of me. If you're at 
McDonald's making $1 an hour and you say, "I'm going for $1.10," nobody's going 
to doubt you. If you've got a dollar and you say, "I'm going to build a 
multibillion-dollar corporation that is going to rival the networks," then 
they're going to hoot at you. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When I first got going (with TBS), I went to New York and said to one of the 
media buyers there, "We're in 2% of households and we're going to build a 
network." He was in a swivel chair; he literally laughed so hard he fell back 
and nearly hit his head on the radiator. He said, "With that broken-down 
station in Atlanta? You've got to be kidding!" And I had to laugh with him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where is he now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Actually, he's still there -- and one of our biggest customers. . . . I 
haven't burned a lot of bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: (TCI president) John Malone, a friend of yours, recently was quoted saying 
that you're a sound businessman, but you get emotional. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure, I get emotional -- doesn't everybody? I get emotional when I see my 
kids. I get emotional when I see my wife. I cry at sad movies. I cried like a 
baby when I saw "8 Seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Really? Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It reminded me -- the kid was having trouble; his father was pushing him 
all the time. And my father kind of pushed me. After the rodeo rider became 
world champion, he was getting married and thinking about quitting. . . . 
That's how he got killed, getting gored by a Brahma bull. That's the last thing 
I'd want to do -- that bull wants to kill you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see the communications business as having only a few global 
companies in the future, or will there always be room for entrepreneurs? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. There also will be big global companies -- and we're one of them, 
although we're not as big as some of the others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What other mountains do you want to climb? 
</P>
<P>
 A: From now on, what I'd like to do is quality. I'd like to make the best 
movies and TV programs that we can. Castle Rock does "Seinfeld," one of the 
best sitcoms on TV. It's intelligent and doesn't dump on anyone. In our movies 
for TNT, we've done David Mamet's "Life in the Theater," Arthur Miller's "The 
American Clock" and a lot of other good projects. We just had a three-hour 
documentary on Antarctica that got great reviews. We did "Captain Planet," not 
"The X-Men" or Amy Fisher. I think we've got more serious, credible news than 
the other guys. We'll continue to do those kinds of programs, with quality and 
relevance and benefit.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that more important to you today? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, what am I going to do with more money? I'm planning right now to give 
half of what I have away. Last year, I gave 10% of what I have away. I gave 
away $200 million of my $2 billion. I'm looking to getting my foundation up to 
$1 billion. The foundation works primarily in environment and population. There 
are so many problems in the world that need addressing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has been the biggest change in your life since your marriage to Jane 
Fonda? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hard to say. I'm sure I've changed in a lot of subtle ways. When you 
make such a big change in your life, it's bound to change you. You have to 
blend your lives together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has she made you more of a feminist? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, probably, although I believed in women's rights before. In many places 
in this world, they still practice female infanticide. In more than half the 
world, women don't have equal rights with men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you able to relax on your ranch in Montana? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I try to relax. But I end up doing a lot of work wherever I am, out in 
Montana or wherever I am. I get a big Fed Ex box of stuff every day, wherever I 
am. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you ever going to retire? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't plan to.

VOICES: 'PAIN IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE'; ABUNDANCE OF LIQUOR STORES 
MAKES IT ALL TOO EASY TO FIND SOLACE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE, EX-ADDICT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, Earl Massey, 40, of Compton is a project coordinator for the 
Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment. He is a 
recovering alcoholic and cocaine user who guides other abusers through drug and 
alcohol treatment programs. In 1990, Massey landed on Skid Row after losing a 
good job and his house to a cocaine habit. He enrolled in a halfway house for 
drug and alcohol treatment and, after 26 years of alcoholism, has been clean 
and sober for nearly four years. He was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago I weighed 128 pounds, I had been wearing the same jeans for a 
month and a half, my teeth were crumbling and my skin was ashy gray. I looked 
like a dead person. 
</P>
<P>
 I had totally given up. I had worked for the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department as a fire suppression aide and I had made it into the academy hoping 
to be a firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I had a knee injury and I washed out of the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 That really destroyed me. The self-esteem that I had was totally devastated. 
</P>
<P>
 I was already an alcoholic and I continued to drink heavily, but finally 
alcohol was not strong enough to kill the pain. I became involved in cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, I had lost everything to cocaine. My house was foreclosed 
on, I was kicked off my property. 
</P>
<P>
 On Easter Sunday, 1990, I was on Skid Row and a church group was there feeding 
the homeless and hungry. There were gospel singers. I had what was really a 
spiritual experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked up to the sky and I said, "I know you're there and I know you hear 
me." And I said, "I don't want to go on living anymore. Just take me off this 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Then a strange feeling came over me and I just started crying and crying. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple weeks later I met the executive director of the Community Coalition 
and she directed me to a halfway house where I spent 14 months in a 
rehabilitation program learning about substance abuse and examining myself and 
what caused me to want to escape reality. 
</P>
<P>
 I realized that painful experiences in my childhood and adult life, the 
negative effects of racism and alcoholism in my family all contributed to my 
feeling that I was less than other people. 
</P>
<P>
 And that loss of self-esteem made me want to medicate my pain and led to my 
own abuse problems. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I feel it is really dangerous to have an abundance of liquor stores 
in an area that is economically depressed, where people's self-esteem is 
lowered on a continual basis. 
</P>
<P>
 All the ways that people can live in pain and misery -- they all exist in the 
inner city. Pain is what people are trying to escape. People are not taught the 
skills to cope with those emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 The alcohol industry knows exactly what it's doing and what it's perpetuating. 
They are ensuring that they will have a future market by flooding the black 
community with alcohol and making it look so tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 Young kids walk by those liquor stores and they see advertisements for 40 
ounces of Olde English 800 malt liquor, what they call an 8-Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe your environment plays a key factor in what you become in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 If everywhere you turn there are liquor stores, billboards and ads for liquor 
and everyone drinking is shown to be having a good time and finding happiness, 
then you're setting up the next generation to be alcoholics. 
</P>
<P>
 The rappers, who are supposed to be successful images of the black community, 
are part of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 They are shown on all the advertisements for liquor. To me, they are the worst 
traitors. They are not interested in how this stuff affects the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 I went through so much personal pain, I don't want to see other people have to 
repeat what I went though. I had to travel a rough, rough way and I wouldn't 
trade my recovery for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 I started drinking when I was 15 years old, hanging out and trying to fit in 
and be accepted. It was viewed as a normal thing for us kids to save money from 
our lunches and buy beer after school. The stigma of alcoholism never even 
dawned on us. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, most of the dealing for cocaine and other drugs that I did took place 
at liquor stores, using the phones on their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I went through recovery, I realized that alcoholism kept me backward in 
my social skills. I had arrested development from the time I was 15 because I 
turned to alcohol and I just stopped maturing emotionally and socially. 
</P>
<P>
 When you take that kind of immaturity and couple it with the pain in the inner 
city and add in an abundance of alcohol, you're asking for dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
 I do have sympathy for the liquor store owners. I can understand that anyone 
who establishes a business in this country has to struggle to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there were an overabundance of liquor stores in the Korean American 
community, I would be just as angry about that. 
</P>
<P>
 I think sometimes we tend to worship the almighty dollar and put profit ahead 
of people and values. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a profit, to me, is not worth the pain and misery that causes 
alcoholism, the rise in health damages caused by alcohol, and the contribution 
alcohol makes to drive-by shootings, auto accidents and other hazardous 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquor store owners might be making a profit, but just look at the cost in the 
long run to humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, human life is a lot more important than money.

VOICES: 'EVERYONE HAS EVERY RIGHT TO REOPEN'; BUT A SOUTH-CENTRAL BUSINESSMAN 
SAYS LIQUOR STORE OWNERS SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO THE COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS AND BE 
AGENTS OF CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN E. KLEIN, David J. McCulley, 43, lives in South-Central Los Angeles 
and has owned the Astro Mini Mart at Manchester Avenue and Main Street with his 
partners, Troy and Diane Jones, for nearly five years. He is vice president of 
the African American Business Assn. of South-Central Los Angeles, a member of 
the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, and he 
served on Mayor Tom Bradley's Task Force on liquor stores in South-Central. He 
was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I grew up in St. Louis with the same kind of madness that we have here in 
South-Central. There were gangs, alcohol and drugs back then, but what we have 
now is just a lot more blatant. 
</P>
<P>
 When I started my own business, I had several opportunities to go elsewhere, 
but I wanted to come to South-Central and do something for the community. I 
didn't know what, but I just knew I had to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of blacks run away from the inner city and nobody comes up with a 
solution. We become more productive, get better jobs and decide to move to the 
other side of town. Nobody wants to stay here and tackle the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we've been discriminated against and cut out on the short end. But that's 
no reason to stop striving to do better and to keep working.  
</P>
<P>
 We can blame white people, Hispanics and the Koreans. Who are you going to 
blame next? 
</P>
<P>
 There are no more liquor stores here now than there were back when the blacks 
owned them and the Jews and now the Koreans. I don't believe we should tell 
people they can't reopen their stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a person has been in business, I can't sit and make judgments on who can 
come back and who can't. Legally, everyone has every right to reopen their 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 But just the same, you can't open up a business anywhere and not be concerned 
about what's going on in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't allow people to purchase liquor and then sit in front of your store 
and drink it. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't allow people to sell drugs there. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't let people loiter. 
</P>
<P>
 You cannot let trash pile up in your parking lot or have derelicts coming in 
and out and standing in front of your business bumming nickels and dimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At my place of business, we post a sign that lists the rules.  
</P>
<P>
 If people are not following them, I physically go out there and with all due 
respect I tell them to move. 
</P>
<P>
 I have done that from Day One. You can't let problems get started and then 
allow them to fester. 
</P>
<P>
 From the day you open that business, that's when you administer the rules and 
you be consistent in it. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't smoke in my store, you do not drink, you do not sit with open 
containers in my parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not the toughest guys in the world, but somebody has to draw the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontations we have had are minimal because of how we approach the 
people. I speak to them with respect and I explain why we have the rules we 
have. 
</P>
<P>
 I think if there was documentation on stores that were here before -- if they 
knew certain stores were bad apples -- then the city should put conditions on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 They should ensure that they are well-lighted and have security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude of the owners has to be that they are going to be concerned about 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't stop liquor store owners from reopening, but they should come back 
with a new attitude. Not just that they are going to be making money. 
Everybody's in business to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol is a drug. It's legal, but it is a drug and it does tear the fiber of 
our community. I feel if I'm going to sell it, I should counterbalance that by 
doing some good. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it used to be. If you ask people around here, they'll tell you 
that the liquor store owners used to sponsor baseball teams and basketball 
teams and do good things for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 I am involved in the community. Totally involved, probably to the detriment of 
my business. We put on talent shows, we have contests, raffles, we try to 
motivate the kids and help and enhance the adults. 
</P>
<P>
 After the riots, we were badly hurt financially because our power was out for 
10 days and we lost most of our stock and a lot of customers. But we were not 
looted or burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 The looters left us alone mainly because we stood guard outside and kept them 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the people who came over here to help us guard the place were gang 
members. This business is something positive for their community and they 
didn't want to lose it. They didn't want it destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't because I am African American. The people who were looting just 
wanted to do as much damage as possible. They didn't know who owned this store 
and they didn't care. It could have been their brother's store and they still 
would have destroyed it if they could have. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in this community know we're here and they respect us and our 
consistency. The kids call me Pop and they call my partner Pop. The problem 
with the community today is that we as black adults have failed our black 
youth. You can't get around that. 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember when I was young, the next-door neighbor would punish me if I 
did something wrong. And by the time I got home, I knew I was going to get it 
from my mother too. 
</P>
<P>
 The same thing happened in school. If you did wrong, there would be 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it's just total disrespect. But it's our fault -- the adults who grew up 
in that era. We forgot, or didn't choose to pass on our history, morals and 
values. There's no sense to it.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: FULL FRONTAL NUDITY FROM 
THE COMPANY THAT PATENTED THE CUTE WIGGLY TUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Disney's annual shareholders' meetings, invariably one or more conservative 
stockholders will stand up and whine about any of the non-family type films 
that slip through the Magic Kingdom's gates each year. "Walt Disney would be 
turning in his grave if he knew" is a common refrain heard in reference to how 
the company's founder might react to the studio's more racy movies, which are 
made under Disney's adult-oriented movie labels Hollywood Pictures and 
Touchstone, instead of the more traditional Walt Disney Pictures family film 
banner. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Uncle Walt might well be doing back flips right now if he saw Hollywood 
Pictures' forthcoming release "Color of Night," an erotic thriller starring 
Bruce Willis and Jane March ("The Lover") and directed by Richard Rush ("The 
Stunt Man"). 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie -- for which Disney has postponed its April 29 release, possibly 
until late summer, to allow Rush more editing time -- Willis plays an 
unconventional psychologist who, in an attempt to discover the murderer of a 
former colleague, takes over his deceased friend's therapy group, in which he 
believes every patient is a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Willis' character, Bill Capa, meets and has a reckless, passionate 
affair with the beautiful young Rose (March).  
</P>
<P>
 Steamy bootleg outtakes from Willis and March's love scenes are currently 
circulating around Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 It is certain that the estimated $40-million film, which was produced by Andy 
Vajna's Cinergi Productions (and has a distribution deal with Hollywood 
Pictures), would never have been released in Disney's day. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush said that he was given Disney's complete blessing to "go for it" when it 
came to making the film as sexually explicit as he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a meeting before we started shooting and I explained what I wanted to 
do in the film and they said, 'Great, go for it, it sounds terrific,' " recalls 
Rush, referring to Hollywood Pictures President Ricardo Mestres and other 
executives present. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush added that he had heard Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg "came 
to one of the previews and was extremely complimentary and warm about the film 
. . . they tell me he didn't even get up for popcorn or to go to the bathroom 
like he usually does." 
</P>
<P>
 Mestres concurs: "We're making all kinds of movies . . . we were confident 
from the outset that Dick and Andy (Vajna) would always operate within the 
bounds of good taste." He describes "Color of Night" as an "intelligent, very 
erotic, beautifully explicit thriller." 
</P>
<P>
 As for those outtake scenes, which were obtained and viewed on videocassette 
by The Times, they show various underwater shots of Willis and March naked in a 
pool (though Willis keeps on his running shoes) engaged in various acts of 
lust. They also show the passionate couple's bare bodies pressed against a 
glass shower door, as well as a very erotic scene in bed, accompanied by heavy 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, who garnered two Oscar nominations for "Stunt Man" (best director and 
co-screenwriter) and also directed such movies as "Freebie and the Bean" and 
"Getting Straight," said that he has every intention of keeping his movie as 
provocative and sexy as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Including Willis' frontal nudity? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. I'd like to keep both shots where his genitals show," says the director. 
"I haven't had any trouble with Bruce on it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Motion Picture Assn. of America ratings board is having trouble with 
it, and took exception to several scenes after the director's first cut was 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 If the outtakes, and even the trailer, are any indication, "Color of Night" 
would be hard pressed to get anything but an NC-17 rating, and it is well known 
that Disney does not release NC-17 movies. In fact, Rush is contractually 
obligated to bring the film in with an R. 
</P>
<P>
 The director says that what he finds annoying is that the MPAA board will not 
specify exactly what they object to. "They will only say, 'The sequence that 
starts with this gives us trouble, fix it.' " An MPAA spokeswoman would only 
say, "All I can say is the film is unrated at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rush said that the footage in question is what he calls "the big love 
montage," a seven- or eight-minute sequence that starts in the pool, goes to 
the bedroom, the dinner table and ends in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 The director noted that the MPAA did not object to some of the film's other 
"daring love scenes," like the ones between two female characters, one of whom 
is played by Lesley Ann Warren.  
</P>
<P>
 Rush said he was shocked that he "didn't get a peep" out of the MPAA on yet 
another "daring" scene that takes place in a bathtub, where March is on top of 
Willis lying face up as a remote-operated toy tank "runs over her body from 
foot to head." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the director said, "strangely, one scene I'm getting internal 
objections to (from Disney and Cinergi) hardly has any (frontal) nudity," but 
involves a nude March serving dinner to a fully clothed Willis, whom she has 
instructed to put on a formal suit. Rush claims that even though he was told 
the scene was "too much," no one is insisting it be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPAA also took exception to some of the film's violence, particularly the 
big murder scene, in which the hero's friend is stabbed to death. Rush, who is 
steadfast in his position of not wanting to change much of the film, said that 
he will likely resubmit another cut to the ratings board in the next week or 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 He denied rumors that the film's release was being pushed back because of 
various problems, including negative reaction from some test audiences to the 
cliffhanging ending that one source said "looks like a phony shot" and may 
require some reshooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been questions about the ending and we're trying some small 
variations of it," admits Rush, who said that he has been told nothing of any 
reshoots. He is also working on "shortening the final love scene." 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the director says, "I personally am very happy with the movie, 
and for me I'm very pleased with the push back, because right from the 
beginning I said to everybody 'This is a summer picture.' " Then, last week, 
"everyone agreed we weren't giving it the polish it deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 While Rush, Vajna (who is the film's executive producer) and Disney officials 
all insist that the general reaction to the film at its various test screenings 
has been very good, one informed source said, "the plot was confusing and needs 
to be simplified because it takes so many twists and turns." 
</P>
<P>
 Vajna, who said it has not yet been decided if any reshoots are needed, 
insisted that it was "totally my decision" to move the film's release date. "We 
just felt the picture wasn't ready and since we have such a wonderful picture 
why should we rush it out for a slot that was just hypothetically set before we 
had a finished product?"

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: FALL GUYS; THE TOUGHEST 
STUNT OF ALL: GETTING AN OSCAR CATEGORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY BRENNAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One after another, the recent Oscar winners would step up and thank those 
behind the scenes who made it all possible. After all, this year's show theme 
was dedicated to them. But the one group ignored that evening -- and, they 
claim, for the past 66 years -- are those who make the movies possible, the 
stunt players. 
</P>
<P>
 Never has there been an Oscar for stunt men and women. Until last year, they 
were not even allowed to be members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences. Even then, it took a petition with the town's heavyweights -- top 
stars, producers and directors -- to pressure the academy into letting several 
stunt coordinators into the fold. It took a six-year campaign just to get that 
far. And still no Oscar category exists. Stunt people complain that there are 
plenty of special effects and technical categories, but not one to recognize 
those who make the action stars like Schwarzenegger and Stallone and Ford look 
so death-defyingly great. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the snub? Some claim it's because the old-guard academy is slow to accept 
change. In fact, academy Executive Director Bruce Davies says simply, "The 
board has never seen fit to extend a category for stunts. It would get corny as 
hell to have several stunt categories. Do you give an Oscar for people getting 
blown out of windows?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly, say stunt coordinators Jack Gill and David Ellis. Ellis is one of the 
select few who has made it into the academy. The category, they argue, should 
go to stunt coordinators, who are sort of the producers-directors of the actual 
stunts seen in feature films. In some cases they perform the stunts themselves, 
and several are second-unit directors. Their primary duty is to coordinate and 
mastermind all aspects of a film's stunt-work -- which in many ways they say 
can be an intricately detailed science. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Gill, there are probably 2,500 working stunt people, who make up 
about 8% to 10% of the membership of the Screen Actors Guild. "But when you 
look at pay, they probably make up 40% because they are working all the time," 
he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started pushing the academy about six years ago for acknowledgment. But 
everything is by the book and they're pretty staunch individuals when it comes 
to change," Gill said. "So we circulated a petition and got people like Sidney 
Lumet, (producers) Marty Bregman and Bob Rehme, Dustin Hoffman and Harrison 
Ford, director Jim Cameron and Arnold (Schwarzenegger) to support it. There 
were about 80 to 100 names . . . big names on it. So the academy listened." 
</P>
<P>
 Gill added, "The weird part is that they said we didn't fit into either 
artistic or technical ability to qualify" for an Oscar category, "but 
artistically we are creating the action on the screen and technically we're 
devising and designing each part of the stunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Why stunt players never raised their voices in the past is unclear. In the 
early days, Gill says, they used to get paid $5 a day, and many stunt men came 
from the rodeo circuit. From the '60s to the early '80s, stunt work didn't 
change much, with injuries prevalent on most sets. But technology and a better 
understanding of science helped improve that, via the stunt coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you consider that 8 out of the 10 top-grossing films of all time were 
stunt-oriented pictures, that tells you the significance and impact that stunt 
people have on this industry," says Ellis, stunt coordinator on "The Good Son" 
and stunt coordinator and second-unit director on "Patriot Games." But he notes 
that "Patriot Games" producer Rehme, who was president of the academy at the 
time the petition was circulated, was instrumental in getting the board to open 
membership to two stunt coordinators. Two more have been added this year. And 
Ellis says more will be voted in. Once their strength in number increases, they 
will set up the criteria for an appropriate Oscar category. 
</P>
<P>
 But the academy's Davies insists that there are stunt people who don't want to 
see an Oscar category. Why and who they are, Davies can't or won't say. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it stands, there are no immediate plans (for the academy's Awards 
Committee on Rules and its Board of Governors) to look at an Oscar category 
now," Davies added. "And when they do, the process will take years." 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are, 1994 will be just one more year that Oscar will slip from the 
stunt players' grasp.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: 'SUTURE' SWITCH; HEY, JOHN 
RANDOLPH ONCE TURNED INTO ROCK HUDSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By QUENDRITH JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scenario: An evil half-brother angles to switch identities with -- then murder 
-- his semblance in order to escape suspicion for their father's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The twist? Although the characters in the story perform as if the two family 
members are interchangeable, one supposedly "identical" brother is white, the 
other black. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to "Suture," a lush black-and-white, cinematic labyrinth created by 
first-time filmmakers Scott McGehee and David Siegel, who wrote, directed and 
produced the film. It opened recently in Los Angeles and New York after winning 
the best cinematography award at this year's Sundance Film Festival (it will 
gradually open wider by the end of April). 
</P>
<P>
 As the title implies, there's a certain fascination with things surgical in 
the film as the physical and psychological identity of the black man, Clay 
Arlington (played by Dennis Haysbert, who starred in "Love Field"), is 
"reconstructed" as if he were his privileged, white half-brother, Vincent 
Towers (Michael Harris), after Vincent's diabolical plan to dispatch him fails. 
</P>
<P>
 In this disturbingly simple achromic world, neither Clay's psychiatrist nor 
his seductive reconstructive surgeon (played by "thirtysomething's" Mel 
Harris), nor any of the other players seem to notice that a ruse informs their 
story line: that Clay's new, post-surgical Vincent is in fact still the African 
American Dennis Haysbert, not the WASPish Michael Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot in Phoenix, the low-budget feature may seem like a wildly humorous yarn, 
a cruel and bewildering deceit, or an insolent slice of neophyte filmmaking. 
And for different factions of the audience, it will be all of the above.  
</P>
<P>
 A filmmaking team since 1989 when they collaborated on short films in San 
Francisco, "Suture" creators Siegel, 34, a Rhode Island School of Design alum, 
and McGehee, 31, a Japanese film aficionado since leaving Columbia University, 
insist that they have not made a "film about race." 
</P>
<P>
 "We were interested in trying to write a movie about identity, about the 
relationship between the interior and exterior, and the importance we give to 
exterior versus interior, and how we come to know who we are," Siegel says. 
</P>
<P>
 For McGehee, the appeal is that "the audience is actually privy to something 
that the people within the movie are not. Clay's physical exterior, for the 
audience, ends up being a kind of marker for something that isn't there within 
the story." 
</P>
<P>
 But the filmmakers won't be pinned down on exactly what is depicted -- a sole 
black man in a movie made by white filmmakers? A black man playing a white man, 
which renders any distinction moot? 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dennis) is the only (African American) in the film. We were very careful 
about that, it was very planned," McGehee says.  
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Haysbert, who transforms in name only from Clay to Vincent, 
isn't troubled by this aspect of the film. "They didn't want to confuse matters 
by putting any more black characters in it. I had no quarrel with that at all." 
For Haysbert, "Suture" addresses "levels of perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Harris says she knows that some viewers may not "get it." "If you're 
willing to suspend belief about certain things you may visually see, and go 
with what people are doing, it's a different experience than if you sit there 
with your arms folded and don't take anything in." 
</P>
<P>
 McGehee freely admits that "Suture's" cinematic tone owes a lot to Japanese 
auteurs , specifically Hiroshi Teshigahara, whose 1966 surrealistic film "The 
Face of Another" centers on an executive whose scarred visage, and very 
existence, is remade by a plastic surgeon. The medical accouterments like 
cellular skin-tissue maps mounted on the wall in "Suture's" doctor's office, 
are, he says, directly lifted from "The Face of Another."  
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted the whole world that Clay/Vincent occupied to be a gleaming white 
world," Siegel says, "a world where his physical difference would be manifest, 
both to highlight the formal conceit and to highlight what we felt were the 
social metaphors of the film." 
</P>
<P>
 Though rife with issues -- from the class struggle between privileged and 
marginalized whites to interracial relations when Harris' rather archly named 
Dr. Renee Descartes strikes up an affair with her patient -- it remains to be 
seen whether the two filmmakers can control the mixed messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Soderbergh ("sex, lies, and videotape"), who helped raise completion 
money for the project, considers it "a very bold movie." He believes that in 
its budgetary category (the $1-million range), the movie outstrips any of its 
competition. "You see so few films that operate on that many levels," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what the debut filmmakers had in mind, "Suture" is destined for 
a subtextual life of its own. "It tends to break that kind of seamless 
seduction that goes on between the viewer and the characters within the story," 
McGehee points out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clay is his own Vincent," Haysbert says. "I kind of wanted to use this (line) 
as the advertising for the film: 'You can love this film, or you can hate it, 
but you can't dismiss it.' It is very polarizing."

SPRING SPORTS; SALESIAN MUSTANGS MAKE A RUN FOR THE PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Without playing even one league match, the Salesian High volleyball squad is 
already preparing to make a better showing in this season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Mustangs traveled to Las Vegas where they finished 2-5 in two 
days of competition. But the preseason record isn't what counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main concern is going higher (in the post season)," said Mustang Coach 
George Rodriguez, who started the volleyball program six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season the Mustangs dropped their first four matches but finished with 
their second consecutive league title with 16 victories in a row. Salesian's 
streak grew to 17 in the post season, but the Mustangs lost in the second round 
to eventual Division III champion Whittier Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest team the Mustangs played in last week's Easter Tournament was 
Nevada state champion Chaparell High. Salesian lost 15-7, 10-15, 17-15, 17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three Mustangs returned to the team this year, Rodriguez said: At 
5-foot-8, senior outside hitter and captain Phillip Andalon "jumps as if he was 
5-foot-11" and is averaging 12 kills a match. With an average of 30 assists a 
game, Juan Rodriguez is "like the quarterback of the team." And 6-foot-2 middle 
blocker George Sanchez averages six kills and 10 stuff blocks a match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs will be looking for its fourth Santa Fe League title. Their 
season opener is April 12 against Daniel Murphy. Swimming 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield's Martha Ramos broke six school records in three meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old sophomore set new girls' varsity records in the 500 freestyle 
(6:34.69) in the Bulldogs' victory over Huntington Park, and the 100 backstroke 
(1:12.58) at Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also the third swimmer of the record-breaking 400 freestyle relay 
team, which included Dianne Jordan, Liz Hernandez and Laura Avila. Volleyball 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola 3, Royal 0 -- The undefeated Cubs rolled over the 1993 Division II 
finalist, 15-8, 15-7, 15-13, in a nonleague match Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the last game was so close was because we put different people in 
to play," said Cub Coach Darrick Lucero. "They were catching up with our 
offense, but they couldn't keep up with our passers." 
</P>
<P>
 Setter Steve Donne ran the offense and middle blockers Lee Bennett and Dan 
Farmer dominated the middle with good passing. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola 3, Playa del Rey St. Bernard 0 -- It took the Cubs less than an hour 
Tuesday to trample Mission League guest St. Bernard, 15-6, 15-4, 15-13, for its 
sixth Mission League victory. The third game featured setter Vaughn Montgomery 
running the offense with Biran Donne spiking five kills and three aces. Brad 
Walsh was instrumental in backcourt ball control with good passes to the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy 3, Cathedral 0 -- Blown out in the first two games, the Phantoms 
briefly held a 6-4 lead in the third game during a Santa Fe League match 
Thursday. Riddled with serving errors, Murphy had no trouble coming back and 
winning in three, 15-3, 15-2, 15-9. Setter Paul Villareal was the main 
offensive force for Cathedral with several key assists while his brother, 
junior outside hitter Jerry, served three aces and struggled to tally three 
kills. Tennis 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino 11 1/3, Loyola 9 2/3 -- The Cubs' four-match winning streak was 
snapped in nonleague competition Thursday. Loyola won seven of nine singles but 
lost seven out of nine doubles matches. Winning in straight sets, senior Ryan 
Becker remains undefeated in five matches while his ninth-grade brother, David, 
won two sets and lost one. Sophomore Mike Ortiz gave up one set as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other close match Loyola has had this season was with Thousand Oaks, 
13-8, while the rest of its preseason schedule has consisted of blowouts. "We 
should be competing for the league title against Harvard-Westlake," said 
first-year Coach Mike Denison. Soccer 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont boys' soccer Coach Nancy Carr-Swaim will be featured in KCET-TV 
Channel 28's "Life and Times" at 7:30 p.m. and midnight Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary, produced and reported by Esther Reyes, highlights 
Carr-Swaim's career as a woman coaching a boys' sport.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the two months I was with them, I saw her relationship with the boys 
blossom and the growth of the team," Reyes said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carr-Swaim guided the Sentinels to their second City Section title less than a 
month ago but was forced to relinquish it after a player was ruled ineligible. 
Belmont is waiting an answer on its appeal.

A BALDWIN BROTHERS CRIB SHEET

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were, at last count, four members of that famous Long Island thespian 
family, the Baldwins of Massapequa, active before the cameras of Hollywood. And 
you have to admit it: Sometimes it's tough to tell this set of sexy siblings 
apart. Sure, it's easy to remember that Alec is the one who married Kim 
Basinger. But it was Daniel or William who showed up in "Three of Hearts," the 
romantic comedy about a three-way love affair? Stephen or Daniel who played 
Daryl Hannah's caddish husband in "Attack of the 50-Foot Woman"? Stephen or 
William in "8 Seconds," playing a real-life rodeo star? Herewith, the 
definitive guide to help tell those pesky Baldwins apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Alec Age: 35 Significant other: Wife Kim Basinger, married August, 1993. 
First made an impression: On "Knots Landing," as a randy evangelist. Movie 
breakthrough role: As lovable CIA agent Jack Ryan in "The Hunt for Red 
October." Most recently seen: Imitating Steve McQueen in "The Getaway." Look: 
Leading man handsomeness: killer smile, blue eyes, great physique. Typical 
role: Suave, intelligent, cool leading man with sensitivity and 
self-deprecating sense of humor. Chest hair: Like a gorilla. If he didn't shave 
his neck, his chest hair would grow all the way to his eyebrows. 
Extracurricular activities: Animal rights activism; moral support of Kim's 
trial. Career trajectory: On the rise until "Marrying Man" debacle; playing 
Broadway cost him Jack Ryan franchise; still the biggest star of the four but 
in need of a hit; maybe summer's "The Shadow" will do the trick. * 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Daniel Age: 33 Significant other: Wife Elizabeth; married April, 1990 
First made an impression: As a talkative detective with marital problems on 
cult NBC hit "Homicide: Life on the Street." Movie breakthrough role: Still 
waiting. Most recently seen: In HBO's remake of "Attack of the 50-Foot Woman," 
flailing helplessly in Daryl Hannah's hand. Look: Alec, with jowls. Looks 
chunkier than he is because he lacks a neck. Typical role: Cocky sidekick; 
lowlife philanderer with a bad attitude. Chest hair: Unknown; has yet to doff 
his shirt in a prominent role. Extracurricular activities: Until recently, 
waiting to see if "Homicide" was going to be renewed (it was). Career 
trajectory: Needs to make an impact in a big film or be reduced to being the 
Zeppo of the Baldwin brothers. * 
</P>
<P>
 Name: William Age: 31 Significant other: Most recently linked to Chynne 
Philips. First made an impression: In "Flatliners," as Kevorkian manque with a 
conscience. Movie breakthrough role: As sexy firefighter in "Backdraft." 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently seen: In the altogether with Sherilyn Fenn and Kelly Lynch in 
"Three of Hearts" and with Sharon Stone in "Sliver." 
</P>
<P>
 Look: Eurotrash version of Alec: slightly watered down and callow; prettier 
but less rugged. Typical role: Romantic lead with much to learn -- about women 
and himself. Chest hair: Virile thatch, but not overrun like Alec. 
Extracurricular activities: Upholding the Baldwin bachelor tradition, so that 
his brothers might live through him vicariously. Career trajectory: Needs a 
role that casts him as something other than the roadshow Alec. * 
</P>
<P>
 Name: Stephen Age: 27 Significant other: Wife Kennya; married June, 1990. 
First made an impression: Slapping leather on "The Young Riders." Movie 
breakthrough role: As the white guy in Mario Van Peebles' "Posse." Most 
recently seen: In "8 Seconds" as a rodeo star and in upcoming "Threesome" as 
one-third of an unconventional roommate arrangement. Look: Like an Alec whose 
DNA has been scrambled. Typical role: The hero's slightly doofy buddy with a 
heart of gold; the boor with a secret streak of vulnerability. Chest hair: 
Hairless as a pre-adolescent. Extracurricular activities: Posing for beefcake 
calendar. Career trajectory: On the upswing, if he can grow into character 
roles once played by Warren Oates and Randy Quaid.; ; ;

BASEBALL; COUGARS POUNCE ON DEMOCRATS EARLY, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the start of the Jefferson-Crenshaw baseball game last week Democrat 
assistant coach Victor Hayes was more concerned about his starting pitcher's 
lack of preparation than the opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Jefferson team arrived late at Crenshaw, Gabriel Avila didn't have 
time for many warm-up pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hayes' fear became reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars scored all of their runs in the first inning en route to a 5-2 win 
in an L.A. Invitational second-round game Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabby had control problems in the first inning, but after that Crenshaw 
couldn't hit his curveball," Hayes said. "If he had gotten warmed up before the 
start of the game, we could've won." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw assistant coach Herb McNeely agreed: "(Avila) had some control 
problems in the first inning and we were able to take advantage. Once he 
started throwing that off-speed pitch, he was in control." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila (0-2) scattered two hits over the last six innings, which included seven 
strikeouts and three walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Down 5-1, the Democrats closed the gap in the top of the sixth when first 
baseman Ramses Cobian, who walked before stealing second and third, scored on 
Crenshaw catcher Mark Sarria's errant pick-off throw to third. 
</P>
<P>
 Cougar pitcher Leslie Williams (1-0) walked the next two batters, then threw a 
wild pitch, advancing the runners to second and third and putting the tying run 
at the plate in Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Avila struck out on five pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our chances in this game, we just didn't capitalize," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crenshaw did, making the most of its opportunities in the first.

WHAT'S THEIR NEW LINE? DEALING FOR BIG DOLLARS; WITH TED TURNER'S BACKING, THE 
STUDIO HAS MOVED FROM GENRE FILMS INTO EXPENSIVE STAR VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in a town where big deals are commonplace, this one grabbed Hollywood's 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Cinema, known for modestly budgeted genre-driven film series such as 
"A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles," had paid a 
staggering $7 million to comedian Jim Carrey to star in a movie called "Dumb & 
Dumber." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie company had paid him only $450,000 to star in its upcoming release, 
"The Mask," but that was prior to the surprise box-office success of his comedy 
"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" for Warner Bros., which has grossed more than $64 
million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 But the comedian, perhaps best known for his zany characters on the Fox-TV 
show "In Living Color," had no previous track record in feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was stunned (by the Carrey deal)," said one industry source. "I 
think the guy made $350,000 (for "Ace"), and all of a sudden someone was 
handing him $7 million." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, New Line paid $3.3 million for Marlon Brando to star 
opposite Johnny Depp, who received $2.75 million, in "Don Juan De Marco and the 
Centerfold." Francis Ford Coppola was paid $1 million to produce the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 In rapid succession, New Line also paid a high six-figure sum for a romantic 
comedy spec script called "Desperate Measures"; spent $400,000 to option a 
script called "Mango" (described as an "Odd Couple"-type story in which the 
Felix character is played by an orangutan); and won a seven-figure bidding war 
for action director John Woo ("Hard Target") to do a film about a Florida cop 
tied up with the mob. They also spent $300,000 to option "Second Defense," a 
big sci-fi movie with Arnold Kopelson ("The Fugitive") producing. 
</P>
<P>
 If that wasn't enough, sources told The Times that New Line currently is in 
discussions with Carrey on yet another $7-million deal to star in a sequel to 
"The Mask" and talks also are under way inside the company on whether he will 
star in a movie called "The Best Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all over town throwing gobs of money at everything," quipped one 
entertainment attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time not long ago when the 27-year-old New Line Cinema would not 
have been a player in Hollywood's high-stakes bidding wars. The old New Line 
never could afford to make movies for more than $15 million and most often they 
were well under $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ted Turner arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 In one decisive move, the Atlanta-based cable broadcasting mogul acquired New 
Line last year in a $550-million deal while also negotiating a separate deal 
worth $200 million for another independent, Castle Rock Entertainment, which 
has released such hits as "In the Line of Fire" and "A Few Good Men." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line suddenly had the means to compete for hot scripts and A-list actors, 
directors and writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if we found the right vehicle," said New Line founder and chairman 
Robert Shaye, "it would only take a telephone call to Ted and he would provide 
us with the wherewithal required." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaye's deal with Turner was so lucrative, in fact, sources said, that as a 
way of thanking people for his success he invited dozens of close friends to 
show up at midnight last Wednesday at Los Angeles International Airport for a 
mystery charter flight to an unknown warm-weather destination for a four-day 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Turner, New Line officials said, the company had already decided to 
expand, but now the process has been accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had gone from producing seven films a year to 11," said Michael De Luca, 
New Line's president of production. "Post-Turner, we're going to try and do 15 
a year and three to five of the extra films will be bigger -- directly 
competitive with the major-studio type of movie. For those films, our budgets 
will be anywhere from $18 million to $25 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaye said that Turner has not broached the subject of what films would be 
taboo under his ownership and has assured company officials they have autonomy 
to choose projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "As he said to me," Shaye recalled, " 'I'm not into horror films, but when I 
was a kid I was. I understand when you are making films for a particular 
market, you have to understand the market you are making them for.' His 
perspective is that whenever possible, take the high road." 
</P>
<P>
 Turner told a theater exhibitors convention in Las Vegas recently that his 
newly purchased companies have more than $500 million in negatives in progress 
and that he intends to "kick that up over the next couple of years to over $1 
billion." 
</P>
<P>
 While Castle Rock has already proven it can attract big stars like Clint 
Eastwood, Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise to its productions, New Line must 
persuade a wary town that it can do likewise. This "mini-major" studio located 
in Beverly Hills and New York must show the creative community that it has the 
marketing savvy to bring out hit films. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of selling the town on New Line has fallen on De Luca, 28, and 
Richard Saperstein, 32, the executive vice president of production. 
</P>
<P>
 They are an unlikely pair. 
</P>
<P>
 De Luca, who grew up in the company and has been there since he was 19, wears 
an earring and trimmed beard, speaks with a soft Brooklyn accent and is just as 
likely to arrive at work in Nikes and jeans astride a Harley-Davidson as in an 
Armani suit at the wheel of his teal Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saperstein, a former agent at International Creative Management, seems most 
comfortable in a blue suit, black shoes and white shirt (with red polka-dot 
tie). He has studied English literature, dabbled in poetry and once wrote 
speeches for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
 De Luca said that his favorite film is "Lawrence of Arabia," although he longs 
for a return of the anti-hero films of the 1970s like "Serpico" and "Dog Day 
Afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 "To make a 'Taxi Driver' today would be ideal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saperstein said that he would like to make movies like "When Harry Met Sally . 
. ." or "Terms of Endearment." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my favorite movies is 'The Man Who Would Be King,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few months, these men with starkly contrasting styles have been 
meeting with many of the top agents in town, explaining how New Line will now 
go after bigger-budget films. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a 'Mrs. Doubtfire' so bad . . . ," De Luca said, referring to the 
Robin Williams comedy that has grossed more than $200 million for 20th Century 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 With Turner's deep pockets, New Line has made it known that it is willing to 
spend the big bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the right actor, we'd offer $15 million," Saperstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Luca conceded that the bidding for Carrey probably went too high at $7 
million. "Maybe we overpaid a little bit, but (Carrey) was already up for 
$4-million and $5-million offers (from Universal and 20th Century Fox)," De 
Luca said. "If we overpaid, it was only by $1 million or $2 million." 
</P>
<P>
 What also moved New Line to act decisively, De Luca said, was that Carrey's 
next film, "The Mask," is already in the can for New Line and company officials 
think that it will be a monster hit this summer. So do exhibitors, judging from 
the strong positive reaction they gave the film's trailer at ShoWest Convention 
in Las Vegas last month. 
</P>
<P>
 At $20 million, "The Mask" is New Line's biggest in-house production to date. 
Based on a dark, best-selling comic series, the PG-13 film will feature 
state-of-the-art special effects with a visual effects budget exceeding $7 
million. Ken Ralston and Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic have created 
digital and optical special effects for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a mask and is instantly transformed 
into a whirlwind of light and power, a human top spinning around his apartment, 
until he becomes a green-faced contortionist who knows how to fulfill every 
desire, satisfy every whim and play all kinds of pranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey said that it was a combination of his success with "Ace Ventura" and 
what they saw in "The Mask" that made New Line not want him to jump to another 
studio with his next film. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them, it's a vote of confidence in 'The Mask,' " Carrey said of his 
multimillion-dollar deal with New Line. "They wouldn't be going this far out 
with anybody unless they thought they had something that was very cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "The Mask," New Line's 1994 lineup includes "Corrina, Corrina," in 
which Whoopi Goldberg stars as a housekeeper hired by a recently widowed father 
(Ray Liotta); "In the Mouth of Madness," John Carpenter's psychological horror 
film about an insurance investigator who must find a missing writer whose 
latest novel wreaks havoc on the life of anyone who reads it, and "Wes Craven's 
New Nightmare," a return of Freddy Krueger by the creator of "A Nightmare on 
Elm Street." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line's emergence as a deal maker has not come without controversy. A small 
film company called Outlaw Productions recently filed suit against the company, 
claiming that New Line stole "Don Juan De Marco and the Centerfold." 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason, these guys with their new-found muscle, decided to take 
over the project," said one Hollywood source. "They wanted to be seen in a 
high-profile project in which Marlon Brando and Francis Ford Coppola were 
working together again (since "Apocalypse Now")." New Line would not comment on 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its longevity, New Line has had to reinvent itself to keep 
competitive. No longer just a niche marketing and distribution company, the 
independent movie operation now must earn respect from Hollywood's more 
mainstream creative community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Richard and I are in the 'We need to prove it to the town' phase of 
our existence," says De Luca, "because whenever you start doing something you 
haven't done before, the attitude is 'Prove it to us.' "

COMMENTARY; THE APPEAL OF GETTING BACK TO THE CLASSICS; MULTICULTURALISM IS THE 
UNLIKELY FUEL FOR THE BURST OF CLASSICAL REPERTORY WORK IN SOME LOCAL THEATERS. 
TAKE CHEKHOV'S 'WOOD DEMON' AT TAPER FOR INSTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles has never been a mecca for classical theater buffs. The 
overweening influence of the film and television industries, with their 
emphasis on pop culture, has affected even what gets produced on local stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in the past few years, there's been a surge of interest in the classics -- 
the Western canon generally thought to include everything from Greek tragedy to 
such vintage Americana as Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," with an emphasis on 
such giants as Shakespeare, Ibsen, Shaw and Chekhov. The opening this week of 
Anton Chekhov's "The Wood Demon" by the Antaeus Company at the Mark Taper Forum 
marks the high point so far in this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, the Taper has provided rehearsal space and workshops 
for the Antaeus Company, a group of established actors committed to creating 
permanent classical repertory in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wood Demon" is the inaugural production for the group, and although the 
Taper is not committed to producing the group beyond this staging, its backing 
of this show by a local company signals a potentially significant turn of 
events for classical theater here. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the Taper has presented a classical repertory 
company, but it is their first presentation of an L.A.-based classical company, 
despite doing a series of works in repertory in the early '80s with many local 
artists. The Taper's imprimatur is particularly significant given the venue's 
dominant position in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Antaeus has not, however, been the only local company trying to advance L.A.'s 
cultural image. Glendale's A Noise Within, founded in 1991, operates a 99-seat 
theater and has done well with both audiences and critics. There have also been 
sundry other groups at work, from new companies like L.A. Women's Shakespeare 
Company, to workshop-oriented groups like the Classical Theatre Lab to the more 
seasoned troupes like Shakespeare Festival/L.A., among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's one (admittedly impressive) thing for a 99-seat theater like A Noise 
Within to make a go of it, and another for the city's flagship theater to throw 
its weight behind such a project. 
</P>
<P>
 And not for nothing is it happening now. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, L.A. finally seems to have an audience for the Bard and others -- witness 
the crowds for Le Theatre du Soleil and the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984 
at the Olympic Arts Festival, Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theatre Company at 
the Taper in 1990, and Ian McKellen's "Richard III" at UCLA in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, New York's depressed economy has driven more conservatory-trained actors 
and directors here to work in film and TV than ever before, and many of them 
still want to work in their favored medium. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to this sudden push than supply and demand. The trend that 
helped move classics to the fore, ironically enough, has been multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s relationship to classical theater has always been different from that 
of other major cities. In addition to L.A.'s populist image, there's the fact 
that L.A.'s major cultural institutions came into being much later than those 
of New York, Boston, Washington or any number of other places, and the 
European-based traditions have never been as rooted here as they have 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles theater is a child of the '60s. That's when the Music Center and 
the city's other major institutions -- those places traditionally charged with 
propagating the canon -- were built. It was also a time of counterculture, not 
classical repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taper, founded in 1967, put itself on the map with political docudramas 
like "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer" (1968), about the physicist who 
pioneered the development of the first atomic bomb, "The Trial of the 
Catonsville Nine" (1971), a courtroom docudrama about a Vietnam war protest, 
and "Zoot Suit" (1978), Luis Valdez's Pachuco-era drama inspired by a 
historical incident. And while the Taper has always presented about one 
classical work per season, it has also stayed the topical, politically charged 
course, up to and including Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, and particularly in the wake of the demise of the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center, the Taper has jumped on the multiculturalism bandwagon -- 
making nods to racial (if not gender) representation in the artists whose works 
they choose to develop as well as what they put on their mainstage. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way the Taper is emblematic of L.A. theater in general, for even as 
multiculturalism has flourished on local stages in recent years, there has been 
an increased focus on the classics. Call it a backlash, a desire on the one 
hand for traditional actors -- white and non-white -- to work on time-tested 
texts and on the other hand to carve out a niche for themselves in the way 
multicultural advocates have. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 appears to have been the turning point. That year, the Taper, Too, which 
had long served as the Taper's primary venue for new works, broke with 
practice, presenting three conceptual productions of older European texts. A 
Music Center document at the time listed "a repertory company" as one of the 
"top priorities of the Mark Taper Forum," noting the success of Branagh and 
company and that "there is no regularly scheduled classical theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1991 -- the same year that A Noise Within was launched -- LATC added a 
Classical Theatre Lab to its list of ethnic and gender-based groups. (The Lab 
continued after LATC, under the direction of Robert Machray.) 
</P>
<P>
 And so we have a paradox. For while early multiculturalism disdained the 
classics as the theatrical equivalent of the Great Books, the movement has 
helped to bring the canon to a city historically unenthused by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, though, it's not simply a reactionary backlash of Anglo 
traditionalists; this may be the next step for multiculturalism. Plenty of 
non-white theater artists are interested in subjects other than ethnic 
identity, as is evident from the diversity in the ranks of both Antaeus and A 
Noise Within. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the current interest in racially integrated casting of classical fare 
-- a "non-traditional" approach made popular by Joseph Papp's New York 
Shakespeare Festival and used in the Taper's 1991 "Julius Caesar" and 1992 
"Richard II" -- is proof that the L.A. stage community wants to move beyond the 
parochialisms of both the traditional institutional theater and early 
multiculturalism, both of which have practiced de facto, if not ideological, 
separatism. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiculturalists have long been pitted against the classicists, when their 
objectives don't have to be mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Classic texts speak to us about age-old problems that cut across divisions of 
race, gender and class, and hopefully L.A. is at last be ready to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Wood Demon," for example, the titular protagonist finds new resolve 
even as the forest of Telibeyevsk burns. His contradictory emotions are likely 
to ring strangely true for people who live in L.A. But then, what better 
playwright to illuminate the sense of futility and forbearance that Angelenos 
feel than Chekhov?

THE EDUCATION OF UNCANNY ALLIANCE; THE DUO'S FIRST RECORD WAS BOOTLEGGED INTO 
NEW YORK'S BIGGEST DANCE HIT, AND 'I'M BEAUTIFUL DAMMIT!' SHOULD HAVE BEEN A 
CROSSOVER SMASH. THIS TIME OUT, THEY'RE READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST HARDY, Ernest Hardy is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uncanny Alliance's "I'm Beautiful Dammit!" is one of the most affecting 
protest songs of the '90s, but it didn't come from pithy alternative rockers or 
angry rappers. It came from the dance world, normally the last place you look 
for biting commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 The sly, subtle, hook-laden song strikes a blow for everyone trying to find 
self-worth in a culture where race, supermodel good looks and fat bankrolls 
generally set the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The single's most memorable element is a pleading and defiant chorus -- "Ain't 
this my sun / Ain't this my moon / Ain't this my world / To be who I choose?" 
-- set against a jittery guitar, swirling keyboards and funky, insistent beats. 
In the background, a robotic male voice bellows repeatedly, "You don't belong!" 
</P>
<P>
 It's no small irony that "House of Style," MTV's tribute to superficiality and 
exclusivity, missed the point and featured the song during one of its 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 A far more substantial song than anything from C+C Music Factory (whose "Gonna 
Make You Sweat" in 1990 remains one of the biggest hits ever from the dance 
world), "I'm Beautiful" had all the earmarks of becoming the crossover hit of 
the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 But the single, which was released late last year, never made it out of the 
dance scene for a variety of marketing reasons -- no small frustration for the 
duo of Brinsley Evans, 27, and E.V. Mystique, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time the pair had seen a potential hit slip through their 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 A year before "I'm Beautiful," Uncanny Alliance's "I Got My Education" was the 
biggest dance hit in New York. The problem then was that the duo didn't yet 
have a record deal. Their demo tape of the song had fallen into the hands of 
local deejays and was widely bootlegged. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time their official version of the song was released by A&M early last 
year, it was too late. The buzz had passed and deejays were already looking 
ahead to the next Uncanny Alliance record. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair and A&M are now hoping that the third time is truly the charm. 
They've just put the finishing touches on their new single, "Everybody Up," a 
rich slice of state-of-the-art dance fare due May 3. An album will follow in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious counterpart to Uncanny Alliance is Deee-Lite, the New York 
trio best known for its 1992 hit "Groove Is in the Heart." Where Deee-Lite 
merged club grooves with idealistic, '60s-style politics, however, Uncanny 
Alliance offers a more biting and sometimes somber look at the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that really sets Brinsley and E.V. apart is the way they combine 
all these different elements into a compelling whole," says Manny Lehman, 
director of A&R for A&M's dance department. "They have a hard-edged street/club 
sensibility that comes straight from the underground. The music is just a 
little to the left of center, a touch artsy, but still legitimate club music." 
</P>
<P>
 Uncanny Alliance's story began seven years ago when Evans and Mystique met in 
New York's legendary, now defunct house music club the Paradise Garage. He was 
a college student and she was a hairdresser, and neither was planning a career 
in music until they met. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' Jamaican parents had not been especially musical, and the 
keyboardist-lyricist, who always wanted to be an entertainer, didn't think 
specifically of a career in music until meeting the Flushing-born, 
Hollis-raised Mystique. Like her partner, she comes from a family with no 
particular bent for music. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Evans grew up listening to AM radio, being influenced by everyone from 
Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles to Quincy Jones and Ashford & Simpson, it was 
through the powerful house grooves of the Paradise that they found both their 
calling and their voices. 
</P>
<P>
 With a third friend from that club, they signed a development deal with 
Columbia in 1991. When that deal fell through a year later, Evans and Mystique 
formed Uncanny Alliance and recorded the infamous demo of "I Got My Education." 
With its irresistible groove, playful vibe and attitude-drenched cries of "Miss 
Thing, Miss Thing," the record overflowed with the influence of the Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was host to the most diverse elements of the city, a home for all 
races and every degree of sexuality, with house music -- the bass-heavy, 
groove-driven music epitomized by mainstream hits such as Technotronic's "Pump 
Up the Jam" -- the glue that held it all together. That brand of cultural 
eclecticism is effortlessly reflected in both the lyrics and music of Uncanny 
Alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo's songs speak of wearying, dead-end jobs and the need for weekend 
release. They talk of the chore of trying to "find yourself" when you're not 
sure you have the tools for the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 In their songs, they juggle a natural warmth and compassion with a socially 
mandated steely facade, viewing the world with the jaded eye that is more 
prominent in rap and alternative music, but diffusing tensions -- and finding 
common ground -- through wickedly dry humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Their talent was immediately apparent back in that 1992 demo of "I Got My 
Education," a wry, tongue-in-cheek tale of an arrogant club kid's fall into 
unemployment and homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at how the bootleg copies undercut the single's commercial 
chances, Evans says: "I wouldn't say I was angry. It was taking so long for us 
to come out with the real record and there were so many cassettes passed around 
that it was kind of inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it happened, I was pissed off for about a day but after that we said, 
'OK, let's move on,' and we handled it with humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's sad that we live in a world where (bootlegging) is a reality, where 
you would actually expect to be ripped off like that." 
</P>
<P>
 When Uncanny Alliance returned late last year with "I'm Beautiful Dammit!," 
the pair lived up to all the early expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Where much of popular dance music exists on a purely giddy, surface level, 
"I'm Beautiful" had an air of longing, melancholy and even a dash of anger that 
fleshed out its grooves. 
</P>
<P>
 The single was embraced by Top 40 radio stations all across Eastern and 
Southern markets even before the record had a chance to catch on in clubs. But 
that early pop success proved a mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite reaching No. 2 on the Billboard magazine club chart, the record never 
made the leap onto the more significant pop charts. It did well enough in East 
Coast dance clubs to earn its high Billboard ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 But somewhere along the line, club deejays nationwide, perhaps put off by its 
initial pop success, became resistant to the track. Without their solid 
support, the record did a crash-and-burn on radio. Having failed to establish a 
strong enough dance base nationwide, it never moved beyond its status as a 
regional hit. "We're starting to get in a trickle of calls from deejays who are 
just discovering the record, or who are playing it again, and the response has 
been amazing," says Lehman, the man who signed the team to A&M. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to "Beautiful's" layers of meaning, the new "Everybody Up" pays 
tribute to the dance floor's power of escapism, with no underlying messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyrically, the record simply exhorts the listener -- in classic club tradition 
-- to throw "hands in the air, now, shake" and to "pump it up, wear it out, do 
it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, however, it's much more ambitious. Lifting from the classy end of 
disco (think the Salsoul Orchestra or Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra), 
Uncanny Alliance delivers an infectious, exuberant concoction by stirring in 
the harder-edged percussion that has become so popular in dance music recently 
and adding spacey synthesizer effects and a throbbing, shifting groove. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really all about simplicity," says Mystique when describing the song. 
"The character I am in this song is what Brinsley and I call the military party 
girl. We're not making people look at anything. Where the other two singles 
told stories, this one is simply about getting out there on the dance floor. 
It's about letting go of your inhibitions." 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction is an important one because it sets "Everybody Up" apart from 
the rest of the pair's just-completed album, "The Groove Won't Bite."  
</P>
<P>
 The album is populated with characters struggling with feelings of isolation 
and self-doubt. But instead of wails of anguish or self-pity, you find 
lacerating humor, mock-diva attitude and a generous spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this dose of reality in the mix that clarifies Evans' stance that, 
despite his allegiance to the dance world, Uncanny Alliance's themes and 
concerns aren't all that different from those of artists such as Pearl Jam or 
Snoop Doggy Dogg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love their artistry and I understand where the anger comes from," he says. 
"It's just not my thing. It's not my approach. But Snoop Doggy Dogg's album, on 
one level I thought, was absolutely brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "On another level I thought it was sad, very sad. I can listen to it and 
understand where they are coming from, but it's a really sad place to be coming 
from." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Mystique: "A lot of people are very unhappy in the world right now. You 
can just see a sadness in their faces; it's like they can't smile or anything. 
I think a lot of it comes from people who don't feel good about themselves, so 
they want to give other people a hard time instead of trying to find a little 
happiness or comfort in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a humorous side to what we do because we believe if you don't laugh 
through life, you're gonna end up crying. If you don't change the way you think 
about things within yourself, you can drown in negativity. Our music 
acknowledges the dark stuff, we just don't give in to it."

FANS GET WISHES GRANTED AS ANGELS BEAT DODGERS, 5-2; BASEBALL: THE CROWD OF 
47,735 AT ANAHEIM STADIUM GETS TO SEE BO JACKSON HIT A LONG HOMER AND ROOKIE 
PARK PITCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 47,735 Angel and Dodger fans at Anaheim Stadium Saturday night probably 
showed up for a number of reasons -- booing Darryl Strawberry apparently high 
on the list for both sides -- but those who came hoping to see Bo Jackson hit a 
baseball a long way and Dodger rookie Chan Ho Park pitch were not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans weren't the only ones ready for a Jackson blast. When he connected 
with the first delivery from Tom Candiotti in the second inning of the Angels' 
5-2 exhibition victory, the fireworks were exploding beyond right field before 
the ball landed in the second deck in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't merely a lucky guess, however. Jackson's towering drive came down an 
estimated 449 feet from home plate. It was his sixth homer of the spring, three 
times as many as any of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels managed three unearned runs against Park and beat the Dodgers for 
the second night in a row to take a 2-0 lead in the Freeway Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area has been Dodgertown for a long time," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers 
said, "and we've been the crap around here since I caught in that 1962 Freeway 
Series. So it's nice to get a little respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Park's Southern California debut was an auspicious one for one inning, anyway. 
In the fourth inning, he got 1993 rookie of the year Tim Salmon to fly to 
right, struck out designated hitter Chili Davis on a high fastball and then 
caught Jackson looking at a change-up. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the fifth, Eduardo Perez reached first when third baseman Dave Hansen 
bobbled his grounder. Perez then stole second. Park walked Chris Turner, and 
utility infielder Rex Hudler lined a single to right to score Perez. Gary 
DiSarcina bunted the runners to second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Curtis drove in the second run of the inning with a grounder to second 
and then Park, who was called for six balks in 23 innings this spring, got No. 
7 when Hudler came dancing 20 feet down the line from third base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that these things are happening during exhibition games," Park said 
through his interpreter. "I'm learning quite a bit from these happenings. I've 
balked with men on first, second, and tonight on third, so there isn't much to 
accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Park may have been in the spotlight on this evening, but the Angel staff has 
been on the spot much of the spring. The Angels entered the game yielding an 
average of eight runs per game and opponents were batting .334.  
</P>
<P>
 But, for the second night in a row, the pitchers looked as if they really 
could be efficient enough to allow the Angels to contend for the pennant in the 
realigned American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting to round into shape a little, especially the bullpen," Rodgers 
said. "I hope we're getting our act together at the right time. For the first 
three or four weeks, it was pretty ugly down there (in Tempe)." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's performance was almost as impressive as Friday night's 
shutout. And for the Angels, who are 9-19 this spring, it was their fifth 
victory in the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Finley started and gave up three hits, including a home run to center by 
rookie Raul Mondesi. But he struck out four, gave up only one walk and 
generally appeared to have command of his pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Leftwich, who will be the fourth starter, worked a perfect three innings 
after Finley, striking out two to pick up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stretched our starters out a little," Rodgers said, "and this was a good 
tuneup for both Finley and Leftwich. I think our arms are coming out of the 
dead stage now and we're peaking at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Butcher, who has struggled and recently been demoted to a middle relief 
role by Rodgers, pitched the seventh inning. He made one mistake and Strawberry 
-- getting a measure of revenge on the boo-birds and even eliciting a 
smattering of applause -- muscled it into the right field bullpen beyond the 
reach of a leaping Salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels responded with a run in the bottom of the inning on a single by 
Turner and a run-scoring double by Curtis to regain their three-run advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Craig Lefferts, who needed only nine pitches to retire the Dodgers in 
order in the eighth, and Bill Sampen, who is recovering from a bicep injury and 
worked a 1-2-3 ninth, did their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 And the guy with the fireworks did his again.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S AND WOMEN'S FINAL FOURS; TECH AND CAROLINA GET 
TO PLAY TODAY; WOMEN: BANGED-UP TECHSTERS GET PAST ALABAMA, THEN JONES HELPS 
TAR HEELS RUN PAST PURDUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Louisiana Tech staggered to its 25th consecutive victory Saturday afternoon, 
but Coach Leon Barmore wondered afterward if he would have enough players for 
today's NCAA women's national championship game against North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Techsters (31-3), it was a game of attrition in the second half as 
three regulars were carried off with ankle sprains and a fourth played with a 
groin injury in the final 10 minutes in a 69-66 victory over Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina (32-2), winner of 13 in a row, showed off its freshman, Marion 
Jones, and streak shooter Charlotte Smith in burying Purdue, 89-74, in the 
second game at the Richmond Coliseum before 11,966. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who set the national high school 200-meter record last year at Thousand 
Oaks High, took advantage of her speed. 
</P>
<P>
 She had six steals, and another half-dozen or so tipped balls that disrupted 
Purdue's offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us were fully aware of how quick Marion Jones was until 
today -- I certainly wasn't," Purdue Coach Lin Dunn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't simulate that kind of speed in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Barmore, whose team won Saturday's first semifinal, will have to move fast to 
prepare for today's final. 
</P>
<P>
 Tech's wounded: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Amy Brown, right ankle.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Kendra Neal, left ankle.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Vickie Johnson, left ankle.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Pam Thomas, groin pull.  
</P>
<P>
 They scored a combined 45 points Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before his team was depleted, Barmore was upset that the women's 
semifinals and final are played on consecutive days. The men get a day's break 
between games.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong to ask these kids to play a national championship game 24 hours 
from now," Barmore said after his team repeatedly turned back Alabama (26-7) in 
the second half. "If I were to do what I want to do, I'd take Louisiana Tech 
and go home, now." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell did not share that sentiment. "Our 
practices are a lot harder than our games," she said. "Our players will be 
ready. We played three games in three days earlier this year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels should be big favorites today, considering Tech's injuries. 
Smith, a six-foot junior, had 23 points against Purdue, including four 
consecutive baskets in an 8-0 run midway through the second half, increasing 
the Tar Heels' lead to 65-50. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored on a drive, a 15-foot jumper, a tip and another drive. Purdue cut 
the lead to 69-60 with 5:17 left, but never recovered after 6-1, 235-pound 
freshman Leslie Johnson missed an easy shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was all alone under the basket with 4:30 left and Purdue trailing, 
71-60. But she blew the two-footer. Purdue outrebounded North Carolina, 45-36, 
but Jones' steals and disruptive ball-hawking -- Purdue had 25 turnovers with 
7:15 left -- and Smith's second half shooting were the difference.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels held 10- to 13-point leads for most of the first half, but let 
the Boilermakers close to 39-37 by halftime. Tonya Kirk tied it for Purdue, 
45-45, in the second half but Smith, Jones and 6-5 Sylvia Crawley ignited a 
20-5 run. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Alabama nearly 15 minutes to mount a challenge against Louisiana Tech. 
The Tide didn't reach double digits until eight minutes into the game, when 
Tech held a 22-11 lead. Tech, which eliminated USC last weekend, got another 
outstanding game from 5-3 senior guard Thomas. But her teammate, Debra Williams 
-- MVP at the Mideast Regional -- got her fourth foul with 9:48 left and played 
only 17 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas seemed to be near every loose ball, every muffed rebound or errant 
pass. She had two steals, three assists and 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 And tenacious Racquel Spurlock, a 6-4 post player, had her best tournament 
game Saturday. She scored 10 points, but had 18 rebounds on an afternoon when 
Tech outrebounded Alabama, 45-35. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama was hurt by an injury of its own.  
</P>
<P>
 An unusual halftime injury rendered Alabama's Niesa Johnson ineffective in the 
second half. Johnson, who averages 15 points a game, finished with 14 after 
scoring 10 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 She hit a water faucet knob in the dressing room with her right hand, and 
opened a cut that required several stitches. She didn't return to play until 
15:33 was left in the game, and then only with a heavily wrapped hand.  
</P>
<P>
 Tech had a comfortable lead for most of the way, or until Barmore's starters 
began suffering injuries. Alabama got to within two, 52-50, but with 8:42 left, 
Thomas made a 15-foot jumper and scored again after picking up a loose ball in 
a scramble.  
</P>
<P>
 The Techsters seemed to be in trouble when Spurlock missed a two-footer and 
Alabama rebounded with 2:18 left. With Louisiana Tech ahead, 67-63, Alabama 
turned it over and Thomas ran the shot clock down, missed a jumper and got her 
own rebound.

DUCKS LIVE FOR ONE MORE DAY; HOCKEY: PENALTY-KILLING DEFENSE AND GOALKEEPER 
HEBERT HELP ANAHEIM DEFEAT TORONTO, 3-1. TEAM CLINGS TO SLIM HOPE IT CAN MAKE 
THE PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Mighty Ducks know that this is the time when teams wilt. Look at the 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Crunch time has come and gone for the also-rans. For the Ducks and every other 
team whose playoff hopes are slim to none, this is a tough time. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only five games between them and the off-season, but the Ducks 
haven't folded, proving it with a 3-1 victory over Toronto before 17,174 at The 
Pond of Anaheim on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known teams that really went into the tank when they faced elimination," 
said goalie Guy Hebert, who won his 19th game of the season and had a shutout 
in the third period. "It's somewhat frustrating that no matter how well we 
play, we can't do enough to pass San Jose without their help. But in 
retrospect, it's really positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Ducks win their remaining games, the Sharks need only one point in 
their last five to clinch the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have won four of their last five games, but they're about to run out 
of time.  
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs have the league's fifth-best record, but finished 1-2-1 
against the Ducks. Toronto, which is limping toward the playoffs, held a 
closed-door meeting after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't kissing each other in there," Toronto Coach Pat Burns said. 
"We're just trying to keep things positive. We're not the favorites any more. 
We're all by ourselves. We have to stick together and play as a team. That's 
how we got this far." 
</P>
<P>
 That and a hard-working style have gotten the Ducks farther than they had 
hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to play well every night," said Joe Sacco, who scored a goal for 
the third consecutive game. "Plus, it's pride. We've got a lot of pride in this 
room. We'd like to finish ahead of certain teams. I don't know what the 
expansion record was, 31?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was -- until the Florida Panthers broke it by winning their 32nd game. But 
the victory over Toronto was the Ducks' 31st, tying them for second with the 
1967-68 Kings and Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert made 27 saves against the Maple Leafs, but the victory probably 
belonged to the penalty-killers, who shut out Toronto on eight power-play 
attempts and killed a five-minute high-sticking penalty against Patrik Carnback 
in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks took a 1-0 lead into the third on Sacco's first-period goal, his 
18th. Then John Lilley, who played for the U.S. Olympic team at Lillehammer, 
celebrated his first NHL goal after circling behind the net and putting in a 
back-hander off a pass from David Williams at 4:37 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan Lebeau scored his third goal in three games at 6:58 for a 3-0 lead. 
But Bob Rouse spoiled Hebert's bid to shut out the Maple Leafs for the second 
time this season at 7:30 when he followed his own shot and knocked in a rebound 
behind Hebert's back. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert will have an opportunity to be the goalie for the U.S. team at the 
World Championships beginning in Italy later this month if he wants to. "Guy 
will definitely be our goaltender," said Lou Nanne, general manager of the U.S. 
team. Coach Ron Wilson is expected to become coach as soon as the Ducks are 
eliminated. Joe Sacco and Tim Sweeney are also being considered for the team.

NHL ROUNDUP; SHARKS BEAT CANUCKS, NEAR PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Jose Sharks have a point to make. 
</P>
<P>
 After their 7-4 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday night in San 
Jose, the Sharks held a 10-point lead over the Mighty Ducks with five games to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remains for the Sharks is to get a single point among the 10 
available to assure themselves their first playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 That done, hockey season would end in Southern California on April 14. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose made sure of that Saturday night when Sandis Ozolinsh and Ulf Dahlen 
scored power-play goals in the first period to send the Sharks winging toward 
their franchise-record sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of three goals for Dahlen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks closed to within 4-3 in the third period, but San Jose finished 
them off with three goals in only six shots during the last 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to be a part of this team," Dahlen said. "It was a lot more like 
playoff hockey tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 4, New Jersey 2 -- The Rangers took a major step toward 
clinching the NHL's best record in the regular season by scoring four goals in 
the second period at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Richter stopped 24 shots as the Rangers won for the sixth time over New 
Jersey in as many games and took a four-point lead over the Devils with five 
games to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 6, Quebec 2 -- Yuri Khmylev and Randy Wood scored twice as the Sabres, 
helped by four power-play goals and two short-handed scores, beat the Nordiques 
at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo sent Quebec to its fourth loss in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Khmylev's goals came on power plays, and Wood had a power-play and 
short-handed goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa 2, Florida 2 -- Senator goaltender Craig Billington stopped 32 shots at 
Miami, where Ottawa, playing loose with the league's worst record and no 
playoff future, hampered the Panthers' playoff hopes with a tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, in its inaugural season, holds a three-point lead for the eighth and 
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, Hartford 5 -- Rob DiMaio scored with 1:13 to play to lift the 
Flyers to a victory at Hartford and spoil a four-goal comeback by the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 After Pat Verbeek scored the last of four consecutive Hartford goals to tie 
the game, 5-5, DiMaio, standing alone in the crease, stuffed home a rebound of 
Kevin Dineen's shot from the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia snapped a four-game losing streak. Eric Lindros scored his 43rd 
and 44th goals of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 3, Montreal 3 -- Ray Ferraro scored 11:51 into the final 
period as the Islanders tied the Canadiens at Montreal and stayed three points 
behind Florida for the final Eastern Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Benoit Hogue and Steve Thomas also scored for the Islanders, who have one 
victory in their last five games, but who have not lost to Montreal all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 3, Calgary 3 -- Dino Ciccarelli and Gary Roberts each scored twice as 
the Red Wings and Flames skated to a tie in Detroit.

WELL, THAT'S IT: KINGS' PLAYOFF HOPES DASHED; HOCKEY: CONACHER RIPS TEAMMATES 
AFTER 5-3 LOSS TO EDMONTON. LATER, SAN JOSE WINS TO ELIMINATE LAST YEAR'S 
STANLEY CUP FINALISTS FROM POSTSEASON.

<P>
 The Kings' magic number -- or is that tragic number? -- for playoff 
elimination had been reduced to one after yet another defeat, a 5-3 loss to the 
Edmonton Oilers on Saturday at the Forum before 14,108. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't last long. Saturday night, the San Jose Sharks made it final by 
ending the Kings' playoff hopes with a 7-4 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, even hours before the Sharks' victory, King Coach Barry Melrose and 
center Pat Conacher put the miserable season in proper perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be nightmare on Manchester, wouldn't it?" Melrose said. "Freddie 
Krueger showed up. . . . and Jason. . . . and Frankenstein and the Bride of 
Frankenstein. And Leona Helmsley." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Conacher: "You can't print the words I'm thinking."  
</P>
<P>
 The printable words were stinging, nonetheless, worthy of a team that missed 
the playoffs for the first time since the 1985-86 season, the first time Wayne 
Gretzky has missed the playoffs and the first time in 24 years that a Stanley 
Cup finalist failed to reach the next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're. . . . laying down like dogs now," Conacher said. "And there's no 
excuse for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Really, the Kings (25-41-11) seemed finished long before the Sharks made it 
official. Before the Shark-Canuck game, the Kings trailed San Jose by 14 
points. They are 7-18-7 since the All-Star break and 20-40-9 since opening the 
season 5-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a very real chance the Kings might not win any of their seven 
remaining games if they keep playing with one eye on the golf course. They are 
closer to last place in the Western Conference than the eighth and final 
playoff spot. The 10th-place Kings are three points ahead of the Oilers and 
seven in front of last-place Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, you guys have some more pride in yourselves," Conacher said of his 
teammates. "Do the best you can, lose, win or draw. You don't lay down like a 
dog and be beaten like a dog. You go out like a man. You don't go out like a 
whipped dog. Have some guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Conacher was not absolving himself. He said the only three blameless players 
are Wayne Gretzky and goaltenders Kelly Hrudey and Robb Stauber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give up 50 shots on goal," Conacher said. "What do you expect? It's one 
thing to stop the first shot but they have got four or five more shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Conacher was especially disgusted by the lack of support the Kings have given 
Gretzky, who leads the NHL's scoring race with 125 points. Gretzky scored his 
38th goal of the season, at 17:32 of the third on the power play and added an 
assist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only guy who deserves any credit," Conacher said. "Take a look at 
Wayne Gretzky and the season he's had and he's hardly had any support from the 
other 19 supporting guys. He's giving and giving and giving. We should be 
ashamed. He's been leading every day and done it with no support. That appalls 
and disgusts me when I see things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't the only one. Conacher had plenty of company as several spectators 
at the Forum were spotted wearing bags over their heads. King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 King forward Tony Granato did not play because of an ailing back. Coach Barry 
Melrose said he might not play the rest of the season. Marty McSorley (pulled 
stomach muscle) saw limited action in the third period because of his injury. . 
. . The crowd of 14,108 was the Kings' third smallest of the season. They drew 
13,018 against San Jose on Oct. 10 and 14,035 against the New York Islanders on 
Oct. 12.

MORNING BRIEFING: BARRY'S WORLD COMES TO LIFE ON THE SHELVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bootlegger's Boy," Barry Switzer's autobiography, sold out immediately in 
Dallas last week after the announcement that he was replacing Jimmy Johnson as 
the Cowboys' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Switzer's book had not been a hot item. One chain even had 
hard-cover copies on its bargain table for $2.98. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What was unusual about the 1957 NCAA championship basketball game 
between North Carolina and Kansas? 
</P>
<P>
 Crash course: The Philadelphia Phillies' outfield is a dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 During spring training, Wes Chamberlain suffered a knee injury, Tom Marsh 
collapsed because of dehydration and Tony Longmire ran into a metal pole in 
left field and suffered a mild concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Bermuda Triangle out there," outfielder Milt Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategy: Al Davis predicts there will be some gamesmanship under the new NFL 
two-point conversion rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a lot of teams line up and try to draw the other team offsides," 
the Raider owner said. "If it works, you move the ball to the one (yard line) 
and go for two. If it doesn't, you take the delay penalty and kick the extra 
point from the seven." 
</P>
<P>
 Modest man: Boxing promoter Don King on his favorite subject: "I never cease 
to amaze myself. I say this humbly." 
</P>
<P>
 Bag man: Anthony Munoz, the former USC and Cincinnati Bengal offensive 
lineman, is back in show business, this time in a slightly more dignified 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired from the Bengals, Munoz has been hired as an NFL analyst by Fox 
television. His only other show business experience was a small part in "The 
Right Stuff," a movie about the early astronauts. Munoz played a hospital 
orderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wound up walking (actor) Scott Glenn and another guy through the halls with 
enema bags," he said. "I don't know if that was a great opportunity or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Priorities: The San Francisco Giants' Willie McGee on his hitting slump in 
spring training: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about hitting as much as the other things in life, like money." 
</P>
<P>
 Car caravan: To save money this spring, Reds' owner Marge Schott made every 
employee with a company car drive the 16 hours from Cincinnati to the club's 
Plant City, Fla., training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, we will: Otto Baric, coach of Austrian soccer club Casinos Salzburg, after 
he was suspended for spitting at an opposing player: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an idiot -- you can write that." 
</P>
<P>
 Teamwork: Colorado Rockies' pitcher Marvin Freeman once crafted violin bows, 
but had to leave the finishing touches to a master.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was the middle reliever of bow making," Freeman said. "He was the closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: North Carolina won in three overtimes, 54-53. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotable: C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle on Barry Switzer as the 
coach of the Dallas Cowboys: "Somewhere, Tom Landry has just decided that he 
will skip dinner and is going to lie down for a while." MAL FLORENCE

COLD-HOT CRENSHAW TIED WITH TORRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw's eight birdies made up for four bogeys Saturday and he ended the 
day tied with Sam Torrance for the lead after three rounds of the $1.2-million 
Freeport-McMoRan Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw and Torrance are at 11-under 205 heading into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of eight birdies, but not the four bogeys. That just won't get it 
done," Crenshaw said after his 68. "Fortunately I hit some good holes, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, who started the day at seven under, bogeyed three holes for a 35 on 
the front nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance, meantime, put together a 67.  
</P>
<P>
 "I played magnificent," Torrance said. "It was as good as I can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance had six birdies, missing only one fairway and one green, and made his 
only bogey on No. 13 when he three-putted from three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just trying to stay within myself and not push it," Torrance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Maria Olazabal, who shot a 63 on Thursday, shot 70 on Saturday for 207 
after three rounds. Jim Furyk's 66 on Saturday gave him a 208.

PREP SOFTBALL / WOODBRIDGE TOURNAMENT; SEMIFINAL IS HALTED WHEN PLAYERS HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The championship bracket of the Woodbridge Classic softball tournament was put 
on hold Saturday night after the county's leading hitter and a teammate were 
injured in a nasty collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge center fielder Alison Johnsen, who was batting .647 entering the 
game, and shortstop Carrie Brown collided in the third inning of the 
10th-ranked Warriors' semifinal against Mater Dei; both were taken to Western 
Medical Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen was knocked unconscious "for at least a minute," according to Coach 
Alan Dugard. She was listed in satisfactory condition and was being 
hospitalized overnight for observation. Brown suffered a broken fibula, Dugard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 29-minute delay, umpires suspended the game until 1 p.m. Monday at 
Harvard Park. Eighth-ranked Mater Dei was ahead, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls are extremely disturbed," Dugard said. "It would have been useless 
to play tonight. It all bottomed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen stole two bases in Woodbridge's 3-0 quarterfinal victory over 
Bellflower earlier in the day, giving her 174 in her career. She needs four to 
break the Southern Section record for stolen bases in a career. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendra Meano's short fly ball started the collision. Johnsen charged in from 
center field and Brown, a junior, turned and ran toward left-center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen made a shoestring catch; Brown tried to sidestep to avoid Johnsen, but 
apparently hit her in the temple with the side of her left knee. Brown flipped 
over Johnsen and both remained immobile on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Lou Neubecker, who was standing near the play, said Johnsen lost 
consciousness immediately and called for a trainer and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her head snapped back and her eyes rolled up," Neubecker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugard, who has coached at Woodbridge four years, said it is the worst 
collision he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both going to get anything that's hit; unfortunately both were going 
full tilt when they hit," he said. "Losing a game means nothing; losing kids -- 
that's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 They are the second and third players in two days to leave a game under such 
circumstances: Huntington Beach pitcher Stefanie Noffsinger was struck in the 
face by a batted ball and had to leave Friday's game against Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal: 
</P>
<P>
 Upland 2, Foothill 1 -- Kelly Smith pitched a one-hitter and Christy Sears hit 
a two-run homer to lift Upland (11-0) to the championship game. Smith faced 
only two batters over the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Barnes' single drove in the only run for No. 9 Foothill (10-5). 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarterfinals: 
</P>
<P>
 Upland 1, Kennedy 0 (10 innings) -- Shanna Humphries' one-out double lifted 
Upland into the semifinal game over No. 5 Kennedy. The Irish played with only 
three starters in their regular positions -- center field, left field and 
pitcher -- to accommodate the absence of three players who missed the game for 
disciplinary reasons and another who was sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 2, Pacifica 0 -- Marie Gieron (3-3) pitched a two-hitter and Dawn 
Davidson and Carley Rutledge had RBI singles as Foothill defeated No. 4 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge 3, Bellflower 0 -- Jackie Sukiasian pitched a five-hitter and drove 
in the only run she needed in the fifth inning to lead No. 10 Woodbridge. 
Ashley Boone and Carrie Brown added RBIs in the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 6, Sunny Hills 0 -- Patty Godwin pitched a two-hitter and got two 
RBIs apiece from Candace Kollen and Margaret Hollis for Mater Dei.

PREP TRACK / TRABUCO HILLS INVITATIONAL; YOUNG SPARKS WOODBRIDGE AS EDISON 
GIRLS FARE WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Gary Young ran a blistering split time of 47.8 in anchoring the boys' 
1,600-meter relay as Woodbridge rallied to finish in 3:24.48, the fastest time 
in the event in the county this season, at the Trabuco Hills Invitational track 
meet Saturday at Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had the lead on the guy at the 250(-meter) mark," Young said. "I saw 
a shadow, so I knew I had to run the last 100 like it meant something." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who earlier quit the 100 meters after his starting block slipped, 
finished second in the 200 at 21.77, another county-best this season. Bryan 
Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs won the 100 (10.52) and the 200 (21.38). 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really good in the 200," Young said. "I felt even better in the 100, 
but my block came out from under me and I had to put my hands down. By the time 
I got my balance the field was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the distance relays, the Edison girls' team dominated the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charger girls swept all their races, winning the four-mile relay (21:35), 
the 3,200 relay (9:47.22) and the individual distance medley (12:48.67.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Our workouts are really tough," said Erin Bailey, who ran all three relays. 
"We never have an easy day, so we are always prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison boys' team also won the only distance relay they entered, finishing 
the 3,200 in 8:39.89. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina Heads of Newport Harbor threw personal bests in the shotput and discus, 
with county leading distances. Her shotput mark of 44-6 is one of the best in 
the state this year. Delores Tuimoloau of Oxnard Channel Islands has thrown 
46-11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the discus, Heads' effort was 133-11 1/2. Marie Philman of Edison was 
second (122-6) and Angela Burgess of Woodbridge finished third (118-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's Ethan Taub, running in the 800 after coming back from a hamstring 
injury, was impressive, finishing in 1:55.05, the best in the county this 
season. Taub usually runs the 400, but was trying to get back into his rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the boys' triple jump, Reggie Curry of Tustin jumped a county-best this 
season with 48-7 3/4, improving on his personal best by 3 1/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Lang of Fountain Valley also improved on the county mark this season,

ROUNDUP; POLAR EXPEDITION WINS AT TURFWAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Polar Expedition held off a fast-closing Powis Castle by a neck to win the 
$600,000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky., on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition, starting from the No. 1 post position, stayed next to the 
rail and led the entire way in covering the 1 1/8 miles in a moderate 1:49. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Hugh Robertson said either the Illinois Derby on April 30 or the 
Kentucky Derby on May 7 will be the next race for the the gelded son of 
Kodiack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably for the next two weeks we won't make any decision one way or 
another," Robertson said. "And we'll have to see how the horse comes out of the 
race, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a hard race, and he's a small horse and puts a lot into his races. 
You can't take them to the well too many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner James Cody of Omaha might keep the horse in Kentucky because he won the 
Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes Kentucky," Cody said. "He's two for two in Kentucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition, ridden by Curt Bourque, held a 1 1/2-length lead over Chimes 
Band through the first half mile, with Powis Castle and Shepherd's Field next 
in the 11-horse field. The lead increased to 2 1/2 lengths as the horses headed 
around the turn for home. Powis Castle, under Chris Antley, made a challenge in 
the final strides, while Chimes Band was seven lengths back in third and the 
favored Southern Rhythm was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know he tried hard, but I just couldn't get him down the lane," Antley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition paid $10, $5.60 and $4.20. Powis Castle returned $5.40 and 
$4.20 and Chimes Band paid $4.60. All of the entries carried 121 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was worth $360,000 to Polar Expedition, increasing his earnings to 
$699,025. He has won seven of nine starts, including two of three this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Expedition had won five consecutive races before losing by 2 1/2 lengths 
to Southern Rhythm in Oaklawn Park's Southwest Stakes on March 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Rhythm, the 2-1 favorite ridden by Chris McCarron, ran in the middle 
of the pack and never threatened the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judge T C took the lead in late stretch and scored a one-length victory in the 
$125,000 Rebel Stakes, Oaklawn Park's last major prep for the $500,000 Arkansas 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge T C, with Joe Johnson aboard, ran 1 1/16 miles in a slow 1:44 and 
returned $7.60, $12.40 and $11. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern was second, 1 1/2 lengths in front of Milt's Overture, who set the 
early pace. Concern paid $7.60 and $6. Milt's Overture returned $14.

 Pairs figure skater Calla Urbanski Freeman and her husband were attacked by 
five assailants Friday night, police said in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Jay Freeman, said the altercation started when one of the 
assailants threw a board into some newly planted shrubbery in front of the 
house the couple is renovating. 
</P>
<P>
 After her husband confronted the group, Freeman said, she was hit in the face 
and thrown against her car. She said her husband was kicked, punched and struck 
with clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must have hit him over a dozen times . . . and then threw him (onto) a 
neighbor's lawn. I stopped and turned back toward them and started screaming at 
the top of my lungs -- just screaming," Freeman, who skates with Rocky Marval, 
told the Wilmington News Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were treated for their injuries at Wilmington Hospital and released, 
police said, adding that no arrests have been made.

VIVA LOST EGYPT; O.C. ARCHEOLOGY BUFFS GO ON EXPEDITION TO THE LUXOR IN LAS 
VEGAS (YES, VEGAS) TO VIEW THE RESORT'S OVER-THE-TOP TAKE ON AN ANCIENT 
CIVILIZATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has stood before the Great Pyramid at Giza, excavated at Mendes in the 
northern Nile Delta, studied the tomb of Ramses II in Thebes, and led an 
ongoing expedition to the Precinct of the Goddess Mut at Karnak. 
</P>
<P>
 On this spring morning, however, Egyptologist Richard A. Fazzini is gazing at 
Luxor -- the new Luxor, the one with a 30-story pyramid of bronzed glass 
towering over a gaudy golden sphinx that emits laser beams from its eyes, the 
one with amusement park-style thrill rides that star an archeologist who utters 
New Age platitudes and has "3-D psychic visions" during solar eclipses. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which begs a question: Just what is Fazzini doing here? Well, for 
starters, he's looking slightly bemused. "No matter how hard we try," he says 
with a shrug, "the public sometimes gets a different idea of archeology than 
archeologists have." 
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini was in Las Vegas at the invitation of the Orange County society of the 
Archaeological Institute of America, which organized a field trip to the 
resort. Society president and founder Norma Kershaw admits that some members of 
the group figured she had to be joking when she first proposed the excursion, 
but they signed up anyway. The trip was a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 While bringing archeology buffs to Luxor would seem, on the surface, to make 
about as much sense as sending a paleontology convention to those roadside 
dinosaurs near Palm Springs, the archeology buffs were more than willing to put 
up with the faux-Egyptian touches in return for a little gambling and a show or 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, Kershaw said, was "to have an educational weekend while having a 
good time" -- a couple of nights on the Strip, coupled with a morning lecture 
(the trip also helped raise money for the group's educational efforts in county 
elementary schools). Fazzini's talk was on the history of Egyptomania, the 
fascination with all things Egyptian that started with the Romans and finds its 
ultimate expression in the newly opened Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his excavations, Fazzini heads the Brooklyn Museum's Egyptian, 
classical and ancient Middle Eastern department, helping to oversee one of the 
world's finest collections of Egyptian antiquities. In his lecture at Luxor, he 
expressed dry amusement at the resort's over-the-top blend of carefully 
reconstructed authenticity and out-and-out fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very hard for people not to associate Egypt with mystery," he told his 
audience of about 50, crowded into a tiny, unfinished meeting room at the 
gigantic resort. "It's almost silly to walk around a casino and say, 'Is this 
accurate?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Later, when asked if it bothered him that the hotel perpetuates exotic visions 
of Egyptian civilization, Fazzini shook his head and said he takes it in the 
spirit of fun in which it is intended. "If this place had a sign out front that 
said, 'If you take our Nile cruise, you'll never have any need to go to Egypt 
or visit a museum,' then I'd have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Kershaw, a retired archeologist who excavated at Cyprus and other sites around 
the Mediterranean, was likewise in a tolerant mood. "I know it's all done 
tongue-in-cheek, so it doesn't bother me," she said. "In a sense, it delights 
me, because it will stimulate people's interest in the real ancient Egypt." 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor opened in October, a $375-million "entertainment megastore" with 2,526 
hotel rooms honeycombed along its inward-slanting walls. Contained within the 
towering central atrium are a 100,000-square-foot casino, seven themed 
restaurants, and an indoor canal carrying guests on a "Nile cruise." 
</P>
<P>
 Historical consultants were called in to help guide the creation of indoor 
sculptures and wall murals, giving the resort a veneer of authenticity. There's 
also a painstaking detailed recreation tomb of King Tutankhamun's tomb, as it 
was found by Howard Carter and Lord Carnavon in 1922. 
</P>
<P>
 All the much-hyped attention to historical detail, however, exists alongside 
another vision of ancient Egypt that's pure fantasy. The three-part thrill ride 
puts high-tech film effects at the service of a story line that's a virtual 
grab bag of exotic myths about Egypt, some old (ancient connections to 
Atlantis) and some new (flying machines discovered in a pyramid beneath, um, 
Las Vegas). 
</P>
<P>
 Other fanciful touches in the resort include a pair of talking animated camels 
in the casino and an elaborate stage show, "Winds of the Gods," about a Pharaoh 
whose resting place is disturbed by thieves. The show has a very un-Egyptian 
chariot race as its climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor is part of a trend toward family entertainment in Las Vegas, the gaming 
mecca that in recent years has had to face competition from a steady growth of 
gambling in other parts of the country. It sits next door to Excalibur, with 
its fantasy castle motif, while farther along the Strip are such recent 
additions as the MGM Grand, with its "Wizard of Oz" theme, and the dueling 
pirates of Treasure Island. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fazzini pointed out, Luxor is not the first Las Vegas landmark to "use the 
ancient world as a sort of adult theme park": the enduring Caesars Palace 
looked to ancient Rome when it opened in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 The real-life Luxor is an Egyptian market town that has grown up around the 
southern half of the ruins of the ancient city of Thebes. Architecturally, the 
Las Vegas Luxor is modeled loosely on the Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx at 
Giza. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor, said Fazzini, is the latest in a long line of "Egyptianizing" 
buildings, his term for structures inspired by the monuments of ancient Egypt. 
In fact, he said, the new resort is probably "the most thoroughly Egyptianizing 
building in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first to experience an Egyptian craze were the Romans, who conquered Egypt 
in 30 BC. European interest in ancient Egypt was revived during the 
Renaissance, but it was a somewhat skewed vision, according to Fazzini, 
filtered through Roman interpretations. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe got a truer picture of Egypt in the 18th Century, as an increasing 
number of travelers ventured there and returned with accounts of the pyramids. 
Egyptomania blossomed with the Napoleonic expeditions of 1798 to 1801, in which 
the ruler took an army of scholars along on a military campaign that ultimately 
proved disastrous to his reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in North America, a new nation had been created by the Founding 
Fathers with mystical visions of old Egypt, fed by their ties to Freemasonry. 
The evidence is right there on the back of the dollar bill -- the Great Seal, 
with its steep-sided pyramid topped by an all-seeing eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, ancient Egypt has come to be a "vector for symbols," 
representing mystery, wisdom, lost knowledge and immortality, Fazzini said. 
Architectural reminders of an American fascination with Egypt are legion. The 
use of Egyptian-style obelisks for memorial markers, a practice transplanted 
from Europe, was first seen in Baltimore in 1792 and culminated in the 
Washington Memorial, dedicated in 1885. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini showed slides of a vast array of Egyptian-influence buildings in the 
United States: museums, libraries, insurance offices, Masonic halls, even 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nod to ancient funerary practices, Egyptian touches were common in 
cemeteries through the 1920s, from gateways to memorial markers. One odd little 
marble marker from the 19th Century grouped a Nativity scene with a dog-sized 
sphinx looking lovingly at the baby Jesus; Fazzini described it as "Jesus, Mary 
and Joseph and their pet sphinx." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-19th Century, architect Franklin Webster Smith proposed an 
elaborate new capital complex borrowing architectural styles from across the 
world and earned some serious consideration from Congress. The design included 
a vast Egyptian hall and a model of the Great Pyramid and Great Sphinx on the 
Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it remind you of any building you're sitting in now?" Fazzini asked his 
audience. "We wouldn't have to go to Las Vegas if they would have built this." 
</P>
<P>
 With the growth of modern architecture in the 1920s, Egyptian influences 
largely disappeared from large public buildings, but the discovery of King 
Tutankhamun's tomb in 1922 sparked a craze of Egyptian style in many smaller 
buildings -- most notably, for Los Angeles at least, in elaborate movie 
palaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Grauman's Egyptian theater in Los Angeles, most of which has been destroyed, 
was the epitome. Southern California, particularly San Diego and Los Angeles, 
was a center for Egyptian-style structures, from apartments and bungalow courts 
to real estate offices. "For whatever reason, Los Angeles is Fantasyland. The 
same is true of San Diego," Fazzini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor "is certainly, in a way, a descendant of the fancy movie palaces of the 
1920s," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptomania goes on today, even outside Las Vegas. Memphis, because of the 
name connection, has always been Egypt-crazy, even in the age of Elvis. The new 
city zoo is an elaborate adaptation of Egyptian design, and the new sports 
arena is a pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond architecture, there are other reflections of the craze, including a 
Utah company founded in the 1980s that mummifies its customers, going so far as 
to put a mask of the deceased onto the sarcophagus lid and copyrighting the 
term "mummification." 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptomania has become a popular sideline for Fazzini. This month he goes to 
Paris to lecture on the subject, in conjunction with an exhibit on Egyptomania 
on view at the Louvre. It all started, he said, after his lecture in Las Vegas, 
when patrons at the Brooklyn Museum began asking him questions about popular 
exotic myths of ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 As a scholar, Fazzini said, he had been little aware of the common perceptions 
of Egyptian civilization. He started investigating, taking slides of 
Egyptian-influence buildings and haunting flea markets and antique shops in 
search of Egyptian-style posters, lamps, clocks and other curios. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to find it an interesting lecture subject," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The invitation from the Orange County archeological group allowed him his 
first look at Luxor, and he took the opportunity to snap slides for future 
lectures. When asked if the size and scope of the resort was more than he 
expected, he shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I had ever seen the real pyramids, many years ago, that was 
more than I had expected."

A MATTER OF HONOR; CHEATING. LYING. STEALING. WITH THESE KIND OF SCANDALS

<P>
 Without warning, a drum roll explodes in the darkness after midnight, echoing 
through the still barracks, jolting the cadets of the Virginia Military 
Institute out of their sleep. It is ominous and relentless, as urgent as it is 
foreboding. 
</P>
<P>
 At every door of the four-story complex, there is a heavy knock, an order to 
fall out and, above the drumming, a shouted, repeated announcement: "Your Honor 
Court has met . . . Your Honor Court has met." In every room, the lights snap 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, dressed in robes and pajamas, chins tucked, chests out, all 
1,200 young men of the VMI Corps of Cadets stand at attention in ranks around a 
dim inner courtyard, assembled for the excruciatingly painful ritual of a 
"drumming out." One of their own has cheated. Hehas been banished for breaking 
their sacred Code of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Resplendent in dress uniforms, members of the Honor Court march through an 
arch into the yard. The court president announces the name of a cadet found 
guilty of violating the code and intones: "He has placed personal gain above 
personal honor. He has left the institute, never to return. His name is never 
to be mentioned again." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a moment none of them will forget. After 30 years, Lt. Col. Mike 
Strickler, a VMI graduate now on the institute's staff, vividly remembers the 
spring morning when a classmate was drummed out for cheating, just 10 days 
before he was to graduate. During one year while Strickler was a cadet, six 
members of the regiment were drummed out. In another year, there were only two. 
He remembers them all. 
</P>
<P>
 He also remembers the 12-word code that every VMI "rat" memorizes the day he 
arrives: "A cadet will neither lie, cheat, steal nor tolerate those who do." 
</P>
<P>
 That code, said Danny Felton, one of about 225 fourth classmen due to graduate 
from the 155-year-old institute this spring, "is the cadet's most cherished 
possession." 
</P>
<P>
 Variations on this rule of conduct are embraced by 100 or so institutions of 
higher learning, in addition to the Army, Navy and Air Force academies and 
venerable military schools such as VMI and the Citadel. They range from small 
private schools such as Washington and Lee and Bryn Mawr to Princeton and Rice, 
and to the University of Maryland with 38,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 At some, they are enshrined and forgotten in student handbooks; at others, 
they have become the cornerstone of academic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, honor systems have been installed at the urging of 
students, in many cases because of concern over cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although schools with viable honor systems remain a small minority, there is, 
says Samuel Sadler, vice president for student affairs at the College of 
William & Mary, "a decided movement" toward making codes a fixture on more 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the codes explicitly forbid lying, cheating and stealing, and 
require students to take some action when they have knowledge of violations by 
their peers. Punishment is usually meted out by student tribunals. In return, 
the school administration allows unproctored examinations, with students 
sometimes taking the tests at a time and place of their choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every week, Washington and Lee, whose campus adjoins that of VMI, 
receives inquiries or visits from other schools interested in its widely 
regarded system. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y., are expected to vote soon on 
adoption of a code. An honor system is under serious consideration at 
Georgetown University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools, such as Duke and Johns Hopkins, have taken steps to strengthen 
their codes, and others, including Stanford, are contemplating ways to enhance 
honor systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, University of Virginia students turned out in extraordinary 
numbers for an honor code referendum, voting by a margin of 3 to 1 to retain a 
system that, for 152 years, has required permanent expulsion for an honor code 
conviction. Codes have been stiffened elsewhere, too. 
</P>
<P>
 So why should this 19th-Century creation -- expanded, codified and preserved 
by military academies and old schools for men of the Southern gentry -- now 
flourish? Especially now, in a generation that hates rules? Even in 
mega-universities where neither race, gender, history, culture, aspiration nor 
personal acquaintance provide unity? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is evidently a sharpened concern over academic integrity -- a 
subject brought dramatically to mind by the cheating scandal that has dogged 
the U.S. Naval Academy for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating, studies show, is pervasive. It involves students struggling for A's 
and admission to prestigious graduate schools as well as those flirting with 
academic failure.  
</P>
<P>
 A landmark survey of 6,000 students in 31 of the country's prestigious 
colleges and universities two years ago found that nearly 70% had cheated -- if 
all manner of minor infractions were taken into account. The figures approached 
80% for non-honor code schools and 60% for those with codes. 
</P>
<P>
 In non-honor code schools, 20% of students acknowledged cheating three times 
or more. Only 5% in honor code schools admitted repeated infractions. "I think 
that difference is quite significant," said Rutgers professor Donald McCabe, 
who conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
 A generation ago, with campuses seething over Vietnam, honor codes seemed 
destined to become a relic. Some schools dropped their codes outright, 
concluding that they were unworkable. Others eased their requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "During Vietnam, there was a clear assault on anything traditional," William & 
Mary's Sadler said, "and the honor system was just one of the traditions that 
came under attack. There was a tremendous passing of honor systems. One by one 
colleges and universities just peeled off." 
</P>
<P>
 There were changes even at such honor code bastions as William & Mary and the 
University of Virginia. Both schools dropped their non-toleration clause, which 
had required a student to report any person he saw cheating or face punishment 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 With expelled students exposed to the military draft, Virginia went four years 
without an honor violation being charged. Students were unwilling to bring 
charges because expulsion was mandatory upon conviction. In 1979, the 
non-toleration requirement was finally dropped from the code. For practical 
purposes, it had long since grown unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 The move back to honor codes is symptomatic of a larger change on college 
campuses, said Gary Pavela, president of the National Center for Academic 
Integrity, a consortium of 60 colleges and universities collaborating on issues 
involving honor codes, student ethics and academic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All across the country, college administrators are beginning to take back 
authority that they gave up to students in the '60s and '70s," he said. "But 
the area of academic integrity is the only one where authority is still moving 
toward the students. In part it is because faculty members are abrogating. They 
teach, do their research and get off campus. But there is a yearning among 
students and in society for more discussion of ethical issues, and honor codes 
provide a forum." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent student vote left Virginia among a handful of schools -- most small 
military academies like VMI -- with expulsion as the required penalty for 
lying, cheating or stealing. The uncompromising attitude is unmatched even at 
West Point, Annapolis and Colorado Springs, the preeminent schools for Army, 
Navy and Air Force officers. But -- ironically, perhaps -- the revered national 
military academies have produced the country's most notorious cheating 
scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, 152 cadets were kicked out of the U.S. Military Academy for cheating 
on an exam. After a long investigation, 98 were reinstated the following year. 
In 1984, 19 Air Force Academy seniors were suspended for cheating on a physics 
exam, and cadet honor boards' handling of academic cheating was temporarily 
halted. 
</P>
<P>
 The most excruciating cheating affair in the history of the military service 
schools is still being played out on the stately campus of the U.S. Naval 
Academy at Annapolis. There, a panel of senior officers appointed by the 
Secretary of the Navy is hearing the last cases of as many as 133 midshipmen 
involved in cheating on an electrical engineering examination in December, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 What made the episode extraordinary was the ensuing cover-up and mishandling. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the incident, Navy investigators concluded that 28 
midshipmen might have had prior knowledge of the exam's contents. Honor boards 
eventually found that there had been 11 cases of code violation, but four of 
them were dismissed by Capt. John B. Padgett III, the commandant of midshipmen, 
and a fifth was dropped by Rear Adm. Thomas C. Lynch, the superintendent of the 
academy. The remaining six were ordered expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The five whose cases were dismissed were academy football players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the superintendent, himself the captain of the football team in 1963, 
went before the 4,200-member brigade to announce the results of the 
investigation and reviews, he faced a remarkable reception. 
</P>
<P>
 One midshipman asked point-blank about one of the exonerated football players, 
a friend of Lynch's son, visiting the superintendent's quarters on the evening 
before his case was reviewed. Lynch replied that he had not engaged in any 
substantive conversation with the young man, but his response was greeted by 
muffled jeers and chants of the football player's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, nearly five months after the now-famous exam, another midshipman 
came forward with new allegations, and the Navy's inspector general launched 
another probe. 
</P>
<P>
 During more than 800 interviews, investigators encountered determined 
reluctance to cooperate by many midshipmen. They reported that some midshipmen 
lied to protect friends even after confessing their own guilt; 14, including 11 
athletes, invoked the Fifth Amendment; eight swore to lies, and five refused to 
be interviewed "even in the face of the Superintendent's grant of immunity and 
orders compelling their cooperation." 
</P>
<P>
 When the investigation was all over in January, Vice Adm. D.M. Bennett, the 
naval inspector general, reported that as many as 133 students had been 
involved and that 81 had finally so acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 As did a separate report from the academy's Board of Visitors, the inspector 
general's findings called for fundamental changes. There had been no actual 
conflict of interest on the part of academy officials, the report concluded, 
but "there was a definite perception of a conflict or a lack of impartiality 
among the midshipmen." 
</P>
<P>
 "The message the investigators received from the midshipmen," the report said, 
"was that they viewed the honor concept as an ideal that simply could not be 
applied to many of the problems that arise in the daily life of a midshipman at 
the Academy." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who study academic integrity issues do not find it surprising that the 
most notorious cheating scandals have come at the service academies, where 
personal honor is the keystone of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Military schools," said McCabe of Rutgers, "create a culture in which 
students strongly bond with each other, joining together and trying to help 
each other through the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a rigid set of explicit rules and regulations, you can reduce 
cheating, but if students see an opportunity to beat the system, they will. 
Honor programs do best where they create an atmosphere of trust, where everyone 
is involved, and the honor system becomes a part of the fabric of an 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because military institutions are special cases, McCabe has excluded them from 
his surveys on cheating. The University of Maryland also excluded them when it 
studied other schools' honor codes in designing a system for its campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The distinguishing feature of the Maryland system -- aside from its being 
tried in a huge public institution -- is its incentive for students convicted 
of cheating to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a case, a student is given a grade of F-X. After a year, in which the 
person takes an ethics seminar, he is given the opportunity to take the course 
again. Otherwise the X, indicating cheating, remains a part of his permanent 
transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Naval Academy, an effort is under way to restore the credibility and 
enhance an honor system that Midshipman Brigade Cmdr. Sean Fahey said will 
remain "student owned and student operated." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost ready to be put in place is a "moral remediation" program for 
midshipmen found guilty of honor violations deemed insufficiently serious to 
warrant separation from the Navy. It will involve psychological counseling, 
performance of service, formal instruction in ethics and work with a senior 
officer, who will act as the student's mentor during the remediation period. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as hearings continue for midshipmen implicated in the scandal, 
superintendent Lynch has begun meeting with classes and with individual 
midshipmen in an effort to establish the honor system more deeply in the 
academy's conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very much ashamed of what has happened," he said. "They feel they 
have all been tarnished by this brush. I can talk with four or five midshipmen 
and get four or five reasons why it happened. But we are going to keep the 
honor concept at the Naval Academy, and it is going to be stronger in the 
future than it has ever been in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Changes will not go so far as to adopt the single sanction that endures at 
VMI, several other small military and private schools, and, after 152 years, at 
the University of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some situations where we will say, 'You are out the door,' " Lynch 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do that for drugs, for sexual misconduct and for serious honor 
violations. But the Academy is a learning, developing, maturing experience. You 
can have a medical problem or you can have an academic problem. But honor 
violations are in all gradations. They are never black and white."

EXTENT OF CHEATING ISN'T EASILY MEASURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When a company drummed up business at Pepperdine University a few years ago by 
writing, selling and distributing term papers, the school's administrators 
cried foul. 
</P>
<P>
 They drummed some students out of school -- for turning in papers they didn't 
write -- and protested that the company had carried the concept of American 
free enterprise too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't stop all cheating," said John Wilson, dean of Seaver College, 
Pepperdine's undergraduate liberal arts school. "But we've tried to set an 
anti-cheating tone on our campus. I tell our students, 'Cheating is the 
academic equivalent of murder.' Our students understand that if someone cheats, 
it cheapens -- and casts into doubt -- everybody's degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating isn't an epidemic on their campuses, officials at Pepperdine and 
several other Los Angeles-area universities and colleges contend. But they 
concede that the extent of cheating isn't easily measured because most cases 
are dealt with quietly and never make headlines like those generated by the 
U.S. Naval Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 To wage war on plagiarism, exam cribbing and other forms of cheating, 
educators enforce written codes of conduct that are less rigid than those at 
the military academies and some old-line Southern schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "The informal hearsay is that cheating is a problem on most campuses, but not 
a major one," said UCLA ombudsperson Howard Gadlin, who adds that his school 
constantly fine-tunes a code of conduct that he said is "very explicit on just 
about every kind of activity." 
</P>
<P>
 At Caltech in Pasadena, an honor code states simply: "No member of the Caltech 
community shall take unfair advantage of any other member of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Inherent in that code is what Gary Lorden, the school's vice president for 
student affairs, calls an understanding that "Caltech trusts the students and 
our students trust each other, knowing that cheating isn't fair to the person 
down the hall, to your roommate, to yourself. We even give them keys to some of 
our laboratories and classrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, Lorden said, Caltech's rigorous science and engineering 
curriculum -- with its laws, rules and formulas -- feeds what he calls "a 
meritocracy based on knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take a subject like mathematics," he said, "it's impossible to fake 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever widespread cheating occurs, some blame societal pressures, while 
others say moral imperatives have slackened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen peaks and valleys -- the pendulum swinging back and forth -- since 
I returned here as a teacher in 1975," said Eric Newhall, Occidental College's 
dean of students and a onetime student there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to reflect the times we live in," he added. "When jobs get tight and 
the economy turns sluggish, the students' anxiety picks up." 
</P>
<P>
 At Loyola Marymount University, Joseph G. Jabbra, the school's academic vice 
president, said: "I get upset when I hear people say, 'Greed is the business of 
America.' Why can't they help us build an ethical fiber in our society?" 
</P>
<P>
 At Pepperdine, Wilson said many students focus excessively on "getting into 
med school or law school, on their (grade-point average), than on learning." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cal State L.A., where many students are older (average age: 28), the 
emphasis is "more on getting an education than on grades," said Tim Dong, the 
associate vice president for student affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, some students say a different kind of pressure -- 
"big-time" peer pressure, one calls it -- helps combat cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 Erika Arceneaux, 24, a graduate student in clinical psychology, said she heard 
only two cheating cases during the year she sat on Pepperdine's undergraduate 
disciplinary board. "People are less apt to cheat here because they know their 
peers will turn them in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecile Nguyen, 21, a Pepperdine senior majoring in international studies, 
added: "If I find out someone is cheating, I'm not going to tell the teacher or 
professor about it -- I'll tell the student. Around here, if somebody cheats, 
everybody else would be terribly upset with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, what makes Occidental's honor system work, Newhall said, is much 
the same kind of trust that Caltech's Lorden said endures at his school. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're betting on the students, rather than against them," Newhall said. "We 
assume they'll behave in an honorable manner, and we're surprised when they 
don't. We feel they're here to learn the subject matter, not try to beat the 
system."

TAKE ME OUT TO A REAL BALLGAME; BASEBALL: THE VULGAR MARKETING MENTALITY THAT 
RULES TODAY MAY DESTROY THE GAME AS WE KNOW AND LOVE IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WEIGEL, George Weigel is the president of the Ethics and Public 
Policy Center in Washington. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every few years, a kindly Providence arranges the calendar so that Opening Day 
follows hard on the heels of Easter. And fittingly enough; although the 
coincidence can lead to a dangerous overload in the piety circuits of a 
Christian -- like me, for example -- who happens to find in baseball a 
foretaste of the time-beyond-time that is the Kingdom to come. But lead us not 
into the temptation of ingratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 However, anyone who cares about the pastime has to approach this new season 
with foreboding. No one knows how the new three-division league format will 
work out. But when the Lords Temporal who control the game decreed that it was 
no longer necessary to finish first in order to qualify for post-season play 
(the second-place team with the best record among the three divisions in each 
league will participate in a new round of playoffs), they may have consigned 
one of baseball's greatest pleasures -- the pennant race that rivets our 
attention from the dog days of summer to the first turning of the fall leaves 
-- to the dustbin of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as ominously, baseball continues to be racked by labor troubles. The 
owners, whose lack of self-discipline drove free-agent salaries through the 
roof and made the game's economics increasingly insane, seem determined to 
break the players' union. The union insists against all common sense that a 
fair-to-middling second baseman who hits .250 and still makes $1 million a year 
is really a wage slave. All of which may result in a season-wrecking strike in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is management's determination to transform a sport into an "total 
entertainment experience," with somersaulting mascots, gyrating ballgirls, 
exploding scoreboards, pounding rock music and all the other nonsense that is 
meant to entertain people who don't belong in the ballpark in the first place. 
This is supposed to attract families. I despair for the families who have to be 
"entertained" this way. (One of my proudest moments as a parent came when my 
14-year-old daughter glared with icy disdain at a middle-aged woman trying to 
do "the wave" in Baltimore's Camden Yards and informed her, "This isn't San 
Diego.") 
</P>
<P>
 But when fears for baseball's future begin to spoil my pleasure over its 
present, I turn my mind to the Pacific Northwest, where my friend Jerry Cohen, 
one of the last of the true believers, is mounting a defiant campaign against 
the dumbing-down of the pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen is a 35-year-old entrepreneur who runs Ebbets Field Flannels out of an 
old warehouse near the Seattle waterfront. And what, you ask, is Ebbets Field 
Flannels? It appears to be a mail-order company whose wares are vintage 
baseball jerseys and hats from the minor leagues, the old Negro and Federal 
leagues and the Latin American leagues. But far more is going on here than a 
successful entry into the burgeoning sports-apparel market. For Cohen is, at 
heart, the historian of an American folk art: the design and manufacture of 
baseball uniforms. And his catalogue reveals an originality, a symmetry, indeed 
a beauty and an intricacy of detail that is reminiscent of auction books in 
which Amish quilts are on offer. Moreover, Cohen has kept a tradition of 
American artisanship alive by defying the modernist heresy of polyester and 
using only original materials, created the old-fashioned way: meaning classic 
baseball flannel, felt and rayon, plus intricate chain-stitching or chenille 
lettering. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans will plunk down about $3 billion this year for licensed baseball 
paraphernalia. Almost all of the apparel items are junk. To anyone with the 
slightest sense of the history and aesthetics of the sport, the trashy 
baseball-apparel boom is just one more depressing example of game's corruption 
by the contemporary American addiction to glitz and "entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping alive a memory of the days when it really was a game -- a game that 
defined a part of the American soul -- Jerry Cohen is giving his friends and 
customers more than a trip down memory lane. Cohen's is a business, sure. But 
it's a business whose reverence for tradition challenges the vulgar marketing 
mentality that is threatening to destroy major league baseball.

BOY'S DEATH DEVASTATES TOWN, BUT MEMORIES OF HIS LIFE SUSTAIN IT; NEW YORK: 
DERRICK ROBIE TOUCHED EVERYONE HE MET. COMMUNITY BUILDS HIM A PARK AS IT 
PREPARES TO TRY 13-YEAR-OLD FOR MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first chink of sunlight after a rainstorm, 4-year-old Derrick Robie 
would dig for worms. Once he got them lined up on the back porch -- Mommy, 
Daddy, brother, baby -- he'd give each worm a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything he could dream up, he was into -- swatting tee balls, mixing meat 
loaf, helping unscrew lug nuts off the car wheel, hoarding hickory nuts in his 
coat pocket. "As much of a boy (as) he was," said his father, "he was very 
gentle with things." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Smith lived on the other side of town, a 13-year-old with glasses and a 
mask of freckles who played drums in the school band, rode his bike everywhere 
and had an infectious cackle of a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, one overcast morning last August, in this pastoral village in western 
New York shadowed by steep-sided hills, Derrick was lured into a stand of pine 
trees a short distance from home and beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Smith, authorities say, confessed to the killing; he is expected to go on 
trial late this month on second-degree murder charges, and the death of Derrick 
will be examined again, in excruciating detail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the life of Derrick Robie -- ebullient, precocious, doted on by all who 
knew him, a ripper of a kid in short sleeves and suspenders with a mop of blond 
hair and a mischievous grin -- preoccupies those who loved him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale and Doreen Robie moved nearly a mile out of town just before Christmas, 
to start afresh. But the walls of their dining room are filled with photographs 
of their ever-smiling son and mementos -- a letter of condolence from the 
President, a poem written by neighbor Mary Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins, "Remember me in early spring, When tee-ball fields with laughter 
ring . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The village came together before winter set in and cleared the base of the 
hill, jagged with pines, where Derrick died. On a knoll overlooking two new 
baseball fields, a crab apple tree, a flagpole and a 42-inch statue of him 
swinging a bat will be erected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "As horrid and as negative as this has been, you just look for something to 
try to turn positive," said Doreen Robie, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people can look at the statue and just remember what childhood was 
supposed to be about, because we've lost it somewhere . . . with all these 
teen-agers that have gone totally haywire. I feel kind of naive because I 
thought I tried to keep him from everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents are sustained by an endless flow of memories. "I think Dory and I 
talk about him like he was in the next room most of the time," said Dale Robie, 
34, a printer. "I think if we didn't, we'd feel pretty negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Doreen Robie unpacked a little gold box she always kept on the 
coffee table and found a hickory nut inside, placed there by small hands. "I 
just left it there, put the top back on and put it back on the shelf." 
</P>
<P>
 No one admired Derrick more than his little brother, Dalton. They played 
together a lot, and Derrick read him "Green Eggs and Ham" every bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "My angel on Earth," said Doreen Robie, touching her 2-year-old's head of 
blond curls. "I've got one each place now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Derrick's fifth birthday, on Oct. 2, she took a bag of big gingerbread 
cookies down to the kindergarten class he would have attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a big party for him and sang happy birthday. That's probably been 
the hardest thing I've had to do since he died, next to burying him." 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over, she wonders how it could have happened. Three mornings a week, 
Derrick went to a summer recreation program run by the village in a field at 
the bottom of their dead-end street. 
</P>
<P>
 It was threatening to rain on Aug. 2, Dalton was fussing and Derrick was 
stamping his foot, pleading for permission to go down by himself. There was 
always a flow of neighborhood youngsters walking along the street, so his 
mother relented. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't follow him down the driveway as usual. Her strong-willed boy hopped 
down the back step and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our share of people writing to us and calling us and telling me 
what a rotten mother I was," Doreen Robie said. "But people don't know the 
circumstances and they don't know the kind of parents we were." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no eyewitnesses; police say Eric somehow persuaded Derrick to take 
a shortcut through an empty, overgrown lot. 
</P>
<P>
 To Eric Smith's family, nothing had jumped out as a strong sign of mental 
illness -- though there were some disturbing tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he strangled a neighbor's cat with a garden hose. Two years later, 
when a schoolmate died in a car crash, he called the teen-ager's family on a 
few occasions, asking to speak with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stephen Herman, a child psychiatrist hired by the defense, said in a 
preliminary report that the boy suffers from depression, nicotine addiction 
from smoking and a mental disorder that causes periodic explosive outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be sorted out at trial. In the meantime, the Robies replay the past, 
again and again. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was recovered on Monday afternoon, the same day Derrick disappeared; 
the Robies didn't sleep until Tuesday night -- and then only with medication. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of the night, Doreen Robie said, "Dale jumped out of bed and 
said Derrick had come to him in his sleep. He told him he was OK, that he never 
felt a thing." 
</P>

 Contributions are being collected to help pay to bronze the statue that is 
being erected in Savona. They can be sent to The Derrick Robie Statue Fund, 252 
1/2 Park Ave., Corning, N.Y. 14830.

MEDICAL JOURNAL ARTICLE SENT PROSECUTOR SLEUTHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a medical journal article that sent a prosecutor sleuthing in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, his persistence led to murder charges against the research 
subject: a mother whose five children had been listed as victims of sudden 
infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Waneta Hoyt, identified only as "H" in the 1972 article, was jailed in lieu of 
$100,000 bail, accused of suffocating the babies -- one after the other -- 
nearly a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Fitzpatrick, then an assistant prosecutor in nearby Onondaga 
County, read the article while researching possible defenses he might face in 
the case of Stephen Van Der Sluys, who was accused of killing his 15-month-old 
daughter in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's death was initially classified as sudden infant death syndrome, the 
unexplained death of a child. As Fitzpatrick prepared to prosecute Van Der 
Sluys for murder, an expert witness told him about the article in the journal 
Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The article chronicled the SIDS deaths of five infants in the same family, a 
premise Fitzpatrick could not accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was dumbfounded after reading the article," he said. "I said, 'These 
children have clearly been murdered.' I just never forgot about the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the article didn't identify the mother, Fitzpatrick noted that the 
author was Dr. Alfred Steinschneider, who at the time worked at Upstate Medical 
Center in Syracuse, the Onondaga County seat. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought the family might also be from Onondaga County, but he put his 
suspicions aside after he left the district attorney's office for private 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 When he became district attorney of Onondaga County in 1992, he followed up on 
his earlier suspicions, checking with the county morgue on infant deaths in the 
late 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 From his list, Fitzpatrick eliminated cases that didn't fit the description in 
the article, until he was left only with the names of the Hoyt children. Then 
he subpoenaed hospital records of the last Hoyt child to die, in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The description of the child's case fit with the description in an autopsy 
report Fitzpatrick traced to Steinschneider, who had examined the last two of 
Hoyt's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick tracked Hoyt to Tioga County, 50 miles south of his own Onondaga 
County, and notified the local district attorney, Robert J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson launched an investigation at the end of 1992. He filed five 
second-degree murder charges against Hoyt in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea if she was alive or not, but it was something I was compelled 
to see to a finish," Fitzpatrick said of his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoyt babies died between 1965 and 1971. One child lived 27 months; none of 
the others survived beyond four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an absolute certainty that these slayings would have gone on undetected 
forever without Mr. Fitzpatrick's involvement," said state police Lt. Thomas P. 
Kelly, who helped lead the investigation. "He was the catalyst. He's the only 
reason this was brought to our attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick contends Hoyt has Munchausen's syndrome by proxy, a psychiatric 
condition in which a parent is driven to harm his or her children to get 
attention and sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinschneider is now considered one of the world's experts on SIDS and is 
president of the American SIDS Institute in Atlanta.

NEIGHBORS RALLY AROUND WOMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HER FIVE CHILDREN; JUSTICE: THE 
DEATHS ORIGINALLY WERE ATTRIBUTED TO SIDS, BUT PROSECUTORS NOW CONTEND THAT SHE 
SMOTHERED EACH CHILD -- THE LAST ONE IN 1971. HER FRIENDS DISPUTE THAT.

<P>
 Spring offered its gentle embrace at last as Waneta Hoyt drove to the village 
on an errand, past snowbanks leaking under the warm sun. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost a daily routine. State police, recognizing the woman's labored 
gait and thinning hair, were waiting when she emerged from the post office one 
morning last month.  
</P>
<P>
 They asked if she would accompany them to Owego, the nearby county seat, to 
assist with research into sudden infant death syndrome, listed as the cause of 
death of all five of her children between 1965 and 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyt went willingly. "If she thought she could help someone, she would," said 
Natalie Hilliard, a close friend for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators weren't really looking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 During six hours of questioning, Hoyt was accused of smothering three of her 
babies with pillows, one with a bath towel and the youngest, Julie, by jamming 
the 7-week-old's face into her shoulder. By late afternoon, she was charged 
with five counts of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges culminated an investigation that began in 1986 when a prosecutor 
read about the unexplained deaths in a medical journal. Right away, he was 
convinced the mother, identified only as "H," was to blame, and set about 
bringing her to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, Hoyt awaits trial, vigorously maintaining her innocence. 
Her lawyer, Robert Miller, castigates the police subterfuge, noting she was 
"picked up on the pretense that they were doing research on SIDS." And her 
friends and neighbors along Route 38, two miles north of this old valley town 
in mountainous Tioga County, seem convinced that the police have made a 
terrible error. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't conceive that she would be guilty. She's too caring, too loving. She 
baby-sat for my children," said Natalie Hilliard's husband, Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trauma that she went through when her children died was really 
heart-rending. This woman you practically carried out of the funeral parlor." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hilliards lived next door to Hoyt and her husband, Tim, from late 1965 to 
1971, and they became friends as the tragedy unfolded. The second child, James, 
lived 27 months; the others died within four months of birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoyts were frantic with worry about losing all of their children to SIDS, 
and used heart-monitoring devices on two or three of them, Arthur Hilliard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did everything the doctors told them to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Nestle, 75, who said she was Hoyt's closest friend in the 1970s, also 
disputed the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe a word of it," she said. "She was too nice a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyt sometimes talked about the deaths of her children and cried, Nestle said. 
More often, she was upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was jolly, just wonderful to talk to, always smiling," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend Hoyt, 47, has Munchausen's syndrome by proxy, a 
psychiatric condition in which a parent, usually a mother, is driven to harm 
children to get attention and sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Ophoven, a forensic pathologist in St. Paul, Minn., who re-examined the 
medical evidence in the Hoyt deaths, prefers to call it "a unique form of 
covert child abuse" first applied in court about 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tim Hoyt, a security guard at Cornell University, and his mother were 
questioned for several hours, no one else is expected to face charges, said 
senior state police Investigator Robert Courtright. 
</P>
<P>
 As for neighbors' anger and suspicion about the pressure Waneta Hoyt came 
under during questioning, he said, "We knew there was going to be some ill 
feelings out there." 
</P>
<P>
 There are poignant memories as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Memorial Day, Natalie Hilliard said, the Hoyts laid flowers on the 
graves of their babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "She always talked about them when it was their birthday," Natalie Hilliard 
said. "My son and their first son would have been about the same age. She 
mentioned that and wondered what he would have been like." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoyts have one living child, a 17-year-old adopted son they reared since 
he was a baby.

NEWLYWEDS REUNITED BY TRUCE IN BOSNIA; EUROPE: HE IS A CROAT; SHE IS A MUSLIM. 
THEY WERE MARRIED 13 DAYS BEFORE THE CONFLICT BEGAN LAST APRIL. SHE WAS CARING 
FOR HER ILL MOTHER AND BARRED FROM RETURNING TO HER HUSBAND -- WHO WAS DRAFTED 
INTO THE ARMY AND TOLD TO SHOOT INTO HER SIDE OF TOWN.

<P>
 When they told him to shoot into her side of town, he fired into the air. He 
tried to send messages to her. She wondered if she would ever see him again. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Davor, a Croat. She is Djana, a Muslim. They were married 13 days before 
war between Croats and Muslims broke out last April in central Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce last month has at last put an end to the war they never believed in. 
And they hope the fragile peace will permanently bring them together again. 
</P>
<P>
 Djana and Davor fell in love as teen-agers 10 years ago, before it mattered if 
someone was Muslim or Croat or Serb. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never paid attention to who was who. It wasn't important," Davor said. 
</P>
<P>
 When war divided their town of Vitez, Djana went to the Muslim side to help 
her ailing mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought she could go there, take care of her mother and come back again," 
said 28-year-old Davor Markovic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fighting became too fierce for her to cross back to the Croat sector 
where her husband was waiting, and the war parted them for 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Davor had to fight against his friends in the Muslim-led Bosnian army. Djana, 
25, spent most of her time in a basement with 15 people, taking shelter from 
artillery attacks on the Muslim-held sector of town known as Stari Vitez. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobilized as a soldier in the Bosnian Croat Defense Council (HVO), he was sent 
to the Stari Vitez front twice. He knew Djana and her mother were somewhere 
nearby -- on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 "On those two occasions it was terrible for me," he said. "I have to say I 
fired only when I had to and I tried not to hit anyone, because all my friends 
were there, my wife, her mother, my best man. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when I had to shoot, usually I shot in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Communicating with the other side was forbidden by the authorities. But Davor 
tried anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, they managed to exchange brief messages through the Red Cross, 
telling each other they were still alive, despite the ferocity of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, he used the Croat militia radio to reach her. Old friends from 
Stari Vitez recognized Davor's voice and they helped foster a few precious 
conversations for the couple by radio phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio contact was eventually discovered and forbidden. Davor's desperate 
written messages were intercepted and destroyed by the Croat military 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The war dragged on. Davor could only hope that his wife would survive in a 
quarter where up to 500 shells would land in a single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Djana began to think she would never see her husband again. "I had lost all 
hope," she said in Stari Vitez. 
</P>
<P>
 Two exhausted armies at last signed a cease-fire in late February. As the 
shooting stopped along the line dividing the town, Davor heard that the United 
Nations would set up a checkpoint between the Croat and Muslim sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 When he went to the U.N. checkpoint, his Croat friends told him not to try to 
cross over when the truce was so fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were warning me not to go. "Don't expose yourself, they said. It's still 
risky.' But I turned a deaf ear to their warnings." 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the checkpoint, Muslim soldiers on the other side recognized Davor and 
went to fetch Djana. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived quickly, but they were still separated by barriers that had been 
set up between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw each other, some 10 meters away. They let us come closer together. 
Those 10 meters seemed like an eternity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they walked the last distance separating them, without caring what 
rules they might be breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "People applauded. People cheered," Davor said. "The U.N. troops knew what was 
happening. They were smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had only a few minutes together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me by my name. I called him his name," Djana said. "We kissed and 
hugged each other. It was sad, especially when we had to part." 
</P>
<P>
 Until commanders of both armies agree to the date when civilians will be 
allowed across former front lines, Davor and Djana have to settle for periodic 
rendezvous at the U.N. checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Davor says he never believed in the war and blames the politicians on both 
sides for fomenting hatred. "I think it was senseless. Many young people died. 
Many of my young friends died on both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Once they are permanently reunited, Djana said, she hopes they won't stay in 
the town where she has so many horrible memories. "I would like to go somewhere 
far away from here to forget what has happened. If there's a chance."

 French authorities said Friday they had found no radioactive contamination

</P>
<P>
 The blast, in an experimental fast-breeder reactor being dismantled at 
Cadarache, killed one worker and injured four. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not evacuate the area around the sprawling nuclear complex, at 
Cadarache, 45 miles northwest of Marseilles. The reactor was halted 11 years

MARQUETTE PAVES WAY FOR URBAN RENEWAL; MILWAUKEE: AS CRIME INCREASED, 
ENROLLMENT PLUMMETED, ESPECIALLY AFTER JEFFREY DAHMER WAS CHARGED WITH 17 
MURDERS. THE SCHOOL DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE BLIGHT. BUT THE PROJECT 
IS NOT WITHOUT CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick LeSage brought his guided tour to a halt outside a three-story brick 
apartment building only blocks from the campus of Marquette University. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was called Drug Plaza. It was like a supermarket for drugs," LeSage said. 
"We finally had to call the sheriff and evict everyone in the place." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the vacant, boarded-up building is on the list for total renovation as 
part of an effort led by Marquette to revitalize a 90-block neighborhood that 
had been declining for years as buildings decayed and crime increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not without its critics, the project is drawing nationwide attention to 
the Jesuit university of 11,000 students as an example of an institution 
fighting inner-city blight through urban renewal rather than fleeing from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use the word 'unique.' I respect what it means -- but I do think this 
is unique without a doubt," said LeSage, who heads the redevelopment effort as 
president of Campus Circle Project, a nonprofit corporation formed by Marquette 
in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by $9 million in reserve funds from Marquette and almost that much from 
an anonymous donor, Campus Circle purchased homes, duplexes and apartments 
throughout the neighborhood. About 30 buildings considered beyond repair were 
demolished. Others have either been renovated or are on a list to be redone. 
</P>
<P>
 As of early this year, Campus Circle owned more than 900 living units in 92 
buildings. It listed the vacancy rate as 50%, due primarily to the waiting list 
for renovation or major repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Centerpieces include Campus Town, a new $30-million, 152-unit apartment 
complex with retail space on the ground floors; the Gilman Building, a restored 
four-story apartment and commercial structure built in 1912; and the Trimborn 
Mansion, an 1880 building renovated from the dilapidated home of two 
fraternities into 20 apartments especially suited to graduate students with 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think that there must be someone out there who's doing what we're 
doing," LeSage said, "but once we got the parade of other universities coming 
in here, it became apparent that nobody was doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors have included representatives of Loyola University in Chicago, 
the University of Southern California, Providence College and the University of 
Cincinnati, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus Circle has "set the tone" for the type of revitalization the Illinois 
Institute of Technology is working to achieve in its Chicago neighborhood, said 
Leroy Kennedy, IIT community relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no model for it; we would say this is the model," said the Rev. 
Albert DiUlio, president of Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
 The area targeted for renewal is generally west and north of the Marquette 
campus, which is immediately west of Milwaukee's downtown business district. 
DiUlio said a gradual shift from owner-occupied dwellings to absentee landlords 
contributed to the drop in housing quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus Circle, which pours the rent it collects back into renovation projects, 
has no policy restricting its rental units to Marquette students or faculty. 
About 3,500 students live in the immediate off-campus area, while others 
commute from home or live in Marquette's on-campus residence halls. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to duties as one of the city's biggest landlords, Campus Circle is 
involved in wide-ranging projects with community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, it worked with the Mid-Town Neighborhood Assn. to hire youths for 
lawn-mowing and other maintenance jobs at Campus Circle properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Another local group, Career Youth Development, plans to start a program for 
homeless young men in space to be provided rent-free by Campus Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Byrd, a former Marquette basketball star, runs an inner-city youth 
development program out of a Campus Circle building. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety was a key concern three years ago throughout the 90-block area 
stretching west from the Marquette campus. Five students died in slayings or 
fires over a six-year period. Then, in July, 1991, serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer 
was arrested at his apartment 10 blocks from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Though none of Dahmer's 17 victims was linked with Marquette, the fact that he 
roamed the neighborhood heightened awareness of its decline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our entering freshmen declined from a high of 2,113 in 1988 to 1,600 in 
1991," DiUlio said. "That's a pretty stark figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt there was no way to reverse that trend without some of our 
involvement in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 DiUlio called on LeSage, whose expertise included years of work in business 
development and high-stakes real estate ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 LeSage said one of the first steps was to appeal to businesses and groups with 
a stake in the neighborhood to join the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the partners he recruited were Aurora Health Care System, operator of 
the Sinai Samaritan Medical Center near Marquette, and Ameritech of Wisconsin, 
with more than 300 employees in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans called for announcing the creation of Campus Circle in the spring of 
1992, but when a knifing incident hit the headlines around Thanksgiving, 1991, 
the plans accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Dahmer thing and everything else, enrollments were hurting -- we 
had to do something before the students went home for the Christmas holidays," 
LeSage said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hastily produced proposal went to the Marquette Board of Trustees on Dec. 
11, 1991, and the board immediately approved using $9 million for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 As word of the project spread, DiUlio was contacted by a wealthy widow who 
contributed $8.2 million, anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus Circle quietly began buying property, and that soon began attracting 
attention -- and resistance -- from community activists concerned that the 
project would crowd out low-income and other non-university residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus Circle has vowed not to raise rents of properties it renovates as a way 
of maintaining neighborhood diversity. But a critic of the project, MacCanon 
Brown, said it has displaced poor people and minorities in favor of providing 
better housing for students. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's homeless advocacy group, Repairers of the Breach, recently announced 
it is launching a study to monitor Campus Circle's impact on housing and living 
patterns in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 June Moberly, executive director of the Avenues West Assn., another community 
organization concerned with social and housing needs, said she hears few 
complaints about Campus Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not hear a lot of in-depth dissatisfaction today," she said. "I think 
they have tried very hard to address the concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Moberly said the project's success in winning a storefront police station, 
with the aid of a government grant, helped reduce neighborhood crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Some complained of evictions as part of Campus Circle's strict policy of 
allowing no drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did put those people out," Moberly said. "I don't think they should have 
to apologize for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students are angry about the taverns ousted from the area by Campus 
Circle, said Bridget Cavanaugh, 20, a junior from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of the people feel that it's just to Marquette's advantage so 
they'll have a better image," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 DiUlio acknowledged that changing the neighborhood's negative image was 
critical to Marquette's future, but the project was never meant to change the 
area's makeup, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a slash-and-burn, scorched-earth type of thing," he said. "This 
was taking care of the people who were here. We have to maintain the diversity 
that we have, which is white and black and Hispanic and Indian and students and 
elderly." 
</P>
<P>
 That goal is reflected in a plan to renovate one building with full 
participation of low-income people who had expressed worries about the project 
at a neighborhood meeting, said Sandy Hintz, Campus Circle vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 DiUlio said the Campus Circle project fits in with the university's status as 
a Jesuit institution, part of the order founded more than four centuries ago by 
St. Ignatius of Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an urban man. He really felt that we belonged in the cities," DiUlio 
said. "Of the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, you'll 
find most of them, like Marquette, started downtown. You'll also find many that 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Marquette never seriously considered moving, and he now sees 
obvious signs of success. 
</P>
<P>
 By last summer, "I'd be walking in the neighborhood and these little old 
ladies would come out and say, 'I wasn't sure, father, but you're doing the 
right thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The most vulnerable people in our neighborhood were the elderly, not the 
students. I think they feel better about the neighborhood. They can walk. They 
feel much safer."

SELF-SEGREGATED DORMS A TREND AND AN UPROAR; CIVIL RIGHTS: UNIVERSITIES ACCEDE 
TO STUDENTS' DEMANDS, ORGANIZE HOUSING BY ETHNICITY, RACE, SEXUAL ORIENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The newest dormitory at Brown University, one set aside chiefly for African 
Americans, is called Harambee House, Swahili for "the coming together of 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Already on Brown's hilltop campus overlooking downtown are Hispanic House, 
French House, Slavic House, East Asian House and German House. 
</P>
<P>
 From this Ivy League school in New England to little-known colleges in the 
Pacific Northwest, many universities are acceding to students' demands and 
organizing dormitories by race, ethnicity, sexual orientation -- even by 
drinkers and teetotalers. 
</P>
<P>
 But as they do, educators question whether these specialized living 
arrangements are bringing people together, as the name "Harambee" suggests, or 
driving them further apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doonesbury" and other comic strips have parodied what some call the 
"separatist movement," depicting scenes like campus drinking fountains labeled 
for blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of concern, Brown has halted opening any more "theme" houses until 
their effects can be studied. "We don't want to have a Balkanization of the 
campus," said Executive Vice President Robert A. Reichley. 
</P>
<P>
 Reichley said the idea of a university is to have diverse people living and 
learning together in one community, not "small enclaves." 
</P>
<P>
 The separatist movement is a hot issue well beyond Providence. In February, at 
the University of Pennsylvania, a special commission studying the "key aspects 
of campus life" recommended that first-year students be assigned housing to 
avoid what it called "self-segregation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current system, students may choose where they will live. The 
commission found that they often "self-segregate and lose opportunities for 
wider interaction among diverse groups of students." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire Fagin, Penn's interim president, said she is considering a pilot 
program next year in which students would agree to be randomly assigned to 
dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, what we are seeing is a much more divided population on our 
college campuses," Fagin said. "We are moving into a very, very hyphenated 
world: It's Asian-American, African-American . . . it's so contrary to 
everything I grew up with . . . when everyone fought to just be American." 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of us who stress pluralism, these are not easy times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although separate housing is perhaps the most controversial part of recent 
demands from student groups, it is not the only one. On many campuses, African 
Americans, Asians, Latinos, gay students and others have demanded their own 
lounges, activities, even their own curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing, however, seems to unnerve people as much as separate housing, 
especially when it involves African Americans. Some see it as a painful slap at 
the 1950s and '60s fight for integration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of the civil rights movement was to be color-blind," said Robin 
Rose, Brown's dean of student life. "There was a high value on integration, 
integration at any cost. Now these students are saying, any cost is too high. 
They want to live together. And who can blame them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail Ramsay said she is glad she can live in Harambee House, after living 
last year on a floor where all the other students were white. "All of a sudden 
I can talk to people going through the same things," said Ramsay, a New Yorker 
who aspires to be a doctor. "It feels more like home." 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say there are small comforts that help them in their studies, such 
as shared tastes in music and food, and more important ones, such as living 
with people who have felt the sting of the same racial or ethnic insults. 
College officials at many campuses agree that black students often earn better 
grades when they are living in exclusively African American dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsay said that because she is black, in a city with a small percentage of 
black residents, Providence natives have assumed that she couldn't be a Brown 
student. She said some have even approached her "thinking I am a prostitute 
because I am a black woman." 
</P>
<P>
 On a campus where 7% of undergraduates are African American, Ramsay said she 
is always in the minority, except when she comes back to Harambee. In its first 
year, Harambee has 17 students who fill two floors of a brick building in 
Wriston Quad. Sixteen are African American, and one is white. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, "open to all students who identify with their African descent, 
speak an African language or major solely in Pan-African studies," is expected 
to attract more African American students next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Lehrer, a Brown sophomore who is white, is one of the students who 
doesn't think separate dorms are a good idea. He said he had more black friends 
when he attended high school in Philadelphia than he does at Brown, even though 
he is around many more African Americans there. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Brown's 5,600 undergraduates, 390 are African American, 300 are Hispanic 
and 660 are Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehrer said students naturally tend to eat, go to movies and parties and 
become friendly with the people they live with. So, he said, separate housing 
inhibits the mixing of different groups of people. 
</P>
<P>
 As Lehrer spoke in the cavernous dining hall called the "Ratty," most of the 
Hispanics, Asians and blacks ate lunch in small, separate groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Several white students said they understood why there were Spanish and German 
houses, because students practiced new languages there. But they said they 
didn't understand how there could be an "African American house," because they 
doubted they would be allowed to have a "white house." Many white students were 
uncomfortable discussing the issue and did not want to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of separate dorms said that for as long as there have been 
fraternities and sororities, students have been seeking out ways to live with 
other people like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 They said athletes room together, people from New Jersey room together, rich 
people with summer homes on Long Island room together. Because there are so few 
minority students on major campuses, every dormitory is essentially a "white 
dorm," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Gray III, president of the United Negro College Fund, said, "We say 
it's acceptable to have a Hillel House, a Newman (Catholic) House, and Lutheran 
House, but as soon as we have a Harambee House, it's bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of asking, why are black students separating from whites at white 
college campuses, we should be asking, what is wrong with white America and its 
institutions that blacks don't feel welcome?"

 After taking a trip to Kenya and taking African studies, he decided to move

 "I get to meet people I wouldn't otherwise," O'Brien said.

 He believes Brown is right to give students an option of where they want to

1993 HIGHWAY DEATH RATE AT ALL-TIME LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's highway death rate fell to an all-time low last year, only the 
second time in three decades that fewer than 40,000 people have been killed on 
the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the 1993 death rate 
was 1.7 fatalities for every 100 million vehicle miles of travel.A vehicle mile 
is one vehicle traveling one mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Total highway deaths for 1993 were 39,850, the agency said. That was up from 
39,235 in 1992, but the death rate fell because of an increase in driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The motor vehicle accident rate has been calculated since 1921, when it was 24 
deaths per 100 million vehicle miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The department estimated that alcohol use was involved in about 44% of fatal 
accidents, down from 45.1% a year earlier.

VILLAGE 1-WOMAN POLICE DEPARTMENT SHUTS DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The police department has disbanded, and Carol Goff is out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Village officials surveyed Martin's 462 residents earlier this year, asking if 
they were willing to pay higher property taxes to cover the $29,000-a-year 
expense for the one-woman department. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% said no. So the department officially disbanded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard -- law enforcement is in my blood," said Goff, who was the 
entire village police force for more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Goff, a 38-year-old single mother of three children, will keep working 
part-time with the police department in nearby Allegan.

PLAIN-WRAP NETWORK HITS ROAD IN HIGH-TECH BUS; C-SPAN: RECRUITING VIEWERS, 
ESPECIALLY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS, IS ITS AIM. WITH TURMOIL IN THE CABLE 
INDUSTRY, THERE'S A LOT RIDING ON THOSE BIG WHEELS.

<P>
 Margie Grills charged toward the canary yellow bus with "C-SPAN" emblazoned 
across its side. "Is Brian in there?" she squealed before she reached the first 
step up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Lamb -- C-SPAN founder and self-styled anti-celebrity -- is back in 
Washington. Disappointed, Grills, 64, scrambled aboard anyway, oohing and 
ahhing over the TV cameras and video monitors inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus crisscrossing the country is the first flashy promotion since cable 
TV's low-budget public service network debuted March 19, 1979. C-SPAN is the 
network that dares to be dull, the network that brought you two hours of 
Congress members arguing about mohair subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Grills is the kind of fan they love to meet. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Bella Vista, Ark., who is spending the winter in Florida, she 
calls herself a "C-SPAN junkie." She isn't interested in ABC or CNN -- the way 
they snip the news into sound bites, then trot out commentators to tell her 
what it means. She watches Congress live on C-SPAN for hours at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," she said, "because it's not all gussied up." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly. C-SPAN has made a science of being less than lively, more solid than 
slick. Its unblinking cameras stare straight through congressional hearings, 
speeches, political rallies and press conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no commercials or ratings; no catchy theme songs or celebrity hosts 
or wizened commentators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb -- who doubles as on-air moderator and chief executive officer -- has 
attracted a few fans like Grills despite his efforts to avoid celebrity. But he 
refuses to promote himself or the other on-air hosts: their place is in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 That has made it tough to promote C-SPAN. Without an image to market, how 
could the network reach out to potential viewers -- especially teachers and 
students -- who could benefit from its programming? 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the C-SPAN School Bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other networks plug a Dan Rather or Diane Sawyer; C-SPAN has its bus. "Because 
this is a network without personalities," Lamb explained, "the bus is our 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea came to him in February, 1993, while interviewing author and history 
professor Douglas Brinkley, who traveled the country in a bus with 17 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, the $500,000 C-SPAN bus was on the road -- part rolling 
billboard, part classroom, part television studio. It's still out there, in the 
midst of a 35-state tour from Washington to California to Florida to 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of turmoil in the cable industry, there's a lot riding on those 
eight big wheels. "It's a good time to be on the road," C-SPAN Vice President 
Susan Swain said. 
</P>
<P>
 New federal cable regulations cost C-SPAN about 2.5 million households since 
September. The rules require cable systems to carry more broadcast stations in 
their lineups, and some dumped C-SPAN to make room. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Congress had struck a blow against its direct pipeline into the 
nation's living rooms. "I don't think they have any idea how bad it's hurt the 
underpinnings of this network," Lamb said. 
</P>
<P>
 C-SPAN has joined others in challenging the regulations before the Supreme 
Court. In the fast-changing world of cable TV, Lamb said, "my No. 1 goal is 
survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 15 years old, C-SPAN already has the feel of an institution. Its live 
coverage of the House of Representatives reaches 50 million cable households -- 
about 98% of the homes with cable -- plus another 10 million by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 C-SPAN 2, which covers the Senate, reaches more than 30 million homes. A third 
network is to begin airing part time this month, carrying more speeches and 
hearings to a handful of markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamb said that surveys find four in 10 cable viewers watch C-SPAN. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Petersburg, Fla., as in most other cities on the trip, the bus pulled 
up outside a school. Eleven students crowded onto a couch inside, in front of 
three large video monitors. When asked if they ever watch C-SPAN, two of them 
nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus manager Richard Weinstein showed off the robotic cameras, zooming in on 
one girl to demonstrate how close-ups create a sense of drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "At C-SPAN, we try to be neutral -- even technically," he told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is giving a speech on the House floor, whether he's talking about 
something really boring or something really important -- that's for you to 
decide," Weinstein said as students watched their faces staring back from the 
video monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 To the teachers, the bus handed out information on how to use C-SPAN in the 
classroom, for free. Some already knew. Jacksonville, Fla., teacher Kevin 
Sacerdote said C-SPAN gives his government students a look at the British House 
of Commons, the nightly news from Moscow and the Australian Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have a sense of 'Wow!' about it, but 'Wow!' doesn't last," said 
C-SPAN's Swain, who joined the bus for a few days. "It's important to turn a 
couple of teachers at every stop into users, so it's there for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
 Video shot by the bus crew shows up on C-SPAN daily. One day it's the Nixon 
Presidential Library in Yorba Linda, Calif.; another it's the Cadillac Ranch in 
Amarillo, Tex., or a blimp ride in Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a satellite truck, the bus can do live interviews. Ross Perot 
came aboard in Texarkana, Tex., and President Clinton spoke to the bus by 
telephone in Hot Springs, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour will end in New Orleans in May. C-SPAN expects the bus to be back on 
the road to schools next fall, and in years to come. There's talk of painting 
it red, white and blue for the '96 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you change the oil," Swain said, "this thing can go forever."

 Tired of the stereotypes, Morello -- great-granddaughter of a Sicilian "man of 
honor" -- offers a glimpse of history most Independence Hall tourists never 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Organized Crime Tour points out that the Irish and Eastern European Jews 
ran Philadelphia mobs long before La Cosa Nostra came along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to realize that organized crime is universal. It's not just the 
Italians and Sicilians," said Morello, 35, a historian and criminologist who 
wrote her master's thesis on South Philadelphia's crime heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers is a tale of poor immigrants in an insular neighborhood that bred 
familiarity and contempt. It is laced with memories of the turn-of-the-century 
Mafia that prided itself on honor and, Morello says, was less a gang than an 
ethnic Elks Club with a mean streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, it's a tale of lost lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Visit Christian Street, where 57 mobsters were slain along one four-block 
stretch between 1914 and 1930. One, Joseph Bruno, took 14 bullets in his right 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk along Kater Street, once a red-light district where syphilis killed 
German and French prostitutes and rogue doctors introduced the drug trade by 
prescribing narcotic injections for menopausal women. See the Mafia clubhouse 
that is now a Vietnamese hair salon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour the cramped alleys where Irish laborers paid 24 cents a month for their 
rented rooms. See St. Mary Magdelene, the first Italian church in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Learn about Salvatore Sabella, who Morello says is the first known Sicilian 
Mafia boss in Philadelphia. And Anthony (Musky) Zanghi, Philadelphia's first 
stool pigeon, killed in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people weren't necessarily exposed to the outside theories and the 
outside ways," Morello said. "They were, and are, neighborhood-bound. And that 
can breed crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1854, South Philadelphia was not part of the city but a municipality 
called Moyamensing, which in the language of the Leni-lenape Indians means 
"pigeon droppings." And it was a haven for criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1830s, Irish gangs were fighting each other for control of the streets. 
One of the meanest, The Killers, reigned after the Civil War. It was run by 
saloon keeper and alderman William McMullen. To stop blacks from voting, gang 
members shot them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there ever was a mob boss, McMullen would fit the bill," Morello said, 
walking past his birthplace. Shot twice in his lifetime, McMullen died in 1901 
of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish mobsters gained power in the early 1900s, before Prohibition forced 
most gangsters into bootlegging, Morello said. Only the Sicilian Mafia emerged 
unbroken after passage of the 21st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prohibition was the big thing. You had 13 years. Either you made it or that 
was it," Morello said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, it meant the dilution of the Sicilian Mafia, which began 
admitting mainland Italians and became La Cosa Nostra. It is here, about 1930, 
that Morello's tour ends. 
</P>
<P>
 She wants to attract tourists and criminology students, and the time is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputed Philadelphia mob boss John Stanfa and 23 suspected associates were 
indicted March 16 on racketeering charges that include crimes ranging from 
murder to kidnaping to numbers running. 
</P>
<P>
 Morello has little patience with today's Mafia. "They're not men of honor," 
she said. "They're gangsters." 
</P>
<P>
 The early crime bosses were neighborhood leaders, Morello said. They ran 
legitimate businesses and used violence, intimidation and criminal activity to 
protect their interests. 
</P>
<P>
 As Morello faced charges of Italian-bashing and anonymous death threats, the 
tour's original sponsor, a museum, withdrew its support. She is now running the 
tour as a business called Italian Market Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone opposes the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey -- as long as the issues are presented accurately, we have no gripe," 
said Francis Recchuiti, a lawyer who heads the Commission of Social Justice for 
the state Sons of Italy lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a rowdy bunch of people. We're talking about violent 
situations that are part of our history," Recchuiti said. "But it's still 
history, and it helped shape this nation. She's credible, she's accurate and 
she has a story that's worth listening to."

BRITISH ERA FADES, CHINA GAINS IN MYANMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RAYMER, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Waiters in starched white shirts and bow ties still serve afternoon tea and 
heaping platters of Yorkshire pudding at Maymyo's Candacraig Hotel, a Tudor 
mansion of the defunct Bombay & Burma Trading Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But the British quit Burma, now Myanmar, in 1948. These days, clients at the 
Candacraig are likely to be a new breed of foreign fortune-seeker -- Chinese 
businessmen exploring overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Candacraig's Chinese guests show up for dinner in cowboy boots, 
American-made blue jeans and sunglasses. Some openly carry bottles of fine 
Scotch whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets, they're easy to spot taking taxi rides in some of the 153 
miniature horse-drawn carriages left from colonial times, when British 
officials used to retreat to mountaintop Maymyo to escape the heat of Mandalay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandalay, now Myanmar's second-largest city, was linked by rail to the old 
Burma Road, which followed an ancient trade route and was the chief supply line 
to China during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the foothills of the Shan plateau, where the clouds rush to meet 
blossoming bougainvillea, the Chinese are buying turreted Victorian houses with 
names like "Polo Villa" and "East Ridge Estate." And they are investing in 
local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Maymyo residents speak of darker activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese have definitely replaced the British as our masters, at least in 
commerce," said a Burmese businessman dressed in the traditional "longyi, " the 
all-purpose wraparound garment worn by both men and women. "The Chinese 
underworld is laundering its money here, especially in real estate and gems." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese presence in Maymyo, longtime residents and foreign diplomats say, 
is unmistakable testimony to the thriving trade -- both legal and illegal -- 
between Myanmar and its giant neighbor to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal trade across the border is conservatively estimated at $1 billion a 
year. The boom is part of Myanmar's efforts to open its economy after nearly 
three decades of state-imposed socialism and official isolation from its richer 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, no one here doubts that contraband Burmese timber and opium, which 
is turned into high-grade heroin in jungle refineries, are making traders even 
richer on both sides of the porous 1,370-mile border. 
</P>
<P>
 Myanmar produces more than 90% of the heroin in the "Golden Triangle" region, 
which includes neighboring Thailand and Laos. Myanmar's forests hold more than 
70% of the world's teak reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, China has become both a market and a transport route for 
narcotics and teak. 
</P>
<P>
 Policing the rugged border through thickly canopied jungle is virtually 
impossible, despite recent truce agreements between ethnic insurgents, 
including several opium warlords, and Myanmar's hard-line military junta, the 
State Law and Order Restoration Council. Burmese troops hold only a narrow 
37-mile-long corridor of jungle near the Chinese border town of Ruili. 
</P>
<P>
 Day and night, convoys of overloaded trucks and new cars make their way 
through Maymyo from the British-built section of the old Burma Road, which 
snakes across the mountains into China's Yunnan Province. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese buyers say they are shipping cheap Burmese teak, much of it cut by 
hill tribes in defiance of government quotas and export restrictions. They also 
buy gemstones, no longer a state-run monopoly, and locally grown corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Chinese appear to be watching over the delivery of Japanese cars, 
four-wheel drives and minibuses that move north on the Burma Road to Yunnan 
Province. Because most Chinese provinces levy hefty taxes, it is cheaper for 
Chinese businessmen to smuggle vehicles through Myanmar than to import them 
legally through Shanghai or Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tribes, especially the Shans, are willing to trade their culture -- their 
forests, antiques and crafts -- for the good things in life," said Mohammed 
Slim, a merchant and pharmacist of Indian heritage whose family has been in 
Maymyo for three generations. "The Burmese and Shans want T-shirts, jeans and 
TVs. And the Chinese have them to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the same Burma Road, Myanmar's military dictators are importing large 
numbers of Chinese-made light-infantry weapons and armored personnel carriers 
-- part of a $1.4-billion arms deal signed in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year more than 300 trucks laden with multiple rocket launchers, 
recoilless rifles, mortars and ammunition passed over a new Chinese-built 
bridge on the Shweli River. The "gun bridge," so-called because of the heavy 
volume of southbound military traffic, links China with the town of Muse and 
the Burma Road on the Myanmar side of the border, according to Western 
intelligence sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese construction crews are reportedly improving the twisting Burma Road 
between the frontier Myanmar town of Lashio and the China border. Western 
correspondents are forbidden to travel to Lashio to see for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chinese goods are visibly flooding the markets of Maymyo and Mandalay. For 
sale are Chinese-made antibiotics and herbal medicines, Michael Jackson 
T-shirts, bicycles, sports shoes, beer, soft drinks, soap, toothpaste, 
televisions, rice cookers and other electronic appliances that are cheaper than 
locally made products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't lack for anything these days, even medicines," said John Aung 
Khiang, a retired Burmese army officer in Mandalay. "If you have the money, you 
just buy it straight away. It's not like the old days of isolation." 
</P>
<P>
 What seems undeniable, according to local Burmese and Western diplomats, is 
that China has dramatically shifted its strategy from supporting 
anti-government communist rebels within Myanmar toward greater economic 
cooperation with the government in Yangon (Rangoon), the capital and largest 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the increase in aid and trade deals, China has promised to build 
three roads linking Yunnan with Myanmar's northernmost state, Kachin. And China 
is reportedly studying construction of a hydroelectric plant for Kachin state, 
which includes the World War II supply base of Myitkyina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burmese are just surviving," said a Maymyo shopkeeper. "But the Chinese 
have won a lot of economic control and haven't fired a shot."

COLLEGE GRADUATES FACE BRIGHT FUTURES LADEN WITH HEAVY DEBTS; LIFESTYLE: A 
STUDY FINDS THAT LARGE NUMBERS POSTPONE MARRIAGE, DELAY HAVING A FAMILY, HOLD 
DOWN TWO JOBS, EVEN PUT OFF MEDICAL CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillary Wicai has her dream job as a television reporter, but she can't afford 
the clothes that make her look professional on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 She's trying to pay off "an enormous debt, probably $20,000 or $21,000" for 
the year at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism that helped 
her land the job. And that's on a novice journalist's salary of $16,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my clothes are gifts," said Wicai, who works for WLFI in West Lafayette, 
Ind. "Every single thing I have for work was given to me. My mother, my 
grandmother -- they shop for me for bargains." 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of today's students must smirk when, studying Shakespeare, they come 
across Polonius' advice to his son Laertes, "Neither a borrower nor a lender 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 If borrowers they weren't, they wouldn't in college be. 
</P>
<P>
 And after they get out, their debt can influence the course of their lives. A 
study finds that many graduates in debt postpone marriage, delay having a 
family, hold down two jobs, even put off medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Much attention has been paid to college borrowers who default, but relatively 
little to the impact of indebtedness on the 12.5 million who ploddingly, month 
after month, pay off their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively they owe $41.9 billion. Many are still in hock 10 years after 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 No time for these young people to backpack across Europe; no year off to "find 
themselves" -- they've got debts to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are students who would like to take a couple of years of their life and 
go to work in the nonprofit sector, and return something to their country 
before they mush on with their careers," said Victor Lindquist, director of 
placement at Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 'But they feel they are unable to do that and still meet their financial 
obligations. The clock begins ticking once you graduate." 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of reasons -- college tuitions have soared, more people of all 
incomes are enrolling and there are more loan programs available -- more 
students are leaving school in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 In many schools, 70% of the student body must borrow. One survey said that the 
average undergraduate borrower carried away a $7,900 debt. Those who also 
borrowed for an advanced degree owed $31,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And the burden is compounded when one student debtor marries another. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in school in the 1950s, I had three jobs and worked summers," 
recalled Lindquist. "If you hustled you could make your way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Peevey, director of career and counseling services at the University of 
Houston at Clear Lake, said some graduates with loans leap at the first job 
offer that comes along "rather than taking the time to find the job that fits 
their skills and interest. So they pay a price." 
</P>
<P>
 Debt, of course, isn't a burden for every borrower. Jerry Heet, a Northwestern 
computer engineering graduate with AT&T Bell Laboratories in Naperville, Ill., 
finds his loans an inconvenience, but not much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Heet, the first member of his family to go to college, pays back $110.59 a 
month; he knows the figure by heart. He said he had to postpone buying a new 
stereo system and drove his 1981 Nissan 220SX "basically into the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 "But looking at what it gave me -- a great education -- I would recommend 
borrowing rather than going to a lesser school," Heet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newscaster Wicai agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could I have gotten this job without that degree?" she asked. "Yes. But would 
I have been as prepared? No. I wanted to be the best entry-level reporter I 
could be, so I could feel confident in my abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 "My lifestyle is dictated by two things -- my loan and my lack of income," she 
said. "I could have had these loans and been a stockbroker and been OK. But the 
combination means I have no social life." 
</P>
<P>
 To measure the after-college impact of college debt, educational researchers 
Joseph Boyd and Carol Wennerdahl questioned 551 recent college graduates who 
had borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent said they could easily handle their payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 25%, the debt affected decisions on when or if to marry; more than a 
third who did marry said it influenced decisions about starting a family. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent work at two jobs or more because of their debts. More than a 
quarter said their loans caused them to live with family or relatives. And 35% 
said they postponed needed health care because of their debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, about 13% said their loans forced them to drop out of college 
-- leaving them perhaps worse off than if they had never gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of earning power you have with just some college is not much more 
than with a high school diploma," said Ted Marchese, vice president of the 
American Assn. for Higher Education. "So these kids are in a bind; $6 an hour 
doesn't go far when you have a $110 monthly debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Hall, director of career services at Howard University in Washington, 
said he has seen students "struggle through one, two, three semesters, just 
worn down" by mounting debts. "I have a feeling we push out a lot of kids," he 
said. "The financial burden is just too great." 
</P>
<P>
 As a step toward relieving these problems, Congress reformed federal student 
loan programs last year. President Clinton recently bragged about the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The change will give students "the choice of repaying loans as a small 
percentage of income over time, which is a big deal for young people who know 
they want to do things that are personally rewarding but don't pay very much," 
Clinton said. "It will decrease the debt burden that crushes too many of those 
people and discourages them from spending a few years in lower-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some educators think more could be done to relieve young people of 
starting careers mired in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern's Kellogg Graduate School of Management is setting up a 
loan-forgiveness program for students who take low-paying jobs for nonprofit 
outfits or in government or teaching. Stanford University is studying 
compressing undergraduate work into three years to reduce the overall cost.

LESBIAN COUPLE HAS A CHILD FOR LOVE, POLITICAL STATEMENT; LIFESTYLE: 'A FAMILY

<P>
 It's a sunny Sunday afternoon, perfect for a poolside baby shower in suburban 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Boy!" proclaims the banner over the front door. Guests stream through 
to the back-yard patio for hors d'oeuvres, punch and word games. 
</P>
<P>
 After an "Earth mother" ceremony in which a wreath of flowers is placed around 
the pregnant woman, presents stacked on a table are opened for her son-to-be -- 
shirts-and-pants sets, T-shirts, playsuits, toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby shower is for Ann Harrington and Mindy McNichols. Harrington is 
pregnant; McNichols is her lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting side by side, they share in the gift-opening, in testimonials from 
friends and in explaining why they decided to bring a baby into their 
complicated world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's overwhelming to know that we have all this support," McNichols told the 
shower-goers, who include relatives, friends and fellow activists from women's 
political and gay-lesbian rights groups. "A family is defined by love, and we 
have it. For us to have a child, for lesbians, today it is a political act." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody asks heterosexuals why they have children," Harrington says. "We want 
to have children for the same reasons heterosexuals have children. I'd like 
other women to know this is something definitely doable, something not to be 
afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For many lesbians, 1993 brought a stronger feeling than ever of openness, of 
"coming out" about their sexual orientation, and that has fostered an increased 
openness about parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one knows the number of lesbian parents in the United States, few 
dispute that the ranks are growing, aided by the increasing availability of 
artificial insemination and support services that lessen the complications of 
rearing a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Support groups number in the hundreds across the nation -- one organization, 
the Gay and Lesbian Parents Coalition International, has about 60 chapters -- 
and dozens of educational books and videotapes are available to gay parents and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly been a growing thing," said Debbie Frank, a clinical social 
worker. "It's been happening now for quite some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Frank began offering parenting workshops for lesbian couples in 
South Miami. Now, she can refer couples to several doctors in the community who 
will help gay women become pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 But openness, of course, doesn't necessarily bring acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Court decisions on the rights of lesbian parents, both biological and 
non-biological, have been mixed, according to Abby Abinanti, legal director for 
the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. Same-sex marriages 
aren't recognized, and custodial rights are interpreted inconsistently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several states are going case-by-case," Abinanti said. "There are certain 
states where it's county-by-county." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington and McNichols used a California sperm bank for Harrington's 
pregnancy, with the donor waiving any future legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 If something happens to Harrington, though, courts might not recognize rights 
for McNichols. Anticipating that, the couple has drawn up 11 documents, 
including a will and trusteeship, aimed to at least provide proof of their 
intent to rear the child together. 
</P>
<P>
 Some court decisions in Florida have recognized such parents' custodial 
rights, guided by what the judge determines to be in the child's best interest. 
But there also have been decisions that refuse rights even to biological 
parents who are gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "His homosexual lifestyle is so indicative of moral unfitness that it 
disqualifies his ability to live up to and perform the societal duty of 
parenting children," Duval County Circuit Judge A. C. Soud wrote in July in 
denying a gay father's request for unrestricted visitation with his two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 David Caton, a state leader of the conservative, church-based American Family 
Assn., said his group is adamantly opposed to homosexuals' being parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally inappropriate to place the custody of a child in somebody's 
hands who is known to be engaging in antisocial behavior that is destructive in 
nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One evening last summer, McNichols and Harrington, her stomach just swelling, 
sat in their living room and discussed their decision to have a child together. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I've always wanted to do," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why shouldn't we be able to do it?" McNichols chimed in. "Times are changing. 
There are a lot more single women who are mothers, more not-so-traditional 
relationships, more acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 When they began seeing each other three years ago, the desire to become 
parents was important to both. Neither had wanted to be a single mother, but 
once they were certain they were committed to each other, they began weighing 
their options. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to have a child was a political statement, they acknowledged, but 
that wasn't the reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both love children," said McNichols, 39, who has 10 brothers and sisters. 
Harrington, 38, has three. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first question: Who would get pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 Both were working for the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, 
the state's social services agency. But they decided that since McNichols, then 
an attorney at HRS, had the potential for higher income, it would be better to 
have her continue working. 
</P>
<P>
 (Harrington noted, however, that because their baby can't be covered under 
McNichols' insurance, she must return to work when her maternity leave ends 
even if she wanted to be a stay-at-home mother.) 
</P>
<P>
 The next question: How would the designated woman get pregnant? 
</P>
<P>
 McNichols and Harrington had met another lesbian couple who used artificial 
insemination and recommended it. They tried at-home insemination 
unsuccessfully, and finally had an intrauterine implant in their doctor's 
office. The cost: $2,000. The conception date: Feb. 26, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came breaking the news to relatives, friends and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were a little shocked," Harrington said of her family. "They've 
all known that I've been a lesbian for years. They assumed I wouldn't have 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 After initial questions of "are you sure you know what you're doing?" both 
families were supportive. Some co-workers were cool to the idea, with reactions 
ranging from "that's great" to silence. And most friends were enthusiastic; 
they wound up having four baby showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they said, came the special questions, such as what the baby will call 
McNichols. "I hated Mommy I and Mommy II," she said of one suggestion. They 
expect to wind up with some combination of Mommy and Mindy. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to explain their relationship to the child "in stages," but never to 
be secretive about it. "I don't want my child to grow up thinking there's 
anything wrong with the way I live," McNichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 They will make sure, she said, that he has positive male role models in his 
life. They think he will grow up more tolerant and open-minded.

 Although the research field is fairly new, studies thus far haven't shown that 
having gay parents harms children. The children face some teasing, but 
gay-parenting advocates note that virtually every child is teased about 
something, from weight to athletic ability to, yes, parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a legal brief last December supporting the appeal of a lesbian mother in 
Virginia who lost custody, the American Psychological Assn. said that research 
has shown sexual orientation "does not affect parenting abilities" and that 
some studies have indicated gay parents might even be more sensitive parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies don't link parents' sexual preference and their children's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I presume he's going to be heterosexual," Harrington said of their child. 
"Having heterosexual parents didn't make me heterosexual."

 Braden McNichols Harrington, 9 pounds, 1 ounce, was born Nov. 23 at Mt. Sinai 
Medical Center. Harrington was in labor 13 hours, with McNichols at her side 
coaching her through natural childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were in tears as they held him for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so incredible, so thrilling," McNichols said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle," Harrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in their living room the next week, they said they may have more 
children, and McNichols hasn't ruled out being a biological mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we're more in love than ever," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braden looked up, wide-eyed, and quietly squirmed as a visitor cradled him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're so trusting," McNichols said, beaming down at him. "So innocent."

OLD N.Y. WATERFRONT NOW IS FOR THE BIRDS AS CAMPAIGN FOR SANCTUARY TAKES WING 
</P>

 Along Gowanus Bay in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, dilapidated, 
crumbling piers jut into the water, relics from the area's booming shipping 
days. Empty warehouses loom like great walls sheltering the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the decay, life blooms in a shallow pool hugged by two sandbars, a 
landfill project never completed. In the last two years, 30 to 50 species of 
birds, including blue herons and egrets, have landed here to nest and feed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think of it as a four-star restaurant for birds," said Anthony Giordano, 
executive director of Sunset Park Restoration, a group lobbying to protect the 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Birds migrating along the East Coast look for open spaces with shallow ponds 
and few people -- exactly what Gowanus Bay and other New York sites offer them, 
said Kevin McGowan, curator of birds and mammals at the Cornell Laboratory of 
Ornithology. 
</P>
<P>
 The city waters often prove hazardous, though. Katharine Parsons, senior 
scientist at Manomet Bird Observatory in Massachusetts, said, "We are concerned 
about pollution everywhere in the New York harbor." But she said places such as 
Gowanus Bay should be "protected and restored" to sustain bird life. 
</P>
<P>
 But the future of the Gowanus Bay habitat is uncertain. The discovery of the 
habitat comes just as the community struggles to revitalize the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest and most significant effort came in late February, when the 
Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corp. petitioned the state to declare 
the entire 80-acre Bush Terminal area an Economic Development Zone. If created, 
the zone would lure businesses with tax and utility incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 It could also ignite an intense debate between birders and businesses. "The 
downturn in business in the last few years has actually been good for the 
birds," Giordano said, adding that his group wants the habitat mapped as a 
wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano said people can't see the habitat on current maps, which represent 
the area as industrial. 
</P>
<P>
 No one saw it at all until an extensive, $125,000 city study on Bush Terminal 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, we thought it would make a nice industrial site," Giordano said. 
"But then we saw it had been reclaimed by nature." 
</P>
<P>
 James Sparkman, economic development director for the southwest Brooklyn 
industrial group, said he supports the idea of a bird sanctuary, but added, 
"I'm concerned about the implications of a wetlands on business development in 
the area. There's a real potential for development there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparkman, whose office at the waterfront and 43rd Street overlooks the bird 
habitat, said he's not sure how far Giordano wants to go to protect the birds, 
but there could be conflict if there is "a real plan to develop the area." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear when any plans will be solidified. Last October, the city 
declared Bush Terminal an "industrial green park," reserved for recycling 
businesses, but 70% of the sites remain vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jerrold Nadler, whose district includes the area, plans to introduce 
legislation to study the feasibility of turning the terminal into a cargo port. 
</P>
<P>
 His plans may stall, however, with news of the habitat. An aide to Nadler in 
Brooklyn, Brad Korn, said he became aware of the bird haven only recently. "It 
is something we will have to take into account. We have to protect our 
wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano, whose group conducted its own study of the habitat this year, said, 
"The amazing thing is that it's the only natural habitat for birds from the 
Verrazano all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 And so every Thursday morning for a year and a half, a member of Sunset Park 
Restoration has been at the water's edge conducting a bird census to be shared 
with the Manomet observatory. Several endangered and threatened species have 
been seen, including the state-threatened commontern. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may seem odd for birds to flock to such an industrial area, 
McGowan stressed that it's not, and that the habitat is worth protecting. "Some 
of the best birding I've done has been with some really horrible stuff in the 
background."

DANA PARSONS: SORE SUBJECT: DOES CANING HURT JUVENILE OR SOCIETY MORE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 We had a math teacher in eighth grade who could best be described as a 
no-nonsense kind of guy. While he was explaining something to us on the first 
day of school, the class clown cracked wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Without saying a word, the teacher walked over to the clown's desk and asked 
for his textbook. Upon receiving it, the teacher stepped behind the student and 
delivered a forceful two-hand backhand to the back of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus ended a budding career of a class clown. 
</P>
<P>
 That reminiscence comes to mind in light of the controversy over the imminent 
"caning" of an 18-year-old American in custody in Singapore. The young man went 
on a spray-painting jag and has been sentenced to a flogging. He will receive 
six blows from a moistened rattan cane. A news story said recipients often go 
into shock after the third stroke and are usually left with permanent scars. 
Previous stories have said there is very little graffiti in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard a lot of people taking guilty pleasure over the young man's fate. 
So frustrated is the American public over rampant crime that many people seem 
willing to consider just about anything. Caning? Hey, why not? 
</P>
<P>
 I asked a Juvenile Court judge about that, starting off with the presumption 
that, despite our government's formal request for leniency for the young man, 
lots of Americans might be silently applauding the Singapore justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does have a threshold attraction to us all," the judge said, who asked not 
to be identified. "We all are frustrated about graffiti and juvenile pranks and 
delinquency and all that goes with it. And we all know that we must have 
accountability in our system and that we feel it is just slipping away from us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess people have always felt that way but, legitimately, it's more that 
way now. So we find it attractive to have prompt meaningful punishment on 
people who spray graffiti or (do things like) pickpocket or shoplift." 
</P>
<P>
 I knew there was a "but" coming. "It has an initial attraction and I share 
that," the judge said, "and so does everyone else, I suspect. On the other 
hand, life just isn't that uncomplicated. I believe parents should have a right 
to spank their children, and I think most people think that. . . . But do you 
want other people to spank your child? And that gets into the problem of, when 
do you spank them? How often? How hard? With a belt or with a hairbrush?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for caning? "Effective? Well, probably," the judge said, "but it's the kind 
of thing that crosses the line. Our system of justice -- and you can go back to 
the common law as it developed from England -- recoils from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Constitutionally speaking, caning probably would be banned as "cruel and 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 I cited the corporal punishment that I remember from my school days. At that 
same junior high, teachers had a wooden paddle that was used on wayward 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have accountability," the judge said. "If you're going to school, 
what discipline tools do they have? Suspension? Everyone knows they (students) 
have to continue to go to school, so there isn't much teeth in that. And we're 
taking away the ability to discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he doesn't necessarily object, for example, to having a 
principal paddle or spank a child if a parent is present. Or, to bring a parent 
to school to administer the punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word caning offends me," the judge said. "That is excessive on every day 
of the week, but some form of switch or (corporal punishment) by hand, 
depending on how old the person is, I think is something we could explore. The 
problem is in keeping it from going to excess." 
</P>
<P>
 Caning probably has won plaudits in America because we can distance ourselves 
from it. Singapore officials can satisfy our primal instinct by meting out 
punishment, while allowing us to ease our consciences because we weren't the 
ones to administer it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept (of harsh punishment) is fine, but control is what causes the 
problem," the judge said. "The best government, practically speaking, would be 
a benevolent dictatorship. . . . The problem is to decide who's benevolent and 
who isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked the judge to forget propriety for a moment and consider whether caning 
would deter juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would deter the individual person -- if it hurt and if they knew 
they would have that hurt visited upon them again if they were to (repeat the 
offense). And to the degree their classmates find out about it and look at the 
bruises, it may well have a deterrent effect. That's the positive part, and the 
negative part is that it's over the line. I think most of Western society has 
made that same decision." 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably best that we not put caning up to a vote in America these days. 
I know at least one retired junior high math teacher who would heartily endorse 
it.

TELLURIDE TAKES JOYRIDE ON INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; COLORADO: THE OLD MINING 
TOWN MAY BE 130 MILES FROM THE NEAREST INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, SPONSORS SAY, BUT 
IT'S ON THE ROAD TO PROGRESS.

 When Jake Burns' friends leave town he keeps in touch by e-mail, and when he 
needs to do a school report on what's left of war-torn Yugoslavia, he contacts 
people there over the Internet computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school junior can do it all without calling long-distance because 
Telluride has "InfoZone." 
</P>
<P>
 "I e-mail other friends to see if I can find any cheap stockbrokers for 
friends here," said Burns, 17, who has had his own computer "since first or 
second grade" and has given up his supermarket job to run Telluride Ski Co.'s 
computer system on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit Telluride Institute oversees the 6-month-old "InfoZone" project 
linking computer users with Internet without having to call long-distance. 
</P>
<P>
 A sparsely populated resort town 130 miles from the nearest interstate 
highway, Telluride is an unlikely stop on the information superhighway. It is 
an old mining town with 1,500 year-round residents, surrounded by 13,000-foot 
peaks in the San Juan Mountains and 275 miles southwest of Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be a special little place, a society that matches the scenery," 
said Richard Lowenberg, the InfoZone chief at the Telluride Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides having access to Internet, computer buffs soon will be testing a 
wireless telephone system using newly deregulated communications frequencies to 
tap into information systems. It will help alleviate the shortage of telephone 
lines created by the town's growing faster than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, by the end of the year the local cable television system will be 
set up for interactive television, offering services ranging from entertainment 
choices to communications via cable lines. 
</P>
<P>
 InfoZone sponsors say few places are better suited to test new ideas -- 70% of 
the population have college degrees. The town has so many scientific 
conferences and art and music festivals that one weekend is devoted to a 
"Nothing Festival." Last year, an "Ideas Festival" was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Roy Romer was pushing for high-tech development on Colorado's Front Range 
corridor when Lowenberg and others persuaded him to consider Western Slope 
areas also. 
</P>
<P>
 A $20,000 state grant paid for establishment of a "node" on the Internet 
system last summer. The state is leasing a data line for residents so they can 
bypass commercial access systems that require long-distance calls and can cost 
$15 an hour or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computers Inc. donated computers that are stationed around the town in 
the library, museum, clinic and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a scheme for subsidizing the local nest of "Lone Eagles," 
telecommuters who took their jobs with them to the rural West. There are an 
estimated 10 million scattered throughout the nation's resorts, countryside and 
small communities, according to Denver's Center for the New West. They 
communicate with their home offices in the city by fax, personal computer and 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Peter Spencer, a computer programmer by profession, said people 
have been making a living here by modem and fax for a decade and do not need 
outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg, a former artist and planner who worked in California's Silicon 
Valley, said the project's goal is to empower this rural area by making 
information readily available. Some see that as a key in a community whose 
rapid growth has led some to call for a six-month moratorium on new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the same line, Greg Law, who is on the InfoZone board, has created an 
audio-text service that allows callers to get information on town affairs. That 
can include the upcoming town council agenda, faxed for free simply by phoning 
into an automated answering service. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg, who said the institute will monitor use of the new information 
system, said that ultimately multidimensional drawings of projects, such as the 
proposed expansion of Telluride ski area, could be delivered to residents' 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Rowath, a New York expert on network systems, said the Telluride project 
is "exciting because it means getting better participation in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowath helped set up the InfoZone after being drawn to Telluride by a 
conversation with Mary-Chapin Carpenter after a folk-music concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also opens the door for more interactive government. I don't know if 
everyone in government wants this or not because it arms people with more 
information," Rowath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in Syracuse," he said, "you can learn who died in a car wreck, but not 
how your senators voted."

'BAH, HUMBUG' GREETS STATUE DEPICTING PIONEER FAMILY; OREGON TRAIL: PORTLAND 
ARTS COMMISSION REJECTS BRONZE BY NATIONALLY KNOWN ARTIST THAT FEATURES RUGGED 
BIBLE-TOTING CHRISTIANS. PANEL TERMS IT CULTURALLY INSENSITIVE, POSSESSING 
LITTLE ARTISTIC MERIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The manifest destiny of a statue depicting a rugged pioneer family has created 
quite a dust-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon Trail Coordinating Council commissioned the $200,000 statue "The 
Promised Land" by nationally known artist David Manuel, and offered to donate 
it to the city. Manuel's sculptures honoring the U.S. Marshal's Service are 
displayed at the Justice Department and the White House in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He found no such appreciation of his work among members of Portland's arts 
commission, which said the bronze statue featuring a Bible-toting Christian 
family to be culturally insensitive and of little artistic merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The depiction of the subject matter was found to be an inappropriate and 
inaccurate representation of the settlers of Oregon, excluding the many other 
races and religions," the arts commission said. "It is also insensitive to the 
history of the indigenous people of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the trail council, created by Gov. Barbara Roberts, can't figure 
out what all the fuss is about. They say their mission was to commemorate 
pioneer families who arrived on the Oregon Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set out to do a memorial to the pioneers of 1843 . . . and that's what we 
have, pioneers that made it in 1843," said Joyce White, the council's 
development director. "It was never intended to represent Native Americans that 
lived here, or blacks that lived here or the British or any of the other folks 
that were living here." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the council has projects in the works devoted to other cultures, 
including a center that tells the trail story from the Indian perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 City worker Art Alexander demurred, telling the arts commission the statue 
represents a "whitewash of the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 "A more appropriate statue might be titled 'Receivers of Stolen Property' and 
would depict laughing European-American men standing on Native American corpses 
with pieces of torn up treaties scattered about," and carrying a sign warning 
that no blacks were allowed, he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, painter Bob Hanson of the Portland arts advisory committee assailed 
the statue's workmanship, saying the hands on Manuel's statue "look like a 
bunch of crabs." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel understands some of the concerns and said he would like to have 
represented other cultures in the statue, but was prevented by time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the belittling remarks about the work itself he can't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to understand that another artist would bombard me," Manuel 
said. "My work speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Other northwestern cities -- as well as Independence, Mo., where the Oregon 
Trail begins -- have offered to provide a home for the statue. But White said 
her group probably will appeal to the City Council to keep it in Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Manuel said he has been inundated with calls of support, which has 
made the criticism bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothered me a little bit but, hey, a few people have their different ideas 
about things," he said. "You can't please everyone."

and the 18 or so children enrolled in day care there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're at the opposite ends of life and feel most the effects of neglect," 
Klingeman said. "Who has time these days to take care of the old ones and the 
young ones? The old ones need to love somebody, and the young ones need to be 
loved. They just fit together hand in hand, like a ball and a glove." 
</P>
<P>
 Programs like Klingeman's Country Care in Othello in rural eastern Washington 
are popping up around the country as people realize that the needs of the old 
and young are very similar, said Donna Couper, executive director of Center for 
Understanding Aging. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is a nonprofit organization based in Southington, Conn., that 
promotes intergenerational programs and specializes in promoting education on 
aging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a society that is increasingly alienated," Couper said. "I see 
this kind of movement as a way to promote human connections. When we don't have 
it within our own families, we have institutions that try to come in with 
substitute connections." 
</P>
<P>
 Both children and the elderly can help each other stay in tune, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a younger person, it gives you an understanding that there is life 
after 16 or 21," Couper said. "For older people, it's helping them stay 
connected when, because of rapid changes around them, they may feel they aren't 
as relevant. With all the trends, fads and changing technologies, you can 
easily feel out of touch." 
</P>
<P>
 John D'Amour, who is responsible for granting licenses to adult family homes 
for the north-central Washington Department of Social and Health Services, said 
state officials are pleased with Klingeman's program. 
</P>
<P>
 "She really felt the old people and the young people should be integrated, and 
all the studies seem to show that's a valid rationale," D'Amour said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was unaware of any similar facilities in Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty unusual to have it set up like that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingeman, a licensed practical nurse, said she feared working with the 
elderly as a student nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I literally begged them not to make me do an internship in a nursing home," 
Klingeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she learned that working with the elderly could be rewarding and continued 
doing it. Adams County Counseling Services hired her 18 years ago to develop a 
geriatrics program at a convalescent center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every week, I took a group of kids to see them," Klingeman said. "We'd sing 
and play, and they loved it. We did the same thing every week, and it was like 
it was brand new each time. I found out that kids, balloons and pets were the 
key." 
</P>
<P>
 When she opened her day-care center five years later, she continued to make 
weekly treks to the nursing home. She also began to take care of her ailing 
grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Her grandmother ultimately became too sick and went to live in a nursing home. 
But the experience gave Klingeman the insight and the desire to start her 
multigenerational care facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The children and the older residents have separate buildings, connected by a 
breezeway. The children aren't allowed to visit the adult side without 
permission and supervision by a day-care staffer, and then never more than 
eight at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 A musical kindergarten is held twice a week, where both the children and the 
adults sing and play games. That program and the daily arts and crafts are 
optional for the adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some days, one of the ladies might not feel like participating. But usually 
they love it," Klingeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main ingredient here is it's not just the kids," Klingeman said. "I want 
to have quality on both sides. The children aren't allowed in the elderly's 
space. They are not allowed to just invade their (the elderly's) home." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, six of the children came to visit, each running to give 
a "grandma" a hug. It didn't matter that two of the women there were visitors 
who had never met the children; they got hugs too. 
</P>
<P>
 They sang songs like "Jesus Loves Me" and silly songs accompanied by hand 
motions that made old and young alike giggle. They played "London Bridge," and 
"Bluebird" -- in which a child wove under the clasped hands of the others in a 
circle until the song ended, at which time the child would choose another to be 
the bluebird. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 20 minutes, the children went back to their area and the elderly 
women stayed in their chairs, smiling and chatting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all revolves," Klingeman said. "The elderly person's behavior goes back to 
a 2-year-old. A 92-year-old and a 2-year-old are at the same point, they want 
essentially the same things: care, love and someone to pay attention to them."

JAPAN'S FAST BREEDER REACTOR TO REACH CRITICAL STATE TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nuclear reaction will reach a self-sustaining level next Tuesday in Japan's 
controversial "fast-breeder" nuclear reactor, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fast-breeder reactor uses highly toxic plutonium as a base substance to 
generate electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industrialized nations have dropped plans for fast-breeders because of 
the hazards associated with plutonium, leaving Japan as the only country 
actively pursuing the technology as an energy source. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, located in Tsuruga, 200 miles west of Tokyo, is named Monju, after 
the Buddhist deity of wisdom, and has a capacity of 280 megawatts. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of anti-nuclear activists on Tuesday submitted a petition demanding 
closure of the reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials lauded the start-up of the $5.9-billion Monju as a great benefit 
to an energy-dependent nation.

POINTING OUT FLAWS OF STUDENT TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I too am a teacher caught up in the CLAS assessment controversy and feel 
compelled to write after reading (Kelly) Gallagher's letter (Letters, March 
27). Gallagher's response to (Karen) Eddy's letter carries a condescending tone 
that is demeaning to our profession. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher holds the opinion that the CTBS test is inadequate, shallow and an 
unauthentic way to measure thinking. However, the CTBS is not intended to 
measure thinking in itself, but knowledge, knowledge that has already become a 
part of the cognitive thinking process. Trying to measure thinking is costly, 
subjective and extremely time consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 For scientific purposes and whether we like it or not, a non-subjective test 
is the only tool we now have that measures each child non-subjectively. 
</P>
<P>
 In regard to special education, it has been my experience that the largest 
number of special education students in the regular classroom are students with 
a learning disability, whether the cause be emotional, genetic or a 
neurological dysfunction. This disability generally interferes with the ability 
to read and write, thereby causing lower test scores. As far as the CLAS test 
setting a higher standard for our students, is this test the only way to raise 
standards? Could standards be raised in our schools by having smaller class 
size, by having enough textbooks for every student and providing more intensive 
instructions in English for those students who need it? It has also been my 
experience that teachers are already constantly working toward upgrading their 
teaching skills. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know a single teacher who is motivated to teach "better" because of 
the promise of published test scores. However, I do know that teachers are 
motivated to give their all, teach their best, and expect the most from their 
students. Our inspiration comes from the faces we see daily, not any test. We 
teach for a better tomorrow, not for one subjective test today. 
</P>
<P>
 LAURA GORE 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Although there are many points Kelly Gallagher makes about the CLAS test 
with which I agree, there are many points of weakness she omits. I agree that 
the test and the content is superior and does drive the curriculum in a 
positive way, however, the test itself is a logistical nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not sure what the test will be in our current school year, so all the 
problems pointed out in this letter are based on last year's experience. 
</P>
<P>
 1. The CTBS (California Test of Basic Skills) gave the individual student a 
result on his/her achievement the CLAS test did not. It was to measure how well 
the school is doing. Since I refuse to lie to my students about that fact, the 
student is not as motivated to do his/her best, particularly if the student has 
little emotional investment in the school she/he attends. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Only a random selection of tests were evaluated. The test ranks results 
from a 1 to a 6. As teachers, we know that about 1% of our students are capable 
of writing a 6 paper, however in a random selection, the chance of missing that 
1% is extremely high. The random represented less than 50% of our student 
responses. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The test is very expensive to administer. It is more than our state can 
currently afford, and yet the individuals scoring the tests are paid a woefully 
inadequate sum. I worry about the credibility of these folks, particularly 
since each test is evaluated by only one person. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of checks and balances puts every test at risk in not being properly 
evaluated.

PATIENCE WILL PAY OFF IN THE LONG RUN; * LAGUNANS ARE UNDERSTANDABLY IMPATIENT 
TO REBUILD, BUT THE CITY'S CAUTION IS WISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of fire-damaged neighborhoods of Laguna Beach have had little to 
cheer about. One thing that did give them encouragement was the city's pledge 
to make rebuilding as painless as possible by expediting the process of 
approving building permits. The city had even talked about waiving for fire 
victims the requirement that hillside residents obtain second opinions from 
city-hired geologists before getting permits. 
</P>
<P>
 But then last month the rebuilding effort was threatened by the disclosure 
that geologists had discovered what they thought might be an ancient landslide 
under 50 or so lots in the Mystic Hills area. And with that disclosure came the 
news that it could take up to a year to stabilize the area before some of the 
lost homes could be rebuilt. As happens in geologically sensitive areas of 
Southern California, the scenic appeal of the setting as a place to live came 
with a qualifier. It was the dicey nature of a landscape that lives by its own 
rhythms over geological time. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been politically expedient to respond to the demands of the 
moment on behalf of those who have suffered greatly by simply overlooking the 
new concerns about the safety of the land. The city, to its great credit, did 
not do that. After being told by the experts that the hillsides must be 
stabilized, the City Council voted 4 to 0 on March 22 to spend $35,000 on 
further geologic study to determine whether the ancient landslide actually 
existed. They made this decision in the face of considerable pressure from 150 
frustrated residents who packed the chambers to urge the city to let them go 
ahead with rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 There may of course be a measure of self-protection in the council's action. 
City Manager Kenneth C. Frank correctly pointed out that the city has faced 
landslide-related litigation in the past, and that it needed to guard the 
city's financial interests against potential liability. The testing could delay 
by eight to 10 months some of the permits, but the city's caution is wise. It 
may be, as Frank has suggested, that it will be necessary to create a special 
assessment district to pay for retrofitting on an entire section of hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 For a city used to coping with disaster, the threat of new trouble must be 
taken seriously. Those who have chosen to live on the slippery slope of 
paradise need to accept that reasonable delays may be part of the price. Any 
delay in getting the hoped-for rebuilding accomplished would quickly be 
forgotten if prudent measures are taken now to avoid possible disaster later.

TRAINS WELCOME BUT SUCCESS NO CERTAINTY; * METROLINK EXPANSION GIVES COMMUTERS 
NEW OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sentiment of traffic-weary Orange County residents was evident back in 
1992 when a UC Irvine survey found that people had warmed significantly to the 
idea of mass transit. A whopping 69% of those surveyed said they favored a 
commuter rail system. 
</P>
<P>
 While that survey was being taken, plans were underway to expand commuter rail 
service in Orange County. The morning and evening train operated by Amtrak 
crews under contract with the Orange County Transportation Authority already 
was operating as a supplement to regular Amtrak service, which is designed 
primarily as an intercity service but also happened to serve commuters. And 
now, last week, a new milestone: two more commuter trains were added to the 
existing one to inaugurate Metrolink service in Orange County. Metrolink is the 
commuter rail network that is serving an expanding part of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of the moment is: Will it take? The jury for now will have to 
remain out. The new service certainly is welcome and encouraging, but there 
should be no illusions about the hard task facing those wishing to make rail 
commuting an important fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Grafting commuter rail on a region that developed around the automobile is no 
easy task. The evidence from the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake was not 
encouraging in this regard; commuters rushed to ride Metrolink trains after the 
quake damaged freeways but very soon began returning to cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public in Orange County certainly seems interested in the idea of rail 
commuting, and well it should. The county has the dubious distinction of having 
about the worst traffic congestion in California. This month, another poll 
conducted by J. Moore Methods of Sacramento for the Orange County 
Transportation Authority found that Orange County voters favored even further 
development in commuter rail: the proposed Fullerton to Irvine line that would 
include stops near Disneyland in Anaheim and South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the big question marks about the viability of commuter rail service 
is money. And the strong public support in that survey fell back to about 50% 
when cold fiscal reality set in. That is, a mention of the anticipated 
$2.1-billion cost of such a line, a signal of lingering fiscal questions. 
Indeed, there have been persistent concerns raised by critics that passenger 
service won't ever make up the subsidies now needed to keep it running. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the inaugural Metrolink trains in Orange County, transportation 
officials were hoping eventually for more business people who might make up the 
backbone of a regular ridership as several thousands of commuters and other 
riders rode the rails on the first day. The presence of more trains can provide 
such commuters with an extra cushion and ease fears that they will be late to 
work, or out of luck, if they miss an earlier train. Metrolink officials were 
wise to offer free service through most of the week and might want to consider 
other enticements. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there is much work to do and many unanswered questions, but the 
hoopla of last week was clearly justified. The arrival of Metrolink ought to be 
an important moment in the annals of transportation history in Orange County.

GIFT GIVERS CULPABLE AS WATER OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you, William Mitchell, for your right-on article, "Gift Giving Is at 
the Root of Water District Scandal" (March 28). You made my morning. 
</P>
<P>
 This same theme caused me to compose a letter to The Times last week. I didn't 
mail it, however, because who would care? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rancho Santa Margarita Water District case clearly shows the lack of moral 
fiber that exists in our local communities today. The gift-givers are every bit 
as culpable as those public officials who accept their favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake up, people! Get mad and let your officials know that, in the future, 
companies such as Robert Bein, William Frost & Associates and 
MacDonald-Stephens Engineering will be held legally liable for their actions 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 SALLY TWOMBLY 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 * William Mitchell's "Gift Giving Is at the Root of Water District Scandal" 
begins to illuminate the contradictory message of the Santa Margarita Water 
District scandal: take gifts which exceed levels stipulated by state statute 
and you may lose your job and wind up indicted by the district attorney; give 
gifts which exceed levels stipulated by state statute and it's thought to be 
business as usual for companies seeking contracts from the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly it makes neither ethical nor legal sense that the firms -- Robert 
Bein, William Frost & Associates of Irvine and MacDonald-Stephens Engineering 
of Mission Viejo -- which gave so generously to public officials at the water 
district -- bear no responsibility for the alleged criminal misconduct which 
transpired. Yes, "those who lavish gifts on public officials," especially gifts 
in excess of state statutory limits, should be held legally accountable for 
their actions. Mitchell proposes a gift-ban ordinance as the remedy. But 
there's no reason to wait for passage of an ordinance. There are a number of 
obvious ways to hold excessive gift-givers accountable under state statutes and 
the common law for contributing to criminal misconduct by public officials.Even 
the toothless Political Reform Act of 1974 establishes a variety of 
prohibitions against gift giving by lobbyists. If RBF executives actively 
lobbied water district officials for engineering contracts, why aren't they 
considered lobbyists subject to restrictions imposed by government code? 
</P>
<P>
 Given these available remedies I'm left to wonder why the district attorney's 
office doesn't appear to be interested in investigating and possibly 
prosecuting those firms who may have knowingly tempted Santa Margarita Water 
District officials to violate state conflict-of-interest laws.

LAGUNA NEEDS POLICE EXPLORER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are all aware that our Laguna Beach Police Department is understaffed. So 
I was particularly appalled to hear that (Councilman) Bob Gentry, with the 
support of (Councilwoman) Ann Christoph, has decided to try to get rid of the 
police Explorer program in Laguna Beach at the City Council meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The police Explorers is a program in which young people, up to age 21, assist 
our Police Department providing volunteer service to help keep our city safe. 
They helped evacuate Laguna during the fire. They learn firsthand about public 
safety, public administration and what it takes to keep our streets safe. 
</P>
<P>
 This program is good for Laguna Beach and for the young people in our 
community who volunteer an incredible number of hours of service. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gentry and Christoph have a problem with this because the police 
Explorers are associated with the Boy Scouts of America, and the Boy Scouts of 
America are opposed to having gay troop leaders in charge of young and 
impressionable Scouts. I'd say Gentry is obviously trying to impose his 
personal preference on the citizens of Laguna Beach again, and at the expense 
of our public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Call your council representative and let him or her know what you think about 
this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, attend the council meeting on Tuesday and support the police 
Explorer program.

METROLINK FARE TOO HIGH FOR RAIL FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * About 20 years ago I moved to Southern California from Boston. Before that I 
had lived in New York. Everywhere I lived in the Northeast, I used public 
transportation. I really missed it when I came here because the bus system was 
not well organized. 
</P>
<P>
 So you can imagine my elation when I opened my paper last weekend to read 
about the new Metrolink train service. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in San Juan Capistrano and working at the Irvine Spectrum in Irvine, I 
figured I could finally go back to mass transit with some assurance that it 
would work for me on a regular basis, five days a week. What the heck, a 
10-mile ride from one station to the next should be a piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
 But they stopped me in my tracks with their pricing. At $80 a month (or $20 a 
week), it's cost-effective. Since I spend about $16 to $18 a week on gas, this 
would be very competitive with my auto commute. But, they've made it a trip of 
two "zones" to get to work. So even though it's only about 10 miles from one 
stop to the next, OCTA wants me to pay $112 a month, not $80. I can't do it at 
that price. At $28 a week, it's not as competitive. Especially when someone can 
go from Anaheim to Burbank, more than four times the distance, through five 
stations and through three "zones," for only $32 more a month (or $36 a week). 
Somehow that doesn't seem right to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know who priced the Metrolink service, but when I can't go from one 
station to the very next one without getting nailed for a big fare jump, then 
I'm not going to get out of my car and use the trains. Simple as that.

RAMS' LATEST PLAY SENDS A CLEAR SIGNAL; * DURING TALKS OVER PRACTICE FIELD, 
TEAM APPEARED TO BE NEGOTIATING ITS DEPARTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It can never be very good news when a landlord and tenant cannot come to 
agreement, but when the former is the city of Anaheim and the Magnolia School 
District and the latter is the Los Angeles Rams, the prognosis in the current 
environment is downright unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have already said that they will exercise an escape clause in their 
Anaheim Stadium lease on May 3, and against that backdrop, negotiations 
collapsed over the lease for their practice field at Rams Park. It was the 
clearest signal to date that the Rams may be history in Orange County before 
too much longer. It is sad to contemplate the very real possibility that the 
team may really move to "greener pastures." The Rams uttered perfunctory 
laments about looming eviction, but it really is hard to find too much fault 
with the city and the school district for their efforts to conclude an 
agreeable long-term lease arrangement at the team's longtime headquarters, the 
former Juliette Low School. 
</P>
<P>
 More to the point, when you examine what went wrong with the discussions, it's 
pretty clear that the issue turned on what it was the team would have to pay if 
it left. If it intended to stay, departure wouldn't have been so serious an 
obstacle to concluding the deal for the practice site. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, in the dispute over who would pay how much for restoring the facility 
as a school lay the hard reality that the team was in fact negotiating its 
departure. It was a bit like a prenuptial agreement where the divorce is 
negotiated before the marriage, and in this case the divorce is such a real 
possibility that it casts a shadow over the wedding cake. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the Rams still are committed to the area for at least the next 
season, and there's little doubt that they will have a number of agreeable 
short-term options at local sites. But the message from the Rams Park debate is 
that, beyond that, don't hold your breath.

PUTTING MURAL UP FOR SALE 'IMMORAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is to express profound disappointment that the San Clemente mural, at 
the historical site corner of Avenida del Mar and El Camino Real, is for 
sale.Not only were the artists never given recognition, that mural was donated 
by Studio Sylvain (and Sylvain), its creator, to the city of San Clemente for 
all of its residents to enjoy through public viewing. The city turned it down 
on the basis that they had "no place to store it." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone should benefit financially, it should be Studio Sylvain. But, it was 
not done for this reason. 
</P>
<P>
 We would rather see it destroyed than to have it used for this blatantly 
immoral purpose.

IN DEFENSE OF HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Professor Paul J. Feldstein, Ph.D., in his Commentary on Business 
("Clinton's Health Care Plan Threatens the County's Recovery," March 27), has 
it all wrong on what he calls unfairness of the employer mandate in the Clinton 
health-care plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Either the small employer pays for his employees' health care or he pays wages 
high enough that the employees can purchase their own.Any other way simply 
transfers the cost to someone else, the unfairest plan of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question to be asked is whether it is the employer or employee who 
has the best chance of holding costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Dr. Feldstein agrees, the small employer needs help to stay in 
business, we should face it as it is, a subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 Give the small business owner a tax break or some other assistance, but let's 
not burden the health-care plan with this unfair cost.

TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THE TOLL OF HANDGUNS, TOURISM IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: Japanese student carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 I read with astonishment your front page quotation from the president of the 
Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau (a.k.a. the Outrich Society): 
"We have to emphasize how safe Orange County is, and we have figures to back it 
up," ("Another PR Nightmare for O.C.'s Tourist Trade," March 30). 
</P>
<P>
 What figures could they be: that our per capita murder rate is lower than 
L.A.'s? That there are actually several million people still alive? 
</P>
<P>
 Give me a break. For example, I could have sworn Santa Ana was in Orange 
County; that quaint, charming village next to Disneyland, where so far in 1994 
there have been almost as many street murders as all of Japan has in a year -- 
and Japan has more than 150 times the population of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of the Japanese students in San Pedro is just one of several 
similar stories in our area this week, but it gets much added attention because 
of the international implications to the sacred tourist dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourist and convention bureaus are wasting time trying to prove this 
county is "safer" than L.A. They should focus on the real problem: "It's the 
guns, stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, who otherwise seem rational, somehow cannot grasp a simple fact: 
Countries that have strict gun control have very few murders, while countries 
that allow free access to guns have a lot of murders. 
</P>
<P>
 When we finally rise up and demand national banishment of handguns and 
ammunition, the murder stories will diminish. Considering our legalistic 
mentality, this will not be easy, but life itself is getting less easy and more 
precarious, simply because we have failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we do, I would advise our Japanese friends to stay away; compared to 
their own and many other countries, this is a war zone.

 * I see that Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez is pushing for a "summit" to discuss 
ways to increase tourism in Orange County ("County Will Hold Summit on 
Tourism," March 23). 
</P>
<P>
 He and his cohorts claim it will pump millions of dollars into the Orange 
County economy. Perhaps it will -- into the pockets of hotel, restaurant and 
amusement owners -- most of whom don't even live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Any employment resulting from an increase in tourism is at the very lowest end 
of the pay scale: hotel maids, waitresses, busboys, teen-agers who work at 
amusement parks. They all get minimum wages, or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Result? More demand for illegal (immigrants) who will work for these wages, 
then send most of their pay back to Mexico, where it helps to sell our trade 
imbalance. And, with the increase in illegal (immigrants), we also get an 
increase in welfare costs of all kinds: Medi-Cal, police, fire, schools and 
direct welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this is what Vasquez wants. But, it's not good for Orange County. 
"Tourism" simply multiplies the problem that's already strangling Orange 
County. Let's make Orange County an attractive place for employers who are 
willing to pay decent wages and offer employment to the thousands of highly 
skilled Orange Countians who have lost their jobs due to defense cutbacks, 
downsizing, the recession and relocation of companies to a more favorable area.

TRUSTEES COMPLIED WITH MEETING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to your editorial, "A Vote for Darkness" (March 24): The first 
rule of elected officials should be to conduct the public business in public. 
Also, it does appear that legislative bodies of public agencies do too often 
use excuses to meet behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 To attempt to link these statements to the Santa Ana Unified School District 
trustees' action to censure one of its own reflects a lack of understanding of 
the issue in question and confused knowledge of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was the procedure utilized to release confidential documents and not 
what price was offered or paid for school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 State law (the Brown Act) does allow closed-door meetings not only for 
personnel and litigation matters but also for real property purchases or sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisals and attorney-client privileged communications related to directions 
given to negotiate the sale or purchase of property are proper closed-session 
discussion. It's obvious that if this process takes place in public, it tips 
the school districts' hand to prospective sellers or purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the issue as to whether the school board was going to pay too much was of 
substantial interest to the public. But state law requires the State Allocation 
Board to thoroughly review any school district's purchase of real property. 
</P>
<P>
 This procedure protects and ensures the public's interest in not paying an 
unreasonable price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brown Act authorizes the release of confidential documents concerning 
proper closed-session matters only by a majority vote of the school board or by 
court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed, the job of elected officials is not to keep the taxpayers in the dark; 
it is to explain and enlighten. But it is also to comply with the law and set 
an example of such, especially when they guide the education of our children. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why a board member was censured. Since there are valid ways to obtain 
the property's purchase price and inform the public, the end did not justify 
the means.

LEAGUE OF CITIES INEFFECTUAL FOR GARDEN GROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to respond to the article on the League of California Cities 
("Gaining Political Clout in Numbers," March 18). 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove's decision to withdraw from the League of California Cities was 
long overdue. The $27,000-plus it costs the citizens of Garden Grove to belong 
to this organization every year can be spent much more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three years, the state of California has taken away more than $700 
million in revenue from its cities to help finance the state government's 
deficit. According to Rhonda McCune (president of the Orange County division of 
the League of California Cities), this amount could have been substantially 
higher. I disagree. I believe it could have and should have been much less. If 
the league's lobbying services had been more effective, it would have been. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's lobbying endeavor has the reputation in Sacramento of being very 
fragmented in direction and less than adequate in effort. Some believe that it 
is because of the league's inability to stand up to the state that we have 
$4.35 million less in Garden Grove's treasury than we should have. 
</P>
<P>
 One of our city councilmen authored a resolution that the league support an 
initiative to keep the state from making its annual raid on cities' coffers. 
This resolution was not met with much support and eventually died in one of the 
league's many committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana authored a resolution and presented it to the league asking them to 
request that the state Legislature pass legislation that would limit the number 
of individuals who could reside in one dwelling. This is an important issue for 
cities in Orange County. The League of California Cities has traditionally 
opposed this type of legislation and only recently began to lend any help. 
</P>
<P>
 My personal pet peeve with the league is that the cities pay dues on a per 
capita basis yet vote on an equal basis. This makes the vote of a citizen of 
Garden Grove worth about one-fifth the value of the vote of a citizen of Los 
Alamitos or La Palma. When we addressed this issue to the league, they sent us 
a letter simply saying they had no desire to change the bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now there is a battle royal building over the disposition of the El Toro 
Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of California Cities should be involved in this matter up to its 
ears; but, of course, it's too controversial for the league to get involved 
with. Maybe the city of Garden Grove should apply for membership in the Lincoln 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't leave for any one reason, but for all of the reasons mentioned. 
However, I do believe the straw that broke the camel's back was the league 
passing up an opportunity to reform the job-killing AQMD by replacing our 
member on the board with a pro-business, pro-jobs representative. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that the league has consistently continued to fail us. It may be a 
very good deal for the very small cities, but they are financing this good deal 
on the backs of the citizens of the larger cities.

<P>
 It ill becomes anyone, particularly a public official -- no matter how 
egregious her personal hurt -- to suggest denial to people of their 
constitutional rights by means of intimidation of their legitimate legal 
counsel.

 Such strikes me as being more like lynch-mob psychology than American justice.

CHAMPIONING CASE AGAINST TOBACCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Public interest in the issue of tobacco smoking was best summed up by a 
student who recently said, "I would think the people who don't smoke probably 
don't care, and people who do smoke don't want to be told to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) were so outraged that they acted together 
to significantly reduce the number of deaths on the highways.Yet who is mad 
enough to stop the No. 1 preventable cause of death today? 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco kills more people than all deaths due to drunk drivers, violent 
crimes, AIDS and illegal drugs combined! 
</P>
<P>
 Close to half a million people die horrible deaths each year due to 
tobacco-related disease. It would also appear that these "children of all ages" 
must die alone and without a friend or loved one to mourn their unnecessary 
death. Half a million people die and no one to wear a ribbon of any color. More 
than passive smoke, passive people will be the death of us all.

A PRUDENTIAL FUNDS CUSTOMER'S STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your "The Revolving Door" (March 13) is a real statement of truth. I am an 
80-year-old retiree. I went to Prudential with the explicit instructions to 
invest our funds in "low risk investments that pay monthly interest."Their 
officials recommended to their sales people -- these partnerships are "safe." 
They have paid off these investments at a 45% loss. They then sent a "claim 
form" for final settlement to be paid in 90 days. How low can these former 
government attorneys get to take money from Prudential to negotiate a 
"settlement" with the customers they cheated out of their funds? I fail to find 
the language to express my thoughts that you could print in the paper.

CLINTON'S IMPERIALISM HURTS U.S.-JAPAN TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By focusing on the U.S. trade deficit with the Japanese, the Business section 
article addressing a confrontation with Japan over trade barriers ("Collision 
Course -- Confrontation Looms as Japan Persists With Trade Barriers," Feb. 27) 
runs the risk of framing the discussion in an emotional manner, thus perhaps 
jeopardizing proper analysis of the problem. And, as usual, when the problem is 
misdiagnosed, the solution is invariably the wrong one. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue should be one of increasing trade, regardless of deficits. The 
Japanese already purchase more American goods per capita than per-capita 
American purchases of Japanese goods. The chart labeled "A Swelling Deficit" 
that accompanied the article merely reflects a recovering U.S. economy 
purchasing increasing amounts of Japanese goods at the same time Japan suffers 
through a recession where all consumer purchases have slowed greatly. 
</P>
<P>
 This is further complicated by a presentation that appears to show imports and 
exports but really shows the "net flow" of import-export transactions. 
Interestingly, of the 15 categories listed, imposing quotas or price sanctions 
will almost certainly punish those American consumers least able to afford it, 
or will punish the service sector with higher costs in an effort to assist the 
much smaller manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Clinton Administration, in recruiting this emotional response from 
Congress and the public, has behaved very much like the Republican bullies of 
the '50s, '60s and early '70s they tell us they despise. They have insisted 
that the Japanese cut taxes -- if that is such a good idea, why don't we do it 
here? -- and have threatened all types of escalating trade sanctions. In short, 
the response is imperialistic. Like the spoiled baby boomers they are, they 
demand their Maypo "now!" 
</P>
<P>
 Our approach should ignore the deficit and focus on increasing trade in both 
directions. The current trend between the two countries, the political factors 
at work in Japan and the world markets are all operating in our favor. Saber 
rattling is posturing. This is typical of the Clinton Administration's view 
that all matters are one of perception and public relations rather than 
substance. It does not bode well for either trade or national security 
relations with Japan.

 DIFFERENT SUNRISE: The county's churches will be filled today with Easter 
worshipers. But you don't have to go to church for a solemn observance. For 33 
years, thousands have gone to the Forest Lawn Memorial-Park sunrise service on 
Lincoln Avenue in Cypress. . . . "We get a lot of people who don't attend a 
church regularly, but need a place to go because this day is special for them 
too," says cemetery spokesman the Rev. Ron Beams. Today's outdoor service 
begins at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 FREEBIE BASEBALL: The California Angels start their 1994 season on the road 
Tuesday in Minnesota, so you'll have to wait until April 11 to see them at 
Anaheim Stadium. As always, some days may be better for going to the ballpark 
than others. The Angels have special events planned for 25 home games. . . . 
Among the giveaways this year: umbrellas, kids' helmets, sports bags and bike 
bags. The first one is April 17, the Toronto game, with magnetic calendars for 
the first 35,000 fans only.

neighbors' complaints about loud concerts at the Pacific Amphitheatre. The fair 
board took it over last year in attempt to keep things under control. Now 
Bailey-Findley is promoting the 8,500-seat outdoor concert facility's 
availability for rental. "We're looking for groups compatible with the 
neighborhood," she says. . . . Examples: upcoming graduation exercises and a 
police drug program. The standard rental rate is 10% of the gross ticket sales 
with a $7,500 minimum. But Bailey-Findley says her office will work something 
out with nonprofit groups.

CELEBRATIONS FROM THE SOLEMN TO THE CONTEMPORARY, COMPLETE WITH MULTIMEDIA, AS 
ONE IRVINE CHURCH OFFERS.

 The Rev. Graydon Jessup wants this Easter to be "user-friendly." That's why 
the pastor of Eastside Christian Church in Fullerton says he's not going to 
pelt his churchgoers with heavy biblical pronouncements or make them sit in a 
cold sanctuary for hours on end today.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to belt them over the head with 'Thus said the Lord,' " 
Jessup said, "but present the Resurrection in an appealing way." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessup's services, the first ever to be held at Cal State Fullerton's football 
stadium, are just one of the dozens of diverse Easter celebrations to be held 
throughout Orange County today. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will attend services from the very solemn to the completely 
contemporary, all in celebration of the holiest day of the Christian calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 At South Coast Community Church in Irvine, churchgoers can expect to worship 
accompanied by the blasts of trumpets and trombones and the sounds of drums and 
guitars, church officials said. Pastor Bob Shank will speak about the meaning 
of Easter to his nondenominational church of more than 2,000 people, at 
services at 9 and 10:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Multimedia is the church's specialty: attendees will watch actors live, 
onstage, interacting with a taped video shown on a large screen as if it were a 
news broadcast, said Lisa Schmidt, who works with the program. "It's not what 
you would expect on Easter Sunday in a church," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Immaculate Heart of Mary Church in Santa Ana, today's services will 
climax a week of often solemn contemplation. To accommodate its thousands of 
parishioners, the church will offer English masses at 6:45 and 10 a.m. and 
Spanish-language masses at 8 and 11:30 a.m. and 1, 5:30 and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 At Immaculate Heart, Holy Week, the week preceding Easter, includes picking up 
blessed palm fronds on Palm Sunday, watching live passion plays on Good Friday, 
and holding Easter Vigil on Saturday to await celebration of Christ's 
Resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Enrique Serra said he will tie the week's events together in his 
sermon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be talking about journeys," said Serra, originally from Cuba. 
"Since most of those in our congregation are immigrants, we'll talk about a 
journey to salvation and how the journey has hardships, but a final 
destination." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic bishop of Orange, the Rev. Norman F. McFarland, will 
celebrate Mass at the Holy Family Cathedral in Orange at 11 a.m., culminating a 
busy week for the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 Today is also the last day of celebration for two county congregations which 
are commemorating the Easter holiday together: Calvary Chapel churches in Costa 
Mesa and Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Chuck Smith Sr. of the Costa Mesa church will lead his congregation to 
the accompaniment of several choirs at a 6 a.m. service held in the open air at 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. His son, Capistrano Beach church Pastor Chuck 
Smith Jr., will lead a 9:30 a.m. service that will also feature Christian 
singers, music and "Scratch," a lion-suited church mascot popular with 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional daybreak services in outdoor settings are also planned by various 
nondenominational churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariner's Church will hold its sunrise service at the Newport Dunes waterfront 
resort and marina in Newport Beach at 6 a.m. And at Cal State Fullerton's 
football field, Graydon Jessup will be waiting for parishioners at 6:29 and 
9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessup hopes people remember to set their clocks ahead for Daylight Saving 
Time, in time for today's services. "If people come by at 10:30 instead of 
9:30," Jessup said, "they'll be out of luck."

CAFE SHOOTING KILLS MAN IN WESTMINSTER; VIOLENCE: ANOTHER MAN IS WOUNDED THERE 
BY AN OFF-DUTY SECURITY GUARD. POLICE PLAN STEPPED-UP PATROLS IN LITTLE SAIGON 
TO STEM LATE-NIGHT ATTACKS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the second fatal shooting inside a cafe here in six days, one man was 
killed and another was injured when an off-duty security guard drew a handgun 
and fired four shots in self-defense as he was attacked with a tire iron, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year-old security guard surrendered to police shortly after the 3 a.m. 
shooting in Little Saigon, which occurred at the Pho Tien Canh Restaurant at 
9631 Bolsa Avenue. "He was having coffee, and another group of people who 
apparently knew him were there," Lt. Rick Main said. "When he tried to leave, 
they wouldn't let him leave. He said they attacked him and he felt fearful for 
his life." 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, a resident of Los Angeles County, was not arrested and is 
not expected to face criminal charges, Main said. The man turned over a 
large-caliber handgun used in the shooting to police. Investigators were 
withholding the guard's name for his own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the cafe was crowded with people at the time of the shooting and 
that many witnesses corroborated the guard's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at the restaurant, there was evidence of a shooting, but 
the guard and other participants disappeared. Within 10 minutes, two area 
hospitals reported to police that gunshot victims had been brought to their 
emergency rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinh Van Chu, 37, of Garden Grove died from his injuries shortly after being 
taken to Coastal Communities Hospital in Santa Ana. Tu Tran, 21, of Garden 
Grove was in stable condition Saturday at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Tran could be charged with murder, Main said. Under the 
felony-murder rule, a suspect can be charged with murder when someone is killed 
during the commission of certain felonies, even if they did not fire the fatal 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard, fearing for his safety, had fled the cafe, but called police about 
20 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard had been employed at a nightclub in the Little Saigon area in the 
past and may have worked at the cafe where the shooting occurred when it was 
under different ownership, Lt. Andrew Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, which recently changed ownership, has been the site of several 
violent attacks in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an address we all know," Hall said. "Under its former owners, it 
presented us with a real history of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was known as the Tan-Hai Restaurant, the eatery was the site of 
several violent gang-related attacks, including a melee in 1991 when 17 people 
were arrested on suspicion of rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, a 21-year-old man was fatally shot in the parking lot. Last 
year, there was a brawl between two groups of teen-agers that erupted in 
gunfire, forcing customers to the floor. A 15-year-old girl was wounded in the 
cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe was closed Saturday afternoon and employees refused to comment on the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Several customers who arrived for lunch were turned away while others appeared 
stunned as they looked at the splattered blood that remained on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Dang, 29, was shopping Saturday afternoon in the small strip mall that 
houses the cafe. The Anaheim Hills resident, who visits Little Saigon weekly, 
said the previous violence at the cafe caused him to quit eating there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear they have had shootings at that place," Dang said. "People go there 
late in the evening to hang out. One thing leads to another." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's shooting has caused concern among city officials and leaders in the 
Vietnamese community, especially since it comes on the heels of a March 28 
attack in which two gunmen strode into a crowded cafe in the 7900 block of 
Westminster Boulevard and opened fire, killing a 20-year-old Garden Grove man 
and wounding a 16-year-old boy and two women, both 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they did not know whether that attack or Saturday's 
shootings were gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that, as a preventive measure, there will be increased police 
patrols of cafes and bars in the area in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mai Cong, president of the nonprofit Vietnamese Community of Orange County 
Inc., called the recent shootings "deplorable and regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
 "These incidents cost lives, and no one wants that," Cong said. "I don't know 
what we are going to do about this. I know that nightclubs have screening for 
guns, but I don't know if this is feasible for cafes. And I don't know if 
closing earlier is feasible to the owners, since they cater to a certain 
clientele who want a late-night supper after going to the movies or a 
nightclub."

CHRISTIAN CLUB; SCHOOL RELIGIOUS GROUPS RISING IN POPULARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU and JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Monday lunchtime again in Room 206 at El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills, and the two dozen students who have gathered talk and laugh as 
they pull out their sandwiches, potato chips, juice packs -- and Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
 When the chatter subsides and the rustling of sacks and wrappers is stilled, a 
young male voice, cracking with the changes of adolescence, begins: 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us come before you with a righteous heart, Father God," the teen-ager 
says solemnly, his head bowed. "I pray that you will strengthen us. . . . Help 
us do well in school, God, and help us be a light to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amens" from the others seal the prayer. The weekly meeting of the school's 
Chi Alpha club -- Greek letters used to symbolize "Christ First" -- goes into 
full swing with a reading from the New Testament and some teaching by the 
group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes are becoming increasingly common at public high schools throughout 
Los Angeles and the nation as religious students exercise rights recently 
clarified by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a near-unanimous decision in June, 
1990, the justices ruled that secondary schools must allow religious clubs on 
campus if other non-academic student organizations are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Christian clubs have begun cropping up at high schools throughout 
the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District. More than half of the 
district's 49 high schools have groups that attract five to 50 students at 
meetings held before class, during lunch or after school. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of campus Christian clubs over the last few years coincides with an 
increase in churchgoing by teen-agers. According to a recently released Gallup 
youth poll, half of the nation's youths attended church weekly in 1993, up from 
45% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil libertarians decry the growing presence of the clubs on campuses, saying 
they further blur the line between church and state. But advocates of such 
associations, including the students, defend them as a legitimate gathering of 
youths with a mutual interest, akin to a chess or ski club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place for people who have a common belief in Christianity to come 
together and anybody who's curious about Christianity to come," said Daniel 
Chapman, a 17-year-old junior who leads El Camino's Chi Alpha and often 
conducts each week's Bible study. "It's a good resource." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say the establishment of Christian clubs at high schools 
has sparked surprisingly little controversy. But because of the constitutional 
eggshells underfoot when it comes to religion on a public school campus, the 
Los Angeles school district's legal office has issued strict guidelines on 
application of the Supreme Court decision and the 1984 Equal Access Act, which 
first unlocked classroom doors to religiously themed meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Friedman, an attorney for the school district, said the high court 
ruling, known as the Mergens decision, broadened the Equal Access Act to put 
religious student groups on virtually the same official footing as other clubs. 
With that status comes the ability to tap materials and resources that are 
available to other sanctioned organizations, such as use of school bulletin 
boards or the campus public address system to announce meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled that the clubs must be initiated and led by students and 
should have a school staff member monitoring proceedings. The law covers groups 
of any faith or ideology, but the vast majority of new high school religious 
clubs in Los Angeles are Christian, Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that the law would spawn meetings of devil-worshiping, neo-Nazi or hate 
groups have not materialized, said Charles Haynes, co-chairman of a broad-based 
religious and educational coalition that developed equal-access guidelines for 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not in all my travels found the parade of 'horribles' that people 
predicted -- that there would be all these Satan clubs or proselytizing all 
over the place," said Haynes, who is a visiting professional scholar at 
Vanderbilt University's Freedom Forum First Amendment Center in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, clubs have been formed by Muslims, Jews 
and Koreans who are Christians. "The kids are all very, very serious about 
their religion and I put out the red carpet for the positive things they are 
thinking about," Fairfax Principal Mike O'Sullivan said. "Who could be against 
them leading their lives in a socially acceptable way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, advocates contend that students across the nation are running into 
opposition in setting up such groups. In February, the conservative American 
Center for Law and Justice filed suit against school districts in New York and 
Virginia -- where the center is based -- on behalf of youths who alleged that 
they had been prevented from starting Bible clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The predominance of clubs with a Christian orientation worries Carol Plotkin 
of the Pacific Southwest Region of the American Jewish Congress. The congress, 
along with other civil liberties groups, opposed the Equal Access Act and the 
Mergens decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we are philosophically against the creation of the clubs 
in the first place is that it puts minorities at a disadvantage, whatever the 
minority happens to be. We happen to be Jewish, and in a pluralist society, 
it's hard to compete with the majority religion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plotkin said her son has had to turn away invitations from Christian friends 
to attend school Bible studies -- invitations that create a social pressure she 
says teen-agers should not be subjected to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young, impressionable people, we don't believe, should be approached on high 
school campuses. . . . This has to do with a belief system, with basic 
religious and moral standards, and that's what the First Amendment tries to 
keep separated (from schools)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in the clubs deny that their goal is to proselytize in 
campus hallways and classrooms. Rather, they said, the groups offer an outlet 
for committed young people to integrate their faith with everyday life, so much 
of which is spent at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice to get involved with Christians at your school so you don't 
live a church life and a school life," said Melisa Powell, 15, of El Camino. 
"You can be a Christian at school." 
</P>
<P>
 But the students acknowledge that their meetings often have an evangelical 
bent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus told us to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to those who 
don't know the Gospel," said 17-year-old Ray Causly, a senior at Monroe High 
School in North Hills and leader of its Christian Club. "And the people in our 
school are the ones we're most accessible to." 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty advisers for several groups said the clubs offer support for students 
striving to live a Christian lifestyle in the midst of the temptations facing 
teen-agers today, such as drugs, sex and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that students need and want this kind of encouragement and 
alternatives," said Elva Quintero, faculty adviser for the 20-member group at 
Roosevelt High School on the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Howard E. Miller, who advises the Christian club at Fremont High School in 
South-Central Los Angeles, said the 20 or so students who meet twice a week 
during lunch in his wood-shop class "really love Jesus, don't like gangbanging 
and want to get away from that type of life." 
</P>
<P>
 District guidelines -- and those put out by Haynes' coalition of religious and 
educational groups -- mandate that supervising teachers be impartial observers. 
Staff advisers should refrain from commenting or participating in any way "that 
would convey either support or disapproval of meeting subject matter," 
according to the memo issued by the school district. 
</P>
<P>
 But practice may not always match the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some club sponsors say they often participate, whether by singing songs with 
the students, praying aloud with them or even putting together the agenda for 
the week's Bible study. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Christian club advisers complain that their groups are subject to 
greater scrutiny than the cheerleading squad or the debate club. 
</P>
<P>
 To Plotkin, such vigilance is necessary to ensure that no civil liberties or 
individual rights get trampled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep a close watch," she said. "We try very hard to maintain the 
separation. And we do enter . . . in lawsuits when we think there's a chance to 
make better laws than there are today." 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates of the groups see no contradiction between preserving religious 
freedom and allowing students to voluntarily assemble on campus to share their 
faith and spiritual experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could run a common denominator through every Christian club I've been 
at, it would be students encouraging other students to be strong in their 
Christian values," said Jamie Johnson, youth pastor at Osborne Neighborhood 
Church in Arleta.

LITTLE REMAINS OF MENENDEZ ESTATE, RECORDS SHOW; COURTS: INHERITANCE OF $14.5 
MILLION WAS LOST TO TAXES, LAWYERS' FEES AND INFLATED REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS, 
PROBATE FILES REVEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Menendez brothers have said they are broke. It turns out they are right. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially valued at $14.5 million, the Menendez family estate has almost 
entirely been run through, according to recently unsealed probate records that 
explain how the millions were lost to taxes, legal fees, inflated real estate 
appraisals and even bad karma. 
</P>
<P>
 All that technically remains of an estate that boasted of prime Beverly Hills 
real estate and millions of dollars in entertainment industry stocks is one 
house in Calabasas, a condominium in New Jersey, some jewelry, a few pieces of 
furniture and $651,948 in cash, the probate files show.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $10.8 million has already been spent, the records reveal, about half of 
that in taxes and lawyers' fees for the defense of sons Lyle and Erik Menendez, 
who admit that they killed parents Jose and Kitty Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 What's left, after figuring in millions in losses on the sale of real estate 
and stocks, is simply not enough to pay a mountain of debts that grows higher 
each day as interest accrues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money goes," said one attorney familiar with the files. "It just goes." 
</P>
<P>
 So much of it is gone, according to the files, that even if Lyle and Erik 
Menendez were to be acquitted of murder in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings 
of their parents, they would stand to inherit nothing -- a remarkable turn of 
events for a case in which prosecutors have long contended that the brothers 
killed out of hatred and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 At their first trial, the brothers asserted that money had nothing to do with 
it. They testified that they killed in fear and self-defense after years of 
physical, emotional and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 That first trial ended in January when separate juries, one for each brother, 
deadlocked between murder and lesser manslaughter charges. Prosecutors 
immediately vowed to try the brothers on murder charges, and again to seek the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has yet been set for the retrial. But in anticipation of the second 
trial, and after reviewing the probate files, a judge assigned two public 
defenders to take over Lyle Menendez's case. Attorney Jill Lansing left the 
case to spend more time with a young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Leslie Abramson, who represents younger brother Erik Menendez, 
wants to stay on for the retrial. She is due to appear Tuesday at a Los Angeles 
Superior Court hearing to renew her request to be paid $100 per hour, up to 
$250,000, in taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson has justified her request by saying that the brothers are out of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The probate files back up that assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he was killed, Jose Menendez was the highly paid chief executive officer 
of Live Entertainment, a Van Nuys-based video distribution firm and a 
subsidiary of Carolco Pictures, the movie production company. If he had lived, 
he stood to make a bonus of $850,000 for 1989 alone, the probate files reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California law, all his property was split equally with his wife. Under 
their wills, their sole heirs were their sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate was first thought to be worth $14,501,342, according to a probate 
document filed Aug. 22, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That, though, left out $164 in savings bonds, $30,470 in jewelry and $28,044 
in furniture, clothes and personal things that had been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The added $58,678 brought the original total to $14,560,020, according to a 
Nov. 26, 1990, probate filing. 
</P>
<P>
 In large measure, according to the court records, the estate was made up of 
three assets: a mansion in Beverly Hills appraised at $4.8 million, the house 
in Calabasas appraised at $2.65 million and 330,000 shares of stock in Live 
Entertainment appraised at $6.58 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder included items such as the jewelry, the furniture and oddities 
such as 16 French francs said to be worth $2.46. 
</P>
<P>
 For accounting purposes, the probate files also include in the asset column 
some $1.3 million in income generated from 1989 through April 30, 1993, the 
date on which the executors submitted the balance books. No updates have been 
filed since.  
</P>
<P>
 The files also add in gains on stock sales during those four years, bringing 
the value on the books to a grand total of $16,018,906. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that figure -- not the $14.5 million estimated in the estate at the time 
of the killings -- from which the calculating is actually done.  
</P>
<P>
 The estate has paid $3,906,280 in taxes, most of it in estate taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 To defend Lyle Menendez, it spent $740,000. That sum was divided among 
attorneys Gerald Chaleff, Joel Isaacson and Lansing. To defend Erik Menendez, 
it spent $755,000. Abramson earned $740,000; Robert Shapiro, the younger 
brother's first attorney, earned $15,000. Total in criminal defense fees: 
$1,495,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate spent $2,743,219 on the Beverly Hills house and $1,404,007 on the 
Calabasas site, mostly for mortgages and upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate allocated $314,384 for "Lyle's miscellaneous expenses." Of that, 
$300,000 went for the purchase of a New Jersey chicken-wing restaurant, said an 
attorney familiar with the file. 
</P>
<P>
 It also spent $9,392 on "Erik's miscellaneous expenses." Included were medical 
expenses, a pre-arrest plane ticket and phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of other fees and expenses brings the total spent to $10,771,199. 
</P>
<P>
 To calculate the value of what remains, the executors -- one of Jose 
Menendez's sisters and her husband -- factored in losses on sales of the 
Beverly Hills house and the Live Entertainment stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The house turned out to be worth nowhere near $4.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, in the TV room, that the sons killed the parents, and "it was 
widely believed by the home-buying public and the real estate brokers and 
agents that this house had bad 'karma,' and was one to be avoided," according 
to court records filed on behalf of lawyers for the executors. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, it sold for $3,607,975 -- a loss of $1,192,024. What was left after 
meeting the mortgage and closing costs went directly to the Internal Revenue 
Service, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 330,000 shares of Live Entertainment stock proved difficult to unload, 
because the share price tumbled after the killings, the probate files indicate. 
The shares sold at a loss of $530,981. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The estate recorded other losses on the sale of some furniture with the 
Beverly Hills house and on Carolco debentures. Total losses amounted to 
$1,806,577. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtracting the expenditures and the losses from the $16,018,906 working 
figure leaves $3,441,130 as the total of the inventory in the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But that figure is misleading, because it lists the Calabasas house at its 
1990 appraised value, $2.65 million. It was last listed for sale at $1.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sells, the house, which sits on 13 acres tucked into a hillside off 
Mulholland Drive, figures to yield $1.5 million, according to papers filed by 
the brothers' probate attorney, Gail Kass. Adding in the cash on hand, 
$651,948, and the estimated net proceeds from the sale of the New Jersey condo, 
$90,000, puts the estate at $2.2 million, not $3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Debts outstanding include the $864,000 Calabasas mortgage, estate taxes 
estimated at $600,000, probate attorney's fees and executors' commissions. If 
those were all paid immediately, the estate would have $310,000 left, Kass 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, interest on the Calabasas mortgage and the taxes is accruing at 
some $146,000 annually, Kass estimated. The estate also owes $200,000 in court 
costs from the murder trial; that money is due to go to the county, which 
advanced the funds. Tax attorneys and accountants also are due to present more 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 If paid, it all would leave the estate with less than zero. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the $651,948 in cash on hand? It can't simply be allocated to the 
brothers' defense. Under the probate law, taxes, the Calabasas mortgage and 
other expenses take a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, attorneys stressed, the estate is under no obligation to pay for the 
defense.

ROBERTI'S POLITICAL DUSK BECOMES NEW DAWN; POLITICS: SENATOR WAS READY TO BOW 
OUT FROM STATE GOVERNMENT, UNTIL A RECALL EFFORT CHANGED HIS MIND. THE 27-YEAR 
VETERAN CAME OUT FIGHTING, AND IS RUNNING FOR STATE TREASURER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 27 years in the Legislature, 13 of them as head of the Senate, Sen. 
David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) -- prodded by his wife, June -- had finally 
decided to bow out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hadn't the people cast their votes against career politicians by imposing term 
limits? And hadn't running for office changed a great deal since 1966, when 
civic-minded volunteers and $3.50-a-plate spaghetti fund-raisers vaulted 
Roberti into the Capitol? 
</P>
<P>
 Enough, he declared. Term limits would end his Senate career in December 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, late last year, something happened that made him so angry that it 
changed his mind. A coalition including firearms rights advocates, upset by 
Roberti's legislation against military-style semiautomatic weapons, got a 
recall election against him set for April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were stupid because I actually had him convinced to look for 
something else . . . to go into private life, get out of public life," June 
Roberti, her husband's closest adviser, said in an interview. "But the recall 
changed everything. We're in it now to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 As his foes called for his removal, Roberti vowed that he would fight the 
recall, and also tossed in a bid to run for state treasurer, declaring that he 
would not be forced out of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the first recall election of a state official since 1914 may be 
remembered as something of an oddity, based on a series of paradoxes: a man 
fighting for his political life at a time when the exit light had beckoned; an 
election-turned-referendum on an assault weapons ban that fails to outlaw all 
such firearms; a slick anti-recall campaign that skirts the issue of whether 
the senator has done a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends in the Capitol say it is typical of Roberti, a naturally introverted 
man, to step out of his shell when challenged to protect his legacy. They say 
he desperately wants to avoid ending his long career as the victim of a recall 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn your back on these people," Roberti said of the opponents he 
openly calls "cuckoos" or "nut cases" for the intensity of their pro-gun views. 
"Otherwise, you turn your back on a career of 27 years, you turn your back on 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 But recall proponents are quick to point out that 46,000 registered San 
Fernando Valley voters who signed their petitions apparently agree that Roberti 
has served too long in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are saying is he presided over the Senate at a time of the worst 
corruption of the democratic system in California history," said Kevin 
Washburn, manager of the recall campaign. "And the people of this district are 
entitled to their democratic rights to recall him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the senator's strategy is apparent: deny that this is about Roberti 
the officeholder, and define the election as retaliation for his legislation to 
ban military-style weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 Although that tells part of the story, Roberti's own rhetoric shrinks away 
from his record or what he stands for ("You don't have to like Sen. David 
Roberti, . . . " says one campaign brochure urging a vote against the recall.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't view it as an election about me," Roberti said in an 
interview. "If David Roberti were somebody else who had been able to (pass gun 
control laws), they'd be on their case." 
</P>
<P>
 Capitol observers sum up Roberti, 54, as an adroit politician, one who 
shrewdly negotiates trade-offs, if need be, to further his agenda. And his 
sharp survival skills enable him to home in on issues that grab people, such as 
the move to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District, which he 
championed in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a track record of successful fund raising, collecting hefty donations 
over the years from unions, law enforcement groups, the California Teachers 
Assn., trial lawyers and large corporations such as Arco and Chevron. 
</P>
<P>
 His ideology, he says, is derived from his belief that government has a 
responsibility to help people so they can eventually help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I gravitate toward the have-nots, the people who need somebody to 
fight for them," said Roberti, who represented Hollywood for a quarter-century 
before moving over to the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who succeeded Roberti in 
January as leader of the upper house, describes his predecessor as being adept 
at forging the kinds of compromises that keep the wheels of state government 
churning. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the recall, "People tend to focus on guns," Lockyer said, 
"but I tend to see him in a different way. If there's an overarching 
philosophy, it's his sympathy for the underdog." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans in the Senate view the Roberti legacy in a harsher light. 
</P>
<P>
 "He strikes me as having been a typical liberal Democratic legislative 
leader," said Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Upland). "He has blocked legislation that 
would have helped California's job situation over the years -- in tort law, 
environmental law, business regulation and taxation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti is currently pushing Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to use his authority under 
the 1989 Assault Weapons Control Act to ban so-called copy-cat firearms. Gun 
manufacturers are getting around Roberti's 5-year-old law by making identical 
weapons under different names from those identified by the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hot themes in the recall debate stems from fallout over the 
disgrace brought on by three Roberti lieutenants in the Senate -- former 
Democratic Sens. Alan Robbins, Joseph Montoya and Paul Carpenter, all of whom 
were convicted of political corruption in the exchange of money for political 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 By association, this has reflected poorly on Roberti. Washburn says: "We're 
not trying to prosecute Mr. Roberti. We're saying there is political 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti says he was unaware of his colleagues' criminal activities. "The best 
thing I can say is, Alan Robbins represented the 20th District for 18 years, 
and there was never a recall against him. . . . And nobody, but nobody, has 
accused me of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That it is he, not Robbins, who ended up on the receiving end of a vigorous 
recall effort is an irony that leaves Roberti feeling stung.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a human being. And human beings, they feel sorry for themselves 
sometimes," Roberti said. "Why should I have to go through this?" 
</P>
<P>
 June Roberti acknowledges that the recall campaign sometimes leaves her 
husband physically tired. But, she says, "I think he has the fighting spirit 
more than he has the low spirit."

EAGLES FANS FLOCK TO IRVINE FOR BAND'S REUNION TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy McGlone stood despondently in the parking lot of the Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre on Saturday morning, resigned that she had no hope of getting a 
ticket for one of the May reunion concerts by the mellow rock band, the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 The number McGlone had drawn two hours before the box office opened at 9 a.m 
put her 2,636 spots behind the first ticket-buyer -- and each person was 
allowed to purchase as many as eight tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 But three hours later -- after a kind soul offered to buy $115 tickets for 
her, putting her in the fifth row -- the Laguna Niguel resident was singing a 
different tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got orchestra seats. I've got goose bumps," she gloated to anyone 
listening. "We're going in a limo now. I'm so excited." 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 3,000 people camped out in the Irvine Meadows parking lot as early 
as 5:45 a.m. and untold numbers trying to buy tickets by phone, all 60,000 
tickets for the four planned Eagles shows on May 27, 28, 29 and 31 were gone by 
12:30 p.m., along with 15,000 more for a hastily added fifth show on June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 While Saturday's buying frenzy did not approach the intensity of last week's 
historic run on tickets for singer Barbra Streisand's concerts at Anaheim Arena 
-- the first three of which were sold out in 30 minutes -- the well-known 
group's appeal was nevertheless impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "To sell more than 57,000 tickets in about three hours is incredible," said 
Matt Curto, the amphitheater's general manager. "We're very pleased to be the 
facility to start off the Eagles' reunion tour. We're all looking forward to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 A sixth Southern California show planned for June 2 at the Glen Helen 
Blockbuster Pavilion in San Bernardino sold more slowly, with a couple hundred 
seats still left by late Saturday afternoon. That venue holds 35,000 people, 
20,000 more than the amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 Some die-hard Eagles fans, like Lou and Eric Sundeen, both 27, of Carson, and 
their friend, Gail King, 29, of Irvine, showed up when the amphitheater gates 
opened at 5:45 a.m. But their early arrival didn't guarantee them seats.  
</P>
<P>
 To keep the crowd from pushing, shoving, and cutting in line, numbers were 
handed out at random to everyone who arrived before 7 a.m. The Sundeens and 
King were about 500 spots away when a crowd-control worker shouted through a 
megaphone, "Ladies and gentleman, all seats are sold. The Eagles are sold out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess maybe we should have gone to my office to use the speed-dial phone" 
in an attempt to secure tickets from the Ticketmaster ticket agency, Lou 
Sundeen said. Her companions sadly nodded their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Now their only chances to hear "Hotel California" live would be to pay a 
ticket resale agency twice a ticket's face value or numb their fingers trying 
to win radio station call-in contests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles fans, whiling away the hours waiting in the cold and, later, bright 
sunshine, played cards, read romance novels and frantically dialed cellular 
phones, trying to crash the busy Ticketmaster telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston native Brenda Cone, 37, who eventually bought the $75 terrace seats 
that brought her to the amphitheater at 6 a.m., found the festival-like 
atmosphere amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a California thing," Cone said as she watched people strike up 
conversations with complete strangers and notify worried friends over their 
cellular phones that they had finally gotten through. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone cherishes the T-shirt she still has from an Eagles' Beantown concert in 
1976, which she remembers as a "wonderful night. It was a blast."  
</P>
<P>
 She said she expects the Irvine crowd to be a more "mature and responsible" 
than the rowdy, beer-drinking, and dope-smoking college kids who packed that 
show 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time," she said, "it's to go listen to the music, relive some memories 
and appreciate some great musicians who I never expected to get back together."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
LOCAL DEMOCRATS JOIN CLINTON IN CORONADO TO ENJOY VICTORY SUNSHINE

 Still celebrating: It's not often that Orange County Democrats can savor 
victory, but they did so with gusto last week when President Bill Clinton took 
time out from his San Diego area vacation to hold a small private reception for 
Californians who helped him in his 1992 election victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Democratic Foundation leaders Susan Naples, Dick O'Neill and 
Wylie A. Aitken and his wife, Betty, were invited to the party at the Hotel del 
Coronado near San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton didn't win Orange County, but local Democrats rallied enough to give 
the Republican national ticket its lowest percentage of votes here in 56 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rewarding to know that those of us who have labored in the vineyards in 
the fields for so long have an opportunity to enjoy the sunshine," Aitken said. 
"It's been awhile since we have had a Democratic President, and Orange County 
Democrats need all the encouragement we can get."

 Undecided wins: Huntington Beach Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, a Democrat 
running in the nonpartisan District 2 supervisorial race, is touting a poll 
showing her ahead of her two major rivals, both Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll of 400 likely voters--paid for by Moulton-Patterson's campaign--shows 
her with 20% support, compared to 14% for Huntington Beach Councilman Jim 
Silva, and 4% for businesswoman Haydee Tillotson. "Don't Know/Unsure" led the 
pack with 62%. 
</P>
<P>
 While the survey shows Tillotson trailing, campaign finance statements for the 
period ending March 17 show Tillotson having the most cash on hand: $157,573, 
compared to $50,881 for Moulton-Patterson and $26,543 for Silva. Tillotson's 
treasury was boosted by $217,000 in loans she made to her campaign. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Conceding?: It's a little early in the political season for a concession 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phillip Knypstra, the only challenger to County Supervisor William G. 
Steiner, admits he doesn't have much chance of unseating the incumbent. A 
professor at El Camino College and a former Anaheim police officer, Knypstra 
has raised no money and doesn't plan to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pure contest between a guy out hustling money and a political 
outsider," Knypstra said. "I paid my $820 filing fee. But I'm a cheap Dutchman 
who has no chance unless people wake up." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Moderately speaking: Hoping to diminish the conservatives' hold on the Orange 
County Republican Central Committee, a new group of moderates called the Orange 
County Republican Majority Coalition has drafted 22 candidates to run for the 
42 slots on the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for power will draw a lot of interest since the central 
committee--volunteers whose purpose is to work for the election of 
Republicans--can influence the makeup of the statewide GOP organization and how 
campaign money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ishimatsu, a Seal Beach resident and among those seeking a seat, says 
local Republicans really are not as conservative as the central committee's 
current membership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to destroy the party, we just want to change the people in the 
organization," Ishimatsu says.

 Back patting: In the 70th Assembly District's Republican primary, Marilyn 
Brewer has received the endorsement of the California Coalition of Law 
Enforcement Assns. headed by Don L. Novey, an ally of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same race, Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond has won the support of 
the conservative California College Republicans board. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, GOP candidate Bob Kerns, who is among the pack of Republicans 
challenging incumbent Rep. Jay C. Kim (R-Diamond Bar) in the 41st Congressional 
District primary, has been endorsed by Angela (Bay) Buchanan, former U.S. 
treasurer and sister of television commentator Pat Buchanan. UPCOMING EVENTS

HIGH TIDE GIVES RESIDENTS RUDE AWAKENING; FLOODING: STRONG WINDS IN WEE HOURS 
PUSH WAVES UP TO 10 FEET TALL INTO GARAGES OF ABOUT 15 SEAL BEACH HOMES. 
SANDBAGGING IS ON WITH MORE SEAWATER ON THE WAY TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Residents were scrambling Saturday night to secure their properties with 
sandbags after 15 beachfront homes sustained mostly minor damage as waves as 
tall as 10 feet raced to shore and another high tide was predicted for early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The onslaught caught this beach town sleeping, as high tides and strong winds 
caused flooding in the garages of homes at 1:20 a.m. Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents of houses near 11th Street on Seal Way had to wade through knee-deep 
waters in their low-lying garages to move their cars and other belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it -- everything in my garage was soaking wet," said Brian 
Hoffman, who lives on Seal Way. 
</P>
<P>
 In the darkness, Hoffman said, dozens of residents lined their balconies to 
catch a glimpse of the encroaching, thunderous tides. Hoffman said he was 
awakened by his fiancee, Christine Peterson, who heard rumbling outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we peered over the balcony, the water was already about two feet high 
right directly below," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Fire Department began receiving calls from worried residents 
shortly before midnight, and arrived soon after to assist in putting down about 
900 sandbags along the asphalt walkway that separates homes from the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have the water come up at this time is unusual," said Maria Sabol, a Fire 
Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifeguards and residents said a 20-foot-high, mile-long sand barrier that was 
built at the beginning of winter might have prevented the flooding, but was 
taken down earlier in the week. It is usually dismantled around Easter, after 
the threat of high tides has subsided, to give residents and spectators a 
better view of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not expected," said Steve Cushman, a Seal Beach lifeguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility crews were dispatched to the area and turned off gas in five of the 15 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to drain the waters back into the ocean, a bulldozer was brought 
in to dig a five-foot trench near the city's pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident John Breiding woke up to what he thought was thunder. "It was pretty 
frustrating," he said. "We couldn't get sand from the beach because it was 
flooded. All most people could do was watch." 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday afternoon, hundreds of spectators had turned out to witness 
another high tide, which came at 4 p.m. but did no damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The next high tide was due at 4 a.m. today, and residents were working into 
the night shoring up their garages and elevated doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sandbagged everything and I'm going to seal everything tonight," Hoffman 
said.

EXHIBITION OPTIMISM AT THE BIG A; BASEBALL: SPRING'S PROMISE THRILLS FANS OF 
ANGELS, DODGERS AT FREEWAY SERIES GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Midge and Carroll Watrous staked a place in the chill wind Saturday, waiting 
patiently for their son to buy tickets for the clash of the freeway titans -- 
Dodgers versus Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 As they always do, they endured this baseball rite of spring without 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all, we waited all last season for the Angels to play well," said Carol 
Watrous, 52, of Placentia. "They didn't, but this is a whole new season." 
</P>
<P>
 That optimism -- fresh as new emerald grass -- was spreading and growing at 
the second game of the annual exhibition Freeway Series between regional 
rivals, the California Angels and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Saturday's 
competition was waged on the Angels' home turf, a day after the Orange County 
team beat the Dodgers 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ticket windows, more than 200 fans lined up two hours before the game 
began. When the gates thundered open to allow ticket holders into the stadium, 
there was a heady excitement among the fans who were immediately drawn to the 
snack stands for baseball's version of a square meal: golden mustard and 
sizzling hot dogs, salty peanuts and cold, cold beer.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long wait for the season to start," said Bob Allan, 47, of 
Torrance, with the tone of a famished man. Allan -- bearded and burly and 
sporting a baseball cap -- was chaperoning a group of fifth-grade students from 
Harbor City Gateway Christian School. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for the players to go out there to play the game, for the fans to 
eat dogs, smell grass -- I mean the kind you mow," Allan said. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's baseball you understand?" he declared, his voice rising like a fly ball. 
"It's life!" 
</P>
<P>
 For Joyce Marary, baseball is her life. And that means romance and nostalgia. 
She remembers a blind date 36 years ago at a game pitting the Detroit Tigers 
against the Yankees. That was the day she started to win her husband's heart.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a baseball fan ever since," said Marary, 58, of Brea. "I go to the 
Angels games all season long, but the series is especially nice because it's 
the only time you get to see the Dodgers and Angels play each other." 
</P>
<P>
 For die-hard fans, the series signaled something more -- a time of new 
beginnings and hope as hard and solid as a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, they insist, their team is going all the way.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Jim Greene of Anaheim begged to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care who's going to win," he said. "I just like baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's play ball."

4 KILLED, 2 INJURED AS CAR HITS TRUCK NEAR UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four people were killed and two were injured early Saturday when a speeding 
sports car went out of control in Westwood and collided with a pickup truck, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said a young man was driving a black 1994 Acura Integra at 
more than 80 m.p.h. when his car veered from the eastbound lane of Sunset 
Boulevard into the westbound lane near Groverton Place about midnight.A man and 
two women were passengers in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 All four died instantly when the Acura slammed into a red Toyota pickup truck 
near UCLA, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. The names of the dead 
were withheld pending notification of relatives, the county coroner's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver and the passenger in the pickup truck, both women in their 40s, 
were taken to UCLA Medical Center, where one was listed in critical condition 
with head injuries and the other was in fair condition, a hospital official 
said. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said traffic on Sunset Boulevard was routed through the UCLA 
campus for seven hours during the accident investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol did not play a role in the accident, police said.

SHOT IN DRUG BUY, DYING MAN TELLS POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old man was shot and killed late Friday, apparently after a drug 
deal that went awry, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Ernesto Rivera Perez, stumbled out of an apartment in the 1400 
block of North Broadway about 10:30 p.m. Friday and collapsed in the street, 
where he was discovered a short time later by a Santa Ana police officer on 
patrol.He was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he died during 
surgery, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he died, Perez, who was shot in the chest and abdomen, told police he 
was buying marijuana when he was attacked, said Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was shot by three guys with masks, but that's doubtful," Faust 
said. "A female witness said she saw a male running from the area with a 
handgun and he wasn't wearing a mask." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they have made no arrests and have no suspects in the case.

MAN SHOOTS YOUTH AFTER ALLEGED COOKIE THEFT 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a Lynwood market shot and critically wounded a 14-year-old boy 
Saturday morning after a group of teen-agers entered the market and one of them 
allegedly stole a bag of cookies, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kim, owner of Charlie's Market in the 3300 block of Martin Luther King 
Jr.Boulevard, told deputies that five boys came into his store just before 
11:30 a.m. Saturday. Only three of the boys paid for items while one of the 
others stole a bag of cookies, Kim told deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim followed the group about two blocks in his car, cutting them off at Alma 
Avenue and Long Beach Boulevard, where he confronted them about the cookies, 
Deputy Larry Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys denied taking anything from the store. One of them pulled out a knife 
and asked Kim, "What are you going to do?" said Sgt. Ron Spear of the sheriff's 
Headquarters Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim pulled out a gun and told the boy to "freeze," Spear said. At the same 
time, another teen-ager reached into his waistband and Kim shot him once, Spear 
said. Kim drove the wounded boy back to his store and called deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Kim has had theft problems in his store. The investigation is 
not complete and Kim was not arrested, Spear said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was in critical condition at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical 
Center on Saturday night with a bullet wound in his upper body. Deputies said 
he lived within blocks of the market.

GAS LEAK FROM SEWER FORCES LANE CLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials closed a half-mile lane of Coast Highway on Saturday after 
underground methane and hydrogen sulfide gases reached flammable levels in 
parts of the sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
 The naturally occurring gases, which for more than 40 years have produced the 
occasional scent of rotten eggs, apparently have leaked into the county 
sanitation system, according to Scott Allan, a Newport Beach Fire Department 
battalion chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what has us concerned," said Allan. "We had some workers taking 
samplings and it was approaching the lower flammable limits. This is the first 
time we've ever had anyone taking samplings." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan said that about an acre of "gas-bearing sand" lies under Coast Highway. 
For at least the next two days, one lane of the highway will be closed from 
Newport Boulevard to Balboa Boulevard while sanitation workers search for an 
explanation. A television camera will be dropped down below one of the manhole 
covers to explore for pipe leaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't quite determined yet what to do," Allan said. "The gas levels seem 
to rise with the high tide. If we need to, we could put another vent in the 
sewage system and suck off the gas."

 NEW FACE: Meet Hank Stockdale, community cop. As part of a federally funded 
program aimed at bringing police closer to the communities they serve, 
Stockdale divides his day between a Pacoima storefront office and the streets 
of the largely Latino neighborhood (B1). . . . "I have no illusions about being 
the new sheriff in town," he said."But if I can make a difference, then I'm 
100% successful." 
</P>
<P>
 TRAPPED: It's been 10 months since Los Angeles stopped trapping coyotes, and 
the debate between residents and animal regulation officials continues (B1). . 
. . "I kinda feel like we have become the fast-food capital for coyotes out 
here," said one Woodland Hills woman. . . . The city has agreed to review the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 LIVING COLOR: Not so long ago, the slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains blazed 
with fire, leaving destruction and heartbreak for hundreds of Topanga and 
Malibu residents. Today, the blackened terrain is alive with a vivid array of 
wildflowers that haven't bloomed in decades (B3). . . . Called fire followers, 
the plants thrive in burned areas but often are crowded out by other vegetation 
after a few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 YOUTHS FOR CHRIST: The rise in Christian clubs on high school campuses 
coincides with an increase in church-going by America's teen-agers (B1). . . . 
The U. S. Supreme Court ruled in 1990 that secondary schools must allow 
religious groups on campus if other non-academic organizations are permitted. . 
. . About a dozen San Fernando Valley public high schools have such clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 LONG TIME COMING: Cal State Northridge senior Amy Windmiller defeated Fresno 
State for the first time since transferring from there after her freshman year, 
helping the Matadors salvage a split of a Western Athletic Conference softball 
doubleheader (C10). . . . Windmiller, who was 0-3 against the Bulldogs last 
season, pitched a four-hitter in Northridge's 4-1 victory. Fresno State won the 
first game, 5-2.

PROGRAM AIMS TO BRING POLICE AND COMMUNITY CLOSER TOGETHER; CRIME: LAPD OFFICER 
IN PACOIMA IS PAID BY GRANT INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE PREVENTION AND LONG-TERM 
PROBLEM SOLVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officer Hank Stockdale of the Los Angeles Police Department is paid from a 
$4-million federal grant designed to help bring peace to urban war zones. 
</P>
<P>
 But the price of the framed picture of John Wayne -- so far the only 
decoration in his week-old Pacoima office -- came out of his own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no illusions about being the new sheriff in town," said Stockdale, a 
6-foot, 200-pound mustachioed blond who nonetheless looks and acts the part. 
"But if I can make a difference, then I'm 100% successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale's new job is to bring the department closer to the community it 
serves -- in this case, a largely Latino neighborhood that surrounds a rough 
stretch of Van Nuys Boulevard east of the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of 54 officers who will be working citywide, using grant money the 
Clinton Administration has awarded to financially strapped cities. The two-year 
grant, which is augmented by $9 million in city funds, is intended to encourage 
community-based policing, which emphasizes prevention and long-term problem 
solving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to place police officers in places where they can more closely 
interact and get feedback from the community," said Sgt. Ron Tingle of the 
LAPD's Office of Operations, which coordinated the grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale's new duties will include regular office hours at a Van Nuys 
Boulevard storefront from 9 to 11 a.m., Monday through Friday. The rest of the 
day, Stockdale meets with local shop owners and patrols the streets in his 
black-and-white. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new job frees him from the obligation to respond to radio calls, 
Stockdale, like most officers, usually wants to swing by to see what is going 
on, especially if the call is close enough and interesting enough. 
</P>
<P>
 And in this part of the Valley, there is no shortage of interesting calls -- 
for police, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, patrolled by the Foothill Division, ranks as one of the 
poorest and least educated in the San Fernando Valley. Although the overall 
per-capita crime rate in the division fell between 1981 and 1992, the area is 
among the Valley's worst for homicides and aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
 It lags behind other Valley police divisions in the number of robberies and 
burglaries, perhaps because its widespread poverty makes other communities more 
attractive to thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic options for many here range from welfare to minimum-wage jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of adults in the adjoining communities of Pacoima and Arleta 
have less than a ninth-grade education, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
About one-quarter speak little or no English. More than one-third of the area's 
residents are not U.S. citizens; 70% are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurial choices on this part of Van Nuys Boulevard include selling 
aluminum cans to Tony's Recycling Center at 92 cents a pound and selling 
pea-sized bits of street-corner cocaine for the equivalent of $44,000 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealing is a lure that accounts for at least half the area's crime, 
Stockdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost impossible to catch burglars -- often drug addicts -- who are in 
and out of houses in a flash. But catch somebody in a drug deal and essentially 
you've caught a burglar the easy way, since many who steal are trying to 
support a $150- to $200-a-day drug habit, Stockdale said. 
</P>
<P>
 The street here is a mix of struggling retail stores, doughnut shops, liquor 
stores, restaurants, bars, car-repair shops and storefront churches. Bright 
banners announcing the 1994 World Cup Soccer hang from street lights, offering 
a splash of color. 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, Van Nuys Boulevard is busy. The sidewalks fill with 
pedestrians, mostly what Stockdale calls the area's decent people. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, the same streets fill with predators, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first goal is to start cleaning up Van Nuys Boulevard," said the 
28-year-old graduate of Granada Hills High School and Cal State Los Angeles. 
"If I work my ass off for three to six months, we'll probably see a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes he was picked for the job because he is an aggressive 
self-starter, an officer who makes arrests and doesn't need much supervision. 
Stockdale decided on police work while in high school after being angered by 
the 1983 shooting death of LAPD motorcycle officer Paul Verna in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his day off last weekend painting the office, an 8-by-13-foot room 
located inside the Avtech language school at the Plaza del Sol shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 During an afternoon patrol, Stockdale is constantly punching license plate 
numbers into his car computer -- checking for stolen cars, cars with 
outstanding warrants, crooks on the lam. He checks the plates of expensive 
cars, which stand out in this poor neighborhood, as well as cars filled with 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's up?" he calls to three teen-age boys sitting on a couch that someone 
has left on the sidewalk. He asks where they got the expensive mountain bike. 
One boy says he bought it, he's got a good job. "Doing what?" Stockdale wants 
to know. Cleaning planes at Van Nuys Airport, the boy says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied, Stockdale moves on. Punching in more license plates, stopping 
wherever youths are gathered in groups -- to say hi, to ask questions and yell 
a little, sounding a lot like a stern father, even though he is at most 10 
years older than those he questions. 
</P>
<P>
 He follows an older Toyota carrying two men that is taking a circuitous route 
through alleys and back streets and finally ends up at one of the few banks in 
the area. They turn out to be employees at a local gas station. Their boss, 
fearing robbery, orders his staff to take such a route when they deposit the 
day's receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockdale -- who grew up in the Valley but like many fellow officers now lives 
about 50 miles away -- took the job in part "to prove I was more than a gung-ho 
street cop." 
</P>
<P>
 But he cannot resist a drive through San Fernando Gardens, a public-housing 
project where Latino gangs have taken control from black gangs, due largely to 
the changing demographics of the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez Park, across the street, is a regular drug-buying area, where sellers 
can easily hide their wares under a clump of grass should they spy a police 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teen-agers spot Stockdale's car and turn to run. He accelerates through 
the parking lot and gives chase, but they have a head start and soon disappear 
into the housing complex. A group of older men watch and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long you think they'll be running?" Stockdale yells. 
</P>
<P>
 He spins the car around the corner but the teen-agers are long gone. Instead, 
two youngsters wave and ask for baseball cards, which LAPD officers give away 
by the box load every spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until they are about 8 years old, the kids here love the police," 
Stockdale said. "After that, it's not so cool to wave. . . . Some of these 
people are lost, but if we can get to the kids, get them started off right, 
they still have a chance to be a decent human being." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Stockdale himself became a father; his wife gave birth to a girl. 
The family lives in an 1,800-square-foot house in the mountains about 20 miles 
west of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, "It's so quiet that the sound of the crickets and frogs is 
deafening," Stockdale said. "That's the way I like it."

CHRIST ON CAMPUS; RELIGIOUS CLUBS CROPPING UP AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN VALLEY AND 
NATIONWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU and JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Monday lunchtime again in Room 206 at El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills, and the two dozen students who have gathered there talk and 
laugh as they pull out their sandwiches, potato chips, juice packs -- and 
Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the chatter subsides, the rustling of sacks and wrappers is stilled and a 
young male voice, cracking with the changes of adolescence but sounding assured 
nonetheless, begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us come before you with a righteous heart, Father God," the teen-ager 
says solemnly, his head bowed. "I pray that you will strengthen us. . . . Help 
us do well in school, God, and help us be a light to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amens" from the others seal the prayer. The weekly meeting of the Chi Alpha 
club -- Greek letters that stand for Christ First -- goes into full swing with 
a reading from the New Testament and teaching by the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes are becoming increasingly common at public high schools throughout 
Los Angeles and the nation as religious students exercise rights granted them 
by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a near-unanimous decision in June, 1990, the 
justices ruled that secondary schools must allow religious clubs on campus if 
other non-academic student organizations are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Christian clubs have begun cropping up at high schools throughout 
the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District. More than half the 
district's 49 high schools have groups that attract from five to 50 students at 
meetings held before class, during lunch or after school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley alone, about a dozen of the 17 Los Angeles district 
high schools have such groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of campus Christian clubs coincides with an increase in churchgoing 
by teen-agers. According to a recently released Gallup youth poll, half of the 
nation's youths attended church weekly in 1993, up from 45% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Some civil libertarians decry the campus organizations, saying they blur the 
line between church and state. But advocates of such associations, not least 
the students themselves, defend them as a legitimate gathering of youths with a 
mutual interest, akin to a chess or ski club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place for people who have a common belief in Christianity to come 
together and anybody who's curious about Christianity to come," said Daniel 
Chapman, a 17-year-old junior who leads El Camino's Chi Alpha group and often 
conducts the weekly Bible study. "It's a good resource." 
</P>

 "It's a way of witnessing to people . . . of fellowshipping with people at my 
school," added Deanna Turner, 17, who founded a Christian club at Sylmar High 
School in December. Her group, like most in the Valley, plans to devote itself 
to Scripture, prayer and mutual encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say the establishment of Christian clubs at high 
schools has sparked surprisingly little controversy so far. But because of the 
constitutional eggshells underfoot when it comes to religion on a public school 
campus, the system's legal office has issued strict guidelines on the proper 
application of the Supreme Court decision and the 1984 Equal Access Act, which 
initially unlocked classroom doors to religious meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Friedman, an attorney for the Los Angeles school district, said the 
high court ruling, known as the Mergens decision, broadened the Equal Access 
Act to put religious student groups on virtually the same footing as other 
clubs. With that status comes the ability to tap materials and resources 
available to other sanctioned organizations, such as use of the school bulletin 
or campus public-address system to announce meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the court ruling, the clubs must be student-initiated and led and should 
have a school staff member monitor proceedings. The law covers groups of any 
faith or ideology, but the vast majority of high school religious clubs in Los 
Angeles that have taken advantage of the liberalized environment are Christian, 
Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that the law would spawn meetings of devil-worshiping, neo-Nazi or hate 
groups have not materialized, either in Los Angeles or other parts of the 
country, said Charles Haynes, co-chairman of a broad-based religious and 
educational coalition that developed equal-access guidelines for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not in all my travels found the parade of 'horribles' that people 
predicted -- that there would be all these Satan clubs or proselytizing all 
over the place," said Haynes, a visiting professional scholar at Vanderbilt 
University's Freedom Forum First Amendment Center in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, clubs have been formed by Muslims, Jews 
and Korean Christians. "The kids are all very, very serious about their 
religion and I put out the red carpet for the positive things they are thinking 
about," said Fairfax Principal Mike O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who could be against them leading their lives in a socially acceptable way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, advocates contend that students across the nation are running into 
opposition in setting up such groups. In February, the conservative American 
Center for Law and Justice filed suit against school districts in New York and 
Virginia -- where the center is based -- on behalf of youths who alleged that 
they had been prevented from starting Bible clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The predominance of clubs with a Christian orientation is precisely what 
worries Carol Plotkin of the Pacific Southwest region of the American Jewish 
Congress. The congress, along with other civil-liberties groups, opposed the 
Equal Access Act and the Mergens decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we are philosophically against the creation of the clubs 
in the first place is that it puts minorities at a disadvantage, whatever the 
minority happens to be. We happen to be Jewish, and in a pluralist society it's 
hard to compete with the majority religion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not surprising that you don't see a Muslim club or a Buddhist club. We 
live in a majority Christian culture. And (in) the more fundamentalist 
organizations that are around, part of the religion is to spread the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Plotkin said her own son has had to turn away invitations from Christian 
friends to attend school Bible studies -- invitations that create a social 
pressure she believes teen-agers should not be subjected to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young, impressionable people, we don't believe should be approached on high 
school campuses. . . . This has to do with a belief system, with basic 
religious and moral standards, and that's what the 1st Amendment tries to keep 
separated" from schools, she said. "Religion is just one of those things you 
don't infringe on in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in the clubs deny that their goal is to aggressively 
proselytize in campus hallways and classrooms. Rather, they said, the groups 
offer an outlet for committed young people to integrate their faith with 
everyday life, much of which is spent at school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice to get involved with Christians at your school so you don't 
live a church life and a school life," said Melisa Powell, 15, of El Camino. 
"You can be a Christian at school." 
</P>
<P>
 But the students acknowledge that their meetings often have an evangelical 
bent, emphasizing the Christian message and encouraging members to bring 
non-Christian friends to either the campus gathering or the churches they 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus told us to go into all the world and preach the Gospel to those who 
don't know the Gospel," said 17-year-old Ray Causly, a senior at Monroe High 
School in North Hills and leader of its Christian Club. "And the people in our 
school are the ones we're most accessible to." 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs also offer support for students striving to live a Christian 
lifestyle in the midst of the temptations facing teen-agers today, such as 
drugs, sex and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that students need and want this kind of encouragement and 
alternatives," said Elva Quintero, faculty adviser for the 20-member group at 
Roosevelt High School on Los Angeles' Eastside. "They have a sense that they 
don't need to follow what society is projecting on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard E. Miller, who advises the Christian club at Fremont High School in 
South-Central Los Angeles, said the 20 or so students who meet twice a week 
during lunch in his wood shop class "really love Jesus, don't like gangbanging 
and want to get away from that type of life." The Bible study sessions have 
taken on a bilingual flair, with many students praying and reading in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as a group would show love to all people and show people how we live and 
how they're missing something," said Monroe High's Ray, who brings his Bible 
and a book of verses to school each day. Sometimes he gets needled as "Reverend 
Ray" by fellow members of the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray and a few other Christian Club friends congregate at one of their homes 
every Tuesday at 6:45 a.m. to pray for the success of their weekly lunchtime 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Camino, a handful of devout students gather on Thursdays, aside from 
their usual Monday meetings, also to pray -- for country, school and each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, the students said, there are miraculous results, like the time 
Melisa, who hurt her neck in a recent car accident, was able -- with her 
doctor's approval -- to remove in just a few days a brace he had expected her 
to wear for weeks. At other times the prayer is for emotional well-being, like 
the requests for divine comfort for a youth whose grandfather is stricken with 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake prompted Christian students at several schools to 
gather for mutual solace, said officials of Grace Community Church of Sun 
Valley, whose ministers often visit campus Bible clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They needed comfort, so we looked at the Psalms talking about the power and 
the love of God and at some of Jesus' teachings," Spencer DeBurgh, co-director 
of the church's youth ministry, said of one such gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All meetings must be attended by each group's faculty adviser. However, Los 
Angeles school district guidelines -- and those put out by Haynes' coalition of 
religious and educational groups -- mandate that supervising teachers be 
impartial observers. Staff advisers should refrain from commenting or 
participating in any way "that would convey either support or disapproval of 
meeting subject matter," according to a school district memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a school staff person who should maintain a neutrality," attorney 
Friedman said, "whether it's religion, politics, or sex, drugs and rock 'n' 
roll." 
</P>
<P>
 But practice may not always match the theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some club sponsors say they often participate, whether by singing songs with 
the students, praying aloud with them or even putting together the agenda for 
the week's Bible study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to keep the adviser 100% out of the activity in terms of 
being passive," said one teacher who asked not to be named. "He has concerns, 
too, that he may want to pray about. The idea of student-initiated (activities) 
is good, but there's no way to carry that through legally 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Christian club advisers complain that their groups, while not 
necessarily faced with open hostility from administrators, come under greater 
scrutiny than, say, the cheerleading squad or the debate club. 
</P>
<P>
 To Plotkin of the American Jewish Congress, such vigilance is all to the good, 
ensuring that no civil liberties or individual rights are trampled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep a close watch," she said. "We try very hard to maintain the 
separation. And we do enter . . . into lawsuits when we think there's a chance 
to make better laws than there are today." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the clubs see no contradiction between preserving religious 
freedom and allowing students to voluntarily assemble on campus to share their 
faith and spiritual experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could run a common denominator through every Christian club I've been 
at, it would be students encouraging other students to be strong in their 
Christian values," said Jamie Johnson, youth pastor at Osborne Neighborhood 
Church in Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's youth group includes a number of teen-agers involved in Bible 
study groups at their schools. Johnson hopes to link such clubs in a network to 
enable students to share ideas as well as promote a massive youth event, part 
of the much-anticipated five-day Valley crusade by evangelist Luis Palau. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, that event, planned for June 4, falls on the fourth 
anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling that allows religious societies at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest thing about having Christian Bible study clubs on campus is that 
it allows there to be a unity of all of God's people," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Baptist kids, there's Methodist kids, there's nondenominational kids, 
there's Catholic kids. The clubs allow them to have a meeting time where they 
would never otherwise get together." Guidelines Q&A 
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines on student-led religious clubs at public secondary schools were 
agreed upon a few years ago by 21 religious and educational organizations to 
help administrators interpret the Equal Access Act. The act became law in 1984 
and was upheld in 1990 by the U.S. Supreme Court in an 8-1 decision, Westside 
Community Schools vs. Mergens.  
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's religious groups ranged from the conservative National Assn. 
of Evangelicals and the Christian Legal Society to the liberal American Jewish 
Congress and the National Council of Churches. Also taking part were the 
National Conference of Christians and Jews and the U.S. Catholic Conference's 
education department. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational groups participating included the National Education Assn., the 
National Assn. of Secondary School Principals, the National PTA and the 
American Federation of Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress' primary purpose in passing the Act, according to the Supreme Court, 
was to end 'perceived widespread discrimination' against religious speech in 
public schools," according to the coalition guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 No change was made in the Supreme Court's prohibitions against 
government-directed prayer. But, the guidelines said, if a school permits 
student groups to meet for student-initiated activities not directly related to 
the school curriculum, it is required to treat all such student groups equally, 
even if they are religious in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the guidelines, which they put into question-and-answer form: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What does "student-initiated" mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It means that the students themselves are seeking permission to meet 
and that they will direct and control the meeting. Teachers and other school 
employees may not initiate or direct such meetings, nor may outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. May outsiders attend a student meeting? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, if invited by the students and if the school does not have a policy 
barring all "non-school persons." However, the non-school persons "may not 
direct, conduct, control or regularly attend activities of student groups." A 
school may decide not to permit any non-school persons to attend meetings of 
any club of any type, or it may limit the number of times during an academic 
year a non-school person may be invited to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. May teachers be present during student meetings? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, but there are important limitations. . . . In order to avoid any 
appearance of state endorsement of religion, teachers or employees are to be 
present at student religious meetings only in a "non-participatory capacity." 
The act also prohibits teachers or other school officials from influencing the 
form or content of any prayer or other religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about groups that wish to advocate or discuss changes in existing law? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Students who wish to discuss controversial social and legal issues such as 
abortion, drinking age, the draft and alternative lifestyles may not be barred 
on the basis of the content of their speech. The school is not required, 
however, to permit meetings in which unlawful conduct occurs.

HUNT FOR SOLUTION IS ON IN COYOTE CONTROVERSY; TRAPPING: L.A. OFFICIALS WILL 
REVIEW BAN IN FACE OF COMPLAINTS, BUT A LOOK AT 27 OTHER CITIES SHOWS THE 
METHOD TO BE INEFFECTIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 The nocturnal howls that awoke Lana Kuhlen from a dead sleep five months ago 
signaled a change in her Woodland Hills neighborhood and launched her into the 
midst of a contentious citywide debate over the merits of wild animal trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes soon began to feast on her neighbor's ducks, chickens and cats, 
leaving the carcasses on neighborhood lawns. Finally, a determined coyote 
scaled a six-foot fence to eat Kuhlen's own chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a huge problem, it really is," said Kuhlen, who lives in the flatlands 
of Woodland Hills, far from the traditional rural habitat of the coyote. "I 
kinda feel like we have become the fast food capital for coyotes out here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Kuhlen's complaints have been echoed many times over by 
distressed west San Fernando Valley residents, prompting the Los Angeles Board 
of Animal Regulation Commissioners to review its 10-month-old ban on coyote 
trapping. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of that review will be a dilemma with which cities throughout 
Southern California have struggled for years: Can trapping and killing coyotes 
put an end to coyote problems, or is a public education program more effective? 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles officials look to other Southern California cities for 
guidance, they will find that most municipalities faced with coyote problems 
use traps on a limited basis, relying primarily on educating the public about 
how to coexist with Canis latrans.  
</P>
<P>
 Of 27 Southern California cities with large wildlife populations, none 
completely ban coyote trapping, according to interviews with officials at the 
eight animal control agencies that serve those cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, animal control officials from those agencies stress that trapping 
is at best an ineffective, short-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
 By one estimate, trapping is successful only 10% of the time. Often, the traps 
snare more pets than coyotes. Moreover, when a coyote is killed, the remaining 
coyotes in the area tend to fill the void, usually with larger litters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think trapping is effective," said Marsha Wyatt, a state officer with 
the Pomona Valley Humane Society, which provides animal control services to 11 
cities in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. "When you move one adult 
coyote out . . . two juveniles will move in." 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, animal control officials tried coyote trapping on a large-scale 
basis about six years ago but found that only sick or injured coyotes were 
caught in the traps. The healthy coyotes that preyed on pets escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are too smart," said Alicia Goddard, a spokeswoman for the Pasadena 
Humane Society. "They didn't get the name 'wily coyote' for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena still traps and kills coyotes, she said, but only when a coyote is 
identified as a repeated threat to pets and people. In recent years, however, 
there have been few such calls -- which Goddard attributes to the agency's 
education efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena and other cities distribute brochures and pamphlets -- sometimes 
attached to utility bills -- to provide tips to residents on how to avoid 
coyote problems. Educational programs warn residents to put pets and pet food 
indoors at night, to fence yards and to keep garbage can lids secure -- thus 
cutting off the coyote's food supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities have produced local cable access shows to convey such 
information. Others mail information directly to new residents of hillside 
communities. In Laguna Beach, people who live in areas with coyote problems are 
not allowed to adopt cats from the city's shelters unless they promise that the 
cat will be kept indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officials say even such aggressive measures work only when 
entire neighborhoods take the precautions seriously. One household that leaves 
food out can create problems for everyone, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think public education is a reasonable approach but (expecting) . . . 
everyone to comply is overly optimistic," said Richard Wightman, deputy 
agricultural commissioner for the Los Angeles County Agriculture Commission, 
which provides animal control services to 12 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over coyote trapping in Los Angeles was sparked in June, 1993, 
when the Board of Animal Regulation Commissioners voted, at the urging of 
animal rights advocates, to ban all trapping of coyotes by city employees. 
Instead, the panel decided to launch its own educational program. The city 
printed about 5,000 brochures titled "Co-Existing With the Coyote," which are 
available at animal-control and council district offices, and is producing a 
cable access program on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 12-month period before the trapping ban, residents lodged 511 coyote 
complaints with the city, according to the Animal Regulation Department. During 
the same period, coyotes were blamed for the deaths of 116 cats, 23 dogs and 50 
other pets, mostly in the West Valley and West Los Angeles, the department 
said. In that same period, the city trapped and killed 34 coyotes citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 But after trapping was stopped, complaints about coyote sightings and attacks 
on pets rose. West Valley residents complain that coyotes have become so brazen 
that they enter back yards to stalk and kill pets in broad daylight. One 
Woodland Hills man says that in December a coyote came within six feet of his 
toddler son before the animal was chased away. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers attribute the increase in coyote attacks and sightings 
not to the trapping ban, but to recent floods, wildfires, droughts and other 
forces that have driven the animals out of their hillside habitats and into 
urban neighborhoods in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the escalating complaints, the Board of Animal Regulation 
Commissioners instructed its general manager to re-examine the city's policy 
and draft recommendations to address the new coyote problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are cowardly by nature, coyotes for the most part are not a 
threat to humans, wildlife biologists say. In Los Angeles County, animal 
regulation officials reported 15,276 animal bites on humans in 1993, none of 
them by coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 But coyotes do grow bold when they begin to rely on neighborhood food sources 
and, in the process, lose their fear of people -- much the way pigeons and 
squirrels in city parks become aggressive beggars, wildlife biologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyotes also are opportunistic, the biologists say. They will not bother to 
hunt mice, rabbits or other traditional prey when they have easy access to 
cats, pet food, or table scraps in open garbage cans. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the conclusion of an unusual 1985 study by a Pomona College biologist 
who compared the habits of coyotes in Claremont, where city-issued garbage cans 
have permanently attached lids, and Glendale, where lids were not attached. 
</P>
<P>
 The biologist's analysis of coyote droppings and the stomach contents of dead 
coyotes showed that coyotes in the Glendale area ate about 15 times as much 
human-generated garbage as coyotes in Claremont. He concluded that the tightly 
fitted, hinged lids on trash cans made the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite criticism of trapping, some animal control officials say it has been 
successful to some degree with coyotes that regularly feed on domestic pets. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Clemente, for example, padded leg-hold traps were used to catch five 
coyotes about two years ago, following a reported coyote attack on a small girl 
and repeated attacks on pets in a particular neighborhood, said San Clemente 
Fire Chief Jene Begnell. In San Clemente, the Fire Department oversees animal 
control services. 
</P>
<P>
 Begnell said the trapping did not end all coyote attacks in the city, but it 
eliminated those coyotes that were believed responsible for most of the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Begnell added, a wildlife biologist suggested that the coyotes that 
were causing the problems were probably the second generation of coyotes in 
that neighborhood to feed primarily on pets. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cities that still rely on trapping opt for cage-like box traps 
that lure animals in with food, considering the steel-jaw traps that clamp onto 
an animal's leg inhumane. By law, the animals caught in the cages must either 
be released or shot at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But box traps have limited success. In Burbank, where trapping is used to 
target coyotes that attack pets, box traps are steam-cleaned before they are 
used because coyotes can detect the scent of human beings on the traps. But 
even then, Burbank Animal Shelter Supt. Fred DeLange said the traps only catch 
a coyote about one out of every 10 times they are used. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, DeLange said Burbank trapped and killed three coyotes. At the same 
time, he said, the traps also snared a dog and a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such mixed results lead DeLange to concede that trapping does not end 
coyote attacks, he defended the policy as realistic. Education isn't a 
foolproof solution either, he said, except in a perfect world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never over, but this is the stand we have taken," he said. "We wouldn't 
have to go out and trap and shoot anything if everybody would do what they are 
supposed to."

RESTORED ENTRANCE TO PARK IS DEDICATED; RECREATION: ZEV YAROSLAVSKY CALLS 
20-ACRE SITE IN SHERMAN OAKS 'ANOTHER PIECE IN THE OVERALL MOSAIC.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The restored entrance to the 20-acre Dixie Canyon Park in Sherman Oaks was 
dedicated Saturday by conservation officials and Los Angeles Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who called the steep, wooded park "another piece in the overall 
mosaic" of recreational land in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Warren Beatty helped conservation-minded residents fighting development 
of the area by buying the 20 acres in 1977. A looping, half-mile trail was 
built the next year, but soon afterward, a giant pile of dirt from illegally 
graded land blocked the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer later settled with the city and paid to clean up the mess. But 
delays in obtaining city permits stalled efforts to give hikers access until 
December, when the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency, used its 
emergency authority to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing before a rock-faced retaining wall, steps and a boulder-strewn bed 
for a small stream that flows from the canyon and trickles down the center of 
Dixie Canyon Place, Yaroslavsky said such parks will be "important for the 
sanity of our community" as the metropolis grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we found out last January, houses come and go, but mountains you can only 
destroy once," he said. "Once you chop down the mountain, you cannot rebuild 
it. No FEMA grant, no SBA loan will rebuild the Santa Monica Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 John Diaz, deputy conservancy director, said if the agency is able to acquire 
land at the end of nearby Longridge Canyon, hikers could walk up to Mulholland 
Drive. "People would find it easier to park up there than here at the entrance 
of Dixie Canyon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another speaker was actor-environmentalist Ed Begley Jr., who arrived 
perspiring from his bicycle ride. Begley praised the man who recently appointed 
him to the conservancy, Mayor Richard Riordan, whom he first met while 
bike-riding in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Riordan is not just interested in bike riding; he's interested in 
preserving areas like this," said Begley, who is featured in the movie 
"Greedy." "It's up to us to make sure there is something left for our children 
and our grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston cited more than a dozen 
people who helped in the preservation and restoration fight, including nearby 
residents Peter and Eileen Doctorow, who donated land at the park entrance, and 
Barbara Asa-Dorian of Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Asa-Dorian said she became an ardent defender of the land in 1977 when she saw 
bulldozers grading it for homes. An admitted novice in the arcane workings of 
city departments and land-use laws, Asa-Dorian said she used a combination of 
research and guile to impress government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think women had any brains in those days, and I wasn't above 
wearing a tight shirt when I went downtown," she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was going to be a 90-foot wall here and 32 homes on the ridge," she 
said. "We got it down to 11 homes, and Mr. Beatty bought the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials surprised Asa-Dorian by revealing that the park's trail 
will be named after her. After shaking her head in disbelief, she recovered 
quickly: "I hope you all use my trail."

MAN POSING AS OFFICER MOLESTS GIRL; CRIME: POLICE SEARCH FOR THE ATTACKER, WHO 
SHOWED A BADGE TO THE VICTIM'S IMMIGRANT PARENTS TO GAIN ENTRANCE INTO THE 
HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who told a 7-year-old girl he was a police officer to gain entrance to 
her house and then molested her in her bedroom is being sought by Glendale 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, described as middle-aged, balding and overweight, with blue eyes and 
a large mole on his left ear, was allowed to enter the girl's home after 
showing her immigrant parents a police badge, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was playing on the front porch of her home on the 600 block of South 
Louise Street about 5 p.m. March 21 when a man in his 50s walked up to her and 
asked if she lived there, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she said yes, the man knocked on the front door and told her parents that 
he was investigating a report of child abuse concerning the girl and was 
referred by the city's Department of Children's Services, said Sgt. Sue 
Hodgman. 
</P>
<P>
 The man said he would need to speak with the girl in private and took her to 
her bedroom. Once inside the girl's room, police said the man ordered the girl 
to remove her clothes then fondled and molested her. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few hours, the parents heard the girl crying and opened the bedroom 
door. They told police they found the girl lying on the bed next to the man. 
The man told the parents he was finished and promptly left. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents then called police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents did not speak English very well," Hodgman said. "They trusted 
that the man was telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman said although the incident appears to be isolated at this time, the 
public should check for proper credentials and identification of law 
enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no problem with the police officer if a person wants to call the 
agency and verify who the person is," Hodgman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are seeking the public's help in capturing the suspect. Anyone with 
information is asked to call 818-548-4840.

DON'T PUT OUT THE WELCOME MAT FOR ILLEGALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * When will the Los Angeles Times take down its welcome sign for illegals? 
When will you stop making these criminals into heroes? 
</P>
<P>
 Ten or 20 illegals endanger themselves and us by hiding in small pickups and 
cars, and you print, "Immigrants' Dreams Also Died in Pickup Truck Crash" 
(March 17).Now you have a story of an illegal, "Joyful Escape Ends Behind Bars" 
(March 27) who hopes for asylum here "with no recreation, no TV, no library and 
regular visiting hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the Kleenex! Why does the L.A. Times sympathize with illegals who turn 
their backs on their people and deal with smugglers, make counterfeit documents 
and enter the United States illegally? 
</P>
<P>
 Take a reality check! Fact: You cannot solve the oppression, ethnic cleansing, 
lack of human rights, poverty, overpopulation for all the countries of the 
world by inviting all of them here for asylum. Real heroes work for change 
inside their own countries and respect the laws and rights of others.

VAL VERDE STORY BROUGHT BACK GOOD MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This letter is in reference to the article, "Val Verde -- A Forgotten Oasis 
of Freedom" (March 2). I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for Jocelyn 
Y. Stewart's presenting such a positive image of Val Verde and African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Many avenues have opened for me and the African American community because of 
Ms. Stewart's efforts. A representative from the Cable News Network read the 
article and featured Val Verde on March 6. I, along with Val Verde friends, 
appeared on national television. 
</P>
<P>
 The article rekindled precious memories within the African American community. 
I have received about 30 calls from friends that I met in Val Verde, including 
one that I had not spoken with in 30 years. The response that I received from 
the African American community was overwhelming. I also received calls from 
friends throughout the country after the CNN special. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to all of the members of the Los Angeles Times Valley Edition's staff 
who contributed to this article.

DON'T TAKE READERS INTO A GAY BATHHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was offended and repulsed by your column "Within the Walls of a Gay 
Bathhouse Lies a World of their Own" (March 10) and angered that a renowned 
newspaper like the Los Angeles Times would print such offensive information. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no community enhancement and nothing of any value or good in this 
article. Yet every reader -- no matter how young -- has been taken into a gay 
bathhouse! 
</P>
<P>
 I feel betrayed by your newspaper, because this is a sleazy article to me. I 
ask that you not print articles like this in your widely acclaimed newspaper.

POSITIVE STEP NEEDED FOR BURBANK CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What's the deal with Burbank's public schools? They sure aren't what they 
used to be! I wish "they" would do something about it! 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time, folks.Cities change. People change. But thousands of children 
continue to show up every day, ready to learn in buildings that haven't 
changed. They are run down and outmoded. It's time for the people of Burbank to 
take responsibility for their city's future. We're not talking about creating a 
decent environment in which our children can learn. We're talking about 
investing in and controlling the destiny of our city. 
</P>
<P>
 As Burbank moves toward the future, our public schools will play a major role 
in attracting quality business and encouraging the expansion of key companies. 
Public schools will provide businesses with skilled employees. Public schools 
will attract new taxpayers to our city. Strong public schools will raise 
property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: A "yes" vote on April 12 on the school bond issue will make an 
impact on much more than the future of Burbank's children. It will affect the 
future for all citizens of Burbank. Let's quit the nit-picking and bellyaching 
about the sad state of affairs and take a positive step toward making Burbank a 
model city by voting yes on school bonds.

COYOTE TRAPPING HEARING WAS UNFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As expected, the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission turned the coyote 
hearing at Parkman Middle School into a travesty and exhibited its hallmark bad 
faith and impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 After being expressly asked by Mayor Richard Riordan to refrain from bringing 
in "expert" witnesses, and instead of listening to and addressing the concerns 
of the public, the commission thumbed their noses at the mayor and his desire 
that all sides play on a level playing field.Three "experts" handpicked by the 
commission for their views against trapping coyotes had an opportunity to speak 
even before the two opposing sides had a chance to speak.  
</P>
<P>
 If the mayor and City Council feel they cannot remove or control the loose 
cannons on the commission, perhaps they should consider turning the entire 
department over to Los Angeles County. The citizens would get far better 
service, and the city would save millions of dollars.

LIBERTARIAN PARTY IS NOT ANTI-GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In his column about Libertarian Bill Carroll's refusal to take a handout 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (March 27), Scott Harris unfairly 
referred to the Libertarian Party as being "anti-government." Nothing could be 
further from the truth.We are not anti-government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, we are pro personal responsibility. We think government is very 
important when it comes to defending rights of individuals and the security of 
our borders. It is only in the many areas where we citizens have allowed 
government (often with a heavy hand) to go beyond these boundaries, casting 
itself in the role of parent for adult citizens, usurping our individual rights 
and responsibilities and enabling multitudes to become dependent on government 
taxation for so many aspects of their existence, that Libertarians harbor 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticizing these excesses doesn't make us anti-government; it makes us 
against governmental excess. By refusing FEMA money to which the law "entitled" 
him, Mr. Carroll has set a fine example of personal responsibility. In a 
society where, more and more, being a "victim" seems to be the preferred avenue 
to financial gain, Mr. Carroll's libertarian example of integrity and strength 
of character is a breath of fresh air indeed.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; EDUCATION IS HALF THE BATTLE IN AIDS FIGHT; PEER COUNSELING 
FOR TEEN-AGERS AND THE PLAY 'SECRETS' ARE IMPORTANT WEAPONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between the months of September of 1991 and 1993, the number of teen-agers 
diagnosed with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome nearly doubled, 
nationwide. And as if that weren't troubling enough, the National Commission on 
AIDS has also warned that such figures can be deceptive because the human 
immunodeficiency virus suspected of causing AIDS can incubate within the body 
for a decade or longer before symptoms occur. 
</P>
<P>
 And as if that weren't troubling enough, we now note that the level of 
ignorance of these matters among sexually active teen-agers is so overwhelming 
that it almost defies belief. Some still believe that only homosexuals can 
contract AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why efforts such as a 2-year-old North Hollywood program are so 
vitally important. In it, carefully educated teen-agers help staff the Valley 
Community Clinic on Vineland Avenue. One of their most important tasks is to 
impart accurate information to other teen-agers when the subject of sex comes 
up, as it often does. This is a thoughtful approach that takes advantage of the 
fact that some youths find it easier to discuss such matters with their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Unified School District has taken another welcome approach by 
allowing the production, this week, of a play that stresses the dangers of 
AIDS. The play, which will be staged at Burbank High School, was produced by 
the Kaiser Permanente hospital care organization. The play, "Secrets," has been 
seen by 700,000 California students. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Glendale Unified School District officials have been much slower 
to respond. Officials there canceled an effort to put on the same play at 
Hoover High School and only recently agreed to reconsider that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers are sexually active at alarming rates. Part of the response must 
include programs that teach youths about the dangers of AIDS.

THE NAME GAME HAS CROSSED THE LINE; OFFICIAL BOUNDARIES AND COUNCIL VOTE SHOULD 
BE REQUIRED FOR RENAMING A COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When urban ills venture too close to home, and when too many of the so-called 
common folk have moved onto surrounding streets, San Fernando Valley residents 
have a simple solution. Change the name of your neighborhood and, poof! -- 
instant upscale. Well, not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 Take North Hills, for example. This geographically featureless community was 
known as Sepulveda until residents in its western half renamed it North Hills 
in 1991 to disassociate it from drug and crime problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remaining half of Sepulveda also renamed itself as North Hills, and 
the original secessionists suddenly found themselves remarried. Sepulveda is 
gone. The crime remains; only the name has changed to protect the 
image-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 This all began in 1931, when Canoga Park was called Owensmouth for its 
reliance on Owens River water. "Who was Owen anyway, and why did I seem to live 
in his mouth?" asked one smart-aleck then. Goodby Owensmouth. Hello, Canoga 
Park, which was then "ready for the prosperity now on the way without having to 
overcome the handicap of a name calling forth unfavorable comment," according 
to the Owensmouth . . . er, Canoga Park Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gazette folded, Canoga Park faded, and its western residents defected to 
become West Hills in 1987. Now, it's all out of control. Newly named Sherman 
Village, for example, was a part of Studio City. It changed its name to avoid 
association with North Hollywood. (Still with us?) It's so small (40 homes and 
one mailman) that some who live and work there seem confused. "We're in Valley, 
uh, it's Valley something. Valley View. I forget," said a motel owner. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, perhaps, the name game merely shows which Valley neighborhoods 
are in demand, and which are not. Reseda, which can't even get a quake named 
after it, is out. Chunks of it have defected to Tarzana and Encino. Sherman 
Oaks is on top, having gained portions of Encino, North Hollywood and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with all of this is that it is a poor substitute for substantive 
change, and for the hard work of ridding down-on-their-luck communities of the 
problems that have caused their loss of popularity. We're talking about crime, 
economic malaise, poor planning and unimaginative leadership. It also sets 
neighbors apart from one another at a time when progress demands cooperation 
and a healthy dose of "we're-all-in-this-together" thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Los Angeles City Council members can change a community's name at 
the request of residents. A plan is in the works that would require official 
boundaries and a vote by the full council before more changes could occur. It 
should be approved before Valley residents isolate themselves even further.

VALLEY PERSPECTIVE; HATE CRIMES AGAINST ANYONE HURT EVERYONE; 2 SCHOOLS SHOW 
COMMENDABLE RESPONSE TO ACTS OF PREJUDICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a different way to view the victims of hate crimes in our region. Our 
source: the most recent set of statistics available from the Los Angeles 
County's Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 They show African Americans as hate crime victims, along with homosexual men. 
Jews have also suffered from hate crimes here, as have Arabs, Latinos, Anglos, 
Asians, lesbians, Protestants, females. And if you're feeling a little left out 
at this point, there was an "other" category for hate crime victims in the 
region that included other religions, other nationalities, other ethnic groups, 
other shades of skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone can be a victim of a hate crime. We point this out because some folks 
find it easy to be cavalier about such matters, or utterly uninterested. As 
long as the hatred is directed against some other and supposedly very different 
group and not your own, there is no reason to be concerned, right? Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Each new discovery of heinously racist literature, ethnically derogatory 
leaflets and religiously based vandalism ought to send a chill up your spine 
regardless of whether you are one of its intended targets. The moment we begin 
to countenance such ignorance and hatred through silence and indifference is 
the moment in which we allow hatred and ignorance to spread, perhaps far enough 
to ultimately include you. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds silly, then remember the following quote: "In Germany, they 
first came for the communists and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a 
communist. Then they came for the Jews and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a 
Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists and I didn't speak up because I 
wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics and I didn't speak up 
because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me. By that time, no one was 
left to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
 The quote is from Martin Neimoller, a German Protestant minister who was a 
leader of the church's opposition to Adolph Hitler. Neimoller was imprisoned in 
Nazi concentration camps from 1937 to 1945. A poster with those words can be 
found in the office of Kay Shafer, the deputy district attorney assigned to 
track hate crimes in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks like Shafer deal mainly with the criminality involved in such incidents, 
but there is more to do than that. An example can be found at Placerita Junior 
High School in Santa Clarita, which was recently the target of the largest 
distribution of hate literature in memory in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 1,000 flyers containing derogatory remarks about Latinos and 
Jews were stuffed into student lockers during the week of March 20, school 
officials decided to use the incident to launch discussions about racism, 
cultural diversity and tolerance. That week, Placerita teachers also began 
their lessons by using a program that shows students how to confront prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like anything else, you ask if you're going to give more attention to it by 
discussing the leaflets in class," said Placerita Principal Jim Tanner, who 
decided it was better to confront the matter. "We felt there was going to be 
more good coming out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayall Elementary School felt the same way -- and with good reason -- last 
October after vandals had twice defaced it with satanic symbols, swastikas and 
other images of gross religious intolerance. Rather than removing the vandalism 
before her students could see it, Principal Barbara Fuller had teachers escort 
their students past the messages of hate before holding discussions on racial 
and religious bias. Later, Fuller invited Shafer from the district attorney's 
office and Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker from the Los Angeles Police Department to 
discuss the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 If every such incident was met with similar resolve, education, and 
discussion, it would do much to keep the scurrilous hate-mongers at bay.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; BLAMING THE VICTIMS; THE CITY'S POLICY OF SUING 
CRIME-PLAGUED BUSINESSES, FORCING THEM TO POLICE PUBLIC AREAS AROUND THEIR 
STORES, PUTS A MISPLACED LAW ENFORCEMENT BURDEN ON MERCHANTS AND LEADS TO 
FORTRESS-LIKE SHOPS. AND IT DOES LITTLE TO DETER LAWBREAKERS. 
</P>

By GIDEON KANNER, Gideon Kanner is professor of law emeritus at Loyola Law 
School.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Suppose you run a business and you see drug-peddling or prostitution outside 
your store. What should you do? Call the police as a good citizen should? 
</P>
<P>
 You had better think twice these days if you live in the Valley. As crazy as 
it sounds, you might get sued by the city if you do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal activity has blighted areas around Van Nuys and Sepulveda boulevards. 
Convenience and doughnut shops that make their living by staying open around 
the clock are particularly hard hit. Night-owl criminals hang around those 
businesses -- after all, they need their hit of caffeine the same as anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 Note that the merchants aren't the lawbreakers. They are no hot-pillow motel 
operators. They are just people trying to make a lawful living under difficult 
circumstances. You would think that their responsibility in such matters would 
begin and end by calling the cops, reporting the crime and waiting for help. In 
some of these cases, there have been hundreds of calls to the police. When the 
cops come and make arrests, the effect is zero -- the druggies and hookers are 
back in business the next day. In some cases there have been hundreds of 
arrests, with nothing to show for it in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of going after the criminals effectively, the city has been 
increasingly responding to large-scale complaints by threatening to sue the 
merchants. City bureaucrats say it is the merchants' responsibility to clean up 
the public areas around their stores. Makes you wonder what we pay all those 
taxes for, doesn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 So if your block is overrun by thugs and you call 911 a lot, don't expect 
Dirty Harry to ride to the rescue. You may get a city attorney with a summons 
directed at you. All this provides a frightening insight into how the 
bureaucratic mind works. The city says all those cries for help only prove that 
your business is the problem. It's up to you to get out there, confront the 
hookers, pimps, gang members and druggies and get rid of them.  
</P>
<P>
 Fall down on the job and the city will shut down your business during late 
hours. That's "the law" says the city attorney, which illustrates that when 
Charles Dickens opined a hundred years ago that the law is an ass, he spoke for 
the ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflect on a case reported about a year ago, in which Superior Court Judge 
Diane Wayne ordered a Los Angeles restaurant owner to chase drug dealers away, 
post a sign announcing the restaurant was under police surveillance and search 
the restaurant for drugs before opening and closing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is no isolated incident. Last year, a Van Nuys mini-mall was ordered by 
Judge Raymond Cardenas to close from midnight to 4 a.m., hire security guards, 
surround the mall with a fence and install high-powered floodlights. Sounds 
more like Fort Apache than a mini-mall. Would you go shopping in a place that 
looks like an armed camp? Neither would others; many of the stores in such 
malls are now vacant. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the case of Jae Joo Kim, who, like a good citizen, reported 
crime, attended neighborhood meetings and testified against gang members 
arrested in his parking lot. For his trouble he found his store windows 
shattered by bullets and -- you guessed it -- he was sued by the city. Others 
were not so lucky. Donald Aragon, a Van Nuys apartment owner who was active in 
helping the police rid his neighborhood of gangs, was killed in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it. These days, when you decide to open a restaurant or a 
convenience store, you may wind up conscripted into the police, without police 
training, authority or resources. 
</P>
<P>
 We are used, of course, to bureaucrats' bungling, but it makes you wonder what 
goes through the minds of judges when they make such orders. Aren't they 
supposed to consider the legitimate interests of both sides? Who do they think 
runs L.A.'s doughnut shops? Wyatt Earp? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course if you actually do try to clean up Dodge City, that can get you in 
hot water too. Two years ago, a private security service using armed operatives 
was hired by some landlords and started cracking down on criminals effectively. 
It promptly became the object of a Police Commission investigation because its 
methods were too tough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The latest such controversy has gone where no bureaucrat has gone before, into 
the realm of out-and-out absurdity. In Van Nuys a woman named Mary Lou Holte 
has taken it upon herself to get rid of prostitutes by patrolling her area, 
taking notes on criminal activity and reporting it to the cops. This is a 
commendable activity, for which Ms. Holte has received accolades. The problem, 
however, is that maintaining street surveillance is hard work, so Ms. Holte 
periodically takes a load off her feet late at night at a Van Nuys doughnut 
shop, whence she calls the police to report the bad guys. Naturally, those 
calls are received by the cops from the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, apparently unhappy with all the extra work, 
has gone after -- you guessed it -- the doughnut shop owners. The LAPD says 
that its primary concern is the presence of criminals near businesses. 
Evidently the fact that the affected business owners are not criminals doesn't 
count; it's up to them to play cop and keep the local prostitutes out. Faced 
with that, Zuita and Ulysses Contador, the hapless owners, capitulated and will 
shut down from midnight to 5 a.m. just to keep Holte from using their shop as 
her command post. The cops' reaction? "We've won," Capt. James McMurray of the 
Van Nuys police station told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 They've what? The hookers and dopers are still there. They haven't been 
arrested. They can now move to some other local corner and harass some other 
innocent merchants. Excuse me, guys, but is that what you call a law 
enforcement "victory"? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And it isn't just the LAPD and the city attorney. The Los Angeles zoning 
administrator marches in lock step with the other bureaucrats and orders store 
owners to curtail business hours, put up fences, hire guards and remove 
electronic game machines, all in the name of suppressing crime. Good thing the 
zoning administrator does not regulate banks, or he might order them closed 
next time there is a wave of bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 There are economic consequences to all this. Somebody has to pay for all that 
private security and for the business lost when store operations are curtailed. 
The "fine" is imposed not on the criminals but on innocent bystanders. In the 
long run the costs are passed on to customers through higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have to live in economically marginal areas have little money as it 
is. It is outrageous that they should have to pay more for goods and services 
because their society has grown so inept, so incapable of assuring public 
safety, that it has to force mom-and-pop merchants to do the job the police are 
no longer capable of doing.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; A DIFFICULT DECISION FOR A BOOSTER OF LOS ANGELES; A LOCAL 
BUSINESS LEADER IS EVALUATING MOVING HIS MANUFACTURING OPERATION OUT OF 
CALIFORNIA. LEGISLATORS HAVE CREATED A NON-COMPETITIVE CLIMATE, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WALTER W. MOSHER Jr., Walter W. Mosher Jr. is president of Precision 
Dynamics Corp. and chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Driven by the state and the city's lack of interest in maintaining or 
attracting industry to the area -- including my existing manufacturing 
operation in Pacoima -- I am actively evaluating moving all or part of my 
$25-million-a-year businesses out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 This decision has not been an easy one. As a native of Los Angeles, I have 
devoted much of my personal and professional time to promoting the area, 
including my recent election to serve a two-year term as the chairman of the 
Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 VICA, a nonprofit business organization with 350 corporate members and 
affiliates, is dedicated in its efforts to preserve and encourage the economic 
vitality of the region. To some small degree, we have improved the business 
climate, but not even close enough for me and other manufacturers to remain 
competitive with those around the world or in neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 My fiduciary responsibilities to the shareholders and long-term employees of 
our company is to minimize expenses wherever possible in order to remain 
competitive in the worldwide markets we serve. The tax-and-spend attitude in 
California has placed my firm at a disadvantage, with a corporate income tax 
that costs between 5% and 11% more than our competitors. This can easily become 
the difference between profit and loss as our industry (medical devices) 
becomes ever more competitive and cost-sensitive. Clearly these tax costs 
diminish our ability to create jobs and new products. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as I love California, I am not willing to operate in a non-competitive 
environment by staying in this state, especially when neighboring states are 
aggressively courting us with very inviting business benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in Nevada and Texas the state corporate income tax is zero, 
compared to 11% in California. Their permitting processes are streamlined and 
business-friendly. Their regulatory agencies are not overlapping, self-funding 
and environmentally shortsighted. Education is a priority. And their business 
revenue programs are not unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to leave, and I despise the ABC (anywhere but California) 
industry relocation mantra that I hear from my colleagues in the medical-device 
industry. But to keep my firm -- and other businesses -- in Los Angeles, there 
must be significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
 These include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminating or dramatically reducing the state corporate income tax, at 
least for sales out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broadening and improving the one-stop permitting process instituted by Mayor 
Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restructuring regulatory agencies by eliminating self-funding and providing 
incentives to resolve problems rather than find fault and impose fines in order 
to continue to fund themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Streamlining government bureaucracies to reward competence instead of 
job-protected tenures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Empowering city and state managers to hire and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Refusing to spend city or state money on federal programs that the federal 
government won't reimburse, i.e., welfare and illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 To support the infrastructure, someone has to pay. However, if the state and 
city continue to drive businesses and jobs out of the area, where will the 
money come from? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is everyone's problem. I would like to stay here, and so would my 350 
employees. But I am tired of our company's being placed in a position where it 
could ultimately be forced out of business by staying in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I take my fiduciary responsibilities seriously. Why can't our legislators take 
theirs seriously? We must vote those that don't out of office now, before it is 
too late.

ELECTIONS / SANTA CLARITA CITY COUNCIL; AMID POST-QUAKE RECOVERY, CAMPAIGN HAS 
BEEN QUIET ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven residents are competing for three seats on the City Council, which 
controls a $50-million budget and has responsibility for suburban problems 
sometimes older than the city itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Jo Anne Darcy and Carl Boyer, who have served on the council since 
the city's incorporation in 1987, are seeking reelection in the April 12 race. 
Jill Klajic, who also was active in the cityhood effort, is running for a 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Clyde Smyth, former superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School 
District, and Linda Storli, a former city parks commissioner, are among the 
better known challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy, Smyth and Fred Heiser, an aerospace engineer who ran for a state Senate 
seat on the Libertarian ticket in 1992, have been the top fund-raisers in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Also seeking a council seat are Larry Bird, an apartment manager; Theodore De 
Vries, a waiter and zoo docent; Dennis Farnham, a police officer; Tim 
Jorgensen, a contract administrator, and Craig Wanek, a realtor. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of Ken Dean and Rosalind Wayman appear on the ballot, but both have 
dropped out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Roads, public safety and economic prosperity are top campaign issues -- with 
candidates calling for more streets, more sheriff's deputies and more business 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's main streets form an inverted triangle, with only one major 
route for traveling east or west through the city and several bottleneck-prone 
intersections. Leaders have sought for years to create additional traffic 
routes without intruding upon existing homes or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, those proud of Santa Clarita's reputation as a safe city watched 
nervously in 1993 as its low crime rate grew with additional graffiti and other 
vandalism. Efforts from a city anti-gang task force and volunteer 
graffiti-removal group have kept incidents in check, but concerns remain. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Santa Clarita is financially sound and withstood a wounded 
Southern California economy better than most cities, small businesses have 
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 All candidates have cited these issues as important challenges for the city. 
But many residents currently are more concerned with recovering from the 
Northridge earthquake than with politics, and the 1994 race for City Council 
has been a quiet one. Squabbles have been confined to illegal billboards and 
other promotional materials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the eight candidates who posted signs violated a local ordinance last 
month by not listing who paid for them, and a seventh printed the disclosure 
too small. The only candidate who obeyed the law quickly took his signs down 
for fear he'd done something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, complaints forced an incumbent to remove the city phone number 
from a billboard and another to stop using a variation of the city logo on 
advertising flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether from courtesy or common sense, political hopefuls campaigned little in 
the months following the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and now have just days 
left to get their messages to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the candidates, in alphabetical order, some of their positions and 
the amount they have raised for their campaigns follow: 
</P>
<P>
 * Larry Bird, 45, manages a Newhall apartment complex and wants to bring more 
curbs, sidewalks, street lights and other amenities to his community. He said 
he's frustrated that money is earmarked for neighborhood construction projects, 
but the work has not been done. "We don't have enough of anything, except city 
government. We've got enough of that." Bird has raised less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carl Boyer, 54, is an incumbent and high school history teacher. He wants to 
bring jobs to the city and believes his League of California Cities membership 
is an asset. He was active in Santa Clarita's cityhood drive and seeks 
compromises to solve problems. "Our goal must be to achieve consensus, 
cooperation and results." Boyer has raised $7,218. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jo Anne Darcy, 62, is an incumbent and field deputy for Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich. She wants to maintain a year-round disaster 
preparedness unit and expand citizen efforts to fight crime. Darcy hopes to 
increase tourism, film projects and various businesses in the Santa Clarita 
Valley. Darcy has raised $16,956. 
</P>
<P>
 * Theodore De Vries, 30, is a waiter and Los Angeles Zoo docent. He opposes a 
city smoking ban and closing City Hall alternating Fridays. De Vries calls 
local government unresponsive and is against funding a cowboy poetry festival 
while other needs exist. "I'm running for the City Council because I think 
their priorities are screwed," he said. De Vries has raised less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dennis Farnham, 49, is a Los Angeles Police Department officer and business 
owner. He wants to reduce crime by getting youths involved in positive 
activities and expanding Neighborhood Watch programs. Farnham said he'll retire 
from the LAPD if elected and believes his business background is important for 
handling a city budget. Farnham has raised $7,563. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fred Heiser, 37, is an aerospace engineer. He wants to develop a high-tech 
job market in Santa Clarita and says the city needs a grid system of roads. 
Heiser said he supports keeping taxes low, open government, making new 
development pay its own way and enforcing ordinances that make parents take 
responsibility for their children's actions. Heiser has raised $19,005. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jill Klajic, 47, is an incumbent and a former business owner and consultant. 
Although all candidates oppose the proposed Elsmere Canyon dump, she is perhaps 
its most vocal critic. Klajic cites her experience dealing with the issues 
facing Santa Clarita, and believes the quiet election race means the existing 
council is doing well. Klajic has raised $6,753. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tim Jorgensen, 45, is a contract administrator for a local ambulance 
company. He favors term limits and worries the young government here is 
settling for the status quo on issues. "There is no single divisive issue here. 
On the other hand, there is no single accomplishment by the incumbents that 
separates them from the challengers." Jorgensen has raised $1,700. 
</P>
<P>
 * H. Clyde Smyth, 62, is former superintendent of the William S. Hart Union 
High School District. He says earthquake recovery, crime, business retention 
and transportation are important city issues. "Attracting and retaining 
industry in this valley, so that residents can work where they live, will cut 
long-distance commutes and give people more free time for community service," 
he said. Smyth has raised $13,476. 
</P>
<P>
 * Linda Storli, 45, is a high school government teacher and former city parks 
commissioner. Public safety and roads are top issues on her agenda. She wants a 
sheriff's deputy on high school campuses and vows to tackle problems without 
concern for reelection. "I think we need to increase youth activities to 
decrease the peer pressure to get involved with gangs." Storli has raised about 
$3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Craig Wanek, 39, is a real estate agent. He says the council is too involved 
in politics and doesn't address local needs. Wanek wants more youth activities 
and public participation. He favors term limits and surveying residents 
regularly for their views. "There's a division between the city and the people; 
they don't communicate," he said. Wanek has raised less than $1,000.

GR8 PL8 DEB8; BELL GARDENS: THE CITY MANAGER GIVES UP HIS 'COLD' LICENSE PLATE 
DESIGNATION -- USUALLY RESERVED FOR INVESTIGATORS -- AFTER A CONTROVERSY 
ERUPTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The great plate debate has ended in Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 It was common practice for Bell Gardens city managers to have their vehicles 
equipped with so-called "cold" license plates, which the California Vehicle 
Code says can be requested by a police chief or district attorney for city 
employees who are engaged in "investigating actual or suspected violations of 
the law." So Police Chief Andy Romero requested the plates for City Manager 
Charles Gomez's city vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 A political firestorm erupted. When the smoke cleared, Gomez gave up the 
special plates, saying that they were not worth the aggravation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cold" plates, which look like ordinary license plates, are coded to make it 
difficult to access information about the driver from the Department of Motor 
Vehicles, said DMV spokesman Bill Madison. They are issued primarily to police 
officers, judges and district attorneys, and are often requested by police 
agencies for use by undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy started when residents all over town received flyers in the 
mail charging that Gomez and Romero "allegedly participated in perjury of 
documents violating the California Vehicle Code." The flyers, a one-page 
newsletter called Current Times, were headlined "Police Chief and City Manager 
Allegedly Involved in Conspiracy and Perjury Scandal." The origin of the 
newsletter, which appears to have been printed on a desktop publishing system, 
was not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez speculated that it was distributed to smear council incumbents Josefina 
Macias and Rosa Hernandez, who voted to hire him and Romero. Neither Macias nor 
Hernandez, who are up for reelection in the April 12 election, are mentioned in 
the newsletter, however. Neither returned calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 "Having this flyer mailed to every house in the city is not a good thing to 
happen right before an election," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said he filled out a DMV form requesting the plates after city staff 
members told him two former city managers had used them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the idea of having undercover plates on his car appealed to him 
because they would be less conspicuous than exempt plates, the familiar 
official tags with an "E" in a hexagon preceding the plate numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyer, however, suggested a different motive. "Maybe you should ask City 
Manager Gomez if he was able to avoid a traffic citation while driving a 
vehicle with undercover police plates," the flyer states. "Is this his intent?" 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said he signed the DMV form authorizing Gomez to receive the plates 
because he also understood previous city managers had them. The plates were 
placed on Gomez's city vehicle in February. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Mike Estrada said he interpreted the vehicle code to mean Gomez 
could legally use the plates because he is often called to investigate code 
violations.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the vehicle code, when taken literally, restricts use of the plates 
to law enforcement officers, Gomez's use of the plates is not illegal, "but may 
be unethical," Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV does not investigate vehicle code violations unless it receives a 
complaint, Madison said. The department relies on police personnel and district 
attorneys who apply for "cold" plates to police themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens officials have ordered exempt plates -- used on all government 
vehicles -- to replace Gomez's non-exempt plates. Neither non-exempt nor exempt 
plates allow drivers special privileges, but license and registration fees are 
waived for both. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Deitch said that he is satisfied with Gomez's offer to 
remove the non-exempt plates, but he does not believe that Romero should have 
signed the form in the first place and has called on the council to reprimand 
Romero and Gomez.

ELECTION'S BITTER ROOTS RUN DEEP; POLITICS: BILL MABIE AND ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA 
ARE LOCKED IN A BRUISING PRIMARY FIGHT TO FILL RICHARD POLANCO'S 45TH ASSEMBLY 
DISTRICT SEAT.

<P>
 In an area with a history of bitter campaigns, the June Democratic primary 
race in Northeast Los Angeles' 45th Assembly District is likely to mirror past 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Front-runners Bill Mabie and Antonio Villaraigosa are gearing up for a 
bruising primary contest to fill a seat being vacated by Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who is running for the state Senate. The winner is 
virtually assured of victory in the November general election, because 62% of 
the district's registered voters are Democrats. Three other Democrats, one 
Republican and one Libertarian candidate are also running. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the Latino-majority district not only pits candidates backed by 
two political rivals -- Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina and Polanco 
-- but it also threatens to divide Latinos who have supported Polanco. Some 
Polanco allies are upset that he is endorsing Mabie, his white chief of staff, 
in a district that has had Latino representation in the Assembly for more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The election is also clouded by the threat of a no-holds-barred slugfest. Each 
camp, vowing to stick to the issues, is charging that the other is preparing to 
run a dirty campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco won his Assembly seat in a bitter 1986 contest against then-Highland 
Park bondsman Mike Hernandez, who is now a City Council member. The election 
was marred by criticism of Polanco campaign mailers accusing Hernandez of 
"making money" by letting child molesters and rapists "out on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's race is shaping up to be no less confrontational, in part because 
the consultant who designed the 1986 mailers, Richard Ross, is directing 
Mabie's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Polanco has said to at least three individuals that this is going to 
be the dirtiest campaign that the Eastside has ever seen," Villaraigosa said. 
"It's been a modus operandi for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco denies making those comments. And Mabie called Villaraigosa's remarks 
"political disinformation." He said he is running the campaign, not Polanco or 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie also questioned why Villaraigosa paid $6,000 to hire Smart Campaigns, a 
Northern California firm that researches opposing candidates. Such firms 
generally compile background information used to discredit or smear an 
opponent's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's planning to run a clean campaign, I can't understand why he would 
spend that kind of money for that type of firm," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa says the race is his to lose, pointing to his longtime ties to 
the community and a host of high-powered endorsements. Along with Molina, his 
supporters include Reps. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), Lucille Roybal-Allard 
(D-Los Angeles) and Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente); Los Angeles City Council 
members Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez and Mark Ridley-Thomas; county 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, and the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those endorsements reflect an acknowledgment of my 25 years of 
grass-roots work on behalf of this community," said Villaraigosa, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie, 32, countered that Villaraigosa's endorsements reflect his connection 
to the "Molina machine" more than his community support. Come election day, he 
says, voters will look at the qualifications of the candidates, not who is 
backing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this contest is judged on the merits of the candidates, I think I come out 
ahead," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie is endorsed by Assembly members Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles) and Martha 
M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park), and Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, among 
others. He is also endorsed by the Hollywood Highlands Democratic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Actively campaigning since the fall, Villaraigosa has amassed a commanding 
20-to-1 lead in fund raising. According to campaign statements, Villaraigosa 
has raised $105,218 so far and says he hopes to collect an additional $245,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie reported raising $5,405 of the $150,000 he says he will need to win the 
race. He discounts his opponent's fund-raising lead, saying that "early money 
is like a quarter in a kid's hand -- it's spent quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates say crime, education and economic development are the 
district's top concerns. Both tout their community work and their respective 
backgrounds as making them the most qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a doctor, Mabie grew up with eight brothers and sisters in a 
comfortable home in the east San Gabriel Valley city of Claremont. After 
graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a degree in political science, he 
joined the Peace Corps and spent two years in Honduras, where he designed and 
managed fish hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie is president of the Highland Park Chamber of Commerce, among other civic 
organizations. He is also the founder of Gardens for Kids, a nonprofit 
organization that builds gardens at urban schools in Los Angeles to teach 
youths about science and agricultural careers. He and his wife live in Highland 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have worked with the people of this district, from Ramona Gardens to 
Hollywood, from Echo Park to Eagle Rock, and I know the issues that are 
important to the residents of this area," Mabie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa is one of four children raised by a single mother in a poor home 
in the Eastside neighborhood of City Terrace. Though he dropped out of 
Roosevelt High School in the 11th grade, he says he re-enrolled the next year 
and graduated on time in 1971 after attending day and night classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa graduated from UCLA with a degree in history. He has served as 
president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and 
president of Local 3200 of the American Federation of Government Employees, 
among other organizations. As Molina's alternate to the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority board of directors, he has developed a reputation as 
an advocate for bus riders. Villaraigosa lives with his wife and four children 
in Mount Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been battling to increase representation and opportunities for everyone 
all of my life," Villaraigosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos have represented portions of the 45th district since 1968. Within the 
district's current boundaries, which stretch from Highland Park to Echo Park, 
63% of the 370,000 residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has been the focus of lengthy civil rights battles that resulted in 
court-ordered reapportionments to create Latino-majority districts for the City 
Council and county Board of Supervisors. Some Polanco supporters charge that he 
has turned his back on those hard-fought victories by endorsing Mabie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of maintaining and electing Latino candidates, especially in a 
district where we have fought so hard for Latino representation," said state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), who backed Polanco when he was first elected 
to the Assembly but said he will consider Villaraigosa in this year's contest 
if the campaign gets dirty. "Certainly, candidates who are not Latinos would 
have ample opportunity to run in other districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco said there were several Latinos he would have endorsed, such as 
Leticia Quezada, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, but that none 
was willing to run. He said he decided that Mabie was the most qualified 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not, on the knee-jerk, going to support someone who will not be the best 
candidate based on the color of their skin," Polanco said. 45th District at a 
Glance

CANDIDATES' VIEWS ON ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Antonio Villaraigosa and Bill Mabie, the front-runners in the 45th Assembly 
District's June primary, both say that crime, education and economic 
development are the top three issues facing the area. CRIME 
</P>
<P>
 * Both candidates oppose the recent "three strikes and you're out" bill signed 
into law by Gov. Pete Wilson, which aims to put those convicted of three 
violent or serious felonies behind bars for life. The candidates say that the 
state cannot afford to build the prisons to house the additional inmates, and 
that the measure is likely to fill the prisons with nonviolent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I think we need to put away violent criminals," 
Villaraigosa said. He added that he supports a less-restrictive measure that 
would only target three-time violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie said he, too, would support a less-restrictive law. "I do believe that 
if you have committed three violent offenses, you should be removed from 
society," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both also support boot camps for juvenile offenders, provided that the 
facilities have rehabilitation and education components. Both oppose 
legislation that would allow youths younger than 16 to be sentenced as adults 
if they are convicted of violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue on which the two candidates differ is the death penalty. 
Villaraigosa is opposed; Mabie supports it. EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
 * The two candidates say more funding is needed for public schools to increase 
the amount California spends per student; the state currently ranks 42nd among 
the 50 states. But they differ on how that money should be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie says that he personally supports a 1% increase in the state income tax 
to help fund the gap, but adds that he would only vote in favor of higher taxes 
if residents in his district approve. He said he would hold community meetings 
to gauge residents' sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa advocates limiting bureaucracy spending to 5% of a school 
district's total expenditures to save money. He also favors closing tax 
loopholes for banks and oil corporations and diverting the revenue that would 
be generated to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also differ on one of the most contentious education issues in 
the district -- the proposed construction of a new high school in the 
Temple-Beaudry area. Villaraigosa supports the site proposed near Belmont High 
School, and Mabie favors a site in Mid-Wilshire. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
<P>
 * Both candidates say they would try to lure more light manufacturing 
businesses to the area and increase public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to stimulate the economy and create jobs is to invest in public 
infrastructure," Villaraigosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Mabie said, he would introduce legislation mandating local hiring 
goals for the billions of dollars in public works projects financed by state 
bonds. "If a good chunk of that were directed for local hiring, we would see a 
lot of people get jobs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates say they support investment in alternative-fuel technology as 
a way to spur the growth of local businesses that would develop to support the 
clean-air industry. ROBERT J. LOPEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL; AFTER 26 YEARS, CITY HIRES NEW LAW FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to boost the city's sagging finances, the City Council dismissed 
a law firm that represented Bell for 26 years and accepted a bid from a new 
counsel for one-third the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted last week to accept a proposal from the Los Angeles firm of 
Oliver, Barr & Vose to represent Bell for $120,000 to $150,000 per year.The 
firm, scheduled to start providing the city with legal services this week, was 
selected from among 17 contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The city paid the Los Angeles firm of Burke, Williams & Sorensen, which has 
represented Bell since 1968, an average of $475,000 per year -- more than $2.3 
million over the past five years, said Robert A. Rizzo, chief administrative 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman George Cole said the council had not only been "looking everywhere 
across the board" to save money, but that it was also searching for "more 
aggressive legal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 75% of California cities contract out for their legal services because 
it is less expensive than maintaining an in-house legal staff, said attorney 
Edward Lee of Oliver, Barr & Vose. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of an effort to shore up Bell's general fund, which has been 
ailing since the 1992 closure of the California Bell Club, once the state's 
largest poker parlor, Rizzo said. The casino once brought the city $2 million a 
year. JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; CITY LEADERS DIVIDED OVER SMOKING 
BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City leaders are divided on the merits of a smoking ban proposed for a 
majority of Huntington Park's 50 restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council created a task force last winter to study how an ordinance 
outlawing smoking in city restaurants would affect local merchants. The plan 
would ban smoking in establishments that do 51% or more of their business in 
food sales. Businesses that sell food but whose primary business is sales of 
another product -- for example, bars that sell more liquor than food -- would 
be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Jackson said he is concerned that the proposed ordinance, 
scheduled to be considered by the council this month, would prompt smokers to 
go to venues outside the city where they could light up after meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to study this proposal to determine what we would accomplish here -- 
we don't want to undermine our merchants," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park's proposed anti-smoking ordinance will allow the city's 10 
largest restaurants to have small smoking sections to keep patrons from 
traveling to surrounding areas, said Mayor Ric Loya. The task force compromised 
to accommodate large eateries that have sophisticated ventilation systems in 
separate smoking sections, Loya said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Huntington Park's neighbors, including Maywood, Bell, Cudahy, Vernon 
and South Gate, have banned smoking in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill that would abolish smoking in almost all indoor workplaces throughout 
the state has been approved by the state Senate Judiciary Committee. However, 
its author, Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), has threatened to 
withdraw the bill unless amendments are removed that would prohibit cities from 
adopting stricter anti-smoking ordinances and allow smoking in up to 25% of the 
space in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force survey of 95 restaurant owners in Huntington Park, Bell and Bell 
Gardens showed that 55% of them would support a law banning smoking in 
restaurants. However, 30% of the owners were concerned that a ban would cause 
them to lose business. The survey was done in conjunction with the American 
Lung Assn. and the California Department of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Loya said warnings from the Environmental Protection Agency that second-hand 
smoke can be deadly prompted the council to form the task force. JENNIFER

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: VERNON; ALCOA WORKERS LOOK WORRIEDLY TO FUTURE 
</P>

<P>
 After 28 years as a parts inspector at the city's Alcoa plant, Charles Adams 
may retire years earlier than he had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, 50, said that last month's surprise announcement by the Aluminum Corp. 
of America that it will close the 56-year-old facility has left him with few 
options. Because of his long tenure, Adams is eligible through his union 
membership for retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may try to get some training or some kind of schooling," Adams said. "It's 
hard. I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 And he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 George Rodriguez, who has been casting aluminum plates at the plant for 15 
years, said many Alcoa employees did not graduate from high school and have 
weak reading and writing skills. "These people are concerned they don't even 
have basic skills required of any job," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez is cautiously optimistic, saying he would like to study to become an 
electrician or a computer repairman -- but that even with such retraining, 
California's job market is flooded with qualified applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the 700 workers who will lose their jobs or be relocated to 
Alcoa plants in Cleveland, Baltimore and Chandler, Ariz., expect to hear this 
week when their last working day will be, said John Tibbits, 35, a 17-year 
Alcoa employee and union officer. The company said the gradual shutdown will 
begin May 13 and be completed by November. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcoa announced the closure March 15 after officials failed to win wage 
concessions from the plant's 481 union employees in an effort to cut costs. 
Union officials said members did not wish to negotiate further because they 
believed they had made enough concessions in the past. The union was in the 
first year of a three-year contract, negotiated last summer, with no wage 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 But union representatives have yet to negotiate a "close-out" agreement with 
the company to determine how jobs will be phased out. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Hurd, president of Local 808 of the United Auto Workers of America, said 
that Alcoa employees are frustrated with the lack of communication between the 
company and the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workers know it will eventually come to pass that they will have to leave. We 
just haven't been given a list of what areas will go first," said Hurd, who has 
maintained equipment at the facility for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the electricians, carpenters, toolmakers and mechanics who mold 
aluminum into baseball bats, aircraft landing gear and airplane skeletons will 
have to change careers in order to find new jobs, said Ned Scott, a UAW 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority of these workers will need training in another field due to the 
fact that the aluminum business is virtually incapacitated now," said Ned 
Scott, a UAW negotiator.  
</P>
<P>
 With reduced operations at Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and other Southern 
California manufacturers of aircraft parts, Alcoa workers have few options in 
the arena of aircraft parts manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many may find work at other manufacturing companies through the UAW Labor 
Employment & Training Corps in Bell, Scott said, although the nonprofit, union 
affiliate only provides training when positions are available at other plants.  
</P>
<P>
 Adams, who sits on a UAW membership committee to find employment-training 
programs for Alcoa workers, said the panel has had a difficult time finding 
programs that will fit members' needs. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 Friends of the Hyde Park Branch Library will sponsor a baked goods and used 
book sale Saturday to raise funds for the library at 6527 Crenshaw Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior librarian Arthur Pond said the branch needs money for a variety of 
supplies and materials, including video and audio equipment.He said he 
particularly wants to attract guest artists, such as storytellers, to increase 
interest in the library in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really see (the library) going down Crenshaw at 45 miles an hour," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pond added that more volunteers are urgently needed for the Friends group, 
which has dwindled to three members. "In general, we need more ongoing 
community support," he said.

 The Jefferson Vassie D. Wright Memorial Branch Library opened its expanded 
facility last week at 3311 W. Jefferson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening was marked by a ribbon-cutting ceremony, used book sale and 
daylong musical celebration in nearby Shaw Park. Improvements, which took about 
eight months to complete, included a new foyer, carpet, paint and installation 
of public restrooms -- the first for the library since opening in 1923. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long time in coming, but we're really happy about this," said senior 
librarian Gladys Cole. "This is the only library in the Jefferson Park area. . 
. . It's important to the community as a resource, particularly for kids."

 The cable channel Black Entertainment Television held its first Comicview 
awards show last week at the Vision Complex Theater, drawing legions of 
celebrities and marking the first time the theater has played host to a 
televised event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marla Gibbs' theater is great, and it's great that BET chose to have the 
awards here," said soul singer Vesta, who hosted the show.About 300 musicians, 
stand-up comics and fans packed the Vision auditorium, which was refurbished in 
Art Deco style for last August's Los Angeles Festival. Awards presenters, hosts 
and attendees included comedian Lawanda Page, television actors Darryl Sivad 
("Roc") and T'Keyah Crystal Keymah ("In Living Color") and comedian Richard 
Pryor.  
</P>
<P>
 The awards show was a culmination of BET's second season of "Comicview," a 
weekly series that showcases up-and-coming comedians taped live at the 
Normandie Casino in Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 Awards went to Dante (best impressionist, best music comedy, most cutting 
edge), Lovell Crawford (rising star), Amazing Grace (best impersonation) and 
Just June (best female comic). Each of the eight finalists competed to star in 
their own half-hour "Grandstand Comedy Jam" on BET. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest honor, the Richard Pryor Award, went to comic Cedric the 
Entertainer. Pryor's sharp, socially observant material in the 1970s influenced 
a generation of black comedians, including those who performed excerpts of 
their routines during the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Comicview Awards will air on BET later this year. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; CARPENTERS FILE SUIT AGAINST CONTRACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A partnership between a Long Beach general contractor and four 
South-Central-based contractors that was heralded as a trailblazing 
collaboration in post-riot Los Angeles has disintegrated into acrimony and a 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Collins Group, four contractors who are members of the Black Carpenters 
Assn., filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on Feb. 14 alleging that 
Har-Bro Inc. led them to believe that they would receive substantially more 
than they got in profits after they helped rebuild a Thrifty drugstore at 
Crenshaw Boulevard and Rodeo Place that was burned out in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Rod White, William Collins, Jake Bellamy and Michael 
Matthews received only $34,000 instead of the roughly $300,000 in profits they 
were expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 Har-Bro attorney Paul Nankivell said the company also expected to make more 
money, but that because of job delays and unexpected construction costs, 
profits are next to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The total cost is still being ironed out, but we just didn't make the money 
the Collins Group assumed we would make," Nankivell said. "Being unfamiliar 
with large construction jobs, I think they had unreal expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership received national media attention after Thrifty awarded the 
$1.3-million contract to the joint venture in January, 1993. Har-Bro approached 
the Black Carpenters Assn. about forming the partnership after Thrifty 
stipulated that 50% of the subcontractors and work force had to be members of 
minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 White said the partnership with Har-Bro seemed too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, said White, here was a chance to employ sizable numbers of black 
workers on a job in the community. It seemed like an opportunity to redress a 
longstanding complaint of employment exclusion that blacks and other minorities 
frequently have leveled at commercial builders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the adolescents, and they (Har-Bro) were the mentors, but we were 
deceived," White said. "We did all the work on the project but aren't reaping 
any benefits. We did everything in good faith because we were so anxious to do 
the job, help our people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Collins Group paid 17 subcontractors, nearly all members of the Black 
Carpenters Assn., to finish the work over 10 months. The Collins Group received 
the $34,000 in increments over that time in addition to money for materials and 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides say that tensions increased in the partnership over the course of 
construction, which began in February, 1993, and ended in November. Nankivell 
said Har-Bro was not satisfied with the work of some subcontractors, and delays 
set in as work had to be redone or new workers hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins Group members say Har-Bro fired some subcontractors unnecessarily in 
the middle of jobs and brought in cheaper, mostly Latino workers to finish up. 
Har-Bro filed bonds against two subcontractors, leading to the suspension of 
their state licenses and forcing one out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, Bellamy said he and his partners were determined to 
finish the job, the largest one the association had ever been awarded. 
Association attorney David Ganezer accused Har-Bro of exploiting that desire. 
"It was like, 'We got good press from getting black partners and black 
subcontractors, so we can get rid of these guys,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nankivell called the allegations "unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Har-Bro is an open book," he said. "I've told them many times they're welcome 
to do an audit." 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty Corp. expressed surprise that its commitment to employ a 50%-minority 
work force at two Crenshaw-area sites ended in a lawsuit. The other Thrifty, at 
Crenshaw Boulevard and Slauson Avenue, was rebuilt by other contractors, and 
Thrifty said no problems developed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very sorry to hear about this," said Thrifty Executive Vice President 
Chris Bement, whose company is not named in the suit. "Once the contract was 
awarded, our relationship with both parties was at arm's length. Hopefully, 
they can work it out." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; SIGN OF THE TIMES: CESAR CHAVEZ AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shouts of "Viva Cesar Chavez" could be heard throughout last week's dedication 
ceremonies that turned Brooklyn Avenue into Cesar E. Chavez Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren from Pacoima, Pico-Union and East Los Angeles attended the 
two-hour ceremony for the street sign unveiling Thursday, Chavez's birthday, at 
the five-points intersection at Indiana Street, where the city and county 
borders meet. The red flags of the United Farm Workers of America were hoisted 
by the scores who had come to witness the name change of one of the city's 
oldest streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and City Council approved the name 
change in October. Some local merchants opposed the change, saying the street 
was once the center of Boyle Heights' Jewish community, and they fear that 
history will be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 The new signs show that the street was formerly Brooklyn Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that when I drive up and down this street, which was Brooklyn Avenue 
and some people will continue to call it Brooklyn Avenue, that now it's going 
to be Cesar E. Chavez Avenue," said Supervisor Gloria Molina, who then led the 
crowd of about 250 in shouts of praise for Chavez, who died last April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Speeches were marked with memories of Chavez, his historic fights for farm 
workers in California's Central Valley and his fasts to bring attention to the 
plight of the workers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 David Martinez, secretary of the UFW and a friend of Chavez's, spoke of the 
continuing struggle. "There are frightening rates of cancer and birth defects 
among our children," Martinez said. "And to add misery to the suffering of our 
children, one out of three children goes hungry every month. Guess whose 
children they are?" 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alatorre, who as an assemblyman authored legislation to 
allow secret ballots for farm worker union votes, said the street name change 
was a token of the people's appreciation for Chavez's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lived his life for justice, and we must never forget what he stood for," 
Alatorre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Tamayo, 7, and his classmates from Esperanza Elementary in Pico-Union, 
sat at the back of the crowd until the strong sun forced them to the shaded 
curb. Their teacher, Tery Betancourt, made sure they knew what they were there 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped all the people," said Charlie. "Cesar Chavez helped all the poor 
people." MARY ANNE PEREZ

 Dance groups from Garfield, Jefferson, Lincoln, Roosevelt and Wilson high 
schools will perform together Friday in Esplendor Mexicano, a tradition that is 
being resurrected after 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson High dance instructor Andres de la Garza brought Esplendor Mexicano 
back with cooperation from the other schools.Started in 1976 by former teacher 
Gema Sandoval, the performances faded away a decade ago. De la Garza, who had a 
Belvedere Junior High School group perform in the annual event when he taught 
there, wanted to bring back the tradition for his new students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to have the opportunity to remember where they come from, even 
though they live here, and be involved in the arts and participate in a large, 
organized affair," De la Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson High's group will perform dances from the Mexican state of Chiapas, 
Garfield High's will be doing dances from the Huasteco region of Tamaulipas, 
Lincoln High's will perform dances from Sinaloa, Roosevelt High's will dance 
polkas from the northern region and Wilson High's will perform dances from 
Nayarit. The 100 students taking part have been practicing for a finale that 
will bring all the couples onto the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a performance by the group Hueyapan from Mexico and by 
Banda America, which is composed primarily of students. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances start at 7:30 p.m. at El Sereno Junior High School 
Auditorium, 2839 N. Eastern Ave. A $3 donation will go to the schools.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; FUND-RAISER FOR UCLA STUDENTS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent fund-raiser dinner to assist seven students involved in last year's 
demonstrations for a Chicano studies department at UCLA failed to raise money, 
an organizer said, but it did succeed in acknowledging their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dinner at Tamayo's Restaurant was sold out and 250 people 
attended, the costs were greater than anticipated, said Elo Castillo, an 
administrative assistant with the UCLA Chicano studies program who organized 
the March 25 event. There were problems in mailing the invitations out on time, 
Castillo said, and tickets originally priced at $100 were reduced to $35. 
"We're just amateur fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds were to have helped the seven students being held responsible for 
$27,000 in damage to the Faculty Center in their effort to reimburse the 
school. "This is very demoralizing for them," Castillo said.  
</P>
<P>
 The damage -- a broken window, damaged furniture, defaced artwork and 
vandalism -- occurred in a May 11 demonstration for the establishment of a 
Chicano studies department with its own budget to hire faculty and direct its 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chancellor Charles E. Young denied the students' request -- on the eve 
of Cesar Chavez's funeral -- they went on a hunger strike. That ended 14 days 
later when the university agreed to establish the Cesar Chavez Center for 
Chicano Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The center operates as an inter-departmental program, borrowing faculty from 
other departments, while it is in the process of recruiting its own faculty. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the seven students have raised $7,000 through fund-raisers. A dance 
in October at a South-Central hall ended in the shooting of two students who 
have since recovered. No arrests have been made in that attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The university has agreed to allow the students to earn money to pay off their 
debt at Edutrain, a Downtown nonprofit education program that enrolls high 
school dropouts. The university students tutor or supervise activities, 
reducing their debt $10 for each hour.  
</P>
<P>
 Student Michael Brewer, 21, works six to eight hours a week at Edutrain, holds 
a part-time job as a teacher's assistant at an elementary school and is a 
full-time student in the Afro-American studies program. He fears that the 
remainder of the debt will still be outstanding by a May 11 deadline, which, if 
not met, could result in the city attorney's office filing various charges 
against the seven. Brewer, who faces felony vandalism charges, maintains his 
innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "You try to combat discrimination and this is what happens," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin Ochoa, 21, who went on the hunger strike but does not face any 
charges, said the past year has been discouraging for those who fought to 
establish the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a shame that the community and people have put so much into it 
and the students that wanted social justice are facing prosecution," Ochoa 
said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ELYSIAN VALLEY; NEIGHBORS WANT FACTORY MOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of this community along the Los Angeles River have renewed their 
effort to force a cleaning-solvent factory to move out of the primarily 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say Mission Kleensweep, which manufactures detergents, hand soaps 
and cleaners for commercial use, spews foul-smelling and possibly hazardous 
chemicals into the air, blocks the narrow residential streets with noisy, bulky 
delivery trucks and ignores neighbors' repeated complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although company President Bob Rosenbaum insists he has gone out of his way to 
accommodate neighbors' concerns, residents say the company at 2433 Birkdale St. 
does not belong in a neighborhood of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have been fighting the company for more than 20 years. But in 
recent weeks, the effort to send Mission Kleensweep packing has taken on new 
energy, partly because of the company's effort to turn an adjacent lot into a 
parking lot for its 45 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Kleensweep's request for a conditional-use permit for the lot, which 
Rosenbaum recently bought, sparked fears among residents that the company wants 
to expand. Leaders of the Elysian Valley Property Owners, Renters and 
Businessmen's Assn. quickly rallied residents in opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 residents attended the series of meetings and told frustrated tales 
-- in English, Spanish and Chinese -- of how the factory has grown nearly six 
times in size and made physical changes before obtaining permits, of the 
18-wheel trucks that rumble through the neighborhood at dawn and pose safety 
hazards for children on their way to school. 
</P>
<P>
 The company president said he responded quickly to residents' complaints of 
early morning truck traffic by delaying first deliveries until 6:30. But the 
nature of his business requires early delivery of his products to commercial 
cleaning crews, he said. "We try to be a good corporate citizen, believe me," 
Rosenbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 City and regional agencies said the company has complied with all laws 
regulating hazardous waste storage and disposal. The company's fumes have never 
violated air quality standards, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our inspectors have done some intensive monitoring in recent months, taking 
air samples and smelling odors, but no violations have been found," said Sam 
Atwood of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. "Odors," he added, 
"are very ephemeral." 
</P>
<P>
 But Isabel Clasen, a 49-year resident who lives next door to the plant, 
criticized the air quality agency for not responding to complaints until 
recently. "How would you like to sit down to eat a barbecue dinner on your 
patio and smell those fumes?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents said the previous owner was even less cooperative than 
Rosenbaum, who assumed control 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have scored small victories over the years. With a petition drive, 
they got the area rezoned in the late 1970s to allow only single-family homes, 
and they persuaded various City Council members over the years to reject 
several Mission Kleensweep expansion proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, a city zoning administrator also rejected the company's request 
for the parking lot, which Rosenbaum had argued would get employee cars off the 
street. But several dozen residents, backed by a Legal Aid attorney and 
representatives of Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, crowded the hearing room to 
voice complaints about the company's record. 
</P>
<P>
 And after years of slow or no response to resident complaints, the air quality 
agency cited the company in February for blowing sawdust onto private 
residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum said the company is digging a pit for proper sawdust storage and is 
working on ways to "hermetically seal" the roof to prevent dust and chemical 
emissions. He said he is also installing a charcoal air-filtration system. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they will continue to fight the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't that we're against business; we're against someone who abuses the 
community," said Virginia Adams, another longtime resident. "Now's the time he 
should relocate someplace." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; HOTEL OWNER FINED, MUST FIX BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in five years, the owner of a Skid Row hotel again pleaded 
no contest to slum charges and was ordered to pay $11,711 in fines, spend 200 
hours in community service and repair the building by May 26. 
</P>
<P>
 If Chung Chuan Wang fails to make the repairs at the Modoc Hotel by the 
deadline, he must spend 30 days under house arrest at the hotel at 819 S. Towne 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Judge Barry Taylor also placed Wang and his company, the 
Chi Cha Corp., on three years' probation after Wang pleaded no contest March 17 
to 10 charges of fire, health and building and safety code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The current charges stem from city Slum Housing Task Force inspections 
conducted on Oct. 21 and Nov. 1 at the two-story, 76-room brick hotel, which is 
across the street from 9th Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors reportedly found exposed live electrical wires, defective heater 
vents, missing and inoperable smoke detectors, missing and broken windows and 
screens, vermin infestation, an open sewer, defective plumbing, trash and 
debris throughout the premises and damaged and deteriorated walls and ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bernard Talmas contends that Wang has spent "a small fortune" 
fixing the building and said the tenants are to blame for many of the problems. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Wang was prosecuted by the city attorney's housing enforcement unit in 1989 
after inspectors found similar conditions at the Modoc during two visits that 
year. Wang pleaded no contest to 12 slum charges and was ordered to pay $13,138 
in fines and to repair the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang made those repairs, but not before violating his probation by failing to 
meet the court-imposed deadline, prosecutors said. He was subsequently ordered 
to pay additional fines and perform 1,500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has also been the source of prostitution and other crimes that 
prompted another unit of the city attorney's office to file a red-light 
abatement lawsuit against Wang in June, 1992. In the two years before the 
lawsuit was filed, undercover vice officers from the Police Department's Newton 
Division made 19 arrests for prostitution at the hotel and investigated a 
number of other crimes, including burglary, robbery and assault with a deadly 
weapon. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC; USC OFFERS MAJORS IN ETHNIC STUDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC has established three new majors and minors in its American Studies 
program, including a program in Chicano/Latino studies. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, the programs will include African American and Asian American 
majors and minors, according to Lloyd Armstrong Jr., USC provost and senior 
vice president for academic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new programs follow a call by Latino students last fall to rename a campus 
park in honor of the late activist Cesar Chavez as well as increase the number 
of Latino professors and classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement also marks plans for a multi-year initiative of arts and 
lectures focusing on the Latino community that include a lecture series, an 
exhibition at USC's Fisher Gallery and acquisition of paintings and sculptures 
for the school's permanent art collection. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12% of the university's 15,000 undergraduate students are Latinos, up 
from 6% in 1988.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; MENTOR PROGRAM FUELS HEALTHY DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The debate over censoring gangsta rap is fast-paced and heated among the 
sixth-graders at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangsta rappers aren't here to set an example but to express their feelings," 
said Lilia Bowie, 12. "If we want to change our community then we have to do 
it, not them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her response to a comment from Ingrid Pinentel, who said some rap artists are 
unaware of the damage their music can do to communities, is quick and 
passionate. 
</P>
<P>
 While student debates are not new at King Elementary, it's a first for Rod 
Watson, an agent with the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. He is part of a mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
 Project Outreach, a program sponsored by the Washington-based National 
Organization of Black Law Enforcement, or NOBLE, pairs African American law 
enforcement officials with schools to establish role models for youths in areas 
such as South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about gangs and drugs mostly," Watson said. "I think a lot of the 
kids don't have someone they can talk to and they can call us. The kids have my 
pager number and they call me occasionally."  
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Watson and about 20 officers from federal and local agencies 
including the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service and the Los Angeles Police 
Department, have been working weekly with sixth-graders at King since 1990. The 
school was selected by NOBLE because of concern over inner-city drop-out rates 
and gang problems. Watson said there is hope of NOBLE adopting another school 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 This school year, officers helping at King started the debates as a way to get 
students interested in writing and expressing themselves, said Brenda Grady, a 
teacher at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It forces them to express themselves," said Grady, who had four students from 
her class take part in the debate. "Among our students, writing is one of the 
skills they tend to perform lowest. In doing the debates, they had to be 
organized and write out their points." 
</P>
<P>
 The debates also provided a forum for the students to interact with Watson and 
his fellow law enforcement officials. "However we can reach a kid, well that's 
one less kid we'll have to put handcuffs on," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 For students such as Brandon Gordon, 12, the debates and the program itself 
help broaden the way they think. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I just listen to the music and don't really think about it," he said. 
"Now, I have a different point of view and maybe gangsta rap is getting worse 
and hurting people." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 The Korean American Food and Shelter Service has changed its address and name 
but not its goal of healing the community by reaching out to people of all 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, established to provide food and other essential services to 
victims of the 1992 riots, particularly Korean-speaking victims, soon expanded 
its services to anyone in need. 
</P>
<P>
 First in the parking lot of a church on Western Avenue and later from a 
converted house on Crenshaw Boulevard, volunteers distributed donated food, 
arranged transportation or found temporary shelter for people, often serving as 
many as 200 a day, said the Rev. Hyun Seung Yang, executive director.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would just be a temporary service at first, but it grew into a 
full-time, multiethnic community service," Yang said. "Nowadays, no one can do 
it alone. We all need shalom -- peace and sharing -- in our daily life." 
</P>
<P>
 To reflect that philosophy, the organization has changed its English-language 
name to Shalom Community Center. Its Korean-language name remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
 After its lease expired at the Crenshaw Boulevard site, the organization was 
given office space at the Korean Community Center, 981 S. Western Ave. But food 
distribution has been temporarily suspended until storage space can be found, 
Yang said. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WESTLAKE; YOUTH SOCCER FIELD TO REPLACE VACANT LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the vacant lot on 3rd Street between Bixel Street and Lucas Avenue 
lay fallow, hostage to a sluggish economy and the site of makeshift homeless 
encampments. 
</P>
<P>
 Few were happy with the arrangement. Not the neighbors. Or the police. Or the 
development company that owns the property once known as Crown Hill before its 
elegant homes were razed to make way for office buildings, apartments and a 
hotel -- projects that exist now only in blueprints, awaiting an upturn in the 
real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors, a police officer, the property manager and a nearby YMCA have 
teamed up to make the local children who have no place to play come out 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, work is expected to begin to turn the approximately three-acre 
lot into a temporary soccer field to serve as many as 3,500 youths a week, said 
Mark Young, executive director of the Ketchum Downtown YMCA, which will 
supervise the site and develop a free youth recreation program there. Play 
could begin as early as July. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids will go crazy when they see this field," Young said. "It's going to 
be beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathay City Development, a Hong Kong-based company, agreed to the temporary 
soccer field since it has no immediate development plans for the site, said 
Terry Lee, the property manager. The site will be fenced to prevent the 
re-establishment of homeless encampments. In the past, Lee reluctantly asked 
people living on the site to move, but they usually returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Serrano, senior lead officer in the Police Department's Rampart 
Division, was instrumental in mobilizing neighborhood support for the field and 
bringing Lee and the YMCA together, with an assist from City Councilman Mike 
Hernandez's office and the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like a waste of space at a prime location," Serrano said. "In the 
Rampart area, there aren't many places for children to play and there aren't 
many outlets for organized sports." 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA is talking with World Cup officials about sponsoring and paying for 
the field, Young said. If the two fail to reach an agreement, he said, the YMCA 
will raise the $300,000 to make it happen, although that could take a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Once work on the field begins, it should take about six weeks to grade the 
property, put in the synthetic surface and lights and erect the fence. JAKE

COVER STORY; AT RISK; RANKED AS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH BY DISEASE, 
DIABETES STRIKES PEOPLE OF COLOR AT AN ALARMINGLY HIGH RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 IT STARTED AS JUST A SMALL SORE ON HIS HEEL, nothing to worry too much about. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days later, the sore had worsened into a gangrene-infected ulcer. And 
soon after, diabetic Adan Monterrosa lay in a hospital bed, his left ankle and 
foot amputated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the thought that nothing would happen because it didn't bother me," 
Monterrosa, 46, of South-Central, said as he sat in his hospital bed on a 
recent afternoon at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of a limb is always horrible, but what makes Monterrosa's tale -- and 
the stories of uncounted thousands of other diabetics like him -- even more 
tragic is that it possibly could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 In Central Los Angeles, minimal access to medical care and lack of awareness 
of the potentially serious consequences of unchecked diabetes is taking its 
toll on segments of the population already genetically predisposed to the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 With regular checkups, doctors can often catch early symptoms of diabetes that 
patients may overlook and can inform them of how to curb its progression. But 
because many do not have the means to get preventive care or wait too long 
before they do, diabetes among people of color is often more devastating than 
it needs to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes ranks high among illnesses affecting those in minority communities. 
Ranked as the third leading cause of death by disease, diabetes strikes people 
of color at an alarmingly high rate. Genetic makeup and environmental factors 
contribute to the extreme consequences of the disease among minorities, but 
poor diet, stress and sedentary lifestyles -- all correctable, to some degree 
-- exacerbate the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, diabetes has been recognized as being in the majority 
population, with the insulin-dependent and kids," said Dr. Don Garcia of the 
Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles' Bell office and a member of a 
statewide steering committee on treating diabetes at the local level. "But 
there has been a rude awakening that diabetes has changed. It is no longer just 
among Europeans and juveniles, but it is an ethnic disease that has besieged 
communities of color." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 14 million people nationwide have diabetes, half of whom are 
undiagnosed and most of whom are minorities, according to the American Diabetes 
Assn. The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that Native Americans 
have diabetes at a rate five times greater than whites. The rate among Latinos 
and Asian Americans is three times greater than whites, and African Americans 
have a rate twice as high as whites. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, more than 700,000 people are afflicted with diabetes, 
according to the diabetes association. Latinos suffer the highest incidence 
rate, with one in seven having diabetes. One in 10 Asian Americans, one in 13 
African Americans and one in 19 whites have the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Diabetes is a dangerous disease because initially there are no symptoms. It's 
just something that creeps up on you slowly," said Dr. Luz Medina of the 
Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes prevents the body from making insulin, a hormone that converts the 
sugar in food into energy. Instead, the sugar collects in the blood and urine, 
stalls body functions and hardens arteries.  
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes also contributes to increased health problems among people afflicted 
with other illnesses, leading to a change of lifestyle or -- at the other 
extreme -- kidney or heart failure, blindness, amputation and death. 
</P>
<P>
 People of color, especially Latinos, are increasingly being found to have 
diabetes in their late 30s and 40s, an especially young age, health officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Latinos being diagnosed with diabetes earlier, that means they're 
walking around with the disease longer and that puts them more at risk of 
suffering the complications of diabetes)," said Marta Miyar of the American 
Diabetes Assn.'s Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterrosa was diagnosed with diabetes 19 years ago at age 27 in his native El 
Salvador. As far as Monterrosa knows, he is the only one in his family with 
diabetes. He never knew anyone else who had the disease until he came to the 
United States 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he carefully watched his diet and took his insulin daily, Monterrosa 
made only sporadic visits to his doctor and waited until he had severe problems 
before he sought treatment. By then, it was too late to save his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people wait until they have noticeable infections or feel too sick to go 
to work before they see doctors, Medina said. If a person then ends up with a 
diagnosis of diabetes, "it's so far gone they have problems with their vision 
or have to have an amputation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though diabetes is a common disease, most people do not know very much about 
it. Some shrug off the disease as a nuisance rather than a serious condition, 
and others equate it with an early demise. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, many diabetics live with the disease for years without severe 
complications. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two types of diabetes: Type 1, which requires insulin, and Type 2, 
which is non-insulin-dependent. Health officials say research on diabetes has 
shown that 90% of diabetics are non-insulin-dependent. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 4% develop gestational diabetes, which affects pregnant women. Though 
gestational diabetes goes away when a baby is born, it is a warning signal that 
there could be a diagnosis of diabetes in the future. One result in gestational 
diabetes is giving birth to an infant weighing about 10 pounds or with a 
deformed nervous system or limbs, Medina said. 
</P>
<P>
 Type 1 diabetes almost exclusively affects whites, who make up about 5% of all 
diabetics, and has a greater link to environmental conditions -- such as 
lifestyle -- than to genetics, said Dr. Francis Rhie, a specialist in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a significant number of people of color, primarily Latinos, are also 
afflicted with Type 1 diabetes, said Dr. Adira Zeidler of the Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center. People can be diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes without 
any prior history of the disease in their family, said Zeidler, who is 
conducting a study among Latino diabetics to determine if Type 1 diabetes, 
which is insulin-dependent, can be prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetics have a history of diabetes in 
their family, Zeidler said. Most minorities with diabetes are 
non-insulin-dependent and control the disease with a strict diet and glucose 
pills to help their bodies produce more insulin. 
</P>
<P>
 "A genetic susceptibility puts you at risk," said Dr. James Gavin, president 
of the American Diabetes Assn. "But there are some strong environmental 
influences to give rise to diabetes in urban areas: obesity, diets high in 
simple sugar and fat, cigarette smoking, stress, low social economic status and 
a sedentary lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no clear understanding of why ethnic and racial groups are more 
predisposed to diabetes than whites, researchers say. Immigrants are being 
diagnosed much more frequently with diabetes as they assimilate to sedentary 
lifestyles and high-fat diets common in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos have high levels of diabetes because of their shared ancestry with 
Native Americans, Gavin said. Korean Americans, Southeast Asian immigrants and 
Japanese Americans have the greatest prevalence of diabetes among Asian 
Americans -- about whom there is little statistical information on diabetes' 
effects, said Julie Masumoto, a consultant who has done studies on diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Diabetes is the eighth leading cause of death among Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a number of Asian Americans and Latinos, cultural myths aggravate the 
problems and consequences of diabetes. Many believe diabetes can be cured with 
home remedies such as herbal teas, special potions or vitamins, or by eating 
cactus plants. And then there are those who believe that if there's no pain, 
there's no problem. 
</P>
<P>
 African Americans and Korean Americans are prone to hypertension, and -- in 
addition to diabetes -- they are at risk of getting kidney disease or diabetic 
retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. Diabetes is the leading cause of new 
blindness in the nation and is responsible for 8% of legal blindness, Gavin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of obesity and diabetes is a major problem among African 
Americans and Latinos. Women in these communities are especially susceptible, 
suffering from the highest death rates from diabetes related to obesity, health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more overweight you are the greater the likelihood of getting diabetes, 
especially if you're older," said Miyar. 
</P>
<P>
 James Martin of the Community Health Foundation explained that treating 
diabetes in overweight people is hard because insulin cannot always affect 
their bodies properly because of the extra fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Amputations are common among diabetics because the disease accelerates 
hardening of arteries and causes poor circulation, frequently affecting the 
feet, said Dr. Richard Chambers, an orthopedist and co-chief of the 
diabetic-amputation ward at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, Refugia Ostoich, 52, went to a doctor about a foot problem. 
She left his office diagnosed with diabetes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know much about diabetes. I had a sister and brother who had it, but 
didn't really know what it would do to me," said Ostoich, a retired nursing 
attendant who lives in Mid-Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 What it did was lead to the eventual amputation of three toes three years ago 
and a piece of bone in her foot last month.  
</P>
<P>
 "It started so small I didn't think anything of it at first. But in no time it 
just got worse," said Ostoich. "Luckily, I only lost a few toes." 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers and his colleague, Dr. Vikram Kamdar, said diabetics often lose 
feeling in their feet so they are more apt to ignore pain or think a problem 
such as a sore or an infection will disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, patients will say they're really tired, are drinking and 
urinating a lot and don't know why," added Medina, of Community Health 
Foundation. "Or else they'll come in with some kind of an infection -- 
athlete's foot, jock itch, recurring yeast infection. When we do tests, we find 
that a lot of these people are diabetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for some extreme complications that require hospitalization, diabetics 
can monitor their sugar levels with special machines and can give themselves 
insulin. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated at her desk in the accounting office of Yes Clothing Inc. on Washington 
Boulevard early one morning, Margarita Santinilla spread open her bright purple 
medicine pack complete with needles, insulin vials, alcohol pads and a pocket 
calculator-sized machine to test her blood glucose level for her daily insulin 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
 With a quick prick to a finger and a drop of blood on a small strip of paper, 
she tested her glucose level: 193, a little high because of a late dinner the 
night before. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood sugar levels should be held at about 70 to 120 milligrams per cubic 
centimeter of blood. Some diabetics on first diagnosis have had levels over 
300, which could result in diabetic coma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoa, well I'll need to watch it a little today," Santinilla, 42, said as she 
lifted her blouse, grabbed a fleshy part of her stomach and injected herself 
with the insulin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really tiny needle and it doesn't really hurt," she said 
matter-of-factly. "If I'm in a restaurant, I'll just do it right there at the 
table," Santinilla said, describing her twice-daily insulin injections. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with diabetes has not been a barrier, said Santinilla, who teaches 
bilingual courses on dealing with diabetes. Nor has it stopped Rita Bramasco, 
38, of South-Central from caring for her six children and volunteering at her 
church. Bramasco takes four Glucotrol pills a day and watches her diet to 
control her diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Santinilla, who has a combination of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, takes small 
amounts of insulin and is hoping to start taking pills instead of the 
injections. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is controlling your diet and staying away from fatty foods," 
said Santinilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Hancock, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator at the USC 
Ambulatory Health Care Center, said diabetics should cut down on the portions 
of food they eat or make other substitutions. For example, Asian Americans who 
are susceptible to diabetes should cut down on the amount of rice they eat or 
increase the amount of insulin they take. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a disease that is controlled, not curable," Hancock pointed out. "But 
if it's controlled correctly, you can live a very, very long life." Diabetes at 
a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known in ethnic communities about a condition that is the 
third-largest cause of death by disease in the country and is responsible for 
thousands of deaths among minorities.  
</P>
<P>
 * What Is Diabetes? 
</P>
<P>
 The term diabetes encompasses two diseases: Type 1, in which the body does not 
produce insulin, and Type 2, in which the body has a normal or even 
above-normal production of insulin but does not respond to it efficiently. 
Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, enables the body to use and store 
glucose, which is a term that applies to a wide range of natural sugars 
occurring in blood, honey, fruits and other parts of plants. It is the 
principal source of energy for humans and other organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 * How the Pancreas Works 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny cell clusters called islets of Langerhans secrete insulin. Islets 
comprise four types of cells. The most common, beta cells, are the insulin 
factories. The other cells secrete hormones that regulate the body's insulin 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cause of Diabetes 
</P>
<P>
 The cause is unknown. Researchers suspect that certain people inherit a 
tendency for developing Type 2 diabetes. Other factors such as obesity or 
stress may come into play. In Type 1 diabetes, some researchers believe that 
hereditary traits can trigger the body's immune system during illness to 
mistakenly attack insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms 
</P>
<P>
 A major symptom is excessive urination. Some other indications are chronic 
thirst, loss of appetite and strength, nausea and vomiting. If left untreated, 
the disease can cause blindness, kidney failure, strokes, heart failure, coma 
and death. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatments 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully maintained diets are essential. Type 1 diabetics must have daily 
doses of insulin by injection. When the effect of insulin is so great that the 
level of blood sugar drops sharply, insulin shock occurs. A diabetic having 
this reaction may become weak or even unconscious. Many diabetics carry foods 
rich in sugar just in case. Primary treatment for Type 2 diabetes is a diet low 
in calories, but sometimes it is necessary to take insulin or oral drugs that 
reduce the level of blood glucose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who Is at Risk 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is common in some families, but many diabetics have no known 
family history of the disease. Some minorities are at extremely high risk. One 
in 10 Latinos are affected. Among African Americans, the risk is 1 in 14. In 
the general population, the risk is 1 in 20. Latinos develop diabetes at a 
younger age. The disease in African Americans is more prevalent among older 
women, the elderly, people living alone and in families with low income. 
African Americans have a higher tendency toward obesity, a strong risk factor 
in Type 2 diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ethnic Groups and Diabetes 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, nearly three-quarters of a million people have 
diabetes. The following is a breakdown among ethnic groups: 04,18,12,14,09 
*NUMBER ETHNIC GROUP POPULATION WITH DISEASE PERCENT Native American 29,159

 Adan Monterossa, 46, in his hospital room at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital in 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Monterossa, a diabetic, had his left foot and ankle amputated after a small 
sore on his heel deteriorated into a gangrene-infected ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many diabetics such as Monterossa wait to seek treatment until it is too late 
to save them from severe consequences. But with early diagnosis and proper 
care, the disease is manageable.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three years after the California Museum of Science and Industry was 
forced to close its chick hatchery exhibit because of seismic damage to the 
building, the display has returned along with bullfrog tadpoles. 
</P>
<P>
 The hatchery, which had been among the museum's educational exhibits since the 
1950s, reopened last week as part of the Eggciting Beginnings exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can view eggs as they hatch as well as use microscopes to observe how 
the embryos develop, said David Combs, a physiologist and curator of the 
exhibit at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus is really on how animals come from eggs and how they develop," 
Combs said. "A chicken working it's way out of an egg is almost as amazing as a 
person being born. The chicks work very hard and are exhausted by the time they 
come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly delivery of eggs to the museum ensure that visitors aren't disappointed 
and "someone is hatching every day." Frog development will also be part of the 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The hatchery was redesigned and is now located in the Science South structure. 
The exhibit continues indefinitely.

MUSEUM TO DRIVE HOME HIGHLIGHTS OF AUTOMOBILE HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By D. JEAN QUASHIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether one loves or hates automobiles, the history of Los Angeles and the 
rest of Southern California is inextricably linked to our wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobiles have defined where and how Angelenos have lived, said Catherine 
Krell, deputy director of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. 
Suburbs and billboards were created because of autos. The world's first 
drive-through grocery store and drive-in church originated in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not celebrate our passion for pistons? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind the Petersen Automotive Museum, which will soon open in 
the former Orbach's building at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Natural 
History Museum officials are overseeing construction of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said last week that plans are on track to meet the projected June 10 
opening date, despite the Jan. 17 quake that prompted additional work to 
fortify the building against future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 One aim is to turn a deteriorating building that had been vacant for three 
years into a jewel that will help rejuvenate the Miracle Mile area of Wilshire 
Boulevard, officials said. The museum is expected to draw 2 million visitors in 
its first year, many of them from operators of two sightseeing tours that will 
add the Petersen to their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very supportive of the museum," said Renee Weitzer, a planning deputy 
for Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area. "It will be a 
great impact on a building that has been an eyesore and had a problem with 
vagrants. It will help revitalize the Miracle Mile." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 13 million automobiles on the streets of greater Los Angeles, 
the museum is a natural for the area, said Matthew Roth, a staff member at the 
Natural History Museum who will be lead curator at the Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is the capital of car consumption," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petersen Automotive Museum will provide a cultural and educational spin 
through automotive history with detailed displays of about 200 authentic cars, 
as well as motorcycles, photographs, billboards and dioramas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 museums in the nation are devoted to the automobile, including three 
in California. They are in Sylmar, San Diego and Danville. But Krell said the 
Petersen, in a four-story, 300,000-square-foot building, will be the largest in 
the country and will have the most comprehensive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like us. We're part of the Natural History Museum, which 
means it's big and serious. No museum deals with the impact of the auto as 
fully and as comprehensibly as we will." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is expected to cost about $50 million, Krell said. It is named 
after Robert Petersen, the founder and chairman of Petersen Publishing Co., who 
donated $15 million toward its establishment. His company publishes 30 
magazines, including Motor Trend and Hot Rod. The history museum also obtained 
$20 million in bond money from Los Angeles County. Money was also given by 
benefactors and by corporations such as Arco.  
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the museum will be education, Krell said, with information in 
English, Spanish, German and Japanese. Each of the first three floors will 
trace the history of the auto, and conference rooms will be located on the 
fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first floor, dubbed "Streetscape," begins a journey through the 1900s. 
There is a scene of a Breer Blacksmith Shop with a 1901 steam car, complete 
with cobwebs and reconstructed tools. There is a diorama of a 1911 American 
Underslung stuck in the mud in Las Tunas Canyon with a chauffeur and stranded 
motorists. Further along is a Laurel and Hardy scene depicting a crushed 
Model-T sitting between two trolley cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other exhibits include representations of Los Angeles' first L-shaped 
mini-mall and one of the first California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers 
perched behind a billboard in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor will include five rotating galleries with themes such as 
French luxury cars of the 1930s; Hollywood and the automobile; early 
motorcycles, and past and present automotive technology. The third floor will 
provide more views of Southern California car culture, with three art galleries 
of photography, toys and memorabilia. The museum began collecting automobiles 
in the 1930s as anthropological artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural History Museum officials decided to build a world-class automotive 
museum as a way to showcase its inventory of automobile memorabilia, which has 
been warehoused because of a lack of display space, Krell said.  
</P>
<P>
 A council of business people, race car creators and drivers, and car 
enthusiasts was formed to assist in developing the Petersen. Council members 
include actor Paul Newman; Bruce Meyer, president of Geary's Beverly Hills, a 
car dealership specializing in fine autos; Sanford Sigoloff, former chairman of 
the Wickes Corp.; J. David Power III, the chairman of J.D. Power and 
Associates, and race car driver Parnelli Jones.

A TOUGHER GOAL TO TACKLE; A ROUGH ROAD STILL LIES AHEAD IN WILLIAMS' QUEST FOR 
COLLEGE CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oswaldo Williams has often been bullied by teen-agers twice his size who try 
to knock him off his feet. A few even try to break his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 His problems don't stem from playground incidents at Bell High or neighborhood 
street fights. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the 5-foot-6 Williams faces his adversaries as a center-forward on the 
soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was Bell's leading scorer -- 24 goals -- but he often paid the price 
for his talents.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was dangerous," said Belmont Coach Nancy Carr-Swaim, whose team beat Bell, 
1-0, in the City Section final. "We knew he couldn't be left alone to take a 
shot. During the few times he wasn't marked closely, he took shots . . . hard 
shots that he barely missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Williams finished his career at Bell, his high school season has not 
ended. This week, Williams competed in the Dallas Cup for boys under 19, which 
is recognized as the youth club world championship tournament. He is playing 
for Salsa 19, a youth team associated with the L.A. Salsa of the American 
Professional Soccer League. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 18, is also a finalist for the 1994 Puma Cup Invitational, the only 
national all-star soccer tournament for high school seniors. More than 500 
players were evaluated to compete in the tournament, which will be June 9-11 at 
St. Louis. ESPN will televise the Puma Cup, which will consist of four 
16-member regional teams. 
</P>
<P>
 His selection to all-star games has helped ease the pain of not winning a City 
final, but it hasn't eliminated his potential to receive more bumps and 
bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very important to me that I play well in these tournaments," Williams 
said. "I didn't get a chance to win a high school championship. I'm going to 
make these tournaments my championship games." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is arguably the best player to compete in the City Section this 
season. He has the ability to play traditional Latin-style soccer, which 
involves artistic, ball-control skills. He also survived the physical demands 
and high-intensity markings found in European-style games. Williams is 
considered a "hybrid" player which has come into demand by collegiate and 
foreign professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has great vision of the field along with great quickness," said Bell Coach 
Jesus Torres. "He is able to pause, then sprint and explode past a defender. I 
think kids his age are barely in second gear. He is in fourth gear." 
</P>
<P>
 His ball control and his instinct to anticipate a sliding defender made 
Williams difficult to tackle. It often took two players to front Williams and 
one to attack him from behind. By drawing a crowd, Williams was able to slip 
passes to teammate Maynor Alvarez, another of the City's top scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, we were physical with him," Carr-Swaim said. "Sometimes he made a 
foul look worse than it was. But we did drop him a few times." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' soccer achievements are even more remarkable considering his life 
off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in Mexico City, where his mother still lives, and moved to Bell 
when he was 14. He said he met his father for about five minutes when he was 4. 
</P>
<P>
 He has told Bart Brown, his coach for four years at the club level: "I'm 
Mexican by birth but American by choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was raised by his 27-year-old brother, Horacio, but now lives with 
his sister and her husband. Horacio died two weeks ago from a protracted 
illness. "I considered Horacio my father because he was always around for me," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Academically he struggled to maintain a C average and has not taken a 
college-entrance exam to qualify for a scholarship. Williams said he wants to 
study computer science at an American university before he begins a 
professional career, but financially he may not be able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is being recruited by Notre Dame, Nevada Las Vegas, UC Santa Barbara 
and several other NCAA Division I soccer schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is being courted by the L.A. Salsa and also received a tryout with a 
professional team associated with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, 
the UNAM Pumas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has some options," Torres said. "Hopefully, he will gain a spot with Salsa 
or a professional team in Mexico. But I hate to see him put all his marbles in 
soccer. He can suffer an ankle sprain or break a leg. He has a good chance, but 
it's very competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 While Williams can realize instant financial rewards -- the average 
professional soccer player can expect to make $30,000 a year, while the top 
players in Mexico can earn $100,000 -- he also risks the chance of a major 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latin players have to deal with the reality that some big guy is going to mug 
you," said Brown. "Players are going to hack you to compensate for their lack 
of skill."

 When Officer Chuck Foote joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1970, he 
thought his best days on the track -- those he ran at Cal State Los Angeles -- 
were over.

 That four-year stint turned out to be little more than a warm-up, for Foote 
has coached and competed for the Police Department's track team for the last 24 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought about being involved in track this long," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still happening for me and real exciting for me coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old team captain, who started running when he was 14, hasn't lost 
a step either. 
</P>
<P>
 Foote won the age 45-49 division 3,000 meters in 9:51.47 at the National 
Masters USA track and field championships last weekend at the University of 
Missouri. He also combined with George Cohen, Bill McCullough and Rich Dyer on 
the department's 3,200-meter relay team to place second in the age 40-49 
division. The foursome also teamed to place fourth in the 1,600-meter relay for 
their division. Next on Foote's itinerary is the April 9 Baker-to-Las Vegas 
race, a 20-person 120-mile relay which will pit the LAPD against more than 150 
law-enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it's off to the Police Summer Games in Sacramento in June where 
the LAPD holds meetrecords in the 800, 110 high hurdles and 400 relay. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Foote, the team has grown from 10 members in 1970 to more than 60. He 
said any law-enforcement officer is welcome to join -- from recruits in the 
academy with track experience to beginners just wanting to get in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had all kinds of people over the years," he said. "It's tough to 
coordinate workouts and competitions because everybody has a different 
schedule. The only time I see everybody at once is at the meets."  
</P>
<P>
 Foote also coaches 30 athletes on the San Gabriel Valley Track Club and has 
been an assistant women's track and cross-country coach at Cal Poly Pomona for 
the past five years.

 For the second consecutive year, Jason Barreda anchored the winning Loyola 
High distance medley relay team with a 4:18.5 1,600-meter leg at the Pasadena 
Games at Occidental College. The Cubs timed 10:24.41 to easily outdistance 
runner-up Thousand Oaks with 10:42.84 on March 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McElroy of Washington High won the invitational 200 in 21.76 and the 
Dorsey High 1,600 relay team of Leo Settle, Anthony Wheeler, Anthony Mabry and 
Devon Dubriel combined to win the open race by nearly seven seconds in a 
season-best 3:20.76.

 Robert Clark won the hammer with a throw of 194 feet 9 inches and the discus 
with a mark of 155-8 for the Golden men, who totaled 54 points to finish behind 
Weber State's 111. Cal Poly Pomona was third with 52, followed by Cal State 
Fullerton and UC Irvine with 49 and 34. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's competition, Janet Hill won the shotput (48-7 1/4) and discus 
(168-4) for Cal State L.A., which placed second with 55 points. Weber State won 
with 102. UC Irvine scored 50, Cal Poly Pomona, 33, and Cal State Fullerton, 
15.

EX-DORSEY COACH AWAITS SENTENCING 
</P>

 Derrel Thomas, the former Los Angeles Dodger and Dorsey High School baseball 
coach, is scheduled to be sentenced May 3 after pleading no contest to 
conspiring to purchase and sell 22 pounds of cocaine last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 43, testified against an alleged accomplice, former Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, 45, whose case was declared a mistrial March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas pleaded no contest in December to one count of conspiracy to purchase 
narcotics for the purpose of resale. In exchange for testifying against Ross, 
he will face no more than three years in prison. Ross could be charged with no 
more than 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross and Thomas were arrested in April, 1992, in a McDonald's parking lot near 
Los Angeles International Airport after arriving with an informant and $151,000 
in the trunk of Ross' rented Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Winston contends that Ross and Thomas were trying to 
buy 22 pounds of cocaine from undercover agents who were running a sting 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross testified that he thought the money might be used for money laundering, 
and not drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' first trial ended with the jury deadlocked 9-to-3 in favor of acquittal 
on three counts of conspiracy to purchase cocaine for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston is expected to file for a retrial of Ross, but has not made an 
announcement in court, according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Dorsey, Thomas was the first baseball player taken in 
the 1969 winter draft. He played 15 years in the major leagues, including five 
seasons with the Dodgers. He became coach of the Dorsey baseball team in 1992.

FARMERS REAP DESOLATE HARVEST ON TOBACCO ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAMB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are worrisome and confusing times for Don Anderson. Every day, it seems, 
he picks up the newspaper to find his livelihood -- and, in a way, all that he 
has worked for and believed in -- under attack, as though he were some sort of 
pariah. 
</P>
<P>
 It's really odd to be told you've lived your life wrong, he says, because he 
has tried to live his right: He's sweated in the fields while dinner grew cold 
on the table, taken out loans to buy tractors and irrigation systems, nursed 
his land until year after year the seeds sprouted and grew taller than a man, 
each golden-leafed stalk robust enough to supply the tobacco for 13 packs of 
cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 His Ford pickup bounced along the dirt road that cut through an expansive 
tobacco field, and Anderson -- college graduate and former salesman who had 
returned to the land his father and grandfather had tilled before him -- 
pondered a question about the future his passenger had asked. He reached into 
the pocket of his denim shirt for a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all the emphasis continues on anti-smoking," he said at last, "then, yup, 
I guess our goose is cooked. What you see here" -- and he motioned toward the 
rows of tobacco seedlings covered by plastic -- "is the investment of 20 years, 
my entire working life really, and I'm watching it go down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco is Virginia's largest cash crop -- and the nation's sixth largest -- 
and in communities like South Boston, where seven tobacco warehouses loom over 
the town and a billboard proclaims that everyone is welcome "to exercise their 
full and free rights to the enjoyment of tobacco products," tobacco is no more 
controversial than corn in Iowa or apples in Washington. It's what makes 
Christmas possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson and his neighbors know that their little tobacco-growing towns 
are among the last designated smoking zones left. They have watched 
anti-smoking restrictions sweep over the nation with such force that one would 
have thought secondhand smoke was causing people to drop dead at their desks by 
the hundreds. And they ask: If the government drives us out of business, will 
the nation's 50 million smokers really quit or merely buy their tobacco from 
Brazil and Zimbabwe? 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent four years at college to learn how to do this, and now it seems our 
business is dwindling away," said Traci Talley, who farms near Anderson. "I 
always thought we produced so much tax revenue the government would never mess 
with us. I guess I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although tobacco consumption is declining in the United States by about 2% a 
year, Americans still spend $42 billion a year for cigarettes, which in 1992 
produced $11 billion in federal, state and local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry accounts directly for 681,000 jobs, including 136,000 farmers in 
23 states. The annual income of tobacco people in Virginia alone is estimated 
at $800 million. "The tobacco industry," concludes a study by Price Waterhouse, 
"is a significant economic force in all 50 states." 
</P>
<P>
 No one in these towns claims smoking is healthy. But then, neither is drinking 
whiskey, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the federal Environmental Protection Agency's assertion that secondhand 
smoke kills 3,000 nonsmokers a year -- a report the tobacco industry is 
challenging in court as scientifically flawed -- the conversation invariably 
gets around to some farmer who chain-smoked for 80 years and his wife who never 
touched a cigarette and they both died of old age. Issue settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoking's bad for some people, not for others," said farmer Kenneth Rickman. 
"It's just like drinking. Some people can drink, some can't. Maybe it's got to 
do with genes. But if I want to do something that kills me, why would someone 
in California possibly object?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rickman, most farmers say they are convinced that the Clinton 
Administration wants to quarantine smokers and cripple growers by quadrupling 
the tax on cigarettes to finance its health care reform plan. The tax, they 
say, is discriminatory because it targets one group in one region in one 
industry that already pays more than its fair share. 
</P>
<P>
 And if tobacco taxes are to underwrite health care, they ask, who's going to 
pay for the program when everyone heeds the government and stops smoking? 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is tobacco farmers are in big trouble," said Larry McPeters, 
Halifax County agriculture director of the Virginia Cooperative Extension 
Service. "Are they any different than an IBM executive who gets laid off or a 
town that loses its military base? You're darn right they are, because I don't 
believe the government has pinpointed IBM or any town and said: 'We're going to 
bust your butt and bury you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-smoking sentiment, of course, is not new. Over the years tobacco has even 
been held responsible for color blindness, baldness, stunted growth, insanity, 
constipation, impotence and mustaches on women. Russia once whipped smokers, 
Turkey beheaded them and India slit their noses.  
</P>
<P>
 The Massachusetts colony outlawed public smoking in the 1630s, and Connecticut 
required smokers to have permits in the 1640s. At various times between 1893 
and 1921, cigarette sales were banned in North Dakota, South Dakota, 
Washington, Iowa, Tennessee, Arkansas, Illinois, Utah, Kansas and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Those prohibitions faded, but Virginia's tobacco farmers say they fear that 
this time a permanent change in attitude is taking hold. From the 1964 surgeon 
general's report linking smoking to cancer to the most recent surgeon general's 
report saying 419,000 people died of smoking-related diseases in 1990, smoking 
has changed from a commonplace habit to one that is practiced by outcasts 
huddled outside the doorways of smoke-free buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be so grateful if I went into a committee room and smokers were 
kept on one side instead of all over," said Minnesota state Rep. Phyllis Kahn, 
chief author of the state's Indoor Clean Air Act, which, when passed in 1975, 
was the nation's toughest anti-smoking legislation. "Now you go into the room 
and if someone has even smoked in it, you throw a fit. The ante has gone way 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn spoke by telephone from a smoke-free room in the Capitol in St. Paul. On 
the balcony outside, she said with a chuckle, she could see the handful of 
legislators who still smoke, puffing away and "giving me dirty looks." Her 
legislative goal is a total ban on smoking in all workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not just make cigarettes illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's never been my interest," she said. "Mine has always been the 
secondhand-smoke issue. But given all we know about the health hazards and all 
the things that we've made illegal, maybe that's something that should happen 
at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 With state after state moving to isolate smokers, the tobacco farmers are 
struggling to organize, adjust and, perhaps, survive. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20,000 of them marched on Washington on March 10, a day when the 
headlines in the local papers said Maryland was about to limit indoor smoking 
to the privacy of one's home. On their farms, they have cut back on capital 
expenditures and started to diversify their crops.  
</P>
<P>
 But they are quick to point out that one acre of tobacco -- one of the most 
labor-intensive crops -- produces a return of $3,800; that same acre planted in 
corn grosses about $200. 
</P>
<P>
 They have tried sweet potatoes, cantaloupes and broccoli and found that 
California and other producers were already meeting the country's demands. They 
talk about cattle, wonder what value real estate developers would place on 
their land and fret that the congressional coalition of 30 Democratic lawmakers 
from tobacco-growing regions may not be powerful enough to turn the tide in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don Anderson turned his pickup back onto the paved road. He passed an 
abandoned one-room schoolhouse and a cluster of overgrown fields once golden 
with tobacco. Off to his right, his father, Clarence, 69, and a hired hand were 
clearing brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington be damned! There was still a crop to get in and the Andersons would 
get it in, just as they had for three generations.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I went out of business because I couldn't compete in the marketplace, I'd 
accept that," said Anderson, 43. "That isn't the case, though. America produces 
the highest quality tobacco in the world. But when you're out in the fields, 
working from 6 a.m. till 11 at night, not taking a family vacation for eight or 
nine years, and you know someone's trying to legislate you out of business, 
sometimes you just stop and ask yourself: 'What am I working this hard for?' "

ITALIAN RIGHTIST STEPS ON MINE CALLED MUSSOLINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Easter reflection brought momentary respite to the tumult of Italy's 
born-again political system, Gianfranco Fini stepped on an old mine named 
Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 In context, fresh fireworks and deepening uncertainty Saturday were hardly 
surprising after the most revolutionary political week in Italy for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption-weary voters abruptly transferred power to an untried alliance of 
right-wing parties that have a mandate but no cohesion, reformist ideas but no 
common program. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for a new government will quicken at inter-party negotiations this 
week, but there are still many doors to slam, many arias to sing. In the wings 
are national anxiety and potential unrest among left-leaning labor unions 
unhappy with the election results. This was signaled by a wave of strikes 
Saturday by restaurant and hotel workers as 20 million Italians and hordes of 
foreign tourists headed for Easter weekend celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is startling that the first victim-in-victory should be the 
articulate and telegenic Fini, leader of Italy's resurgent neo-fascists. At 42, 
he is by far the most polished politician in the power-bound triumvirate that 
also includes brittle billionaire Silvio Berlusconi and abrasive regionalist 
Umberto Bossi. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in a post-election interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa, Fini 
paid tribute to former dictator Benito Mussolini, the founder of fascism and a 
figure not remembered fondly by Americans, their World War II allies -- or most 
Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say he was the greatest statesman of the century," Fini told La 
Stampa. "Berlusconi would have to pedal hard to show he belongs to history like 
Mussolini. Two identical men are not born in a year and not even in a century." 
</P>
<P>
 Bad timing. Fini made the same historical judgment of Mussolini publicly in 
October, 1992, La Stampa pointed out Saturday, but that was before last week's 
big-bang elections. Fini was not as prominent then -- and neither was his party 
claiming a share of power for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fini calls his party "post-fascist," supports Berlusconi for prime minister 
and is demanding strong Cabinet representation. He respects Mussolini the man, 
Fini says, but rejects many of his policies. And he rejects critics who charge 
that he is the stalking-horse for the rebirth of a disgraced past.  
</P>
<P>
 "A dozen kids giving the Roman (fascist) salute in the Piazza Venezia is not 
grounds to talk about a resurgence of fascism," Fini said. The authoritarian 
Mussolini -- who took Italy into disastrous war as an ally of Adolf Hitler, 
imposed racial laws, deported Jews, invaded African countries in chimerical 
pursuit of empire, suppressed civil rights and made the trains run on time in a 
corporate state -- was killed by partisans in 1945, to national applause. The 
Fascist Party was outlawed after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming their leader in 1987, though, Fini has transformed Italian 
neo-fascists from untouchables into respectables. He breathed new life and 
fresh votes into the Italian Social Movement, which typically got 5% to 6% of 
the national vote, nearly all of it in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 In the elections last week that toppled centrists from power for the first 
time since the war and rejected a leftist alliance's bid to replace them, 
Fini's party ran as the National Alliance, a new name aimed at recasting the 
movement's jackboot image. 
</P>
<P>
 When the votes were counted, neo-fascists had more than doubled their usual 
showing, claiming 106 of the right wing's 366 seats in the new 630-member 
Chamber of Deputies that takes office April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Fini took pains to portray the alliance as a modern party 
moving away from yesterday's right and toward a new center, and along the way 
he attracted substantial support from disenchanted former supporters of the 
scandal-racked centrist Christian Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Fini's eulogistic remarks on Mussolini brought a quick domestic 
backlash, just as the sight of a few youths giving the old fascist salute at 
Fini's victory celebration raised foreign hackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Praising the old dictator shows Fini "still regards Mussolini as a model for 
the future. We all know what the state of liberty was in this country when 'the 
greatest statesman of the century' was in power," charged Claudio Petruccioli, 
a spokesman for the former Italian Communist Party. The party anchored the 
defeated leftist coalition and is respected by millions more Italians than vote 
for it because of its courageous opposition to Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini says his party has no links with the right in France or Germany and 
disavows skinheads who regularly attend his rallies. He has denounced such 
Mussolini initiatives as the racial laws that foreshadowed the deportation of 
Jews to Nazi concentration camps, calling them "an error that led to a horror." 
</P>
<P>
 "When the National Alliance was born (in January) we consigned the judgment on 
fascism and anti-fascism to history. . . . That means looking to the future 
without being prisoners of the contradictions of the past," Fini told La 
Stampa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the campaign, the National Alliance called for stricter controls against 
immigration, institution of the death penalty for certain crimes and 
negotiations to recover Adriatic coastal areas ceded to Yugoslavia in 1947. It 
also demands great economic help for the south, a strong central authority and 
electoral reform to allow direct elections of a president and prime minister. 
Both are now chosen by Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 As junior partner on the right, Fini has thus far taken a back seat in 
negotiations for a government between prime minister-wannabe Berlusconi and 
Bossi, whose Northern League claims 122 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, or 
lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi, who apparently has backed away from a refusal to participate in any 
government with neo-fascists, espouses the flip side of many Fini policies. 
Bossi despises Roman central authority, believes the north is being 
impoverished to enrich a corrupt south and demands a federalist Italy of three 
self-governing regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini says his time will come when negotiations resume Wednesday to transform 
an electoral alliance into a government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Berlusconi and Bossi know perfectly well nothing can be decided unless all 
three of us are there," Fini said.

DODGERS TO DEBUT WITH 'CHAN HO-MANIA'; BASEBALL: ROOKIE PITCHER IS ALREADY 
INSTILLING PRIDE AMONG KOREAN AMERICANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY and SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With every scorching fastball that mows down an opposing batter and every 
respectful bow to a bemused umpire, 20-year-old Dodger pitcher Chan Ho Park 
gives the city's Korean American community something to cheer about after a 
long period of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who was picked for the Dodger roster last week, will be the first Korean 
to play major league baseball in the United States. Major league baseball 
starts its regular season today and the Dodgers' home opener is Tuesday against 
the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like the exuberant pride among Latinos caused by the extraordinary 
prowess of a 20-year-old rookie pitcher named Fernando Valenzuela in 1981, 
excitement is rising like a 94 m.p.h. fastball among Koreans and Korean 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be Chan Ho-mania? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been the talk of the town since he came to L.A.," said Harrison Kim, 
executive director of the Korean American Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "From elementary school students to old people, there's much interest in Chan 
Ho Park," said Tom Byun, managing editor of the Los Angeles edition of the 
Korea Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is hard to find anyone of Korean descent who has not at least heard 
of Chan Ho Park. (He is known as Park Chan Ho in Korean, which traditionally 
places the family name before the given name. But Park now defers to the 
customary American name order to avoid confusion.) In Los Angeles, 
Korean-language newspapers, radio stations and television newscasts follow his 
progress religiously. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, some fans cannot get enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had lots of calls. They want to know everything about him," Byun said. 
"When is the next time he will go to the mound? What kind of food does he 
(eat), Korean food or hamburgers? Does he have a girlfriend? For the first time 
ever, we sent a reporter to Vero Beach to cover spring training." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' ticket sales office, though declining to divulge any numbers, 
confirms the heightened interest in tickets in the Korean American community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single Korean American I talk with wants to know how Chan Ho is doing, 
even the non-baseball fans," said Allan Erselius, the Dodgers' director of 
ticket marketing. "We've noticed a lot of activity from Koreatown. I've spoken 
with people who said they bought season tickets just so they can see Chan Ho 
pitch."  
</P>
<P>
 "We talk about Mr. Park all the time, and everyone wants to go to Dodger 
Stadium," said Young Bai, who runs the Han Bo Golf & Tennis sports shop in the 
Koreatown Plaza. "I don't know much about baseball but he's Korean and he's 
there, so I want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day when I come home, two of my sons, one in junior high and one in 
elementary school, say to me: 'I want to be a pro player.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Byun said the news that Park will be on the Dodgers' roster Tuesday was 
reported "in the Korea Times in South Korea, and we heard that people there are 
just delighted. In Los Angeles and Orange County and Ventura County, many 
Koreans are saying they want to go to Dodger Stadium or will be watching the 
games on TV. Some people are even talking about organizing a Chan Ho Park fan 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said no one expected Park "to make the majors this quick. We expected him 
to work out with the team in spring training and then go to the minors. It's 
real exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have been marketing the team in the Korean American and other 
ethnic communities for the past few years and joined the Korean American 
Chamber of Commerce as a corporate member. "We want everyone to feel welcome at 
Dodger Stadium all the time," Erselius said.

 The past four years, KBLA 1580 AM, better known as Radio Korea, has broadcast 
about seven Dodgers games each season in Korean. This year, in addition to 
those games, the station plans to broadcast any game in which Park is to pitch, 
reporter Duncan Suh said . 
</P>
<P>
 What if Park is used as a relief pitcher rather than a starter? "We encourage 
our listeners to get season tickets," Suh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who grew up in Kong Ju, about 60 miles south of Seoul, is also big news 
in South Korea. A spring training game he pitched against the Montreal Expos on 
March 26 was broadcast in South Korea, causing a rather nervous outing by the 
young pitcher. (Park struggled through five innings, but the Dodgers came out 
on top, 5-3.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers first noticed Park, a high school and college all-star, during an 
amateur tournament here in 1991 and monitored his progress during last year's 
Asian Games and World University Games. Dedicated to baseball since elementary 
school, Park saw the payoff for his hard work when the Dodgers signed him in 
January for $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Koreatown, Kim said, excitement was high as people waited for word on 
whether Park would make the team, predicting that "you'll see a swarm of people 
headed to the ticket office" now that he has made the roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Although adults seem more excited than children, several Korean American 
students at the Koreatown Wilshire YMCA recognized Park's name. "I've heard 
about him," said Sammy So, 12. "It makes me feel good that he's Korean and 
playing for the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Chang, an assistant professor of ethnic studies at UC Riverside, said 
Park's success "could be a source of pride and solidarity for Koreans," but 
worries that the pressure might be "too great for a 20-year-old rookie from 
Korea not accustomed to all the details of American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Hye Shin Kang, a radio reporter for the Korean-language FM-Seoul (KFOX 93.5), 
said her audience is divided on Park: "Some people are really excited and want 
him to move ahead as fast as possible, and some people think he's moving too 
fast and needs to work in the minor leagues first so he'll be better prepared 
for the future."  
</P>
<P>
 The Korean-language media tried to be cautious about his prospects in order 
not "to get expectations too high," Chang said. But, he said, if Park lives up 
to his early promise, "it could be similar to Fernando-mania for Koreans." 
</P>
<P>
 Erselius said comparisons between Valenzuela as a rookie and Park are 
inevitable -- "young, foreign-born pitchers with lots of potential" -- but 
hesitates to predict a repeat of the kind of hoopla generated by Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando really caught the imagination of all of Los Angeles," not just the 
Mexican American community, Erselius said. "Everyone wanted to root for the 
kid. He had charisma. Hopefully, Chan Ho will be like that, but it's premature 
to make any comparisons." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Park made a big impression in the Korean community during his 
brief stay in Los Angeles before he headed off to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went around and introduced himself, and everyone had a positive reaction 
to him as a person," Kim said. "He seemed very nice and was constantly smiling. 
He seems to represent many of the good aspects of the Korean culture and 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 In the education unit at the Korean Youth and Community Center, staff members 
cut Park's photo out of a newspaper and posted it on a wall. "We're really 
proud of him," said staff member Robert Cho. 
</P>
<P>
 Modest yet confident, Park said he has been concentrating on making the team 
rather than thinking about the reactions of his fans. In the process, he is 
learning English but speaks to his teammates through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fernando-mania was possible because Fernando was good," Park said from 
Florida after practice last week. "I'm working hard to be good. Then, if 
there's Chan Ho-mania, that would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 As for being a role model, Park said: "I'm working hard to be in that position 
in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-foot-2, and 185 pounds, Park also breaks down some stereotypes about 
Asian men. "I think it's good for Americans to see a big Asian guy pitching and 
striking out pro ball players," Suh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang agrees. "It could be a good psychological boost for Asian American men 
because he counters the 'nerd' image." 
</P>
<P>
 Eui-Young Yu, a sociology professor at Cal State Los Angeles, said that by 
being an integral part of a multiracial team, Park could "probably help improve 
the perception of Koreans in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census counted more than 200,000 people of Korean descent in Southern 
California; unofficial estimates put the total at twice that. For many, 
especially small-business owners, the American dream has been battered by the 
1992 riots, crime, a sluggish economy and the Northridge earthquake. But as 
Park chases his dream, he has provided a welcome distraction and a chance to 
consolidate rooting interests: a Korean hero playing for the home team in the 
most American of sports.  
</P>
<P>
 Park said he has already received fan mail from young Korean Americans. 
"Mostly they tell me to work hard and succeed and they tell me that they talk 
about me at school. And they ask me for my autograph," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park, who studied and played at Hanyang University in Seoul, reminds his young 
fans not to neglect their studies. "Basic education has to be fulfilled in 
order for a person to be a good ballplayer," he said. "Otherwise, you can't be 
considered a true gentleman athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own gentlemanly ways, Park said he will continue to bow to umpires. 
It is perhaps the one element of his cultural upbringing that Park would like 
to impart to his teammates: "We should respect our elders." 
</P>
<P>
 Some local baseball card shops report that although they do not yet have 
Park's card -- rookie cards usually are not printed and distributed until later 
in the season -- they have had some inquiries, and not all from Korean fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Murillo, coach of a baseball team for boys 13 to 16 at the West Wilshire 
Recreation Center, said he and many of his young Latino players are excited 
about Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should it matter if he's Korean? He's a respectful kid and he can pitch 
the ball. He could be rookie of the year. When my players see a young guy like 
him play for the Dodgers, they believe in themselves more."

CAMPUS TOLERANCE GROWS OUT OF TRAGEDY; UNITY: FULLERTON HIGH TURNED TENSION 
AFTER RACIAL KILLING INTO NEW UNDERSTANDING. RELATIONS AREN'T PERFECT, BUT THEY 
ARE BETTER.

<P>
 A decent interval has passed; nobody dresses in mourning weeds for Angel 
Gonzalez anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The cotton T-shirts stamped with the autumn 1992 date of the Fullerton Union 
High School sophomore's murder have been laid to rest with the awful memories.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was something he could have walked away from. For me, life is more 
important than my pride," said Leo Solis, a 16-year-old Fullerton sophomore who 
was ordering a Big Mac that afternoon as Gonzales and a group of Vietnamese 
youths lobbed insults that eventually led to gunfire. "A guy lost his life over 
words." 
</P>
<P>
 Words are also the working prescription for peace at the placid Spanish-style 
campus of Fullerton High, where students have struggled not only with tragedy, 
but a transformation in the population from a white majority to a student body 
dominated by Latinos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year of its centennial celebration, student peace monitors in yellow 
badges roam the sunlit corridors, primed for a "911" call to offer healing 
words that can prevent a spat between rival suitors from turning into a 
Bosnia-sized misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, a few students are pried from cliques in the lunch quad for 
six-hour sessions organized by the County Human Relations Commission, which 
feature pizza and intimate conversation that wanders from family rituals to 
detailed descriptions of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The talk is part of a calculated strategy to promote harmony at Fullerton, 
where the climate grew so tense after the shooting that at times some students 
feared to look at each other, let alone offer greetings. 
</P>
<P>
 After the words of one draining session faded away last week, it was clear 
that every one of the 30 student participants -- black, white, Asian and Latino 
-- had at some point in their lives felt the pain of prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 A white junior recalled the hazing of his freshman year when, he said, he was 
targeted for regular beatings by Latino students. A Cambodian girl recalled the 
"mad-dogging" hate stares of Latino students who, she said, shoved Asian girls. 
A student of Mexican descent insisted that six weeks ago he heard the 
unmistakable whisper of a teacher softly cursing "typical Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long way to go," conceded Principal Ed Shaw as he sat last week 
amid a circle of students who seemed reluctant to stop talking. "We're not 
there yet, but we're committed to promoting ethnic diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, as Fullerton's population started to shift, the school began 
trying to promote cultural awareness by hosting dances, ethnic food days and 
celebrations for holidays such as Cinco de Mayo.  
</P>
<P>
 But most of the students didn't need a festival to inform them that ethnic 
minorities had become the majority population of the school. Latinos make up 
48% of the population this year, and Asians comprise another 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 What they needed was an invitation to mingle. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunchtime, different ethnic groups segregated themselves in the main quad 
like delegations at the United Nations. And the school's elite was dominated by 
white students who published the yearbook and the newspaper, ran the 
government, led the cheers and danced at the proms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never even bought a yearbook since I've been here three years," said 
Laura Melgoza, a Fullerton junior and daughter of Mexican immigrants. "Why buy 
one if I don't know any of the people in the pictures?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the shooting of Angel Gonzalez as he walked home on a Friday 
afternoon in September of 1992, about a block south of the campus. Witnesses 
said he was jumped, beaten and then shot twice in the back by four to six Asian 
youths who shouted racial slurs at him.  
</P>
<P>
 Solis said he heard the crack of gunfire as he sat in the school's detention 
office. He dismissed the noise as a backfiring car. Then someone rushed into 
the room, ordering everyone out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the street, tearful girls stumbled away from the whirling lights of a 
growing collection of police cars. And Solis remembered back to the squabble 
three hours earlier at McDonald's when slurs were the weapon of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, five Asian youths were charged in connection with the slaying, 
including a 15-year-old Vietnamese sophomore from Fullerton High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the campus flag would droop to half-staff. Students would don T-shirts 
with Gonzalez's name and the epitaph "rest in peace." But in their own small 
community peace was elusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Asian students said they were afraid to stray near the Latinos, 
even though some students tried doubly hard to be friendly to the Asians. Vaty 
Moussa, the daughter of Cambodian immigrants, remembers the bullying questions 
of some Latino teens, who provoked tears with fresh insults and slurs that were 
popular during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got shot, it really had a sobering effect," said Otto Salzer Jr., a 
17-year-old junior. "It showed us what racism can be and how easily someone can 
die like that. Five minutes ago, you're at school and then you're bleeding on 
the concrete." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From tragedy came the opportunity for school officials who had already 
realized that cultural awareness didn't necessarily produce harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to change our focus," said Shaw, the principal for almost five years. 
"We really wanted to go beyond awareness into acceptance -- accepting 
differences, but celebrating the similarities." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, they tried again, launching a multicultural task force of 
about 12 students assigned to promote harmony. That effort sputtered the first 
school year and was jump-started again in the fall of 1993 after Assistant 
Principal Donald J. Morrison drew on the energy of a larger group of students. 
</P>
<P>
 The group recently staged an assembly on ethnic diversity with sessions that 
included the speech of a Santa Ana police officer who immigrated from Mexico. 
Many of the students have also gone on field trips to UC Irvine for more 
lessons on the issue of ethnic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Ramirez, an original member of the group, said its first task was to 
reassure the Vietnamese students who feared reprisals in the wake of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to tell them that we can't be angry with each other and that the 
student's death wasn't in vain," she said. "We tried to make the kids aware of 
the things that they say, to avoid calling each other names. I think we've 
achieved that, but we still have our little cliques, our little groups. And we 
want them to come out and mingle." 
</P>
<P>
 Mingling 101 has proved to be the hardest test of all. School officials and 
students have experimented with a variety of strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the principal formed a music committee amid complaints from 
students that the lunchtime deejay was spinning tapes a little heavy on the 
rock 'n' roll and a little light on the quebradita music. School officials had 
already noticed that lunchtime music had a way of bringing students together. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief yearbook photographer made a calculated effort to snap photographs 
of every ethnic group, rather than the usual roundup of the 100 most popular 
people on campus. And the campus newspaper even started publishing a Spanish 
translation of some local news. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, some white students balked at the translations, according to Mike 
Fillmore, a senior who writes for the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think it was right," he said. "A number of people were, like, 
'Hey you're in America. Learn English. How are you going to get ahead without 
it?' But that's died down." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with those efforts, the school and the Human Relations Commission 
organized retreats of small groups, who met together away from school where 
they could speak more candidly. Top school officials, including the principal, 
also participated. 
</P>
<P>
 So did a wide variety of students who represented the traditional spectrum of 
campus life -- the varsity jock and the cheerleader, the Eagle Scout and the 
student activist, the newcomer and the graduating senior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of a session last week, the students were quiet and shy, but then 
grew more animated as they shared tales about family rituals and customs. 
Students who barely glanced at one other in the hallways nodded in recognition 
as they listened to common stories of divorced parents and reconstituted 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentative friendships bloomed like spring buds. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they talked, Laura Melgoza looked at black sports star Christopher 
Young in the hallways and labeled him a "stuck-up" athlete. And then she 
listened to his memories of the slurs that scornful white fans screamed while 
he dribbled a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they talked, Valerie McQueen -- one of the new black students at 
Fullerton -- sized up Marilyn Rodriguez as a prim and distant student leader 
who hung out with the preppy crowd. And then she heard Marilyn's memories of 
how she and her Mexican immigrant grandparents fled a restaurant that had 
shunned them, refusing service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'That's true, I can identify with that,' " said McQueen. 
"Maybe we do have something in common and I can talk to her now. I later went 
up to her and told her I was sorry if I was rude because I thought you were a 
snob. She's really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 As a school bus rumbled outside to carry the students away, the words came out 
in such torrents that Principal Shaw and Assistant Principal Morrison agreed to 
bring the same group together again to hammer out a specific strategy of 
activities to mix the students. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing had a more powerful effect than a spontaneous act the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sight of "Mr. Morris," tall and imposing, stumbling through the 
quick steps of the quebradita.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was dancing to Mexican music! Everybody was amazed and laughing because it 
was Mr. Morris, an authority figure," Solis said. "Personally, I hate that 
music because it bugs me. But his dancing showed me many things. He's a person 
who cares about us and our school. He doesn't want racial barriers." 
</P>
<P>
 There were 15 students dancing when Morrison joined. And when the music 
stopped, there were 25.

TWISTING TRAIL OF GUN THAT CHANGED MEXICO'S HISTORY; FIREARMS: BRAZILIAN-MADE 
REVOLVER BEGAN AS A LEGAL WEAPON, THEN VANISHED UNTIL IT CLAIMED CANDIDATE'S 
LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like almost every other American firearm used in a crime, the gun that changed 
Mexican history started out on the right side of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured nearly two decades ago in Brazil, the .38-caliber Taurus that 
killed presidential front-runner Luis Donaldo Colosio originally was offered 
for sale at the Bob Chow Gun Shop in San Francisco -- a store then owned by a 
world-class marksman who once competed for the U.S. Olympic shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
 The revolver was first purchased in 1977 by a Bay Area security executive who 
objected to supplying his unskilled guards with guns, but reluctantly agreed to 
buy this one after a client with a vault full of valuables insisted on an armed 
patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, the company and its assets were sold to Stanley Smith 
Security, a huge Texas-based conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 But between 1980, when Stanley Smith presumably acquired the gun, and March 
23, when an assailant in Tijuana fired it at Colosio's head, there are no 
records of where it traveled, of how many hands it may have passed through, or 
of who may have supplied it to Mario Aburto Martinez, the 23-year-old factory 
worker who allegedly pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like looking for a needle in a haystack," said Ed Gleba, a spokesman for 
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which closed its 
investigation last week without being able to trace the revolver's history. 
"There could be a million explanations for what happened to that gun." 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, the story of this cheap, antiquated six-shooter -- what one 
expert called "the Pinto of handguns" -- is a typically American tale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are nearly 220 million firearms circulating in the United States, one 
for virtually every man, woman and child. The vast majority of the weapons are 
owned by law-abiding people who buy them for protection, hobby or sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a nation where gunfire also claims 35,000 lives a year, there is no 
system designed to account for those weapons, to record their movement, or to 
prevent them from slipping out of legitimate channels and into the hands of the 
violent or deranged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that this gun dropped off the radar screen -- that's just business 
as usual in the world of firearms," said Erik Larson, the author of "Lethal 
Passage," a new book that traces the path of a single handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, official policies are far more stringent, prohibiting the sale of 
all firearms to anyone outside law enforcement or the military. But the reality 
is that weapons flow freely from the United States into many border towns, 
lured primarily by the narcotraficante underworld. 
</P>
<P>
 Although motorists approaching Tijuana are met with black and white signs that 
warn: "Guns Illegal in Mexico," the demands of a tourist economy come first. 
Unlike the long lines that mark the return to the United States, most visitors 
entering Mexico are waved in without a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about as difficult to get a gun in Mexico as it is to obtain a 
fraudulent green card up here," said Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center 
for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. "It's not as if Mario Aburto had to 
get on a bus to San Francisco and go looking for his favorite gun store." 
</P>
<P>
 The .38-caliber Taurus that allegedly landed in Aburto's hands is not the kind 
of weapon that tends to make headlines in either country these days, not when 
there's access to high-powered semiautomatic rifles, laser sights, 
armor-piercing ammunition and combat-size ammunition magazines.  
</P>
<P>
 But even after 17 years, the $50 revolver proved to be just as deadly, living 
up to Taurus' twin hallmarks of "quality and price." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as pretty as my $800 gun and it's not real cool," Gleba said. "But 
obviously it'll do the job. It's a cheap killing machine." 
</P>
<P>
 If it were not for America's seemingly insatiable appetite for handguns, a 
good number of the 2,200 employees at Forjas Taurus, located in the south 
Brazilian river town of Porto Alegre, would probably be out of a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Taurus has become one of the world's leading handgun exporters, 
producing more than 100 models and growing into an $85-million-a-year 
powerhouse, despite Brazil's own troubled economy. The United States, which 
annually purchases about 150,000 Taurus handguns, accounts for 60% of the 
company's revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is, undoubtedly, no market for guns in the world as big as the United 
States," Taurus President Carlos Alberto Murgel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic manufacturers still dominate the U.S. handgun market, producing more 
than 1.5 million pistols and revolvers a year for the nation's 245,000 
federally licensed dealers. However, imported weapons are not far behind, often 
topping 1 million a year, according to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most arms manufacturers, Murgel disavows any responsibility for the small 
percentage of people who misuse his merchandise. It is unfortunate that a 
Taurus became linked to one of Mexico's most shocking political assassinations, 
he said, but violence should be blamed on criminals and the governments that 
fail to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns," he said, "are not the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 This .38-caliber revolver could not have begun its journey in any steadier 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Chow, who for 35 years owned a gun shop in San Francisco's Mission 
District, competed on the U.S. Olympic shooting team during the 1948 games in 
London. He placed 13th in the 25-meter rapid-fire match -- an event that 
requires marksmen to shoot 60 rounds at a series of silhouette targets in about 
60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop, now called High Bridge Arms, still has a trophy case full of Chow's 
shooting prizes, most of them gold figurines of a man taking aim, his left hand 
on his hip and his right arm fully extended.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tough old man, very tough," said Masashi Takahashi, who bought the 
store in 1988 from Chow, now believed to be in his late 80s. One of the first 
things Takahashi did was renovate the shop's second-floor apartment, which Chow 
had refused to rent for fear that a tenant would be tempted to cut a hole in 
the floor and steal all of his weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't trust people," Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The security executive who first bought the Taurus tends to share those 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the potential for attacks by political extremists, as well as 
the hassle of being hounded by news crews, the executive granted The Times an 
exclusive interview on the condition that his identity not be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want any publicity," said the 62-year-old retiree, sitting in the 
living room of his apartment in the placid Contra Costa County community of 
Lafayette. "I also don't want anyone, from whatever side, knocking on my door 
with a rat-a-tat-tat." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive, a veteran of the security world in Los Angeles during the 
turbulent 1960s, formed his own company in 1976. He soon was employing about 
100 guards and serving a variety of high-profile Bay Area clients that included 
prominent retail outlets and financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many security executives, at least those who count themselves among the 
industry's more responsible practitioners, he frowned on the use of armed 
guards because of the liability risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You shouldn't put guns on people in public places," he said. "Sooner or 
later, the guns go off." 
</P>
<P>
 But less than a year into his business, a valued client with a vault insisted 
on armed protection. Assured that his guard would have no contact with the 
public, the executive acquiesced. The only problem was that he had no gun. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in 1977, the security executive paid a visit to Bob Chow, hoping to find 
an inexpensive .38-caliber revolver, something without the firepower or 
bullet-capacity of a more sophisticated weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything else is too dangerous," he said. A six-round revolver can be loaded 
with just five bullets, he said, leaving the hammer set on an empty round "so 
that if the mother drops, it ain't gonna go off." 
</P>
<P>
 The .38-caliber Taurus he selected, modeled after a popular Smith & Wesson, 
was one of about 225,000 handguns legally sold in California that year. As 
state law has required since 1975, the security executive waited 15 days while 
officials conducted a background check before he could pick up the weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, nearly 5 million handguns have been legally sold in California, 
with last year setting an all-time record of 429,217. During that time, fewer 
than 1% of handgun sales have been denied by state officials, who check for a 
history of criminal or psychiatric problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I learned what happened (in Mexico), I suppose I was stunned or shocked 
or flabbergasted, but not really surprised," said the security executive, who 
was visited by federal agents just hours after the Tijuana assassination. 
"Goodness knows, if he didn't have this gun, he would have gotten another." 
</P>
<P>
 The security executive told federal firearms agents that in 1980 he sold his 
contracts and assets to Stanley Smith, which was founded in 1928 and has grown 
to be the fifth-largest security firm in the nation. Based in San Antonio, the 
company employs 8,000 guards, about 6% of whom are armed. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the agency contacted Stanley Smith, company officials could find no 
record of the weapon, either in Texas or at their parent company's Australian 
headquarters. Although the purchase of the Bay Area firm represented a 
relatively minor acquisition -- the assets were valued only at about $3,000 -- 
a Stanley Smith spokesman said such a weapon would have been carefully 
screened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have anything to indicate that we ever received it," said Patrick 
Schindler, vice president of corporate development. "At this point, we're 
assuming we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 And there the paper trail stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, firearms sold between private parties do not need to be 
reported. Until 1991, the same was true for California. Since then, the state 
has required private transactions to be made through a licensed gun dealer, who 
is supposed to hold the weapon for 15 days while officials conduct a background 
check on the buyer and seller. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state agency that reviews those applications has no enforcement 
authority and no way of knowing how many people skirt the process -- avoiding 
the $24 filing fee and the chance of a denial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of those things that's against the law, but if nobody sees it, how 
are you going to enforce it?" said Ann Norman, an analyst with the state 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, a large number of gun enthusiasts who believe that any 
attempt to regulate the sale of firearms infringes on their constitutional 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who concede that some restrictions are appropriate contend that 
most government controls only inconvenience the large majority of responsible 
gun owners, instead of targeting criminally minded people who don't obtain 
their weapons through official channels in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody steals a gun or buys it on the black market, they don't create a 
paper trail to begin with," said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment 
Foundation, an educational and legal defense fund. "Even if there was one, 
quite frankly, it would be meaningless. Tracing a gun doesn't help prove who 
committed the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Most gun control advocates believe firearms are still far too easy to obtain, 
even for law-abiding people who end up using them in domestic quarrels, 
accidents or suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Because virtually every weapon that falls into criminal hands was originally 
acquired by legal means, groups such as Handgun Control Inc. are pushing for 
laws that would require the registration of all handgun purchases, including 
private transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think people will become more responsible about their weapons if they know 
the paper trail will end with them," said Susan Whitmore, director of 
communications for the national lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, people bent on murder usually get their way. Whether by 
conspiracy or happenstance, this revolver landed in the hands of an assailant 
whose audacity would leave Mexico reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto, who in a recent poem wrote that "the forces of peace are greater than 
the forces of war," purportedly confessed to taking target practice before the 
point-blank attack. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems unlikely that he would have been admitted to any of the firing ranges 
around Tijuana. The ranges -- like the Berrendo Club on the old Ensenada 
highway -- are exclusive fraternities where the names of members are posted on 
the wall, complete with a catalogue of their weaponry, including make, model 
and serial number. 
</P>
<P>
 What matters most is that 11 days ago, he arrived in the shantytown of Lomas 
Taurinas, which, like the handgun, draws its name from the potent imagery of 
the bull. As the man expected to be Mexico's next president greeted some of 
Tijuana's poorest voters, Aburto allegedly worked his way through the crowded 
dirt square and stuck the gun to Luis Donaldo Colosio's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Only then did the journey of this .38-caliber Taurus come to an end.

 The .38-caliber Taurus revolver used to kill Mexico' leading presidential 
candidate was legally purchased in 1977 to arm a guard employed by a Bay Area 
security company. By 1980, the gun's paper trail already had evaporated and the 
weapon, one of more than 200 million in circulation in the U.S., soon slipped 
through the cracks. This is all investigators know: 
</P>
<P>
 1977: The revolver, imported from Brazil, is offered for sale at the Bob Chow 
Gun Shop in San Francisco's Mission District. 
</P>
<P>
 1977: The head of a Bay Area security business buys it for about $50 after one 
of his clients requests an armed patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: The security company and its assets are purchased by Stanley Smith 
Security Inc., a large Texas-based firm, which says it can find no record of 
having ever received the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 March 23, 1994: Mario Aburto Martinez, a 23-year-old factory worker, allegedly 
uses the revolver to fatally wound Mexico's leading presidential candidate 
during a campaign rally in Tijuana.

WHEELS TURNING AT MOBILE HOME PARKS IN O.C.

 Among the residents of Sierra Mobile Homes Estates, Gerie Kirkpatrick is known 
as the Rose Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the blue-and-white home that Kirkpatrick and her husband bought in 
1982, she cultivates 18 rose bushes that bloom in yellow, pink and white. 
Scissors hang from a small wooden sign hand-painted with the words, "Help 
yourself to a rose." Her neighbors at the 230-home park often do -- and no one 
steals the scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkpatrick, now a widow and retired, owns her Huntington Beach mobile home, 
but she doesn't own the rose garden. And because of escalating rental rates for 
spaces in the park, she says, keeping the home itself is becoming difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we did such a smart thing when we moved in here, thinking it was a 
good, affordable place to retire," Kirkpatrick said. "Then we were hit with 
rent increases. People are walking away from their trailers, and they are going 
back to the banks." 
</P>
<P>
 The rent on Kirkpatrick's space in Sierra Mobile Homes Estates has climbed to 
$488 a month from $220 six years ago, she said. That is in addition to her 
monthly payment of $429 on her home. Squeezed by such increases, a growing 
number of California's mobile home dwellers, estimated to total more than 1 
million, say they are being forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing that prospect, many are taking advantage of state laws that encourage 
them to band together and buy the property on which their homes sit. Besides 
gaining control of rental rates, residents who own their parks can set policies 
and regulations, pool their money to improve common areas and build equity that 
they can cash in if they decide to sell their mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments are getting involved, too, especially in urban areas like 
Orange and Los Angeles counties, to preserve mobile home parks as affordable 
housing for elderly people such as Kirkpatrick who live on fixed incomes and 
for young, lower-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 California's mobile home population has changed dramatically in the past 30 
years. During the 1960s, most park residents were elderly people who bought 
homes for as little as $15,000, often paying cash for them after retiring and 
selling conventional houses. 
</P>
<P>
 During the real estate boom of the 1980s, working families priced out of the 
housing market began moving into the parks. Driven by consumer demand, mobile 
home prices soared. 
</P>
<P>
 In the economic downturn and housing industry slump that followed, however, 
many of those working people lost their jobs. At the same time, the value of 
their mobile homes sank because of depreciation and the real estate decline. 
Homes for which families had paid between $50,000 and $80,000 were bringing 
only $20,000 to $30,000 as resales, according to the Manufactured Housing 
Educational Trust, a trade group based in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, rent on spaces in parks began increasing. Sites that rented 
for $250 a month in the mid-1980s now range as high as $1,000 in coastal areas 
and average about $500, according to the trade group.  
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1986, the state launched a program that made low-interest loans 
available to park residents. Of the estimated 4,000 mobile home parks in 
California, only about 120 so far have converted to resident-owned parks -- 
knows as ROPs. But interest is increasing sharply, said John Tennyson, chief 
consultant with the state Senate Select Committee on Mobile Homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rents are going to continue to go up," said Tennyson, whose committee has 
published a pamphlet titled Guide to Mobilehome Park Purchases by Residents. 
"That's the biggest issue driving the trend toward park ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 This month, an intergovernmental agency created by the California State Assn. 
of Counties and the League of California Cities will mail out brochures for a 
new program called "MuniHome." Under the program, the agency, which has sold 
various types of bonds since the 1980s, will offer tax-exempt revenue bonds for 
cities, counties or nonprofit groups such as mobile home residents who can then 
use the proceeds to buy the parks. New York investment bank Lazard Freres & Co. 
has been chosen to sell the bonds, which will be paid off with park operating 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help cities and counties who are interested in preserving existing 
low-income housing stock," said Dan Harrison, assistant director with the 
cities league in Sacramento. "It's a tough decision for a city or county to 
acquire a mobile home park. We're not saying they should. But if they make that 
decision, we want to help them do it well." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond seeking to ensure affordable housing, local governments are sometimes 
getting into the mobile home park market after being drawn into disputes 
between park owners and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura County, which has 23,136 mobile home residents, the Santa Paula 
City Council was besieged two years ago by angry tenants who alleged rent 
gouging by park owners. City voters subsequently passed a measure that 
tightened rent-control laws already in effect. But the owner of one mobile home 
park then sued the city, alleging that the new regulations interfered with his 
ability to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 James Taylor, owner of the Santa Paula West Mobilehome Park, withdrew his 
lawsuit after agreeing to sell the property to the residents for $9.2 million. 
The city has agreed to supply housing redevelopment bond money, but the 
purchase has not been finalized because park residents say the price is too 
high.  
</P>
<P>
 Interest by either a city or a residents' group in buying a park does not 
guarantee a done deal. In some cases, park owners are simply not interested in 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Pica, an owner of Sierra Mobile Home Estates where Kirkpatrick lives, 
said the Huntington Beach property is profitable, and "our rents are right 
where they should be. We're just a mile and a half from the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do sell, we'll give them first choice," Pica said of the park's 
residents, who have formed a nonprofit group, the Sierra Residents Corp. State 
law, in fact, requires park owners to notify residents first before putting the 
property up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Pica said, "we're just not selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Other park owners complain that tenant groups who want to buy them out are 
either poorly organized or cannot obtain financing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ideal buyer is the tenant," said Richard Hall, a Costa Mesa businessman 
who is a part-owner of Orange County's largest mobile home park: the 29-acre 
Treasure Island Mobile Home Park on the oceanfront at Laguna Beach. "But they 
don't have their act together." 
</P>
<P>
 Other park owners say they feel pressured to sell once residents announce 
their interest in buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if an owner wants to sell to the residents, that's fine, but they 
shouldn't be forced to," said Norman McAdoo, a partner with Busch, Carr, McAdoo 
in Garden Grove, which owns five mobile home parks in Orange County. "Everyone 
wants to live in Orange County -- it's California's paradise. (Park) residents 
are complaining about rents, but nowhere else in Orange County could you get a 
decent place to live for those prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Such different viewpoints can be an obstacle when residents sit down to 
negotiate a purchase, said Gerald Gibbs, a lawyer with Gibbs, Dunham & Gibbs. 
The firm, based in San Clemente, specializes in resident-owned parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many parks, the residents are pitted against the owners over issues like 
rent and rent control," he said. The owners "resent the fact that these 
homeowners have banded together and screamed and yelled and got the city to go 
along with them in terms of financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obstacles, at least two Orange County cities, Garden Grove and La 
Habra, have already bought mobile home parks with money raised by issuing a 
total of $35 million in tax-exempt bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, which has nearly 105,000 mobile home dwellers, the city 
of Lancaster has used redevelopment funds to purchase two parks and is 
negotiating to buy several more of the 33 parks within the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Several deals have been completed in recent months, too, by nonprofit 
residents' groups. In December, for example, the 268 dwellers in the Bayside 
Village Mobile Home Park in Newport Beach purchased a 279-slip marina and the 
56 acres under their homes from the Irvine Co. for $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other park purchases are being negotiated. In January, mobile home owners in 
Lake Forest asked that city to co-sign a $6-million loan so they can buy the 
lease on Kimberly Gardens Mobile Home Park, where 1,300 people live. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry consultants and even park owners foresee an increasing number of the 
state's mobile home communities being run as nonprofit entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole status of mobile home parks in California is going to change in the 
next decade, with most of them becoming owned by tenants and cities," said 
Laguna Beach park owner Hall. "Thirty years ago it was a good idea to buy your 
mobile home and set it up on someone else's land. That's not true today." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, though the name "mobile home" suggests otherwise, owners cannot simply 
move to a new park where rents are lower, lawyer Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has changed since 1955 -- it's not Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz 
hooking up their trailer to their car," he said. "These things don't move 
today. Some have stucco walls and tile roofs." 
</P>
<P>
 That is all the more incentive for park dwellers to become landowners. 
Homeowner Kirkpatrick, who paid $42,000 for her home, says she has spent at 
least $15,000 on improvements. She estimates that she could sell her home, 
though, for no more than $25,000, partly because the value of mobile homes has 
depreciated rapidly in the Southern California real estate downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hennessy, president of the Golden State Mobile Homeowners League in 
Garden Grove, said Orange County, which has more than 53,000 mobile home 
residents, is especially ripe for purchase by park dwellers. The reasons are 
high housing costs in general and a lack of any form of rent control, said 
Hennessy, whose nonprofit group represents 100,000 mobile home owners in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, park owners' groups question the fairness of state and local backing 
for purchase of parks by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should a city make a gift of public funds to help a couple of hundred people 
buy property?" asked Vickie M. Talley, executive director of the Orange County 
Manufactured Housing Educational Trust, a mobile home park owners association. 
"Just like any other homeowner, they should have to come up with the down 
payment and make the payments." 
</P>
<P>
 Consultant Tennyson of the state Senate Select Committee on Mobile Homes 
argues that park residents, though, are in a special situation. Mobile homes 
are the only affordable housing available to many lower-income people, he said, 
and thus should be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mobile homes are something the state should be involved in," he said. "Many 
of these people are seniors on fixed income. If they are economically forced 
out of their homes, they will end up on the streets, and the taxpayers will 
eventually be supporting them." 
</P>
<P>
 Among mobile home residents who have succeeded in buying their parks, the 
consensus is that they made a wise decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Hetherington, 64, a former Pasadena police officer who owns a mobile home 
in the Shorecliffs park in San Clemente, said he and his neighbors are 
delighted with their $12.8-million purchase, completed in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Each resident obtained a separate bank loan to buy his or her individual 
parcel of land, and now the 192-home park operates much like a condominium 
association. It is governed by a seven-member board of directors, of which 
Hetherington is one. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't pay rent, you control your own park, and you have a say in what 
work is to be done," Hetherington said. "You don't have to go to someone else 
and ask for something. We have the security to know we can stay here and 
control our future." Profile of Mobile Home Parks

PILOT'S SON MAY HAVE CAUSED AIR CRASH IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager reportedly allowed to play pilot in the cockpit may have caused 
last month's crash of a Russian-leased Airbus jet that killed 75 people, Moscow 
media reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian commission investigating the crash in Siberia has yet to announce 
its official findings, but it did say Saturday that tapes from the plane's 
"black box" recorder show that guests were visiting the cockpit before the 
Airbus A-310 went down. Four Moscow newspapers reported that "children's 
voices" appear on the cockpit tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's specialists are still working on identifying the voices and 
the exact causes of the crash, a spokesman told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian media were already full of a mind-boggling -- though still 
unofficial -- account of how the pilot's son may have accidentally sent the 
Airbus into an unstoppable nose dive by hitting a switch that turned off the 
autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If true, the story of how the plane crashed will do much to cement Russian 
civil aviation's reputation as unsafe. Although the Airbus, made by a 
consortium based in France, appears to have been mechanically sound, it may 
have been done in by lax Russian discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the English-language Moscow Times, which carried the most 
complete account of the crash, the flight from Moscow to Hong Kong on March 22 
had been under-booked, so about 30 airline employees and family members came 
along for a free trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was the 15-year-old son of Capt. Yaroslav Kudrinsky, the Moscow 
Times said, quoting Aeroflot and Transportation Ministry officials who asked to 
remain anonymous. The plane flew under the aegis of Russian International 
Airlines, the international branch of Aeroflot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cockpit voice recorder readings indicated that the youth inadvertently 
knocked off the autopilot and fell against the control column as his father and 
other crew members stood behind him," the Moscow Times said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane then plunged into a nose dive from its flying height of 33,000 
feet, the adults were apparently thrown off their feet, unable to reach the 
controls of the plane immediately. The dive became so steep that the crew could 
not correct it, the Moscow Times said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those aboard were 23 foreigners, including one American. None of the 
passengers or crew survived when the plane hit the tundra near the Mongolian 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 Valery Eksuzian, the head of Russian International Airlines, told Interfax on 
Friday that the Airbus crew was "not to blame." He said that analysis of radio 
contacts indicated that "the plane started to act in ways which were not 
programmed into the autopilot. Judging by their exclamations, the crew was 
greatly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Eksuzian heartily denied a French television report that none of the crew 
members were in the cockpit just before things went wrong. But no officials 
have denied that the pilot's son caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's NTV television network reported Saturday that Kudrinsky let his son, 
Eldar -- whose age was given as 16 instead of 15 -- take his seat in the 
cockpit and went back into the cabin. When the trouble started, another pilot 
who happened to be among the passengers jumped to the controls to try to save 
the plane but failed, NTV said. It said the boy's blood showed traces of 
barbiturates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian crash commission has been analyzing the recordings with Airbus 
manufacturers in France, according to the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. The 
commission's conclusions are expected in about a week and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was so mysterious that officials had originally speculated that it 
might have been caused by a terrorist's bomb, but they now rule out that 
theory. Mechanical failure also appears to be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem, the Vechernaya Moskva newspaper wrote, that "the reason for the 
tragedy was the human factor. Namely, that the pilot gave his seat to his 
16-year-old son, let him 'drive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, this is hard to believe. But if you think about it, after a 
spontaneous 'That's impossible!' something else comes to mind: How coincidental 
are the catastrophes happening more and more often in our skies?" Vechernaya 
Moskva asked. "Has the splitting of Aeroflot into more than 200 companies 
really strengthened discipline?" 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, discipline in the unified Aeroflot of the former Soviet Union had not 
been good either. Pilots routinely took bribes to allow passengers without 
tickets to fly with them -- sometimes in the cockpit itself -- and technical 
difficulties in the aging Soviet fleet abounded.

NEWS ANALYSIS; KEY FACETS OF CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN STILL INTACT; MEDICINE: 
DESPITE DIRE ASSESSMENTS, THE WHITE HOUSE SEES DEVELOPMENTS SO FAR AS REASONS 
TO REMAIN OPTIMISTIC. 
</P>

<P>
 Weeks after independent-minded members of Congress began crafting their own 
health care reform plans, the key structural elements of President Clinton's 
agenda remain very much alive -- confounding critics who months ago pronounced 
them dead on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 With growing confidence, the White House is counting on mandatory work-based 
health insurance, cost controls and the creation of insurance-purchasing 
alliances to become the foundations of a revamped health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "As people try to pull our plan apart, they'll see that you can't achieve the 
goals that so many of us agree on -- lifetime universal coverage with 
comprehensive benefits -- without doing what the President has proposed," one 
presidential adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is leaving plenty of room for compromise. But rather than 
jettison any of the major elements, it is becoming clear that the President is 
willing to let Congress scale back, stretch out and even drastically alter the 
employer mandate, the cap on insurance premiums and the nature of the 
alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a distinct possibility that Clinton ultimately will agree to 
delay universal coverage beyond his stated goal of 1998 and to defer certain 
elements of a standard benefits package, especially coverage for mental health 
and long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Administration officials are loath to discuss areas of compromise 
publicly, they privately refer to such potential compromises as "transitional" 
instead of "structural" -- a telling distinction underscoring that Clinton 
remains committed to the goal of universal coverage even if his proposed means 
are modified. 
</P>
<P>
 That view was validated recently as two House panels developed their own 
proposals and both contained the major principles in Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative process, of course, is never entirely predictable, and that is 
all the more true in the attempted restructuring of one-seventh of the U.S. 
economy. As the President noted during a March 24 press conference: "There will 
be lots of twists and turns in the legislative process. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And with the bulk of the work still ahead, there is plenty of time for 
Clinton's plan to come unglued. "I appreciate their desperation for hanging on. 
Otherwise, their plan truly falls apart," said critic Gail Wilensky, a top 
health care adviser in the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all the pronouncements by Republicans and even some Democrats that 
Clinton's plan is dead, the key elements of his 1,342-page Health Security Act 
continue to dominate the public dialogue and set the congressional agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many of the President's other proposals -- a cigarette tax hike, 
administrative streamlining, abolition of discriminatory insurance practices, 
prescription drug coverage -- are so widely embraced that they are barely even 
debated. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Clinton's overhaul agenda calls for employers to pay at 
least 80% of workers' premiums, with employees paying the rest. No big firm 
would have to pay more than 7.9% of its payroll. Small companies with low-wage 
earners would receive subsidies while having their premium payments capped at 
3.5% of payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's plan would also force companies with fewer than 5,000 workers 
to join the regional insurance-buying alliances, which pool consumers to 
enhance their purchasing power. The alliances would select from provider groups 
a variety of insurance plans from which consumers could choose annually. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that his experiment with "managed competition" slows the rate of 
growth in health care spending, Clinton would limit the amount that insurance 
premiums may grow. This may prove to be the most intractable element in 
Clinton's agenda, for many members of Congress appear to be unalterably opposed 
to any price controls -- just as the White House devoutly believes that 
controls are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a tough one," one senior Administration analyst said. "You need to 
control costs, or else providing universal coverage would be unaffordable. And 
we are unwilling to stake things on market forces." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there may be room for compromise -- perhaps by setting "targets" rather 
than absolute caps. 
</P>
<P>
 On the employer mandate, there seems to be more leeway for compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 To lessen the burden to businesses, the President may well agree to reduce the 
employer requirement to, say, 70% of premiums instead of 80% -- and perhaps 
even delay its implementation, especially as applied to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lower the share paid by the employer, the greater the number of 
individuals who will need federal subsidies, warned Paul Starr, a Princeton 
University analyst who helped the Administration develop its proposals last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite considerable business resistance to the mandate, Administration 
officials insist that no other politically feasible alternatives exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "While no one likes the idea of added employer responsibility, no one can come 
up with a better way of achieving the goal of universal coverage," House Ways 
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have got to understand the trade-offs, and that's just beginning to 
happen," said John Rother, director of legislation, research and policy for the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons. "If you're not going to have the employer 
mandate, then taxes have to be a lot higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton chose the mandate because it builds on the current system, in which 
most Americans get their insurance through the workplace. Moreover, an employer 
mandate would cover 80% of the 38 million uninsured who are already jobholders 
or dependents of jobholders. 
</P>
<P>
 On the health care alliances, the President has all but declared his 
willingness to allow them to become voluntary rather than mandatory 
cooperatives and to invest in them far fewer regulatory functions -- which "can 
probably be done some other place," as he told California Medical Assn. leaders 
during a satellite teleconference last month. Clinton also may agree to allow 
for competing alliances in the same regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it'll all be debated in Congress and I'm certainly flexible on it," 
the President said, implying, nevertheless, that some alliance structure may be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without alliances, there's not a sufficient pooling mechanism to group people 
into large risk pools," Rother said. "These things are not there just to look 
good. They are actually there to solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the President's bottom-line goal of universal coverage, the broad 
rationale of his complex proposal is beginning to dawn on members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 After divisive wrangling, the House Ways and Means health subcommittee 
produced a bill that contains an employer mandate and tough cost controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would require all employers with more than 100 workers to provide 
insurance by Jan. 1, 1996. Firms with fewer than 100 employees would get a 
two-year grace period. The bill would also impose federal cost controls on the 
fees of private doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. And it contains a 
$1.25-per-pack increase in the federal cigarette tax, 50 cents more than 
Clinton's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A separate proposal, crafted by House Energy and Commerce Chairman John D. 
Dingell (D-Mich.), also would retain the employer mandate. It too eases the 
burden on small business by exempting firms with 10 or fewer workers. The plan 
also would scale back the minimum benefits package and make participation in 
alliances voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan's not bad, is it? Things are really getting interesting," a top 
Clinton adviser said.  
</P>
<P>
 An Administration health analyst said: "I wouldn't say it's 80% of the 
President's plan, but it's close." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some moderate Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee are 
circulating a proposal that would give firms with fewer than 100 employees a 
chance to phase in the employer mandate over four years, starting with a 50% 
contribution and reaching 80% only by the fourth year. 
</P>
<P>
 Such transitional compromises may well win the support of small-business 
owners, as several of them said in testimony before the Senate Finance 
Committee last month.  
</P>
<P>
 With such encouraging words from the most implacable opponents of Clinton's 
agenda to date, no wonder Clinton and his health care team are so upbeat. That 
became apparent on a recent spring afternoon as the President, First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, spoke at a 
health care pep rally on the White House South Lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton clapped his hands in delight when Sister Bernice Coreil, a St. Louis 
hospital administrator, told him not to be discouraged by exaggerated reports 
of his plan's demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "D.E.A.D.," she said, "stands for 'Don't Expect A Defeat.' "

COLUMN ONE; POWER AND PLEASURES OF THE PEN; AFICIONADOS REVEL IN THE REVIVAL OF 
FINE STATIONERY AND THE PERSONAL LETTER. EXECUTIVES FIND HANDWRITTEN MEMOS HAVE 
GAINED NEW CLOUT. AND WHO WANTS A COMPUTER-PRINTED VALENTINE?

<P>
 May we step back a moment from the great, heralded, chaotic coming of the 
Information Age and reflect on the survival of pen, paper and letter? 
</P>
<P>
 Survival? Make it revival. 
</P>
<P>
 Chisel and stone gave way to quill and paper some centuries ago to make 
writing easier and faster. And now futurists tell us the pen and paper will 
soon disappear because of quicker photon and silicon. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Futurists are supposed to say that, so it cannot be helped," said Ellsworth 
Brown, president of the Carnegie Institute and Library in Pittsburgh, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is one of thousands of busy Americans who race through life, from 
meeting to telephone conference, from taxi to airport, all the while carrying 
that supposedly endangered artifact from a more placid age: the fountain pen. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the saying goes, it is a gift to be simple," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Large, heavy and crafted with precision, the fine writing pen has made a 
comeback, and is staying back. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal letter too. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leading-edge Luddites are out there, perhaps in your own neighborhood, 
trying to revive the dying art of penmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of things personal," Brown said about his fountain pen and 
pad of paper. To manipulate data, give him an electronic machine. To turn over 
ideas, he'll take a pen. "It is incredibly convenient . . . you can flag 
things, circle them, go back to them, see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we should thank the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than diminish our interest and need, the microprocessor seems to 
stimulate demand for these venerated traditions: sending us back into our past 
for ways in which to be expressive and personal against the unbearable sameness 
of the computer, for ways to be reflective against the ephemeral electron. 
</P>
<P>
 So despite the explosion of E-mail, interlinks, cellular phones and fax 
machines, it may come as a blow to those infatuated by future-think to know 
that in 1991, Americans wrote and mailed 100 million more personal letters than 
they did just four years earlier, according to the U.S. Postal Service. Not 
only that, personal letters increased their share of the overall mail load, 
despite rising volumes of junk and business correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond just raw numbers is the growing appreciation for this lively art. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing that can take the place of a letter," wrote Jerry Lee Hill, 
founder of the Minneapolis-based Letter Enjoyers Assn. In an interview 
conducted via mail, Hill wrote: "A letter has the ability to deliver a bit of 
the personality of its writer. . . . There's a charm and graciousness to letter 
writing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Letters are gifts -- both ways," said Van Gordon Sauter, Fox Network news 
executive and former president of CBS News. "I enjoy writing letters because I 
enjoy thinking of the people who will receive them." 
</P>
<P>
 But, you say, you are too busy to write. 
</P>
<P>
 Via letter, Sauter points to President Theodore Roosevelt: "On New Year's Day 
in 1907, he welcomed the citizenry to the White House and shook 8,107 hands -- 
an average of 50 per minute. He also on that day conducted personal 
professional business, and between breakfast and a morning reception wrote 25 
letters (of the estimated 50,000 he had written to that point in his life.)" 
</P>
<P>
 That was then, but what about tomorrow? Will young people retain any of this 
tradition? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Postal Service set out to increase literacy and an 
appreciation for the letter by establishing "wee deliver" mock post offices at 
elementary schools. Today, 18,000 schools have adopted the program, which 
teaches kindergartners through fourth-graders how to correspond with each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 A Postal Service spokeswoman says one result has been better attendance at 
these schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoying an even more obvious resurgence are the tools of writing. 
</P>
<P>
 A generation ago, the idea of a successful retail store specializing in fine 
writing instruments was quaint to the extreme. Just a few existed. Today, pen 
stores thrive in most major cities, and some distribute catalogues nationwide. 
Department stores and artist-supply, luggage and gift shops also market quality 
pens. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 15 years, U.S. sales of fountain pens have increased from 6.4 
million to 25.4 million, according to the Writing Instruments Manufacturers 
Assn. You can add to that the millions more fine ballpoints and roller balls. 
It is common for these instruments to reach prices of $100 to $600 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting pencils and cheaper pens, 5 billion writing instruments were sold in 
the United States in 1992, twice as many as in 1973. Innovations, style changes 
and quality improvements seem to occur monthly -- both the result of growing 
manufacturer competition and an increasing number of pen and paper collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 To men like Jon Sullivan, this is the golden age of the pen. He is president 
of America's pioneer specialty store, Fahrney's, in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when people used to walk in and say: 'You got to be kidding. 
There's still such a thing as a fountain pen?' " Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes that President John F. Kennedy helped cultivate the 
nation's taste. Bamboo-pointed soft tips were just coming into being during the 
Kennedy Administration, and the White House ordered boxes of them. Soon, 
Washington followed suit, and the demand for expressive writing instruments 
swelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business has grown steadily since, with only a couple of dips along the way," 
Sullivan said. "Right now, today, people have the greatest choice of fine 
writing instruments ever made." 
</P>
<P>
 Fahrney's catalogue has a national circulation of 100,000. At least one 
specialty magazine is published for collectors, and pen shows are held around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, H. G. Daniels Co., an art-supply firm in Los Angeles, has 
gone head to head with the computer, and in some cases lost. It's hard to match 
computer graphics with off-the-shelf artist equipment, for example. So thank 
heavens for precious pens. In the last 20 years, the company has become a major 
purveyor of quality writing instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have the pen, we'd be in trouble filling the gaps for products 
computers have taken the place of," manager Nancy Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, she realizes the irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the pen has come a boom in fine writing paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Capper Heffernan opened her downtown Seattle store in 1983, offering exotic 
and handcrafted stationery "because I love paper. I needed it. It's friendly. 
It's essential. It's right up there with the wheel. It has history. But it has 
a future." 
</P>
<P>
 Every year since, business has grown in cotton bonds, watermarked Italian 
stock, handmade sheets from the Himalayas, a variety of regionally indigenous 
fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our indications are that personal correspondence is undergoing some kind of 
resurgence," said John Hansen of Crane & Co., a nationally known supplier of 
stationery in Dalton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Aficionados of pen and paper search for some simple explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Whimsy, mysticism, nostalgia, rebellion, practicality and a healthy dollop of 
egotism all figure in one way or the other. People say they are reaching for a 
personal touch in an impersonal culture, something warm against the chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's because some people write less by hand and take greater interest in 
the few things they do write, such as their signature. Others don't use a pen 
at all, but feed their laser printer $7.50 sheets of rice paper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years ago, business executives made their best impression in 
flawlessly typed letters with a secretary's initials at the bottom. Today, many 
executives deliver their strongest punch with their own hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Newell Smith is an entertainment and food expert at Sutton Place 
Gourmet in Washington. She advises writing invitations by hand for any party 
smaller than 50. "What you say is, I'm writing you because I want you to come." 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the fine fountain pen is a way to display status. That's why Mont 
Blanc pens are often advertised in the same upscale publications that feature 
Rolex watches. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, who take notes or write a lot by hand, proselytize about how the 
"feel" and "balance" of a good pen against fine paper adds a sense of pleasure 
and craftsmanship to their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles lawyer Jeff Towns learned in school that he could write faster and 
enjoy it more by using better tools. "Without sounding completely strange, I 
just like the feel of a fountain pen. It's smooth and effortless." 
</P>
<P>
 For some people, pen and paper is a disciplined way to write or edit -- words 
thus produced come slower and mean more than those that fly off keyboards in 
clumps of easy verbosity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Post-modernist designer Ettore Sottsass of Milan, renowned for his rendition 
of the 1970s Olivetti typewriter, among other things, has just turned his 
artistry into a new fountain pen for the Italian company Omas. "Tapping a 
keyboard," he said by way of explanation, leaves writers "separated from our 
thoughts. . . . The act of writing is in fact a mysterious action, sometimes 
ambiguous and complicated. The transition of thought to written word requires 
duration. Thoughts multiply as time passes." 
</P>
<P>
 Magazines as diverse as serious Harper's and trend-setter GQ published 
articles this spring about the simple art of the love letter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Columbus, Ohio, Richard Northup is a vice president of Zaner-Bloser, which 
publishes handwriting courses for teachers and young students. He was 
interviewed by several reporters for Valentine's Day stories and says: "I was 
surprised, practically all of them interrupted me to say how much they were 
afraid of receiving a love letter that came out of a word processor." 
</P>
<P>
 To many people, the matter of pen and paper is a deep attachment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pen is an aesthetically beautiful object. It connects me to myself, my 
past, my entire being," said Nancy C. Andreasen, professor of psychiatry at the 
University of Iowa in Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 Andreasen also is editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Psychiatry and 
must turn down 80% of the professional papers submitted for publication. A 
rejection written with her Pelikan Toledo fountain pen "conveys to them that I 
care." And it also soothes. "I learned from my predecessor that it's harder to 
be mad at someone who writes you a personal note." 
</P>
<P>
 If pens and paper are thriving, penmanship, it seems, is not keeping up its 
end of things. Teachers, postal clerks, secretaries and pharmacists can attest 
to the decay of American handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, American Demographics magazine compiled a disheartening 
inventory of undeliverable letters, processed film that could not be returned, 
indecipherable prescriptions and even the fatal crash of a small airplane 
caused by someone's illegible handwritten barometer reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Here and there, however, are scattered signs of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Fahrney's pen store is increasingly being asked by customers to recommend 
handwriting courses. Calligraphy and calligraphy pens are hot sellers in gift 
stores. Zaner-Bloser says demand is up for its correspondence course designed 
to help teachers understand the basics of penmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 At Maple Hill Elementary School in Diamond Bar, Calif., handwriting 
coordinator Teri Beattie produced two winners in a national penmanship contest 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This hasn't been receiving emphasis like multiculturalism or social studies, 
but we believe students need to know how to write. It's basic," Beattie said. 
"When you learn to write, your self-esteem goes up."

POSSIBLE ROBERTI SUCCESSORS ARE NEARLY INVISIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have been virtually invisible, but in a little more than one week, one of 
them could be vaulted into a post that pays $75,000 a year, boasts a trove of 
perks, and gives its holder power and prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 The five are candidates in the April 12 recall election that targets state 
Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) for removal. 
</P>
<P>
 If Roberti's political machine -- equipped with a panoply of consultants, 
phone banks, literature and supporters from Hollywood to Sacramento -- stumbles 
and is unable to muster more than a 50% vote against the recall drive, one from 
this almost anonymous quintet will become the next senator, literally 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, they have languished unseen in the shadows of Roberti's costly 
media blitz that has relentlessly attacked his foes as "assault weapons 
extremists" who are wasting taxpayer money by trying to unseat a lawmaker who 
will be forced from office in December by term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, obscurity has been inflicted on the challengers by a lack of money. 
Collectively, the five have less than a 10th of Roberti's $750,000 political 
war chest. And without money, the group has been unable to effectively 
communicate their message to voters through paid advertising or events 
engineered to catch the media's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Los Angeles Times poll confirmed their political predicament. The 
five are barely known even to those voters most likely to vote, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 The five are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Randy Linkmeyer, 37, worked as a sales representative for a national gun 
distributor for a number of years until he bought Art's Guns, a small store in 
Canoga Park, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer has put together perhaps the most ambitious campaign of the five. He 
has produced a series of 30-second TV ads that are airing on local cable 
channels and, for this weekend, he organized free gun safety seminars at five 
San Fernando Valley shooting ranges. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent candidates forum, Linkmeyer rented a hospitality suite for his 
supporters and the media while his campaign director button-holed visitors for 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Sherman Oaks resident was not involved in the grueling, months-long 
signature-gathering phase of the recall and for this he is resented as an 
interloper by some of the old hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Linkmeyer, however, contends that his commitment is unassailable and points to 
the fact that in 1989, when Roberti was enacting his controversial ban on 
military-style semiautomatic rifles, he helped co-found the Constitutional 
Rights Federation to fight gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 He later left the organization, he said, because it was captured by radicals 
who advocated the abolition of background checks on gun purchasers and the 
legalization of machine-gun ownership. "You won't find anyone stronger on the 
Second Amendment than myself, but I'm not a radical," Linkmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his gun interests, Linkmeyer said his first priority as a state 
senator would be to decentralize -- not break up -- the Los Angeles Unified 
School District. His two school-age children are in private schools, and "it 
makes me mad as hell that I have to pay private school tuition when I'm paying 
taxes for the public schools because I can't trust them with my children," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I accomplished nothing else as a senator, I would want it to be that I 
gave the schools back to the parents and children." 
</P>
<P>
 * Dolores White, 59, is a real estate broker who is making her second bid to 
knock out Roberti and win his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, when Roberti first ran for the Valley-based 20th District seat, White 
was one of nine who challenged him. The longtime Republican Party activist got 
10.5% of the vote at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she and four others initiated the recall campaign, culminating in 
January with the determination that the recall election had qualified for the 
ballot by gathering more than 20,000 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who has a master's degree in economics from UCLA and was an assistant 
professor at Cal State Los Angeles, has won the support of the county 
Republican Party's Central Committee, of which she is a member. 
</P>
<P>
 "This recall is history in the making," White recently said at a candidates 
forum in Van Nuys. "They are watching this election all across the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 White is the only woman in the race, and the only one of the challengers who 
-- responding to a question at a candidates forum sponsored by the National 
Rifle Assn. -- answered that she did not own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Like her fellow challengers, she has strong views on the need for stiffer 
penalties for criminals and a strong stand on immigration control. "I favor a 
one-strike-and-you're-out provision for sexual offenders," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining about the huge costs of providing welfare, health and education 
benefits to illegal aliens with large numbers of children, White told an 
audience in Van Nuys that "we're the ones who should be having them (children) 
and certainly we should take away all the benefits to illegals, no matter what 
country they come from." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bill Dominguez, 43, is a systems analyst who lives in Van Nuys. Introducing 
himself to an audience of pro-recall supporters recently, Dominguez said: "I'm 
the one who started this party." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Dominguez, the only Democrat among the challengers, was the leader of 
the coalition that organized the signature-gathering chapter of the recall 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez has frequently cited his family history to explain his own 
heart-felt views that gun control laws interfere with the public's right to 
rise up in arms against a domestic tyrant. In the early 1960s, the Dominguez 
family fled Cuba as refugees from the Castro regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez recently told a group that he got his first gun when he was 8 years 
old and had it confiscated when he was 11 by Fidel Castro's henchmen. Because 
of his youthful experiences, Dominguez said he is "not quite as complacent as 
many people in this country are" about the dangers of dictators. 
</P>
<P>
 Like White, Dominguez was a candidate in the 1992 special election. He has 
also been a leading figure in Californians Against Corruption, a Signal 
Hill-based group, and the California Voters Alliance, a Woodland Hills group, 
both of which have tapped gun owners throughout the state and nation to support 
the recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his work, Dominguez inadvertently helped hand a public relations coup 
to the Roberti camp when he reported the theft of more than a dozen guns from 
his home. The Roberti side crowed that Dominguez's arsenal was proof of the 
recall leader's overpowering fascination with guns and belied his attempts to 
characterize the recall drive as the work of good government reformers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Al Dib, 63, retired owner of a produce business, has run four times for 
public office, his last time in 1993 when he ran for the Los Angeles City 
Council seat being vacated then by Ernani Bernardi. Dib has been active in 
community affairs for years and has been a confidante of Councilman Hal 
Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a newcomer to the recall, Dib has staked out a radical position on 
gun control issues. At a recent forum, he urged the abolition of laws outlawing 
concealed weapons and machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign adviser is Manny Fernandez, who, along with Linkmeyer, co-founded 
the Constitutional Rights Federation. Fernandez, who pleaded guilty to owning a 
machine gun in the early 1980s, was purged from the recall coalition after he 
was quoted as saying that the movement was the gun lobby's revenge against 
Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 * Larry Martz, 51, is a handyman who lived in the South Bay until about a year 
ago, when he moved to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Martz, chairman of the Valley chapter of the American Pistol and Rifle Assn., 
describes himself as an avid participant in political organizations and causes, 
including protests against federal laws aimed at regulating vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I feel like a Don Quixote, but I have to participate because there 
is so much corruption and special-interest influence," he said recently. "Maybe 
I am a little crazy, but so was Einstein and Edison." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Martz said he was a volunteer in Ross Perot's presidential 
campaign and Richard Riordan's campaign for mayor of Los Angeles. He has 
circulated petitions for numerous initiatives, and is working to get signatures 
for the Save Our State initiative to place new controls on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Martz said his top priorities would include breaking up the Los 
Angeles school district, repealing laws that give authorities wide-ranging 
power to seize the assets of drug dealers, and requiring full disclosure of 
foods that have been irradiated or treated with hormones.

CENSORSHIP FIGHT OVER SCHOOL TESTS ESCALATES; EDUCATION: STATE SENDS OUT 
MATERIAL IN TAMPER-PROOF PLASTIC, BUT CRITICS HOPE TO FIND OUT CONTENTS AND 
PREPARE TO SUE TO HALT EXAMS. LEGISLATIVE DEBATE IS HEATING UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-secret documents sealed in tamper-proof plastic are arriving on the 
doorsteps of California's public schools. Inside are the latest versions of the 
state performance test to be taken by about 1 million children by mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of tight security is usually just precautionary, but not anymore. 
Authorities are determined to avoid what happened last fall when one section of 
the test -- a story by Pulitzer Prize winner Alice Walker -- was reproduced in 
a Riverside newspaper, prompting educators to remove the excerpt from the exam 
and sparking a major battle over censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to defuse the controversy, the state Board of Education last month 
reinstated the story and two others to the pool of literature that officials 
draw upon to assemble the California Learning Assessment System tests. 
</P>
<P>
 But that move failed to end what promises to be a long-running ideological 
battle on the suitability of the materials used to judge how well California 
students perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the closely guarded test have distributed more excerpts from the 
1993 edition and are eager to get their hands on the 1994 version and make that 
public too, thus impairing its usefulness as test material.  
</P>
<P>
 Opponents maintain that the innovative exam -- a new approach intended to 
measure critical thinking skills of students against tough statewide standards 
-- fails to test what public school students learn. Among the objections are 
that open-ended questions seek to elicit feelings, not knowledge, from the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of their strategy, conservative opponents are poised to sue school 
districts from the Coachella Valley to Santa Barbara to block the 
administration of the test this spring. They contend that state law requires 
that parents give permission before children take the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Test supporters characterize the criticism as the rantings of right-wing 
zealots, and say the objections are tinged with racism and sexism because many 
of the targeted writing samples are by African Americans and women. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first test date approaches and criticism mounts, the state Department 
of Education is warning school superintendents that they must administer the 
test to all students. The authorities are also cautioning teachers that any 
attempt to divulge test contents could cost them their teaching credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 To deter tampering with the test process, legislators plan to introduce 
legislation to impose criminal sanctions and stiff fines for release of the 
confidential material. 
</P>
<P>
 But Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, conceded 
that all it would take to destroy the integrity of the test is "one teacher 
going to a Xerox machine." 
</P>
<P>
 The test was administered for the first time in 1993 to fourth-, eighth- and 
10th-grade students in public schools, and the student scores, largely dismal, 
were made public last month. The test sections included mathematics, reading 
and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Unified School District, the first groups of an estimated 
140,000 students, now including fifth-graders, are scheduled to begin taking 
the performance test Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as students sharpen their pencils to start the test, the debate is 
heating up in the Legislature. Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) is among 
those pushing legislation set to be heard this week to authorize administration 
of the test in future years, while angry Republican legislators are demanding a 
reappraisal. Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga) is 
expected this week to ask to see copies of the current testing materials -- a 
request that already has been denied by the Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican legislators say their complaints go beyond criticism of individual 
passages by Walker and other authors. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent Assembly Education Committee hearing, one of the critics, 
Assemblyman Larry Bowler (R-Elk Grove), said there is a suspicion that the test 
is laden with value judgments and the "attempt to manipulate and intimidate 
young minds. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), chairwoman of the committee, 
strongly disagreed, saying the test does not "get into issues of morality at 
all. The truth is that these people (test critics) are afraid of children being 
able to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, a candidate for state superintendent of public instruction, denounced 
Republican Assembly critics as "extremists arming for Armageddon. . . . These 
people probably don't want us to have public education." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups passing around parts of the 1993 test in the Capitol are the 
Escondido-based United States Justice Foundation and the Eagle Forum of 
California, part of a nationwide conservative women's group headed by Phyllis 
Schlafly. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Steinke of La Quinta, an Eagle Forum director in the Coachella Valley, 
said it is possible that if she obtains a copy of the 1994 test, she would 
expose objectionable portions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things you can't hide," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Steinke's view, the literature sections of the test deal "in a lot of 
hopelessness" and she faults the exam for failing to measure such basic skills 
as spelling and legible writing -- a charge denied by those who created the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the statewide standards used to score the tests, student writing 
performance is judged by the succinctness, depth and originality of the writing 
as well as by the grammar used. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step for opponents is to ask the courts to block the test. Steinke 
and Gary Kreep, executive director of the private, nonprofit Justice 
Foundation, will argue that the test explores the beliefs of students -- in 
violation of a state law that requires parental consent before children answer 
such personal questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange of the state Department of Education said in an interview that if a 
question was viewed as "too intrusive of a person's personal life," educators 
modified it willingly, not because of attacks by conservative activists. 
</P>
<P>
 She said widespread disclosure undermines the integrity of the assessment 
system, which when fully in place will cost about $55 million a year to 
administer. Currently, Lange said, there are no penalties for exposing the 
contents of the test. 
</P>
<P>
 That became clear recently as opponents openly distributed copies before and 
during the Assembly Education Committee hearing. Leafing through the packet 
passed out by critics, Dale Carlson, who has overseen development of the test 
for the Department of Education, shook his head and described the material as 
"the real McCoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the passages that critics called attention to were a story from "Black 
Boy" by Richard Wright and "Not Poor Just Broke" by Dick Gregory. Lange 
confirmed that the Wright story was used on the language arts portion of last 
year's test. She would not say whether Gregory's was on the test. 
</P>
<P>
 In the exam, students are asked to read a passage and evaluate its meaning or 
describe their feelings about what they read. The response is scored for the 
students' ability to understand the text, question and revise their 
interpretations and connect ideas in the passage to their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Phil Lawson, representing the California Council of Churches, said he 
was concerned about censorship and what he called "the internalized racism and 
sexism" because critics of the test cite stories by Walker, other African 
Americans and women authors. 
</P>
<P>
 Test opponents brushed aside the race of the authors as unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has simmered since last fall when the Riverside 
Press-Enterprise published an excerpt from Walker's "Roselily" along with 
accompanying questions that appeared on the 1993 test. The story is about the 
thoughts of a black unmarried mother as she stands at the altar for her wedding 
to a Muslim man. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials said they had no choice but to delete it from the 
test because the confidentiality of the exam had been breached. About the same 
time, the Traditional Values Coalition questioned the story because it "could 
easily be construed as anti-religious and anti-clergy." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the state Board of Education removed another Walker story, "Am I 
Blue?," from the 1994 test. The story relates the loneliness of a horse named 
Blue and ends with the narrator unable to eat a steak: "I am eating misery, I 
thought, as I took the first bite and spit it out." Board President Marion 
McDowell described the story as "anti meat-eating." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, an excerpt from Annie Dillard's "American Childhood" about her 
growing up was pulled from the test. Board member Kathryn Dronenburg said the 
story by the Pulitzer Prize winner was removed because of violence in the 
depiction of a snowball fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Besieged with complaints about censorship, the board last month ordered the 
writings restored to the pool of literature used to test reading comprehension 
and analytical skills. Whether they will actually form part of the test 
materials presented to students this spring is unknown.

BREWING CHANGE; 'COWBOY COFFEE' ONCE RULED THE ROAST IN NEVADA, BUT CAFE LATTE 
AND CAPPUCCINO ARE BRINGING A TASTE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE SILVER STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA L. La GANGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, there was "cowboy coffee," that dense, mobile brew borne of 
campfires and cattle drives, so thick, some say, it caused the spoons to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 But buckaroos gave way to Burger Kings, Nevada took on a Midwestern twang and 
coffee here began "to look like tea," says Tara McCarty, managing director of 
the Western Folklife Center in Elko. 
</P>
<P>
 She's the first to admit that silver palates are hard to find in the Silver 
State, that anyone in search of a sip of Sumatra will probably locate "garbage 
roadside coffee" instead. And she knows who's to blame for this travesty of 
taste: "The middle-class, middle-American suburban influence." 
</P>
<P>
 But a funny thing's happening on the way to the Bunn-o-matic; it's turning 
into a big, brass Rosito Bisani. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if Starbucks still has no plans to bring baristas to Beatty. Nevada 
has passed its share of mocha java milestones: 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, more than half a dozen new espresso places have opened 
their doors -- or sometimes just their drive-through windows -- here in Reno, 
Nevada's unofficial Coffee Central. 
</P>
<P>
 There finally are more espresso machines statewide than burble away on Main 
Street in Santa Monica -- perhaps the most caffeinated mile in the country, 
with more than 30 such coffee makers and shops stocked with everything from 
organic espresso to the improbable "Chocolate Tofu Mousse." 
</P>
<P>
 There's even espresso in Elko, the remote northeastern home of the annual 
Cowboy Poetry Gathering. The Gathering, one guidebook says, is "important for 
its contribution to rural and small-town American culture, which is seriously 
threatened by urbanization, water rights, corporate agriculture, and the global 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevadans are now "getting into yuppie or maybe it's back into their roots, to 
cowboy coffee," McCarty says as she struggles to account for the changes 
brewing in her home state. "It's that California influence, I know it is. 
California has certainly invaded Reno. And there's quite a few (espresso bars) 
in Elko." 
</P>
<P>
 An unprecedented number of Californians have fled to this state, bringing with 
them more than just traffic jams and crowded schoolyards. As they bleed across 
the border in search of a more stable economy -- about 31,000 of them in fiscal 
year 1993 alone -- they're also causing a quantum leap in the quality of 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what they say here in Reno. Which, by the way, now has good 
coffee and bad traffic, compliments of you-know-who, former Californian Kathy 
Ensminger said as she bought a latte at Kinko's copy shop on the appropriately 
named California Avenue. "You get one and put up with the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Las Vegas weighs in at four times the size of tiny Reno, it lags far 
behind its neighbor to the north. The water in Las Vegas is so hard, one 
caffeine expert said, that it is barely possible to brew a good cup there. 
</P>
<P>
 Add salts from the Colorado River -- Las Vegas's water supply -- to acids 
naturally found in coffee "and there goes any taste difference between an East 
African arabica and a West African robusta," says Ted Lingle, executive 
director of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America. (That's a good one and a bad 
one, for those not in the know.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are espresso bars in Sin City South -- at least 15 in the Yellow Pages 
alone, and that doesn't count the coffee counter at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno's Eldorado Hotel & Casino has 15 espresso machines by itself, says 
executive chef Anthony Gillette, who likes to boast between puffs on a Marlboro 
that "this is the only hotel in the country that roasts and grinds its own 
coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Geography and climate are on Reno's side. Winter has snow; summer is not 
painful. What better place to quaff a cappuccino? "When you go to Vegas in the 
summer, it's 115," Gillette says. "You want a beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's attitude. OK, so Reno soon will be home to the National Bowling 
Stadium; it's also a city that aspires to culture. Witness a billboard campaign 
that trumpets such arts-commission slogans as "National Survey: Many Renoites 
prefer 'La Boheme' to la ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are close to San Francisco; Las Vegas is close to nothing," said Tim 
Healion, owner of the Pneumatic Cafe. "Las Vegas is a very superficial 
community with absolutely no true soul and no taste. . . . Vegas is an evil 
place, and I don't recommend anyone going there." 
</P>
<P>
 This from the man who also owns Reno's very first coffee house, the nearly 
9-year-old Deux Gros Nez. Yes, Francophiles, that's "two big noses" to you; his 
partner gave two thumbs down to the prospective name Cabeza Gorda -- "fat head" 
en espanol.  
</P>
<P>
 With its loud music, flannel-and-Docs set and resident bag woman, Deux Gros 
Nez at one time ruled the Reno roast. Then came The Laughing C.A.T. (home of 
Cat's House Blend) and Mr. Latte, Java Jungle and Cafe Royale-Royale Roasting 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real influx," says Myles Garber, co-owner of Cafe Royale, which opened 
across the street from Deux Gros Nez a year ago. "But it's still in its 
infancy. It's six years behind Seattle, three or four behind California." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind, however, is merely a state of mind. Squint at the long line of cars 
queued up for a morning jolt at Espresso to Go-A Drive Thru, and you might just 
think you are in California. As co-owner Shelley Warne does her morning 
pirouette-with-milk-carton in the closet-size former Fotomat, at least one Jeep 
Cherokee driver passes the time via cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Warne, however, does not ascribe to the California-made-us-do-it theory of how 
cappuccino came to Reno. There is, says the former Valley Girl, a coffee craze 
sweeping the whole country. So why shouldn't good coffee get to Nevada all by 
itself? 
</P>
<P>
 "California has such a big attitude," she says. "I don't know who died and 
made them kings and queens."

ON CALIFORNIA: TARGET ME! RECALL ME! MARTYR ME! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Producing political pain by bleeding our targets is what brings us great 
pleasure and satisfaction. -- From a strategy memo by proponents of a recall of 
state Sen. David Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. David Roberti slumps in his chair, arms dropped to his side, head 
hung low. He looks up with sad eyes, and talks in resigned tones of playing 
"the hand that is dealt me." His posture and demeanor suggest a man awaiting 
execution. The temptation is to whistle a little "Tom Dooley," to offer a last 
cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor David Roberti. On April 12, after a quarter-century in public office, he 
will be subjected to the first recall election of a California legislator in 80 
years. How is it going? he is asked. Roberti shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all right," he says tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what's it been like, facing this assault so far along in political life? 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels like you are under siege," he says. "It's been nasty. There have 
been personal threats, political threats. The recall and the whole opposition 
of the gun lobby is a very difficult thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He looks up again with those big, sad eyes, a martyr in waiting, and it at 
once becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
 David Roberti is the luckiest politician in California today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is lucky because just as his career was fading, a coalition of gun rights 
activists and various government watchdog types from the fringes of state 
politics came along and sponsored a recall drive against him. He is lucky 
because either through adroit campaigning, simplistic reporting or plain truth 
-- the point is debated -- the recall has become a closely watched referendum 
on assault weapons. It has become, to quote one national pundit, "the most 
important political campaign in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's story is that the "gun nuts" have come to hunt him down in his last 
political hour. Five years ago, a troubled soul exercised the rights the NRA 
works so diligently to protect. He took his AK-47 and played army with a 
schoolyard of children in Stockton. After the slaughter, Roberti helped push 
through a bill that banned certain assault weapons. Prior to this, his only 
foray into weapons control legislation was a crackdown on toy guns. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Roberti's view that the recall is simple pay back. "The reason why I 
have been able to put the attention on weapons" he says, "is because I am 
telling the truth." He buttresses the case with strategy memos obtained somehow 
from the other side, polemics laced with mock assassin language about "bleeding 
targets" and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 This scenario is disputed by recall proponents, but not with any great effect. 
The script is set. Roberti has been cast in the role of his biblical namesake 
-- a lonely warrior sent to battle the gun lobby Goliath. This is how the story 
has been told from here to New York City and across the nation on television. 
This is how the election seems to be framed in the minds of voters in the 20th 
District. That the NRA announced last week it would start airing pro-recall 
commercials was but one more piece of good fortune for Roberti, solidifying, as 
it did, his preferred story line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before the recall drive, Roberti seemed marked for political exile. His long 
run as Senate leader was all but finished; term limits mandate his departure 
before Christmas. Prospects for higher office were dim in part because, short 
of Willie Brown, no one better personifies Sacramento politics -- hardly a 
helpful distinction in these days of voter discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, no one asks much about Roberti's Sacramento record; they mainly 
want to talk guns. In public, Roberti's main role is to wave guns at every 
photo op and look beleaguered. His campaign placards don't mention his name, 
only assault weapons. And now there's even an explanation for Roberti's rather 
startling failure to move to the Valley from Los Feliz after switching 
districts: the "gun nuts" had threatened his family. Now he has new friends to 
tap: "There's an issue at stake," he says. "I'm not just another politician 
calling." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Roberti insists he'd rather be "a hero than a martyr," the 
distinction is thin. Beat the recall, and polls have him way ahead; Roberti 
becomes the courageous leader who stared down the gun people. Lose, and he can 
wave his own bloody shirt -- the man who gave all. Yes, he'll have surrendered 
eight months of lame-duck duty, but Roberti can use the free time. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the recall began, Roberti has announced his candidacy for state 
treasurer. Consider how much tougher that quest would have been without the 
attention and glory that have come his way in this fight. Does the firing squad 
have any last requests?

 Hundreds of people gathered at Palo Comado Canyon in eastern Ventura County on 
Saturday to celebrate the dedication of the former cattle ranch -- once slated 
for luxury homes and a PGA golf course -- as federal parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with dozens of hikers, bikers and equestrians, politicians and 
environmental activists showed up in force to take credit for the acquisition 
of the 2,329-acre tract, formerly known as Jordan Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The dedication began with an ancient ceremony led by Chumash Indian Chief 
Charlie Cooke, who instructed the more than 400 park visitors gathered under a 
canopy of oak trees to reach down and touch the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you know what you're made of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, taking a clay bowl filled with smoldering white sage, Cooke disbursed 
streams of smoke in a gesture symbolizing the purification of the land.  
</P>
<P>
 The smoke had barely cleared before the jostling began among many of the 
dignitaries over who could claim the most credit for the acquisition of the 
tract, now part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service bought Palo Comado Canyon from Bob Hope last June 
for $16.7 million after a drawn-out battle over a 750-home development and 
world-class golf course planned for the site. Those development plans were 
shifted to nearby Ahmanson Ranch as part of a complex deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight to save Palo Comado Canyon involved five years of sparring by local, 
state and federal officials. The politicking continued Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced by a federal park official as "the father of the Santa Monica 
Mountains," Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) was the first to speak 
during the ceremony that drew people from both Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is of course for me extremely gratifying for all these many years to have 
been able to play a role in obtaining the funding to purchase this property," 
as well as other mountain land, said Beilenson, who is running for reelection 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to thank other officials present for their role in helping to 
acquire Palo Comado Canyon. They included Ventura County Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Director Joseph T. Edmiston and 
National Recreation Area Superintendent David Gackenbach. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson also credited Gov. Pete Wilson and his staff for helping to work out 
a compromise deal between developers and county officials that resulted in the 
cancellation of development plans for the canyon. Beilenson acknowledged that 
Richard Sybert, a former Wilson aide now competing for Beilenson's job, was 
present at the ceremony, but did not mention him by name. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will speak to you shortly, so I won't introduce him," said Beilenson, 
eliciting laughs from the crowd. "But he'll be around for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, Sybert, the governor's official representative at the 
ceremony, took the podium and wasted no time in returning the jab. 
</P>
<P>
 "As someone who plans to be here for a while, I'd like to give credit where 
credit is due -- to Congressman Beilenson," Sybert said. "I know as he looks 
back on a long career he will look upon this as something to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 In her speech, VanderKolk, a key player in the deal that resulted in the land 
purchase, noted that "all of the complicated reasons we are here today are not 
nearly so important as the fact we are here. I for one am happy that we are 
here together and celebrating this special moment." 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, who had been criticized by Sybert in the past for not giving 
Wilson enough credit in the parkland deal, did not mention Wilson or Sybert in 
her speech. She did, however, give special thanks to Beilenson as "one of our 
most effective members of the House of Representatives and our white knight in 
shining armor." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Wiesbrock, president of Save Open Space, an environmental group credited 
with leading the charge against development at Palo Comado Canyon, said she was 
proud of "what the public has accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wiesbrock said the park service never should have paid Hope millions 
for the land. Because the property was landlocked -- with no legal access for a 
roadway -- it would have never been able to be developed, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Edmiston, of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, said that because the 
land was privately owned, it still had to be purchased for public use. And he 
called the value of the land "incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiesbrock urged the crowd to join her group in fighting development on 
neighboring Ahmanson Ranch, where a 3,050-dwelling golf course community is 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the giant Ahmanson Ranch 
project in 1993 on the condition that the development partners deliver to state 
and federal park agencies 10,000 acres of mountain land -- most of it owned by 
Hope. So far, only about 3,000 acres, including Hope's Palo Comado Canyon, have 
been acquired as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ahmanson Land Co., which has agreed to dedicate 2,633 acres of its ranch 
as open space, must still deliver two other Hope properties to park agencies 
before it can go forward with its development. These include Hope's 4,369-acre 
Runkle Ranch near Chatsworth and his 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who attended Saturday's dedication ceremonies said they were not 
bothered by all the politicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a quarterback on a football team," said Grant Gerson, 73, who rode 
his horse to the ceremony. "If you win, you're a hero. If you lose, you're a 
bum. I think all of them have to be credited. But it's the people who won." 
</P>
<P>
 Kitty Dill and her husband Gordon, of Thousand Oaks, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's important to them to say their piece, fine," Dill said. "The reality 
is that . . . tomorrow and the next day we can come back when there are no more 
political speeches."

<P>
 Aside from its significance as a recreation area, the Palo Comado Canyon 
acquisition preserves a key part of the wildlife corridor that runs from Simi 
Valley to the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobcats, deer, mountain lions and dozens of other species live among the 
rolling hills and rocky outcroppings of the tract that abuts the National 
Recreation Area's 2,150-acre Cheeseboro Canyon Park.

<P>

 Kitty Dill and her husband, Gordon, residents of Thousand Oaks, agreed.

<P>
 "If it's important to them to say their piece, fine," Dill said. "The reality 
is that Gordon and I can stand here under this oak tree enjoying our iced tea 
knowing that tomorrow and the next day we can come back when there are no more 
political speeches."

BOMB IN TURKISH BAZAAR KILLS 2 TOURISTS; 15 PEOPLE INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bomb planted in a shoeshine box by suspected Kurdish separatists exploded in 
Istanbul's Covered Bazaar on Saturday, killing two tourists and injuring at 
least 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Security officials said at least eight foreign tourists were among the 
injured. Some of the 15 were in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anatolian news agency identified the dead as Munira Najan, 40, a Tunisian 
woman, and Javier Castro, a Spanish man. It said Najan's 17-year-old son, 
Mehdi, four Spaniards, two Frenchmen and a Lebanese man were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second bombing of the popular tourist site in 10 days. Four people 
were injured in a blast March 24 and three tourists were wounded when a bomb 
went off in the garden of St. Sophia, a 6th-Century Byzantine basilica, on 
March 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that no one had claimed responsibility for Saturday's explosion 
but that they suspected the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). 
</P>
<P>
 If that suspicion is borne out, the tourists would be the first foreign 
victims of the PKK's separatist war since it was launched in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 In Madrid, a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that a Spaniard was 
killed. The four injured Spaniards were believed to be out of danger, he said, 
quoting the Spanish consul. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the bomb had been planted in a shoeshine box in front of a 
jewelry shop and exploded at 10:30 a.m., shattering windows and smashing 
furniture in nearby shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw myself out of my shop after the blast and saw two people lying on the 
ground. The legs of one of the victims appeared severed. I thought both were 
dead," a young assistant at a carpet shop told Reuters TV reporter Kemal 
Gokakin. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they had seen an unfamiliar boy for several minutes before the 
blast standing in front of the shop next to the shoeshine box. 
</P>
<P>
 Yildirim Aktuna, state minister and government spokesman, visited the site and 
condemned the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a cowardly, sneaky attack," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Aktuna said additional measures would be taken to safeguard tourist 
attractions and crowded sites. With more than 4,000 shops, the 15th-Century 
Covered Bazaar is one of Turkey's leading tourist attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with an Athens daily published Thursday, the PKK's political 
wing said the outlawed group would launch a warlike campaign against tourist 
targets in Turkey this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year's campaign against Turkish tourism was just a warning. The real 
campaign begins this year and it will be like war," Hassan Dag of the National 
Liberation Front of Kurdistan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attacks against tourist targets are part of our war action and it is 
logical that there will be human victims," he said. "What we want is to stop 
tourist money from entering Turkey. This money is used to massacre our people."

PARTY LAVISHES LONG-TERM POWERS ON ZHIRINOVSKY; RUSSIA: THE ULTRANATIONALIST 
APPEARS TO SHIFT ATTENTION TO GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZING. HE HAS HIS EYE ON THE 
PRESIDENCY IN 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky on Saturday gave his supporters a 
taste of how, if elected president, he would run Russia: all by himself, and 
for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 At a congress of his party, the misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party of 
Russia, Zhirinovsky asked for -- and received without a dissenting voice -- 
sweeping powers as chairman and a guaranteed term until the year 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 "The powerful ship of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has come into the 
open ocean," he declared. "We must give the navigator the chance to hold the 
wheel even more tightly, in order to steer the warship even more firmly and 
sail it into that victorious harbor known as one short word: president. " 
</P>
<P>
 It was Zhirinovsky's own charisma and limitless TV promises, not his amorphous 
Liberal Democrats, that brought his party's astounding success in Russian 
parliamentary elections in December, winning it about 23% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Saturday's congress, Zhirinovsky appeared to be shifting some of his 
attention to getting a real grass-roots organization under way -- the kind of 
structure he needs for his intended run for president. Elections are scheduled 
for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The final goal is to make the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia the ruling 
party . . . to form a one-party government and occupy the supreme post of 
Russia -- the presidency!" he said to a roaring hall of backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without emergency aid our country will not survive," he continued, comparing 
himself to the one doctor who can cure Russia's ills. "A patient dies when the 
doctors consult too long in the next room. If we allow the surgeon to start 
operating on the patient, he must lead the operation to its end and the patient 
is back on his feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old lawyer, seen as a political clown until his December election 
success, exulted openly in the anxiety his mass support and extremist 
nationalist views have aroused in Russia and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world has been in shock for three months. They're going crazy -- all the 
governments, diplomats and intelligence services," he said. "Billions of 
dollars are being spent to fight the only political force on the planet -- the 
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 The platform passed around at the congress provided more fodder for anxiety. 
Zhirinovsky's party proposes that Russia's borders be expanded to those of the 
former Soviet Union and sees Serbia and Iraq as among Russia's main strategic 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the party congress in a giant hotel in southern Moscow were an 
official representative of the Iraqi government as well as French and German 
rightists and a large contingent of Serbs. Hanging above the gathering was the 
congress' slogan: "LDPR on the Road to Power." A central banner depicted a 
falcon, Zhirinovsky's favorite symbol, over a map of Russia expanded to include 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 With loud applause, the 343 delegates from various Russian regions approved 
Zhirinovsky's proposal that he rule the party for 10 years. As chairman, 
Zhirinovsky also appoints the party's entire leadership and has the power to 
remove anyone he chooses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the December elections, several top members have defected from the 
Liberal Democratic Party, saying they could not stomach Zhirinovsky's rude 
behavior and his extreme positions, particularly his outrageous stands on 
foreign affairs. Zhirinovsky's argument that he needs the right to appoint all 
leaders so that he can control them indicates that he has had trouble keeping 
his party subordinates in line. 
</P>
<P>
 The party has also had financial problems, according to defectors, but 
Zhirinovsky has not admitted to them. He claimed Saturday that the party had 
just paid off its election debt, which he put at the unlikely figure of only 
250 million rubles -- about $140,000. Another dubious fact Zhirinovsky shared 
with his adoring audience was that Western agents had offered him $100 million 
to leave politics. He also hinted that Japan had offered him $1 billion for the 
disputed Kuril Islands if he comes to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "In good Russian, I told them where to get off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky said that his party is not fascist and that he will reoccupy the 
old Russian empire without war. Someday soon, he said, Russian children will 
once again sing "My Native Country Is Wide." He then broke into his own 
rendition of the Soviet-era favorite.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II's youngest son, Prince Edward, will marry his girlfriend, 
Sophie Rhys-Jones, in a low-key ceremony this summer, the Sunday Express 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper quoted palace sources as saying preparations were well advanced 
for a wedding in late July or early August. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a low-key wedding and will take place before the first leaves 
fall," the Sunday Express quoted an unnamed peer with close connections to the 
Royal Family as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the couple were reported on their way to Windsor Castle, west of 
London, where the Queen and family traditionally spend several weeks at Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward, 30, is the Queen's only unmarried child. The other three -- heir 
Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Andrew -- have had troubled marriages.

ARMY SERGEANT APOLOGIZES TO BEHEADED BUDDY'S FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. Army sergeant who killed his wife's lover, kicked off his head and 
brought it to her as she lay in the hospital apologized Saturday to the 
victim's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Stephen Schap was convicted Friday of premeditated murder, which carries 
a life sentence.But on Saturday the jury recommended he be granted leniency and 
be given a lesser sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Schap choked back tears as he spoke for the first time to the court that 
convicted him. "I'm sorry I'm the man responsible," the 26-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schap was convicted of killing Spec. Gregory Glover, 21, one of his buddies at 
Sickels Army Air Field in Fulda, last Dec. 7 after learning that his wife was 
pregnant with Glover's baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Capt. Jennifer Beakes asked the jury to consider the feelings of 
the victim's mother, Irene Glover of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a mother sends a child off to the Army, she knows he may come back in a 
body bag,"' Beakes said. "She does not expect her child to come back 
slaughtered in two pieces, at the hands of a fellow soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 Schap apologized to Irene Glover, telling her, "I know what it means" to be 
without a loved one.

SERB ASSAULT ON ENCLAVE SAID TO ADVANCE; BOSNIA: THE TARGET IS THE MUSLIM 
POCKET OF GORAZDE. THE RED CROSS DECIDES TO EVACUATE POTENTIAL VICTIMS OF 
'ETHNIC CLEANSING' IN THE NORTH.

<P>
 Bosnian Serb forces appeared to be making progress Saturday in a concerted 
five-day assault to seize the U.N.-protected Muslim enclave of Gorazde, U.N. 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In northern Bosnia, Red Cross officials decided to evacuate Muslim and 
Croatian civilians from the town of Prijedor to save them from an alleged 
Serbian campaign of terror. 
</P>
<P>
 The "last-resort" decision followed reports that Serbian militants in the town 
had targeted Muslims and Croats in a campaign of killings, beatings and arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo radio, reporting on the Gorazde fighting, said, "All suburbs are 
coming under fierce artillery fire and dozens of houses have been razed to the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs are certainly trying to finish off Gorazde with what seems to be a 
big-scale offensive," one U.N. source said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people in our staff who made an assessment that Gorazde could well 
fall because it's a very shallow area. There is one main road and if it is 
taken it is the end of the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), Maj. Rob Annink, said 
fighting in Gorazde on Friday had killed four people and wounded 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said a column of Serbian tanks, armored cars and trucks was seen moving 
eastward from Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale late on Friday, apparently 
headed for the Gorazde front. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how the United Nations could tolerate the Serbs seizing an area that it 
had declared a protected zone, he said: "The members of the Security Council 
should object to these happenings in Gorazde. UNPROFOR cannot do anything at 
this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. sources said the U.N. force was powerless to deter a Serbian advance 
until after the planned deployment of 800 Ukrainian peacekeeping troops in 
Gorazde later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 As an illustration of continuing tensions even in areas where cease-fires have 
been negotiated, Annink said the Muslim-led government army had suspended all 
steps to normalize the situation in the divided southern city of Mostar after a 
Croatian sniper seriously wounded a Muslim official. 
</P>
<P>
 He said international monitors in the city, whose Muslim quarter was pounded 
by besieging Croats for months, met commanders of both sides to impress on them 
the gravity of such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic endorsed the International Committee of 
the Red Cross' plan to evacuate non-Serbs from Prijedor, saying lives came 
first even if this helped "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I am concerned, if these people are in danger we have to take them 
out. We should not try to protect ourselves. We must know that lives come 
first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and Red Cross officials said they accepted claims by the Muslim 
organization Merhamet that Bosnian Serbs had killed 17 Muslims and two Croats 
in or near Prijedor in the past few days.

LAWLESSNESS AGAIN RAMPANT IN SOMALIA; AFRICA: REMAINING U.N. PEACEKEEPERS ARE 
ILL-PREPARED. LOOTING IS WIDESPREAD.

 Less than a week after U.S. soldiers left, the gates of Mogadishu's port were 
knocked to the ground, thefts multiplied and Somalis began smuggling weapons 
past Egyptian sentries. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining U.N. troops have less training, less discipline, poorer 
equipment and greater problems in fulfilling a less ambitious U.N. mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief groups have abandoned outlying cities, claiming that U.N. troops cannot 
or will not protect them. The U.N. World Food Program complained to the 
commander about difficulties in arranging escorts for food convoys. A U.S. aid 
worker was kidnaped Thursday in sight of a U.N. checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Looters descended on the airport even before U.S. Marines lifted off in their 
helicopters. The seaport has been overrun by Somalis who breeze past Egyptian 
sentries with counterfeit passes, weapons and booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Datuk Aboo Samah, the U.N. commander, has 19,000 soldiers, most of 
them from Third World countries. He said they are fulfilling the new mandate to 
protect the humanitarian effort and secure the port, airport and U.N. 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have been killed or wounded trying to protect aid workers. Still, 
confidence in their ability to provide that protection is ebbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am firmly convinced the only security we are going to get is from Somalis 
who work here," said Ed Johns, the tall, lanky Texan appointed by the United 
Nations to run the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said looters had managed to carry items as large as washing machines and 
generators past Egyptian military guards. 
</P>
<P>
 With the gates knocked down, port workers now block the opening at night with 
a cargo container. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military officers acknowledge problems, some caused by language or 
cultural barriers. Pakistani troops, for example, have refused to escort some 
food convoys on Fridays, the Muslim sabbath. 
</P>
<P>
 Somalis, stressing Muslim brotherhood with the Egyptians, routinely talk their 
way past sentries at the port, Johns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboo, the commander, said that the rules of engagement have changed slightly, 
with emphasis on using minimum force. 
</P>
<P>
 To illustrate, he said U.N. troops no longer will engage "technicals" -- 
pickup trucks with weapons mounted in the back -- unless directly threatened. 
Previously, technicals were engaged on sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where guns are already returning to the streets, some people fear 
the technicals will become a common threat again.

PRESIDENT OF GUATEMALAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of Guatemala's Constitutional Court was shot and killed Friday 
night outside his home in Guatemala City as he returned with his family from a 
Holy Week celebration, a court spokeswoman said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility for the shooting by unidentified gunmen who were 
believed to have opened fire from a vehicle about 10:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Epaminondas Gonzalez, 61, was shot in front of his wife and 8-year-old son as 
they returned from a celebration in Antigua, a town 25 miles from Guatemala 
City, Constitutional Court spokeswoman Claudia Arriaza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was rushed to a hospital, where he died 30 minutes later, Arriaza 
said. His wife and son were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a prominent Guatemalan lawyer, had been president of the five-member 
Constitutional Court, the country's highest legal body, which rules on the 
constitutionality of laws approved by Congress. His one-year term as president 
of the court was due to end April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez gained national respect last May when he ruled that former President 
Jorge Serrano's attempt to seize near-dictatorial powers was unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision was a decisive blow to Serrano's bid for one-man rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say the killing of Gonzalez further undermines the fragile 
administration of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, which has lurched from one 
political crisis to another since he assumed office in June.

CLINTON, GOP PUT OWN SPIN ON MARKET SLUMP; STOCKS: PRESIDENT SEES CORRECTION; 
CRITICS SEE MISTAKES. BUT ANALYSTS SAY POLITICS MOVES FASTER THAN THE ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While White House officials insist that last week's stock market swoon was 
little more than a case of temporary indigestion, critics of the Clinton 
Administration are already blaming the slump on the President's economic 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his economic advisers are trying to calm market jitters by 
characterizing falling stock and bond prices as normal "corrective" moves in an 
otherwise healthy economy. Administration officials want to prevent last week's 
retrenchment from becoming a rout when the markets open for trading on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration critics were quick to predict more problems. In the 
official Republican response to President Clinton's weekly radio address on 
Saturday, Rep. Robert S. Walker (R-Pa.) said the 9% decline in the Dow Jones 
industrial average since January is a signal that "taxes, deficits and 
regulatory drag are beginning to have an adverse economic impact" on the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans warned months ago that the combination of tax increases, new 
government spending and regulatory overload would lead to economic slowdown," 
said Walker, who called on Clinton to join the GOP in backing "a broad-based 
middle-class tax cut aimed at helping families with children." 
</P>
<P>
 The back-and-forth analyses suggest that the Washington Establishment will not 
wait for the dust to settle on Wall Street before it tries to estimate the 
political gains and losses from the market's travails. 
</P>
<P>
 While economists generally attribute declining stock and bond prices to 
expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will keep raising interest rates in 
response to accelerating economic growth, a protracted market slump could 
undermine support for the President's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Brookings Institution economist Barry T. Bosworth said the political 
hay-making is "inevitable but unfortunate" as the Fed's efforts to keep 
inflation in check by raising interest rates cause investors to demand higher 
returns from bonds and stocks. The markets satisfy expectations by bidding down 
prices, which increases yields. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Presidents have very little to do with the short-term economy," Bosworth 
said. "These are things that have a lot more a life of their own. It's always 
been surprising how much Americans identify day-to-day economic events with the 
President. There's an awful lot of evidence that voters vote for presidents on 
the basis of last year's economic conditions. It's a little absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey released Saturday suggests that, so far, Americans are not sure what 
to make of the recent market turmoil. A Newsweek magazine poll, conducted by 
Princeton Survey Research Associates on Thursday and Friday, showed that 37% of 
those surveyed said they still believe that the economy is improving, while 26% 
said it is getting worse. About 34% saw little change. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that 47% of respondents said they believe the recent 
declines in stock prices represent a serious or somewhat serious problem for 
the nation, while 38% do not consider them a serious problem at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Several economists said that all the political jostling for the hearts, minds 
and pocketbooks of middle-class voters obscures a crucial fact: With few 
clearly superior investment alternatives available in sight, most investors are 
unlikely to abandon the market altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think smaller investors, who tend to be in mutual funds as part of 
their retirement packages, are going to pull out any time soon," said analyst 
Michael Barker. "The general level of financial literacy among ordinary people 
is very high now. People understand if you're a stock market investor there are 
ups and downs. They know there are corrections. They know, too, that with 
interest rates where they are, they can't do better anywhere else." At the same 
time, some economists warned there is no assurance that the slide has ended. 
With the likelihood of more signs of economic strength -- personal income 
statistics to be released Monday are expected to show a healthy increase -- 
anxiety about Fed interest rate hikes could increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher interest rates tend to reduce inflationary pressures by increasing the 
cost of borrowing and slowing the rate of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the markets settle down, there probably will be no corresponding 
decline in Washington's penchant for seeking political advantage in the 
economy's ups and downs. In recent months, for instance, the Administration has 
been quick to claim credit for signs of an improving economy, such as rising 
employment and increasing consumer confidence. Republicans, in turn, have 
called attention to contrary indicators to bolster their argument that the 
Administration is on the wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his rebuttal to Clinton's radio address -- which did not mention the 
financial markets -- Walker said the Administration's reliance on higher taxes 
to help reduce the federal budget deficit will diminish the savings and 
investments of middle-class Americans and put one out of five American jobs at 
risk. Republicans have called for bigger federal spending cuts in lieu of tax 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "By January of this year, the stock market began to drop, interest rates 
started to climb, factory orders fell, the trade deficit widened, and inflation 
at the wholesale level increased," Walker said. "At almost exactly the same 
time that the Clinton economic plan took effect, the interest rates on 30-year 
Treasury bonds started up." 
</P>
<P>
 While the economy continues to show "underlying strength," Walker said, "much 
of that strength is leftover muscle from 12 years of economic growth" under 
Republican administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker called Walker's charge "a contentless remark" that belies Washington's 
negligible short-term impact on the stock market. "The Republicans have to pray 
the economy slows down" before the 1996 presidential election, he said. "In the 
meantime, they're just looking for little, sharp things they can stick in 
Clinton's back as he races by."

RAZORBACKS COME THROUGH FOR UNRESTRAINED NO. 1 FAN; BASKETBALL: CLINTON FAMILY 
STOPS OFF ON WAY HOME FROM CALIFORNIA, CHEERS ARKANSAS SQUAD TO AN NCAA 
SEMIFINALS VICTORY OVER ARIZONA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Arkansas Razorbacks had one particularly powerful fan on their side as 
they beat the Arizona Wildcats, 91-82, in the NCAA basketball semifinals 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, along with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and their 
daughter, Chelsea, stopped off on their way home from a vacation in Southern 
California to watch the game and cheer on the Arkansas squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they stayed out of view in skyboxes, the President, a longtime fan of 
the Razorbacks, made no attempts to appear to be an unbiased spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very worried," he told reporters afterward. "It was a hard game. I'm 
glad we don't have to replay it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton shook hands all around in the skybox after the game, but did not go 
down to the floor and headed quickly to the presidential motorcade. His return 
to Washington later in the evening wrapped up the family's nine-day vacation, 
but the President is off again Monday on a five-day, six-state tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the game, when Arkansas pushed ahead, 18-15, the First Fan, sitting 
in a skybox owned by Charlotte Hornets' owner George Shinn, sprang to life -- 
clapping, pumping his fist and pointing out certain players. 
</P>
<P>
 But shortly before halftime, after the Wildcats had scored eight unanswered 
points, the President looked like a very worried fan. Moments later, Arizona 
tied the game at 41. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, as Arkansas gained the upper hand and then widened its 
lead, the President -- dressed in a business suit, white shirt and tie -- 
leaped to his feet, jumped up and down with his hands in the air and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the game with the First Family were Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles; 
retired Boston Celtic John Havlicek; Barlow Herget, an old friend of the 
President's from North Carolina; Harvey Gantt, onetime Democratic challenger of 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.); and Hugh McColl, chief executive officer of 
NationsBank, which is headquartered in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a President attend the tournament added to the pandemonium of hosting 
the Final Four contest for Charlotte. For example, crowds of spectators had to 
pass through metal detectors to enter Charlotte Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is believed to be the only President to attend a basketball game while 
in office, and the record he has set will be hard to beat. Saturday's game was 
the third he attended this season, and he plans to return to Charlotte on 
Monday night to see the Razorbacks play in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 That trip will come after the traditional Monday morning Easter egg roll on 
the White House lawn. The Clintons also will open the major league baseball 
season in two different cities -- the President throwing out the first ball in 
Cleveland while the First Lady does the honor for the Chicago Cubs' first game 
of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the week, however, is devoted to an Administration-wide blitz to 
regain momentum for Clinton's health care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's schedule will include town meetings and health care events in 
North Carolina, Missouri, Kansas and Minnesota. He also plans to travel to 
Kentucky for the funeral of Democratic Rep. William H. Natcher. 
</P>
<P>
 While previous presidents have honored athletes with White House receptions 
and telephone calls, Americans have never seen a President who was so 
unabashedly crazy about a particular team. 
</P>
<P>
 Before heading to Coronado last weekend for a vacation with his family after 
attending his brother's wedding, Clinton squeezed in time for the NCAA Midwest 
regional final game in Dallas, where the Razorbacks triumphed over the Michigan 
Wolverines, 76-68. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was so wrapped up in that game that lip-reading television 
viewers caught him clearly cursing when the Razorbacks seemed to be losing 
their lead right before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps feeling the need to maintain his presidential composure -- and not 
offend Michigan voters too much -- Clinton restrained himself from joining in 
Arkansas' traditional "Whoooo! Pig! Sooey!" cheer during that game. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently such restraint is not Clinton's norm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be calm and quiet, you shouldn't watch a game with me," he 
told Sports Illustrated magazine last month. "I call the Hog. I change the 
defenses. I talk to all the players. I do all kinds of stuff. But it's a great 
tension-reliever." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton jogs and plays golf regularly, his enthusiasm for basketball 
is that of a spectator and fan, not a participant. He does, however, do his 
share of armchair dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fabulous game, isn't it?" Clinton told the magazine. "It makes me wish 
I were two inches taller and 20 pounds lighter. With a four-foot vertical jump, 
I could be doing something else."

WILHELM PREDICTS WHITEWATER WILL FADE BY SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic National Chairman David Wilhelm predicted Saturday that President 
Clinton's Whitewater troubles will subside by midsummer and will not be a major 
issue in November's congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Whitewater will recede . . . because the President and the First Lady 
are cooperating with the special counsel," Wilhelm said on CNN's "Evans & 
Novak" show."They're answering the questions that are being raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm, who managed Clinton's presidential campaign two years ago, said 
Republicans are using the Whitewater affair as "part of a political strategy 
designed to promote gridlock, to slow the President down." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that news accounts detailing the Clintons' investments in the 
1980s when Clinton was attorney general and governor of Arkansas were not 
"helpful" in advancing the President's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilhelm said public interest in the Whitewater controversy will wane once 
congressional hearings are held on the Clintons' partnership with the owner of 
a failed Arkansas savings and loan in the land development project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons claimed they lost money on the Whitewater deal. Federal 
regulators and a special counsel are investigating whether federally insured 
deposits from the failed Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan may have been used to 
cover Whitewater losses and debts from Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a Republican Party that is obsessed with Whitewater and doesn't seem 
to have a clue about what should be done to move the country forward," Wilhelm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think by midsummer, by the time the fall elections come around, the 
amount of attention will be lessened and the real attention will be focused on 
issues like health care reform, welfare reform and economic growth," he said.

INFANT GETS HEART MONTH AFTER CANCELLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-week-old boy received a new heart Saturday, a month after officials 
canceled his first transplant operation because the organ donor had died of 
sudden infant death syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Brown was listed in serious but stable condition after the surgery at 
St. Christopher's Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby had been readied for a transplant on March 3. But the surgery fell 
through because the New Jersey medical examiner's office, reversing an earlier 
decision, refused to release the organs of the intended donor, 3-month-old Ryan 
Anthony Pacelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other critically ill babies also were prepared to receive organs from 
Ryan. Their surgeries also were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical examiner's office said it would not release Ryan's organs because 
doctors still do not know what causes SIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the other two infants later received a lung transplant and is 
recovering, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Organ and Tissue Sharing Network 
said.

$1-MILLION SETTLEMENT DUE IN DEATH OF SIX RETARDED PERSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city government of Washington has agreed to settle a wrongful-death 
lawsuit brought by the families of six residents of an institution for the 
mentally retarded, according to attorneys representing both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement agreement, to be made public Monday, the city, which 
admits to no wrongdoing, will pay the families a total of $1.075 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators said the deaths, which are the subject of an article in 
today's Los Angeles Times Magazine, constituted the worst example of 
institutional abuse and neglect in recent U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's civil rights division had charged that at least nine 
residents of the now-closed institution, called Forest Haven, died between 1989 
and 1990 as a result of substandard medical care after they contracted 
aspiration pneumonia, which is caused by feeding people while they are lying 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 The families of six of those residents later brought the civil suit against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement came after a senior city medical officer testified in a sworn 
deposition that the medical record of one of the residents who died was missing 
critical pages and appeared to be altered. It also followed the disclosure that 
the city's own investigators had concluded that one of the institution's 
doctors had provided substandard medical care to some of the residents who had 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Davidson, a partner with Steptoe & Johnson, which represented the 
plaintiffs on a pro bono basis in their D.C. Superior Court suit, said the 
agreement also requires the city to meet with the six families to discuss how 
to improve medical services in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials declined further comment until public announcement of the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Haven closed in March, 1991, after a long battle with the Justice 
Department, which first alleged in 1978 that the city's treatment of the 
institution's residents was inhumane.

GUNMAN SOUGHT TO HIGHLIGHT UPRISING, TRANSCRIPT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The confessed assassin of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio 
said he wanted to call attention to the Indian uprising in southern Mexico, 
according to a transcript of his interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Aburto Martinez also told interrogators that he was covering up for 
others and that he belonged to a political group with thousands of members.He 
did not, however, identify those he was protecting or affiliated with. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of a conspiracy in the March 23 assassination have been plentiful in 
Mexico, although Mexican investigators say they have no evidence of a wide 
conspiracy. A man hired to help provide security at the rally is also being 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto spoke during an interrogation by Mexican federal investigators soon 
after Colosio was gunned down. A copy of the 33-page transcript of Aburto's 
interrogation was obtained by the San Diego Union-Tribune and published Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto has admitted shooting Colosio, the Aug. 21 election favorite. In the 
transcript, he said he only intended to slightly wound him and then use the 
resulting attention to air his views. "But when I raised my weapon, somebody 
bumped me or shoved me," Aburto, 23, was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his motive was to focus attention on the Chiapas uprising.

SCULPTURE MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN FOR JUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Art, like junk, is often in the eyes of the beholder. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what worries sculptor William Wareham, whose 800-pound 
sculpture made of junk metal has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-foot-tall piece, "Salmon Run," was built from crushed water heaters and 
a ship's ladder. It was placed on a steel pedestal outside the offices of 
Norcal Waste Systems, but disappeared three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wareham fears that garbage collectors may have carted it off for the city's 
extensive scrap metal recycling program. "It may have been cut up by now," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norcal workers didn't tell police the statue was missing right away because 
they mistakenly thought it had been taken away to be cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Wareham offered a $1,000 reward for the artwork's return in good 
condition. It has been valued at $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory is that the statue might have been stolen by an art collector 
or rival sculptor. Six bolts had to be removed to get it off its pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 Police aren't so sure it was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thing is 9 feet tall and weighs about 800 pounds, so how did the thief 
lift it off the pedestal?" Police Inspector Joe Curtin said.

FUNERAL RULING IN FUMES CASE SOUGHT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riverside County will go to court to make sure the body of Gloria Ramirez, who 
died as hospital emergency room staff passed out around her, remains in a 
sealed container until burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's family wrote to the county challenging a public health officer's 
order that it not have an open-casket funeral, county spokesman Tom DeSantis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 DeSantis said Friday that the sealed container is necessary for safety 
reasons, and the county will go to court next week to try to get a ruling that 
"would reinforce the public health officer's decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's family has refused to accept the body under the terms of a 
conditional release signed by the county coroner's office that would bar 
removal of the body from a sealed casket. 
</P>
<P>
 The family says Ramirez was not the source of the still-unidentified fumes 
that affected six people -- nurses, doctors and technicians -- Feb. 19. One 
doctor was hospitalized for three weeks with breathing trouble.

HOW MANY JOBS TO MAKE ENDS MEET? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on flextime eroding the eight-hour work day (A Shake-Up- in Labor 
Law," March 28) was very interesting, but your focus was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Your concern was that people on 40-hour or less work weeks won't be paid 
overtime. My concern is with full-time jobs at much lower wages than they had 
earned. With the erosion of the eight-hour day, these people can easily find 
themselves working two part-time jobs of 12 hours a day each at today's reduced 
wages just to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Shades of worker exploitation. Talk about advancing rapidly backwards.

AS DISASTERS GO, COUNTY'S 2 VOLCANOES ARE DUDS; GEOLOGY: ONE HASN'T BEEN ACTIVE 
IN 16 MILLION YEARS. THE OTHER IS JUST A SMOKY HOLE IN THE GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After drought, floods, wildfires and a devastating earthquake, what's next for 
Ventura County? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, did you know about the county's two volcanoes? 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't much as volcanoes go -- one is dead and the other is really just a 
smoky hole in the ground -- but these days, you can't be too careful. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents may not realize it, but a chunk of mountain near the Conejo 
Grade, where thousands of cars and trucks whiz by daily on the Ventura Freeway, 
is the site of a volcano that once disgorged lava with alarming frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 And if motorists continue north, they will cruise past what many call the 
"Rincon Volcano." 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled on a steep hillside north of the Ventura Freeway between the bananas 
at La Conchita and the surfers at Rincon Point, the "volcano" sometimes 
startles drivers -- and prompts a call to the local fire station -- when it 
emits smoke and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that the Conejo volcano hasn't made a peep in at least 16 million 
years. Or that volcanologists dismiss Rincon's infamous fire well as a sorry 
excuse for a volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of January's earthquake, officials have been asked to update plans on 
how they would respond to a variety of natural disasters. A report by county 
geologist Jim Fisher does not specifically mention volcanic hazards, but some 
residents prefer to err on the side of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all we need, a volcano erupting," Aaron Foster, 20, of Agoura Hills 
said as he peeled off a damp wet suit after a morning of surfing at Rincon 
Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "But as long as it doesn't blow when I'm surfing, I guess it's OK by me." 
</P>
<P>
 The mouth of the Conejo volcano is under the master-planned community of 
Camarillo Springs at the northern base of the Conejo Grade. The surrounding 
area, all the way to Thousand Oaks, sits over a former lava-spewing system 
called the Conejo Volcanics, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's absolutely no danger of volcanic eruption, geologists agree. The 
Conejo volcano has been dormant since the Miocene epoch, a geologic period 
beginning about 24 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not likely to erupt again because the geologic conditions have 
changed dramatically since then, Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in pretty good shape," he said. "We've got a lot of geologic hazards to 
worry about, but I would put that one pretty low on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Of more immediate concern to public safety officials is the so-called Rincon 
Volcano -- which isn't really a volcano. The formation is actually something 
geologists call a solfatara, or thermal vent, a place where sulfurous gases 
escape from a crack in the Earth's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon occurs in Ventura County at a rocky outcropping several hundred 
feet above the Ventura Freeway between La Conchita and Rincon Point because 
conditions are just right, geologists say. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is composed of shale and is fed by underground reservoirs of oil, 
said Luke Hall, a geology teacher at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 For some reason -- perhaps a spark caused by rocks shifting in the ground -- 
the fissure spontaneously ignites and begins burning off the oil, Hall said. 
When air invades the chamber and the rocks are very hot, the burning starts to 
accelerate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What most people see are steamy gases creeping from the side of the mountain, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On foggy days, the steam looks like smoke, Ventura County Fire Chief George 
Lund said. That sometimes prompts drivers to pull over and report a fire, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a continual nuisance for us," Lund said. "Our Rincon station gets calls 
on it a couple of times a year, and we always have to check it out just to make 
sure it's not a real fire." 
</P>
<P>
 People calling tend to get excited by what they see, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see smoke, and smoke is fire to most people." 
</P>
<P>
 The first recorded report of the "steaming mountain" was made in 1835 by a man 
traveling north by stagecoach to La Purisima Mission in Lompoc, said David 
Griggs, curator of the Carpinteria Valley Museum of History. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, several sightings of vent activity have been made. But it is 
impossible to predict when the Rincon Volcano, now quiet, will again begin to 
smoke, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to subside when air is cut off," he said. "Someone told me it was 
smoking a lot in the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobette Bates McKay, whose family owns the 400-acre ranch where the vent is, 
said locals dubbed the formation the Rincon Volcano because it sometimes spewed 
fire along with gases. 
</P>
<P>
 As children, she and her brothers and sisters did a lot of exploring on the 
ranch and they just took the volcano for granted, said McKay, 74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never went down to the mouth of it, but my younger brother did," McKay 
said. "I probably didn't want to get my clothes torn." 
</P>
<P>
 The vent sometimes flared up at night, creating a spectacular natural Bunsen 
burner. But invariably it only lasted a day or two before dying down, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was seldom that we saw it," McKay said. "It was fun for a day or two, but 
that was about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said there are similar rock formations near Grimes Canyon Road south of 
Fillmore. But people don't see them because they are buried in old mines, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo volcano, on the other hand, is visible to anyone who drives over 
the Conejo Pass. But most people don't realize that they're looking at the main 
vent from magma upwellings that formed the Conejo Volcanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't aware of it," said Martha Beckman, who sells houses in the Camarillo 
Springs development that sits right on top of the neck of the volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it doesn't surprise me. Nothing surprises me any more after all the 
disasters we've had." 
</P>
<P>
 The volcano was probably most active about 16 million years ago when it was 
covered by the ocean, Hall said. Tectonic activity since then has caused the 
volcanic chain to be uplifted and tilted on its side, forming the western end 
of the Santa Monica Mountains, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That movement effectively capped the volcano, and it is not likely it will 
again erupt, Fisher said. At least not during our lifetimes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tensions that create volcanoes are no longer there." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Camarillo, remnants of the volcanic ridge cover a wide swath of 
the eastern county, including all of Newbury Park and parts of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents seemed to take news of the volcano in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 Bert Vanacker of Newbury Park said he didn't learn about the volcano until 
after he bought his home a decade ago. The retired water and power worker said 
he doesn't give it much thought, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an item I would ask about if I was going to buy a house," he said. 
"A volcano? I think you just have to take your chances and, if something 
happens, you just do the best you can." Ventura County's Volcanoes 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has two "volcanoes." The Rincon Volcano is actually a 
geiser-like geologic formation that spews vapors from a steep hillside above 
Highway 101 near Rincon Point. The Conejo Volcanics in the eastern county is a 
dormant volcanic ridge that last erupted hot molten magma about 16 million 
years ago.

MORE FUN THAN SUN ON HOLIDAY OUTINGS; EASTER: THOUSANDS FLOCK TO THE BEACHES 
AND COUNTY CAMPGROUNDS DESPITE COASTAL FOG AND INLAND CHILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A blanket of thick, gray fog along the coast Saturday made for a chilly, 
sometimes drizzly day but couldn't stop thousands of holiday weekend 
vacationers from crowding parks and beaches across Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasters predict continuing clouds for the coastal regions today, 
but the fog should burn off in the inland valleys to reveal blue skies for 
Easter. Temperatures are expected to be in the low- to mid-60s on the coast and 
in the mid-70s inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend revelers participated in a cadre of pre-Easter activities Saturday, 
from mountain biking and fishing at Point Mugu State Park to picnicking in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents Laura and Bryan Gentry bundled themselves in warm 
clothes before stationing their fishing pole in the sand at Thornhill Broome 
Beach near Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was warmer it would be nice, but it doesn't matter," Laura Gentry said. 
"It's just nice to get away from the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Using frozen chicken as bait, Bryan Gentry said he wasn't expecting to catch 
his Easter dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying real hard. It's just something to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although campsites were packed at state and national campgrounds in the 
county, afternoon beach-goers were hard to find.  
</P>
<P>
 "If this was nice and sunny, it would be full," state parks Ranger Simon 
Cavazos said while gazing at the nearly empty beach. "It's going to be a little 
mellower day for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers said the lack of sunshine at the beaches had a calming effect on a 
holiday that can be marred by traffic accidents and ocean rescues. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the temperature increases (and) the number of people increase, so does the 
number of incidents that we have to be prepared for," Cavazos said. "I've been 
here for 14 years and I've seen it all." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, Cavazos has had to peel adventurous rock climbers off cliffs 
and watch lifeguards drag children out of the sea, but this weekend was shaping 
up as a quiet one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And quiet was exactly what some vacationers were seeking Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are off riding their bikes, I'm relaxing -- they're doing what they 
love and I'm doing what I love," said Kathy Setka, holding up a thick hardback 
novel while reclining in a folding chair at her campsite near Sycamore Cove 
Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "We could have used some sun," she said. "The bathing suits are definitely not 
going to get used." 
</P>
<P>
 Setka said her group of 10 campers, all from San Pedro, made reservations 
eight weeks ago for their campsite under a sprawling sycamore tree near the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacationers plan to roast a leg of lamb and hunt for Easter eggs in the 
newly grown brush by their camp to celebrate Easter today. Portions of Sycamore 
Canyon were burned during the fires last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Carrillo, Sycamore Cove and Thornhill Broome beaches, three popular county 
vacation spots, were all booked solid for the weekend, as were McGrath and Emma 
Wood beaches to the north, park rangers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the way from Refugio to McGrath, everything's full," said park operator 
Daniel Wills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura County residents bypassed the beach Saturday to seek blue skies 
and warmer temperatures inland. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park residents Chris and Carla Hoglund picked up their two daughters 
from an overnight camping trip at Leo Carrillo and decided to escape the cool 
fog for an inland picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we'd try out here," Chris Hoglund said, gesturing at a vast green 
field at Wildflower Playfield in Thousand Oaks. "We just wanted to be together 
as a family today." 
</P>
<P>
 At Lake Casitas near Ojai, 400 of the 450 available campsites were full 
Saturday, and the recreational area is expected to be packed solid today, 
rangers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easter Sunday is our biggest single day of the year," Ranger Brent Doan said. 
"People come to hide their eggs, barbecue. . . . It's a great day to kick off 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, at the the annual Cottontail Canyon Day at Arroyo Verde Park, 
children seemed unfazed by the chilly weather. The event drew about 8,000 
people, who participated in an egg hunt and various games for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 But many children, like Ventura resident Alice Bailey's 4-year-old daughter, 
Rebecca, couldn't get past the petting zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been here since 11 a.m.," a weary Bailey said at 3 p.m. "And they've 
been nibbling on her all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca's pink tights had bite-size holes where the baby goats had been 
chomping at her legs. But that didn't stop her from scooping up the crying 
goats in her arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one loves varmints," her mother said with a chuckle.

AIRPORT CAFE TAKES OFF VERY QUICKLY; CAMARILLO: NEW EATERY HAS ESTABLISHED 
ITSELF AS SOCIAL HUB. PILOTS AND AVIATION ENTHUSIASTS ENJOY FOOD AND 
CAMARADERIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tucked on the edge of the Camarillo Airport is a new refuge for pilots and 
flying enthusiasts -- a place to gather for chats about airplanes of all kinds 
and the passion for flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Way-Point Cafe has been open only a few weeks. But, already, it has 
established itself as a social hub at the dusty Camarillo airstrip that once 
was an Air Force base. 
</P>
<P>
 Named after a pilot's navigational aid, the Way-Point is the kind of place 
that serves basic hot food -- fast and with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the no-nonsense American-style fare, owners Kathy and Mike Mills 
say they have been taken aback by the near instant popularity of the little 
cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we were the only restaurant on the airport but we had no idea that 
folks would take to us so quickly," Mike Mills said. "Frankly, we've been 
happily overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Open from early morning to midafternoon every day, the restaurant has become 
the place at the airport where pilots hang out, slurp hot, fresh coffee, eat 
fresh-baked pies and muffins and recount their most glorified experiences in 
the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said they chose early on not to decorate the place -- instead 
urging pilots, friends and others to bring in their glossy, framed photos of 
airplanes to line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after closing time -- 3 p.m. -- and long after the restaurant's 
short-order grill has grown cold, Mike Mills says that he keeps the coffee pot 
on and the front doors unlocked in case stragglers need a late afternoon 
pick-me-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to create a gathering place," said Mike Mills, a private pilot. 
"Nobody will ever get kicked off a table here. If they want to sit and drink 
coffee all day, that's fine with us. We want it to be our customers' place." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Kathy Mills, both 47 and residents of La Crescenta, said they became 
restaurant owners because of hunger and happenstance. 
</P>
<P>
 "One weekend Mike and I were out flying and we decided to land at Camarillo 
and get some lunch," Kathy Mills said. "When we got down, we radioed the tower 
and they directed us to some vending machines. I guess that's when you could 
say the light bulbs in our heads blinked on." 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe opened its doors early last month as the first restaurant at the 
airport since the closure of a Mexican restaurant in the same spot five years 
ago, according to Nona Makinson, the airport's operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first heard (they) were interested, we all got very excited," 
Makinson said. "It's a great little place." 
</P>
<P>
 Since securing a five-year lease from the county last September, the couple 
have nearly doubled the size of the restaurant -- expanding it to accommodate 
about 70 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has large picture windows facing the runway, and plans call for 
the completion later this spring of an outdoor patio for those patrons wishing 
to eat their meals even closer to the flight line. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Barber, wing leader of the Confederate Air Force's Southern California 
chapter which operates out of Camarillo Airport, said the cafe was exactly what 
the facility needed. The Confederate Air Force is a nonprofit organization that 
preserves and flies World War II-era aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been my experience that airport cafes take on a life of their own and 
this one seems headed in that direction," Barber said. "They kind of become a 
social core for the place -- when you're not flying or working on your bird, a 
place like that is where many pilots will typically hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Bill Melly, a 71-year-old Camarillo pilot, says the restaurant is 
important because it gives local pilots a comfortable place to talk about 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that flying is not a terribly forgiving activity. You 
have to be able to do it right the first time and all times," Melly said. "A 
place like Mike and Kathy's gives us the chance to discuss safety, procedures, 
weather. . .it gives us a place where we can exchange views." 
</P>
<P>
 The eatery also attracts customers who are not pilots, such as Everett 
Ellerman of Camarillo. Nearly every Saturday, the 56-year-old investment 
executive and his wife, Julie, station themselves at the breakfast counter and 
soak up the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feel you get is like one of those Charles Kuralt Sunday Morning segments. 
You know the kind where Kuralt is just shooting the breeze with someone at a 
roadside diner in the middle of nowhere," Ellerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the Way-Point, instead of the patrons getting out of trucks and 
automobiles, here they get out of Pipers, Cessnas and Lears." 
</P>
<P>
 For Julie Ellerman, 52, the Way-Point has become a home away from home. Her 
rhyming poetry is prominently on display next to the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not pilots, but yet from the first day we stepped into the place we 
were comfortable," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This a place that's new that wants to be old. It has a great feel to it." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ed Beakley, 47, a retired naval pilot and a Camarillo resident, the 
restaurant with its aviation accouterments is a place where he makes regular 
stops during his workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're an airplane person like I am, you'll love this place," said 
Beakley, who is now a civilian flight-test scientist. "It's got a great 
atmosphere and real good food." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the new cafe off the ground has been a struggle for the couple, but it 
has been eased by the encouragement of the pilots and office workers who have 
become customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up on the roof working on a screen and before I knew, one of our 
customers was up there volunteering some help," Mike Mills said. "You don't 
find that kind of friendliness just everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that has helped has been Kathy Mills' experience in the restaurant 
business -- she says her family has run a small eatery and newsstand at Union 
Station in Los Angeles for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our food is pretty basic, but we make a lot of it ourselves," Kathy Mills 
said. "I think people like it when they find a place that gives a home-cooked 
feel."

JOB IN THE FAST LANE; FIREFIGHTERS, AMBULANCE FIRM BATTLE OVER SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Paramedic Brian Williams saw the cluster of firefighters and teachers around a 
prone figure behind Ventura High and steered the ambulance up over the 
sidewalk, past a crowd of curious teen-agers just getting out of their first 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 As Williams knelt next to the fallen boy, a firefighter updated him on the 
patient's vital signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old was experiencing some dizziness after collapsing outside the 
school, but otherwise was fine. Eight minutes after the school called 911, the 
youth was on his way to Community Memorial Hospital, needing only basic 
treatment and transport. 
</P>
<P>
 The regularity of this type of scene -- about 65% of all the 911 calls that 
Pruner ambulances respond to require little or no medical aid -- is one of the 
reasons Ventura firefighters want to replace Pruner Health Services, the 
private ambulance company that serves the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters say the city of Ventura would get faster and improved care if 
paramedic service is included in their duties. Since they are usually first on 
the scene, they say, why not provide all the necessary medical services? 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters' union also criticizes Pruner for hiring young and relatively 
inexperienced paramedics. In Ventura, their average age is 25. 
</P>
<P>
 In the union's scenario, the ambulance would arrive at Ventura High along with 
the fire engine, a firefighter-paramedic would care for the boy, and Pruner 
would not make a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Murphy, Pruner's chief administrative officer, disputes the union 
contention that Pruner's response time averages eight minutes. Murphy said an 
in-house review of 1993 dispatch records showed an average response time of 5.6 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A mention of the age issue produces an exasperated sigh from Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, this is a young person's job," he said. "I just don't think you're 
going to find a lot of people in their 40s who are going to want to get out of 
bed three or four times in the middle of the night. It takes a lot of energy 
and a lot of sheer physical strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner Health Services was launched in 1963 by Don and Jackie Pruner after Don 
Pruner bought an old ambulance on a whim. He parked it in his Thousand Oaks 
driveway and the business grew gradually, with the couple its only employees. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the only service they provided was transportation to the 
hospital. In 1975, they branched out into paramedic services. Now they have 55 
paramedics working within Ventura County and 19 emergency medical technicians. 
Thirteen ambulances operate throughout the county during the day and 12 operate 
at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner provides ambulance service for Ventura, Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley, 
Moorpark, Camarillo, Fillmore and Santa Paula. Ambulance service for Ojai, Port 
Hueneme and Oxnard is run by other private companies. Pruner also extends some 
limited service into Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brian Williams sees it, the system runs smoothly, and the last thing he 
wants is to lose a job he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his partner, Rob Nowaczyk, a paramedic-school graduate awaiting county 
certification, work 24-hour shifts out of Pruner's central Ventura station on 
Loma Vista Road. Their office -- the busiest of the three in Ventura -- is an 
unmarked building next to a church. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, a police scanner is always on, announcing trouble as it arises. A 
phone hooks Williams and Nowaczyk into Pruner's dispatch system in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their emergency calls are with Fire Station 3 on Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Williams and Nowaczyk work the same schedule as the firefighters -- 10 
24-hour shifts a month -- they know most of them quite well. Despite the power 
struggle between their bosses in City Council chambers, a trip to the fire 
station to partake in an enchilada dinner is still a common occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 27, has been with Pruner for seven years. During his senior year in 
high school he took an emergency medical-training class and liked it. After 
brief stints in construction and television repair, he finished his EMT 
training and started at Pruner. 
</P>
<P>
 All applicants to paramedic school, which lasts about a year for full-time 
students, are required to have at least six months' experience as EMTs. 
Williams had about 18 months' experience when he entered Walter S. Graf/Daniel 
Freeman paramedic school in Inglewood, where many Los Angeles city firefighters 
receive their paramedic training. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowaczyk, 23, also a graduate of the Inglewood program, had a more romantic 
introduction to the field. He remembers driving around as a child with his 
mother, a nurse who often stopped at traffic accidents to offer her help. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time it was pretty critical," he said. "I remember the ambulance pulling 
up, and the door opened up, and this big, tall paramedic came out. And I 
thought, that's it, I'm going to be like him. When I turned 18, that's what I 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowaczyk worked as an EMT in Malibu for a 1 1/2 years before school, then did 
his required internship with the Fire Department in South Central Los Angeles. 
He has been certified in Los Angeles County, but has a few more steps to get 
certified in Ventura County. Until then, Williams performs the advanced 
life-support procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Williams and Nowaczyk say they wanted to work in Ventura for the variety 
of medical calls they get. Although many calls are routine -- such as 
transporting patients from one hospital to another -- traffic accidents, 
shootings and other crime injuries provide excitement and keep the adrenaline 
moving. 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound gruesome, but the more life-threatening the call, the more the 
paramedics say they learn. On the other hand, neither would be eager to endure 
the constant stress of being a paramedic in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Days are usually more active than nights. Between regular calls, the pair 
sandwich in medical seminars and equipment checks, with occasional breaks for 
reading or watching television. They start their shifts at 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday morning, it was after 9 o'clock before the first call 
came, for the boy at Ventura High. A second call came just as the paramedics 
were returning to the station, this time for a toddler whose mother was worried 
that the child had fallen and hit her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Babies are the only patients that really rattle the paramedics, Williams said, 
mostly because the infants can't tell them what's wrong or what hurts. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived at her home, the paramedics found the 20-month-old child 
alert and crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as they're crying, it's OK," Williams said. "It's when they aren't 
making any noise that I worry. That good healthy cry is a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The child turned out to be fine, and Williams thought she might not even have 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe she slept on (her neck) funny or something," he said, making a note on 
the paperwork -- filed in quadruplicate -- that he fills out on every patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the toddler was brought to Community Memorial, accompanied by anxious 
parents. The paramedics said they probably would not have called 911 themselves 
if the girl were their daughter. They would have just taken her to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if they want an ambulance ride, then they get one," Williams said. 
"Whether they can pay or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, they can't. Forty percent of patients in the city of Ventura don't 
have insurance and pay nothing, said Murphy, Pruner's chief administrative 
officer. Countywide, about 26% can't pay for the service. Patients without 
insurance generally end up at the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Fire Department thinks Pruner makes money on every call," Williams said. 
"That's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors regulates Pruner's fees within Ventura County. For 
the most basic runs, where no advanced life-support equipment or medication is 
used, prices range from $250 to $400. For a run using advanced life-support -- 
where medications are administered and heart monitors are used -- costs range 
from $500 to $800. But for patients on Medi-Cal, Pruner makes about $62. 
</P>
<P>
 Transporting patients is the best source of revenue for Pruner. With a base 
rate of $240 and a charge of $10.67 per mile, costs rise quickly. An occasional 
trip to the medical center at USC, for instance, will make up for the uninsured 
patients Pruner loses money on. 
</P>
<P>
 The most complicated call of the day was for a 76-year-old man who had been 
vomiting blood. Getting to his home in a retirement community on the eastern 
edge of Ventura took about seven minutes. By the time paramedics arrived, 
firefighters had taken two sets of heart and blood pressure rates. The man was 
on his back, blood splattered around his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipping on rubber gloves, Williams began the regular drill of questions: Are 
you allergic to any medications? Does this hurt? Can you take a deep breath for 
me? 
</P>
<P>
 Attaching patches to the patient's torso and chest, Williams hooked him to a 
portable heart monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, he found a vein in the man's arm and began an intravenous saline drip. 
Once in the ambulance, Williams continued to check the man's blood pressure and 
called to advise emergency room nurses on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "His lungs are clear, heart is fine," Williams told the nurse. "He's 
maintaining a blood pressure of 104 over 62. I've established a normal saline 
IV. Our ETA is four to five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes later, the man is wheeled into the emergency room at Community 
Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "That the upper G-I bleed?" a nurse asked. "Bring him over here." 
</P>
<P>
 On the next run to Community Memorial, the paramedics will ask about the man's 
condition, but their responsibility to this patient ends with the completion of 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nights, nothing happens. Hours at the station are spent eating, drinking 
coffee, chatting on the pay phone, keeping up on new procedures -- paramedics 
have to pass a recertification test every two years -- and watching endless 
hours of television. On those nights, it helps to enjoy the company of your 
partner, which Nowaczyk and Williams say they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the station drinking a weak pot of coffee made by Nowaczyk, they 
talked about the controversy. It's insulting to be accused of inexperience, 
they said, when the firefighters haven't had the level of training they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be like me going up to the doctor and telling him he doesn't know 
how to do his job," Williams said. "I'm not going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men say it isn't surprising that firefighters arrive first on the 
scene of most 911 calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got three stations; they've got five," Williams said. "Of course 
they'll beat us there sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Nowaczyk say they get to the scene with or before the 
firefighters about 35% of the time. Citing the Fire Department's preliminary 
proposal to buy just three ambulances, they said they do not see how response 
times would change. 
</P>
<P>
 The men also see their youth as an advantage. Being a paramedic requires not 
just energy but strength. Each paramedic has to be able to lift a patient 
alone, regardless of the patient's weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the paramedic chief from Los Angeles came up here and said he 
thought Pruner did the best job that a private ambulance company could do," 
Nowaczyk said. "I find that insulting because I trained with his department. 
How am I different from his paramedics?" 
</P>
<P>
 When socializing with the firefighters, the controversy does come up. But they 
say discussions remain friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's pretty professional," Nowaczyk said. "We'll talk about it, but 
our fieldwork is not being hampered one bit." 
</P>
<P>
 What the whole thing comes down to, Williams said, is money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't knock the firefighters for what they're trying to do. They're just 
trying to put more money in their pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Pruner paramedics and county firefighters receive similar salaries, starting 
at about $30,000 for Pruner paramedics and $32,000 for firefighters. Overtime 
wages usually drive yearly incomes up considerably for both. 
</P>
<P>
 If firefighters did take over paramedic service, both said they would probably 
lose their jobs. Neither wants to be firefighters, and they said it's very 
unlikely they would be hired by the Fire Department anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I've ever done is EMS since I was 18," Nowaczyk said. "What would I do?"

 NEW BREED OF CADET; ACADEMY GIVES CITIZENS A TASTE OF POLICE WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About two dozen Thousand Oaks residents are nearing the end of their police 
training in the first-ever Sheriff's Citizen Academy, a hands-on program the 
department hopes will broaden community support for its deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 These average folks will have no special powers after 12 weeks of training. 
During training, the residents fire guns in practice ranges and ride shotgun in 
patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But sheriff's officials hope the investment of time and money -- about $1,600 
split by the city and the Sheriff's Department -- will persuade the citizen 
cadets to phone in tips, set up Neighborhood Watch programs and improve the 
department's public image. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten weeks into the program, the public-relations plan seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 After riding along with a patrol deputy and blasting rubber bullets from an 
anti-riot weapon, Jayne Berlin said she has changed her mind about cops. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old teacher said she once thought, "They're just out to give you a 
ticket and that's their job, but I don't feel that way any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now when I get a ticket, I'll accept it gracefully," she added. "Cops are 
really here to help you." 
</P>
<P>
 The citizen cadets range from an actor-screenwriter studying police 
personality types to the former boyfriend of kidnap-murder victim Kellie 
O'Sullivan. The first Citizen Academy class was dedicated to her memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin White said he learned "just how professional these guys are" during the 
12-day search for O'Sullivan's body last September. 
</P>
<P>
 White was one of the first to sign up when the academy was announced and now 
says he hopes that what he learns will have "a trickle-down effect." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already talked to at least 10 or 20 other people and told them all about 
it," White said. "It's been very educational." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cadets hope their lessons at the Citizen Academy will help them get into 
the Sheriff's Academy to earn deputy badges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it'd help me get my foot in the door," said Tyson Santos, 30. "It's 
really opened my eyes to what the sheriff's (deputies) have to go though, all 
this training." 
</P>
<P>
 One week the cadets listened to Superior Court Judge Bruce Campbell lecture on 
how the court system works. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later they took guns in hand and tested their wits against a video 
crime simulator that showed life-threatening scenarios and made them decide 
whether to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week we heard about their dogs," said Betty Horner, a 59-year-old 
housewife and wife of former Thousand Oaks Councilman Lawrence Horner. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when it was in the paper (Wednesday), we knew exactly what went down," 
she said, referring to a fleeing drug suspect who was collared in Thousand Oaks 
by a police dog. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the cadets watched officers of the SWAT team, hostage 
negotiating team and bomb squad explain tactics and tools of their trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Donning the 22 1/2-pound flak vest that SWAT team members count on to save 
their lives, Lt. Geoff Dean explained that deputies must take weapons and 
physical training and pass a psychological exam to join the elite squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things they ask you is, 'If you're in a life-threatening 
situation, could you take somebody else's life?' " Dean said. "When a (SWAT) 
sniper shoots someone with a Remington 700 that fires a .308 round, he's going 
to die, and it's a tough decision for someone to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want someone who's going to turn into a vegetable after doing it," 
Dean said. "We want someone who psychologically is going to be able to deal 
with that and move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Dean let several cadets fire .37-millimeter shells packed with rubber 
bullets that are meant to break up an unruly crowd without serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Coached to pull the gun-stock tight to her shoulder and fire low at a nearby 
wall, Jayne Berlin squeezed the trigger, unleashing a spray of sparks and a 
shower of pellets that bounced harmlessly back at her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bruce Hansen described the psychological tools used by the hostage 
negotiating team he belongs to, and the difference in philosophies between it 
and the SWAT team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The SWAT team, they have the feeling they'd like to get the situation 
resolved as quickly as possible," Hansen said. "The hostage team, we believe we 
should take as much time as we need. We try to develop a rapport with the 
hostage-taker, address his concerns and get him calmed down enough so he'll let 
the hostages go and surrender." 
</P>
<P>
 One cadet asked what should someone do if held hostage? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a really good question," Hansen said. "If it's a carjacking, give them 
your wallet and your keys and walk away. If you're a hostage when someone takes 
over a bank or something, do what you're told. When you're spoken to, look the 
individual in the eye. Try to make that human contact." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in rumbled Andros, the sheriff's 750-pound, bomb-handling robot. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Andros was bought, a bomb technician had to put on 95 pounds of armor 
and pick up suspected bombs by hand, Senior Deputy Paul Higgason said. Now, the 
technician can handle the bomb from a distance, commanding the robot by radio, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Devlin Murphy -- allowed to accompany his mother to this one 
class -- crept closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The department bought the robot last year, Higgason said, after his squad 
handled a powerful bomb at Newbury Park High School that could have been 
triggered remotely. 
</P>
<P>
 "There actually would be very few situations in which we'd have to go back to 
the suit," Higgason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he gingerly lifted a soda can with Andros' aluminum claw, and just as 
gingerly crushed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Devlin peppered Higgason with questions, touching the robot and 
admitting with wide blue eyes, "It's pretty cool." 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Shoshana Murphy, lamented the small size of the class, wondering 
how much good only four academy classes a year will do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, 'Why only 25 people?' " said Murphy, 39, who plans to apply to the 
Sheriff's Academy this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kids should be required to do 10 to 15 hours working as volunteers in the 
Police Department," which might do more to spread the department's message to 
the public at large, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The end goal, said Hansen, the academy coordinator, is to help the students 
understand police work and hope that the information filters out to the general 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people we really need to educate are people who don't always see 
the police in a positive light," he said. "All we can do is extend the 
invitation and hope they take us up on applying to the academy."

COMPANY'S BALLOT PLAN ON LANDFILL NOT ENOUGH; WELDON CANYON: AUTHORITIES SAY 
SAN DIEGO COUNTY FIRM WOULD STILL NEED STATE, REGIONAL AND LOCAL APPROVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Editor's note: Due to a production error in the Saturday edition, this story 
is being rerun in its entirety.  
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego County firm that hopes to bypass Ventura County supervisors by 
seeking a ballot initiative on a dump at Weldon Canyon would still need state, 
regional and some local approvals, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic Resources of San Diego County is negotiating to take over a lease to 
Weldon Canyon from Waste Management Inc., which withdrew its proposal to build 
the dump last summer because Ventura County supervisors would not support the 
project. If it gets the lease, Taconic says it plans to seek a countywide 
initiative on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to that prospect among Ventura County officials was mixed Friday. 
While some speculated that Taconic could mount a successful petition campaign, 
others questioned whether a ballot measure could pass and expressed doubt that 
any such vote would be legal or binding. "I think the perception is that east 
county voters want a landfill in Weldon Canyon," said Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk, whose district extends from Thousand Oaks to Port Hueneme. "My 
opinion is that people realize there are a lot of alternatives to landfills, 
that you can't keep putting trash in a hole in the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose western county district includes Ojai, agreed 
that the county does not need another landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have the legality of this thing looked at," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Taconic is successful in negotiating with Waste Management and Weldon 
Canyon property owners, the development firm says it plans to seek a countywide 
ballot question on whether a landfill should be allowed in Weldon. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic, which specializes in solid and liquid waste projects, would then have 
to produce about 18,000 signatures on a petition by June 8 to get a measure on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If that measure were successful, permits would still be needed from the 
Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, California Regional Water 
Quality Control Board, California Integrated Waste Management Board and the 
local enforcement agency, which in Ventura County is the county's Environmental 
Health Division, said Kay Martin, manager of the Ventura County Solid Waste 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, I don't see why people should be afraid to get the voice 
of the people," she said. "There are sufficient state requirements to see that 
environmental considerations are taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 But others, including Ojai City Councilwoman Nina Shelley, object to taking a 
land-use decision to voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a fair way to decide whether there should be a landfill at Weldon," 
said Shelley, who fought the previous proposal by Waste Management. "The 
proposal has impacts on only one part of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "Residents, biased as they are in the east and middle county," 
would be voting on the measure. "We only have 1.5% of the voting public in 
Ojai." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley said she also fears that such a ballot measure would divide the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said the larger issue is that voters at large are not equipped to 
decide the merits of such a complicated, technical project as a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "They do not have access to all of the information we do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taconic representatives said the impending defeat of the Waste Management 
landfill proposal by the Board of Supervisors would have been based on 
politics, and not information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would only bypass the county supervisors and Planning Commission," said 
Richard Chase, general partner of Taconic Resources. "We would still have to 
obtain other state, local and regional permits. But at least those permits are 
based, at least largely, on the technical merits of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes the firm can win the necessary votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are substantial groups in portions of the county that would be in favor 
of Weldon: Oxnard because it has the existing dump, and the people in the east 
would like the west county trash to stay out of the east county." 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic has entered a similar lease agreement with Waste Management to take 
over development of a landfill in northern San Diego County. Servcon-San Marcos 
Inc., a corporation in which Taconic has an interest, is the developer at 
Gregory Canyon there. 
</P>
<P>
 Taconic is also seeking a ballot initiative in San Marcos, where petitioners 
are gathering signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 If allowed, Taconic would develop a Weldon Canyon landfill, but would not 
build or operate it. Those options would be sold or leased to a third party, 
Chase said.

<P>
 A traffic accident early Saturday morning in Thousand Oaks left an Agoura 
woman seriously injured, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Dawn Sandy, 23, was driving south on the Ventura Freeway near 
Hampshire Road shortly after 4 a.m. when she veered, struck the center divider. 
Her vehicle overturned several times, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 She suffered major head injuries and was taken to Westlake Hospital, where she 
underwent surgery, a nursing supervisor said. Sandy was listed in stable 
condition in the intensive care unit Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy's passenger, Carrie Mcauliffe, 26, of Oxnard, suffered minor injuries 
and refused medical treatment, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP briefly closed a portion of the southbound Ventura Freeway at 
Hampshire Road after the accident. TRACY WILSON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COMPUTER PARTS DESTROYED IN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A computer-repair business in Simi Valley suffered about $110,000 damage in a 
two-alarm fire that swept through a large industrial building, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire at Independent Technology, 310 E. Easy St., was reported just after 
11 p.m. Thursday and was extinguished by firefighters about 30 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze caused an estimated $10,000 worth of damage to the 
15,000-square-foot warehouse and destroyed $100,000 worth of computer parts, 
County Fire Investigator Peter Cronk said. 
</P>
<P>
 A cause has not been determined, but Cronk said it started inside a stockroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Keith Mashburn said fire crews had a tough time locating the fire 
because the smoke inside the warehouse was so dense. To vent the building, 
firefighters cut holes in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Prinkey, the company's operations director, said the fire and smoke 
damage is covered by insurance. JULIE FIELDS

SIMI OFFICIAL KEEPS A MISHMASH OF PROGRAMS IN ORDER; GOVERNMENT: DIANE 
DAVIS-CROMPTON HAS WON PRAISE AND RESPECT AS HEAD OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES 
DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Question: What do garbage dumps, crossing guards and cable TV have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Diane Davis-Crompton. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of Simi Valley's Environmental Services Department, Crompton runs a 
mishmash of programs ranging from waste management and city planning to 
neighborhood councils and services for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis-Crompton takes an overall approach to her work, making sure that the 
department as a whole is operating smoothly while leaving the details to five 
highly specialized division heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very eclectic mix, so it's always a challenge to make sure that all 
the parts are working properly," Davis-Crompton said. "Things are always 
changing, which keeps the job interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Davis-Crompton runs such a wide-ranging department is a 
testament to her ability as an administrator, City Manager Lin Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, she started with the city 14 years ago with a very small 
department and just grew with the responsibilities," Koester said. "She has 
been able to take on difficult assignments and accomplish them in a very 
excellent manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis-Crompton came to work for Simi Valley as the city's human resources 
director in 1980, just as Koester was launching a major overhaul of the city's 
departments. As his revisions progressed, Davis-Crompton's workload grew. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, she became community services director, gradually taking on 
neighborhood councils, senior and youth services, the crossing guard program 
and the city's bus system. She soon added waste management, animal regulation 
and cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all recognized Diane as this incredible resource who was willing to tackle 
all the really messy, sticky issues," Mayor Greg Stratton said. "The standing 
joke was if nobody else wanted to do it, you just gave it to Diane." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis-Crompton said her background as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ecuador in 
the 1960s helped her handle the wide range of responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in the Peace Corps, you have to face and overcome all kinds of 
adversity," Davis-Crompton said. "At a hospital I worked at in the Andes, when 
we ran out of medicine, we got by on a mixture of herbs from the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The most adverse addition to Davis-Crompton's workload came in 1989, when she 
was named director of the newly formed Environmental Services Department. She 
got an $8.5-million budget, 120 employees and all her former tasks -- plus the 
city's planning division, which was inefficient and plagued by delays and a 
lack of credibility with the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 With no formal planning background and a mandate to whip the division into 
shape, Davis-Crompton hit a wave of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Planners are very independent people, so Diane's biggest challenge was to 
convince them that there are things like schedules and deadlines and process," 
Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she's a small woman with a big presence, Davis-Crompton's firm but 
friendly management style prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a certain amount of screaming and kicking and gnashing of teeth," 
Stratton said. "But the upshot was she did a great job and got things turned 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf Ascher, a deputy planning director, witnessed the transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dramatic effect of her leadership is that this department has gained 
a tremendous amount of credibility," Ascher said. "She makes you account for 
everything and doesn't allow any of the deputies to shoot from the hip." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis-Crompton said she is most proud of the department's improved 
accessibility to residents. Employees are expected to be cooperative and 
friendly, following through on inquiries with easy-to-understand answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her direction, workers designed a chart detailing the path of a project 
from its conception to completion, taking some of the mystery out of the 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 Other department accomplishments under Davis-Crompton's tutelage include 
launching the city's recycling program and constructing the Senior Center and 
the Heywood Gardens apartment complex for low-income senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our whole purpose is to open up government and make it more user-friendly -- 
sharing as opposed to hoarding information," Davis-Crompton said. "We've come a 
long way in doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis-Crompton has also come a long way in gaining the respect of her peers. 
It is not uncommon for her to provide guidance and advice to council members 
and city staffers, who refer to her simply as "DDC." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, however, those initials will be changing -- Davis-Crompton is engaged to 
Dennis Merritt Jones, a minister at Simi Valley Church of Religious Science. 
After the wedding, scheduled for late April, Davis-Crompton will change her 
name to Diane Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis-Crompton spends much of her free time volunteering at the church and 
doting on her 1-year-old grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has passions for downhill skiing and flying -- last year she flew 
solo for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always loved to fly and it was just a matter of time before I learned 
how to do it myself," Davis-Crompton said. "It was really a thrill the day I 
got out of the cockpit and wasn't soaking wet from sweat." Profile of Diane

CHRISTIAN CLUBS ON THE RISE AT AREA HIGH SCHOOLS; RELIGION: IN THE VALLEY 
ALONE, ABOUT A DOZEN OF THE 17 DISTRICT SECONDARY CAMPUSES HAVE SUCH GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It's Monday lunchtime again in Room 206 at El Camino Real High School in 
Woodland Hills, and the two dozen students who have gathered there talk and 
laugh as they pull out their sandwiches, potato chips, juice packs -- and 
Bibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the chatter subsides, the rustling of sacks and wrappers is stilled and a 
young male voice, cracking with the changes of adolescence but sounding assured 
nonetheless, begins: 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us come before You with a righteous heart, Father God," the teen-ager 
says solemnly, his head bowed. "I pray that You will strengthen us. . . . Help 
us do well in school, God, and help us be a light to other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "Amens" from the others seal the prayer. The weekly meeting of the Chi Alpha 
club -- Greek letters that stand for Christ First -- goes into full swing with 
a reading from the New Testament and teaching by the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes are becoming increasingly common at public high schools throughout 
Los Angeles and the nation as religious students exercise rights recently 
granted them by the U.S. Supreme Court. In a near-unanimous decision in June, 
1990, the justices ruled that secondary schools must allow religious clubs on 
campus if other non-academic student organizations are permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Christian clubs have begun cropping up at high schools throughout 
the sprawling Los Angeles Unified School District. More than half the 
district's 49 high schools have groups that attract from five to 50 students at 
meetings held before class, during lunch or after school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley alone, about a dozen of the 17 Los Angeles district 
high schools have such groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise of campus Christian clubs coincides with an increase in churchgoing 
by teen-agers. According to a recently released Gallup youth poll, half of the 
nation's youths attended church weekly in 1993, up from 45% the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Some civil libertarians decry the campus organizations, saying they blur the 
line between church and state. But advocates of such associations, not least 
the students themselves, defend them as a legitimate gathering of youths with a 
mutual interest, akin to a chess or ski club. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a place for people who have a common belief in Christianity to come 
together and anybody who's curious about Christianity to come," said Daniel 
Chapman, a 17-year-old junior who leads El Camino's Chi Alpha group and often 
conducts the weekly Bible study. "It's a good resource." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way of witnessing to people . . . of fellowshipping with people at my 
school," added Deanna Turner, 17, who founded a Christian club at Sylmar High 
School in December. Her group, like most in the Valley, plans to devote itself 
to Scripture, prayer and mutual encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say the establishment of Christian clubs at high 
schools has sparked surprisingly little controversy so far. But because of the 
constitutional eggshells underfoot when it comes to religion on a public school 
campus, the system's legal office has issued strict guidelines on the proper 
application of the Supreme Court decision and the 1984 Equal Access Act, which 
initially unlocked classroom doors to religious meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Friedman, an attorney for the Los Angeles school district, said the 
high court ruling, known as the Mergens decision, broadened the Equal Access 
Act to put religious student groups on virtually the same footing as other 
clubs. With that status comes the ability to tap materials and resources 
available to other sanctioned organizations, such as use of the school bulletin 
or campus public-address system to announce meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the court ruling, the clubs must be student-initiated and led and should 
have a school staff member monitor proceedings. The law covers groups of any 
faith or ideology, but the vast majority of high school religious clubs in Los 
Angeles that have taken advantage of the liberalized environment are Christian, 
Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that the law would spawn meetings of devil-worshiping, neo-Nazi or hate 
groups have not materialized, either in Los Angeles or other parts of the 
country, said Charles Haynes, co-chairman of a broad-based religious and 
educational coalition that developed equal-access guidelines for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not in all my travels found the parade of 'horribles' that people 
predicted -- that there would be all these Satan clubs or proselytizing all 
over the place," said Haynes, a visiting professional scholar at Vanderbilt 
University's Freedom Forum First Amendment Center in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, clubs have been formed by Muslims, Jews 
and Korean Christians. "The kids are all very, very serious about their 
religion and I put out the red carpet for the positive things they are thinking 
about," said Fairfax Principal Mike O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who could be against them leading their lives in a socially acceptable way?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, advocates contend that students across the nation are running into 
opposition in setting up such groups. In February, the conservative American 
Center for Law and Justice filed suit against school districts in New York and 
Virginia -- where the center is based -- on behalf of youths who alleged that 
they had been prevented from starting Bible clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The predominance of clubs with a Christian orientation is precisely what 
worries Carol Plotkin of the Pacific Southwest region of the American Jewish 
Congress. The congress, along with other civil-liberties groups, opposed the 
Equal Access Act and the Mergens decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we are philosophically against the creation of the clubs 
in the first place is that it puts minorities at a disadvantage, whatever the 
minority happens to be. We happen to be Jewish, and in a pluralist society it's 
hard to compete with the majority religion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not surprising that you don't see a Muslim club or a Buddhist club. We 
live in a majority Christian culture. And (in) the more fundamentalist 
organizations that are around, part of the religion is to spread the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Plotkin said her own son has had to turn away invitations from Christian 
friends to attend school Bible studies -- invitations that create a social 
pressure she believes teen-agers should not be subjected to. 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in the clubs deny that their goal is to aggressively 
proselytize in campus hallways and classrooms. Rather, they said, the groups 
offer an outlet for committed young people to integrate their faith with 
everyday life, much of which is spent at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice to get involved with Christians at your school so you don't 
live a church life and a school life," said Melisa Powell, 15, of El Camino. 
"You can be a Christian at school." 
</P>
<P>
 The clubs also offer support for students striving to live a Christian 
lifestyle in the midst of the temptations facing teen-agers today, such as 
drugs, sex and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see that students need and want this kind of encouragement and 
alternatives," said Elva Quintero, faculty adviser for the 20-member group at 
Roosevelt High School on Los Angeles' Eastside. "They have a sense that they 
don't need to follow what society is projecting on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard E. Miller, who advises the Christian club at Fremont High School in 
South-Central Los Angeles, said the 20 or so students who meet twice a week 
during lunch in his wood shop class "really love Jesus, don't like gangbanging 
and want to get away from that type of life." The Bible study sessions have 
taken on a bilingual flair, with many students praying and reading in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We as a group would show love to all people and show people how we live and 
how they're missing something," said Monroe High's Ray, who brings his Bible 
and a book of verses to school each day. Sometimes he gets needled as "Reverend 
Ray" by fellow members of the basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray and a few other Christian Club friends congregate at one of their homes 
every Tuesday at 6:45 a.m. to pray for the success of their weekly lunchtime 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake prompted Christian students at several schools to 
gather for mutual solace, said officials of Grace Community Church of Sun 
Valley, whose ministers often visit campus Bible clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They needed comfort, so we looked at the Psalms talking about the power and 
the love of God and at some of Jesus' teachings," Spencer DeBurgh, co-director 
of the church's youth ministry, said of one such gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 All meetings must be attended by each group's faculty adviser. However, Los 
Angeles school district guidelines -- and those put out by Haynes' coalition of 
religious and educational groups -- mandate that supervising teachers be 
impartial observers. Staff advisers should refrain from commenting or 
participating in any way "that would convey either support or disapproval of 
meeting subject matter," according to a school district memo. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a school staff person who should maintain a neutrality," attorney 
Friedman said, "whether it's religion, politics, or sex, drugs and rock 'n' 
roll."

STUDENTS PAINT A POSITIVE PORTRAIT; YOUTH: CLORFUL ENTRIES FOR FOURTH ANNUAL 
PACOIMA PRIDE ARTS PROJECT REFUTE NEGATIVE IMAGES OF THEIR COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 For most of their young lives, Pacoima schoolchildren have seen their 
community portrayed in stereotypes: streets teeming with violence, rampant drug 
activity, despair. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the nearly 2,000 children who depicted their community for 
the fourth annual Pacoima Pride arts project judged recently in Pacoima and 
Sherman Oaks, the stereotypes tell only part of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 In brilliant markers, watercolors and crayons, the children's artwork tells of 
a Pacoima replete with smiling suns, grassy hills and families holding hands. 
"I am proud of me and my family because we work so hard" is the message 
scrawled on one. "People in Pacoima live together and share things," says 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual contest is sponsored by TransWorld Bank, which opened its doors in 
Pacoima in 1941 and is now the only bank there. This year, organizers invited 
children from four Pacoima elementary schools to interpret the contest theme: 
family and community pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Five judges chose first- and second-place winners from each grade at Haddon 
Avenue Elementary School, Pacoima Elementary School, the Vaughn Next Century 
Learning Center and Mary Immaculate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Velasquez, a muralist and counselor for Community Youth Gang Services 
who helps judge the contest every year, said he was struck by the overwhelming 
number of positive images this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children know the stereotype of Pacoima," Velasquez said. "They also know the 
positive and the good. They just don't have the opportunity to express it very 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 The judges traveled to each of the schools, where rows of colorful drawings 
and paintings of houses, parks, neighborhoods and families hung in hallways or 
auditoriums. They narrowed the entries to about 100 and took them from the 
schools for final judging at TransWorld headquarters in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in a basement training room, organizers hung the winning art on walls, 
doors and chalkboards. Judges circled the room in silence, studying the artwork 
and taking notes as if appraising great masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn a lot from children," said Cecilia Aguilera, who is Mayor Richard 
Riordan's East Valley representative. "They tend to be positive and not 
disillusioned. They only see solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank will host an awards dinner for the winners and their families in 
mid-April at the bank's Pacoima branch, where the art will first be displayed. 
First-place winners will receive $100 savings bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the winners will travel by bus to Downtown Los Angeles, where their 
work will be presented to the City Council and displayed at the Children's 
Museum.

AT 75, MARATHONER RUNNING ON POSITIVE ENERGY; HOBBIES: SARAH LONDON TOOK UP 
JOGGING AT AGE 57. SHE STILL LOGS 40 MILES A WEEK AROUND CARSON AND ON THE BIKE 
PATH AT REDONDO BEACH.

<P>
 Sarah London passed by her toppled bookshelf for weeks on the way out of her 
mobile home for her daily run, but she didn't pick it up. The 75-year-old was 
afraid that cleaning up damage from the Northridge earthquake might injure her 
and ruin her intensive training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited until after the marathon," the Carson resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished the Los Angeles Marathon last month in six hours, 44 minutes and 
28 seconds, and it wasn't her first. Last year, London ran in the L. A. 
Marathon, as well as those in Honolulu and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After this year's marathon, she finally picked up the bookcase and her books 
and knickknacks. It was a good thing she waited, she said, because she strained 
her back slightly while setting things right. 
</P>
<P>
 London has covered a lot of ground in the past few years, but she came late to 
long-distance running. She played basketball and volleyball in high school, but 
didn't start running until she was 57. She and her husband got interested in 
the sport at the prompting of a neighbor and ran 5K and 10K races together. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband had a heart attack while running seven years ago, and he died four 
years ago. But London kept running. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, she joined a group called the Leggers, which trains together in Santa 
Monica. Her first marathon was in Long Beach in 1992. She finished the race in 
six hours, 31 minutes and 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tani Leung, 40, who credits London with getting her started running three 
years ago, said London told her that to stay alive, she has to stay positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Sarah goes out with a feeling that she's going to finish," Leung 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 London describes herself as the kind of person who skips the parts of the 
newspaper that have bad news. She likes the company of younger people because, 
she said, their conversation is more interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start talking to people my age, they start telling you about their 
ailments," London said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she runs because it makes her feel good. She gets restless if she doesn't 
run or walk first thing in the morning, and she enjoys the endorphins that keep 
her feeling good the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Leung left the Leggers and joined the closer Gardena Reebok Runners. 
Coach Dan Ashimine encourages London to keep putting in her miles, and she 
regularly logs 40 miles a week around Carson and on the bike path at Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashimine doesn't think that anyone's too old to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind that you can start exercising at any time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 London said she's not sure that she'll do any more marathons, but Leung is 
trying to persuade London to do the Bay to Breakers Run in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 While running this year's Los Angeles Marathon, London noticed that some 
people weren't doing too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a lot of young people along the way with their shoes off, bandaging 
their feet," London said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she finished, she was tired, but not exhausted. She said she tries not to 
think about the length of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of 26 miles -- that's a long ways to go. I'm looking toward 
seven miles. Then I start thinking of 14 miles. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 During the race, other runners often match her pace for a bit, resulting in a 
breathy chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of enjoy myself when a young fellow will say, 'You're doing good; how 
old are you?' " she said. "I enjoy that -- I'm not offended." 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't claim to have any great secrets of running. Before a race, she has 
coffee and a Power Bar for breakfast, then another Power Bar and water during 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rest of the time, London said she eats lots of pasta, fruits and 
vegetables, and avoids fatty and fried foods. But she has a taste for prime 
rib, and eats some sort of meat two or three times a week "to keep my strength 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 "My appetite is very good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Ohio native, London came to California with her husband more than 30 years 
ago. She has two daughters in Ohio, but plans to stay in Carson as long as she 
can take care of herself. That way she can keep running. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do here I can do year-round," London said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family is proud of her but doesn't really understand why she runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think it's too much. They can't conceive that anyone would do that but a 
crazy person. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interested, but they're not about to go out and do it," London said.

VOLUNTEERS RALLY SUPPORT TO REBUILD EATON CANYON; NATURE: SINCE THE OCTOBER 
FIRES DESTROYED THE PARK FACILITY, VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN WORKING TO RAISE THE 
FUNDS TO IMPROVE AND EXPAND THE STRUCTURE.

 Eaton Canyon Nature Center is the kind of place that gets lemons and makes 
lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
 After the October wildfires scorched the center's 184-acre wilderness park and 
burned down its building, park supporters spent little time lamenting the loss. 
And the center's director blissfully announced: "We'll have a fantastic fire 
ecology park." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, busloads of children and carloads of hikers have been watching how 
nature responds to a fire. And the county and park volunteers are in the 
process of not only rebuilding the structure, but adding and improving, perhaps 
with new wildlife exhibits or medicinal-plant gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 An upcoming public hearing will give people a chance to offer more ideas. It 
is set for 7 p.m. April 28 at the Los Angeles County Arboretum, 301 Baldwin 
Ave., Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the county will draw up preliminary building plans to determine 
how much funding will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency 
Services have agreed to cover the bulk of the rebuilding costs, which county 
officials estimate will amount to more than $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 That only covers the cost of building a center identical to the original. 
Volunteers who have long supported the park hope to raise hundreds of thousands 
of dollars to make the new center even better. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Eaton Canyon Nature Center structure, built in 1963, was a 
5,300-square-foot stucco building. It had a gift shop, library, 186-seat 
auditorium, and geology, plant and animal exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first of the public meetings on the new center was held, several 
suggestions surfaced. For instance, some want the new center to be made of more 
costly materials, possibly an adobe-like substance that is supposed to be 
sturdy and fireproof, and blend in well with the natural surroundings. Many 
supporters would also like energy-efficient heating and cooling systems to be 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion is that the old center's auditorium be replaced by a 
multipurpose room with a kitchen. That room could be rented for meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also proposed are bee and bat exhibits.

GETTING CLOSE UP AND PERSONAL WITH WHALES; WESTERN BAJA: CABRILLO MARINE 
AQUARIUM OFFERS EXPEDITIONS TO SAN IGNACIO LAGOON WHERE THE HUGE MAMMALS SEEK 
OUT CONTACT WITH HUMANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the warm, salty waters of a shallow lagoon on the western coast of Baja 
California, Vivian Richman's dream came true. She kissed a whale. 
</P>
<P>
 She leaned over the side of a small boat and planted a big kiss on the smooth, 
rubbery nose of a young Pacific gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
 And the strangest part was that the whale seemed to enjoy it too. In fact, it 
was at least partly the whale's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came right up to the boat and his head came straight out of the water and 
I leaned over and kissed it," said Richman, 55, a retired businesswoman from 
Malibu who was one of several dozen members of a whale-watching expedition 
sponsored by the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so large, but so gentle. It was just incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene of this close encounter between vastly disproportionate mammals -- 
at a little over 100 pounds, Richman is about one-fiftieth the size of the 
young whale she kissed -- was San Ignacio Lagoon, a narrow, 16-mile-long inlet 
that is virtually teeming with gray whales during the winter and early spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated about 600 miles southeast of Los Angeles on the desert shore of 
southern Baja California, San Ignacio Lagoon and other lagoons nearby are the 
mating and birthing grounds of thousands of Pacific gray whales who divide 
their time between Baja and their feeding grounds near Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few months of every year, the lagoon is so chock-full of 
whales that it's almost impossible to look at any particular patch of water for 
five minutes without seeing one, or three, or a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's just the knuckled dorsal curve of their bodies cutting through 
the surface; other times they "blow," spewing a flume of vapor out of their 
breathing holes, or breach (shooting out of the water and falling back with a 
tremendous splash), or perform a curious movement called "spy-hopping," in 
which the whale sticks its head vertically out of the water and eyeballs the 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, San Ignacio Lagoon has become the ultimate whale watcher's 
destination, not only because so many whales congregate there, but also because 
while in the lagoon the whales often display behavior that scientists say is 
probably unique in all the world: They actually seek out close physical contact 
with humans. 
</P>
<P>
 The young whales in particular swim right up to small boats, pop their heads 
out of the water, look around with eyes the size of baseballs and then, like 
dogs wanting to be petted, nuzzle up to the boats and the outstretched hands of 
the humans aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 They seem to enjoy the contact; with the mother keeping a watchful eye nearby, 
some of the young whales will frolic around the boats for half an hour or more. 
Sometimes the mother will even nudge her offspring toward the boats, as if 
eager for the young whale to get a look at the strange creatures inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The contact is always the whales' choice. The Mexican government regulates not 
only the number of boats allowed in the lagoons but the activities of the whale 
watchers as well. Boats are restricted to the outer third of the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chasing or harassing the whales in any way is prohibited, and would be 
counterproductive to whale watching anyway. As it is, the small whale-watching 
skiffs, called pangas , take off from shore or from larger boats and simply 
park themselves in the whales' general area. Then they wait to see if the 
whales will come to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the weather conditions are right -- no wind and flat water -- and the 
whales are in the mood, it's usually only a short wait before a whale and her 
calf will initiate the contact. 
</P>
<P>
 For Richman and the other members of the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium expedition, 
which sailed to the lagoon aboard the 110-foot fishing boat Royal Polaris out 
of San Diego, the encounters were awe-inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them saw gray whales up close and personal, from only a few feet away. 
Almost all actually touched some of the whales. And everyone described the 
experience as being, well, almost mystical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I touched a whale! With this hand right here, I touched it!" exclaimed 
Marydith Piepenbrink, 70, a San Pedro nurse. "I can die happy now. To see them 
so close is great, but to actually touch one is . . . well, it's hard to 
explain. It was just a wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was in church," Ewa Pauker of Topanga Canyon said of her 
whale-touching experience. "It's like nothing I've ever known before." 
</P>
<P>
 What the whales got out of it is anybody's guess. In fact, no one knows why 
the whales in the lagoon behave in the gentle, friendly way they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of theories, but nothing certain," said Larry Fukuhara, 
program director at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium and one of the organizers of 
the whale-watching trip. "There seems to be some connection there, between the 
whales and the humans, but we don't know what it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The behavior of the so-called "friendlies" is all the more astounding when 
measured against the savage, bloody history of mankind's interaction with the 
Pacific gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
 The gray whales leave the Arctic waters in the fall and head south along the 
coast at a swimming speed of 4 to 6 m.p.h. A few months and about 6,000 miles 
later, the whales reach the warm shallow lagoons where they are safe from 
storms and natural predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Males and females mate; those females will bear their young a year later. 
Already pregnant females give birth to 15- or 16-foot-long calves that grow 
rapidly on a diet of mother's milk, which is about 50% fat; the calves drink 
about 200 gallons of milk a day. By early March, the males leave the lagoons 
and head back north; by mid-April the mothers and their now-fat calves follow.  
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of years, Native Americans along the West Coast hunted gray 
whales as they passed by on their journeys to and from the Baja lagoons. Since 
gray whales seldom swim out of sight of land, they were an accessible source of 
food, if not necessarily an easy one. Weighing as much as 45 tons, they were 
dangerous prey for aboriginal hunters.  
</P>
<P>
 Native Americans, given their limited numbers and means, didn't make much of a 
dent in the gray whale population. In the mid-1850s, however, a whaling captain 
named Charles Scammon discovered the largest of the gray whales' birthing 
lagoons on the Baja coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Scammon would write that in the lagoon, now known as Scammon's Lagoon, 
the whales were "huddled so thickly that it was difficult for a boat to cross 
the water without coming into contact with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The word of this whale bonanza spread quickly. Soon whaling ships were 
congregating outside the mouth of the lagoon and sending longboats inside to 
hunt the whales. Within four years the whales in Scammon's Lagoon had been 
virtually wiped out, turned into whale oil and other products. 
</P>
<P>
 (One highly sought whale part was the baleen plates, the flexible sieves 
through which whales sift out the small crustaceans on which they feed. Before 
the invention of plastics, the baleen material was used for women's corsets and 
other products requiring strong but flexible material.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although the whales lost the war, the battles between man and gray whales 
weren't always completely one-sided. Scammon wrote that "Hardly a day passes 
but there is upsetting or staving of the boats (by gray whales). . . . Repeated 
incidents have happened in which men have been instantly killed or received 
mortal injury." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, despite its friendly reputation now, the gray whale was known to 
whaling men as the "devil fish" because of its ferocity in attacking when it 
was injured, or when its young were endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the 19th Century, Pacific gray whales, which had once numbered 
about 20,000 animals, were so few in number that it was no longer profitable to 
hunt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazingly, the gray whale made a comeback, its numbers increasing steadily 
until once again the Baja lagoons were full of them. In the 1920s and '30s, 
there were so many that whalers once again came after them, killing them by the 
thousands and grinding them up for pet food. For the second time, the gray 
whale was almost wiped off the face of the earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, however, an international treaty was signed to protect the gray 
whale, and their numbers have been steadily increasing. Although whale censuses 
are difficult to do, experts estimate that there are now about 20,000 Pacific 
gray whales -- the same number that existed in pre-commercial hunting times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was no secret to the local fishermen, who often had " las ballenas 
" approach their small fishing boats, the friendly behavior of the gray whales 
while they're inside the Baja lagoons was first noted by scientists in the 
1970s. (The friendly behavior does not occur outside the lagoons, where the 
whales apparently are too busy migrating or feeding to pay attention to 
people.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists initially speculated that the "friendly whales" of the Baja 
lagoons were actually just one particular whale, a female named Gigi who had 
spent a year in captivity at SeaWorld in San Diego before being released into 
the Pacific, and thus presumably was accustomed to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 But as more and more contacts were documented, it became clear that, for 
reasons of their own, the gray whales of San Ignacio Lagoon and other Baja 
lagoons sometimes enjoyed sidling up to humans in small boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Not always, though. Bill Samaras, a retired Carson High School science teacher 
and gray whale expert who has traveled to the lagoons every year for the past 
two decades, notes that, "When there's mating going on, you can't get anywhere 
close to the whales." 
</P>
<P>
 Samaras discovered this at his peril some years ago, when his boat got a 
little too close to mating whales. The male whale flipped over suddenly and 
Samaras almost got crushed by a 10-foot-long gray whale penis that slammed down 
on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been reported incidents of whale-watching boats being knocked over, 
probably accidentally, by whales in the lagoons. In 1983 in Scammon's Lagoon, a 
whale-watching boat got between a mother and its calf and wound up getting 
whacked by a massive whale fluke, or tail; one elderly passenger died of a 
heart attack, and another was struck and killed by a flying oar. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are aberrations -- flukes, if you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to San Ignacio Lagoon can be expensive, or difficult, or sometimes 
both. The Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (formerly the Cabrillo Marine Museum) has 
been sponsoring annual boat trips there for 15 years; the cost this year for an 
eight-day voyage on the Royal Polaris from San Diego with stops at the lagoon 
and several offshore islands was about $1,800 per person. The trip was booked 
months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to the lagoon by land are possible, but rugged; the lagoon is connected 
to the nearest town, San Ignacio, only by a 35-mile stretch of deeply rutted, 
washed-out dirt road.

JUDGE REFUSES TO ALTER LIGHT PENALTY; COURTS: JURIST WHO SAYS SENTENCING RULES 
ARE TOO RIGID GAVE A REFORMED DRUG DEALER ONLY HALF THE TERM PROSECUTORS AGREED 
TO IN A PLEA BARGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Escalating his campaign against federal sentencing laws, U.S. District Judge 
Terry J. Hatter Jr. has refused a request to reconsider the 4 1/2-year prison 
term he gave to a onetime narcotics dealer who has become a community activist 
in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office had asked Hatter to review the sentence because it 
was half the time defendant Bobbie Marshall had agreed to serve in a plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter's refusal last Monday, inviting a confrontation with the executive 
branch of government, is one of several instances in which he has challenged 
federal sentencing laws, which he considers too rigid.  
</P>
<P>
 He told Atty. Gen. Janet Reno in a public forum last year that young, white 
federal prosecutors were making their reputations on the backs of minority 
defendants, comments that angered many federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hatter sentenced Marshall in early March, the judge said he thought even 
4 1/2 years was too severe under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter praised Marshall, 41, for turning his life around during the past four 
years and emerging as an anti-drug, anti-violence advocate who played a key 
role in the city's efforts to maintain calm after verdicts in the second Rodney 
G. King beating trial and the Reginald O. Denny beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have done wonders in the community," Hatter said, crediting Marshall with 
helping young men from minority groups avoid the "spiral of crime in which you 
found yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 He lamented that "justice can't be completely done" because politicians have 
restricted the power of judges to act independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter was referring to the fact that federal sentencing laws passed in the 
1980s restricted the discretion of judges to tailor sentences to fit individual 
circumstances. Congress enacted the laws after expressing concern that there 
was too much inconsistency in sentences given to individuals who had committed 
similar crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the March 7 sentencing hearing, Hatter also took the rare step of 
expressing the hope that the government would not appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 28, Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madison, treading as lightly as he 
could, told Hatter that the government respectfully disagreed with his 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said that Hatter was obliged, under a federal appeals court ruling, to 
impose the "agreed upon nine-year sentence," which was part of a plea agreement 
that included the dropping of four other 1989 drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Madison contended, the entire agreement should be voided and 
Marshall should go to trial, where he would face a possible sentence of 24 
years or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hatter would not budge, saying such an action would be unfair to Marshall. 
"It's the court, if anyone, who is outside the law, not the defendant," Hatter 
said. He also formally dismissed the four remaining charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter told Madison that if the government wants to challenge his decision, 
the appropriate action for the U.S. attorney's office is to follow its normal 
procedure and ask the U.S. solicitor general for permission to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then we'll see whether this Justice Department is (as rigid) as the one we 
had the last 12 years" under Presidents Reagan and Bush, Hatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said the government's decision to hold fast for the nine-year term had 
been made after he consulted with U.S. Atty. Nora Manella and Richard Drooyan, 
the chief of the office's criminal division. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he would consult with them again on whether to appeal 
Hatter's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. attorney's office took a close look at this case," Manella said. "We 
worked out an agreement that was suitable to both sides and faithful to the 
sentencing guidelines. We will have to look at this (Hatter's decision) and see 
what our alternatives are." 
</P>
<P>
 Manella and Madison noted that this is an unusual case. Marshall was arrested 
in May, 1989, and charged with dealing drugs near a Pacoima schoolyard under a 
special federal statute that mandates stiff prison terms for such crimes. 
Marshall had three state convictions between 1977 and 1987 for selling 
marijuana and for possessing PCP and crack cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Marshall, who is African American, and several other 
defendants filed papers alleging that the U.S. attorney's office was 
selectively prosecuting blacks and Latinos under the schoolyard law. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Marshall and three other minority defendants pleaded guilty 
on the eve of a hearing at which a bevy of local and federal law enforcement 
officials, including Robert C. Bonner Jr., then chief of the Drug Enforcement 
Administration, were scheduled to testify on the allegations of selective 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, who had been out on bail since March, 1990, received a 14-year term. 
By that time, he was involved in community service work and consistently tested 
drug-free. Hatter postponed his sentencing for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Marshall's defense lawyer, Denise Meyer, sent a letter to Reno 
urging her to reconsider the 14-year sentence, praising Marshall as a "model of 
rehabilitation and leadership that the criminal justice system rarely sees and 
should reward." 
</P>
<P>
 Attached to Meyer's letter were other letters of praise from community 
leaders, including one from Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office and Meyer renegotiated Marshall's plea arrangement 
and on the morning of March 7 agreed to a nine-year term, setting the stage for 
Hatter's decision to hand down a more lenient sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy that the judge recognized he has the power to sentence and 
not the prosecutor," Meyer said after Monday's hearing. "Even though it was a 
binding plea agreement, it doesn't mean that the judge doesn't retain 
jurisdiction to decide on a fair and just sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter's decision in the Marshall case is not the first time he has imposed a 
sentence lighter than prosecutors sought. But he also has meted out severe 
sentences in narcotics cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he sentenced two men to life terms, without possibility of parole, 
after they were convicted of being the leaders of a ring that was broken with 
the seizure of a record 21.4 tons of cocaine in a Sylmar warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a case that cries out for the maximum sentence," Hatter said. 
"Society must be protected as best it can."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S AND WOMEN'S FINAL FOURS; RAZORBACKS WILL DUKE 
IT OUT; GAME 2: THE BLUE DEVILS' HILL TAKES OVER, SCORING 25 POINTS AND HOLDING 
BROWN TO ONLY EIGHT IN A 70-65 VICTORY OVER FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It isn't often you see the 10-year-old son of the opposing coach asking for 
Duke player autographs, but after the Blue Devils' 70-65 victory against 
Florida on Saturday evening, who could blame him? 
</P>
<P>
 Little Kevin Kruger, son of Gator Coach Lon Kruger, knew what he was doing 
when he ventured into the Blue Devil locker room an hour after the national 
semifinal game at Charlotte Coliseum. No dummy, he made a beeline for swingman 
Grant Hill, who graciously signed away. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, it was one of the few things Hill gave up to a Gator all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill scored 25 points, made eight of 13 shots, collected six rebounds, had 
five assists and two blocks. And that was only the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the defensive end, the 6-8 guard/forward/whatever put the glove on 
Florida's Craig Brown, the Gators' best pure shooter. Brown finished with eight 
points -- seven below his season average -- and generally was reduced to 
spectator as Hill and the Blue Devils overcame a 13-point second-half deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, teammates queued up to praise Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it that he can't do?" said Duke freshman point guard Jeff Capel, who 
was bailed out by Hill all night. "There isn't anything on the court that Grant 
Hill can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 He will get no argument from Antonio Lang, the Duke forward who happily serves 
as Hill's publicity flak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grant's performance tonight was definitely was one of the best performances 
in Final Four history," said Lang, who sat out much of the first half because 
of three fouls. "I feel good just to be out there and say I witnessed it. Grant 
did everything tonight and we jumped on his back and I really think he took us 
to the promised land, if you want a little analogy and something to write in 
the paper." 
</P>
<P>
 The promised land, of course, is the championship game, a place that Duke 
knows well. When the Blue Devils face Arkansas in Monday night's game, it will 
mark the fifth time in the last nine seasons that Duke has advanced to the 
championship bracket. Three of those appearances have featured Hill, which 
pretty much rules out the coincidence factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill played all 40 minutes Saturday night. He shut down Brown and lit up 
whatever Florida defender Kruger sent his way. Brown . . . Dan Cross . . . 
Brian Thompson, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point," Kruger said, "you kind of choose your poison a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Gators tried to crowd Hill, he found the open teammate for a clear 
shot. When they gave him room, Hill made jumpers or drove through the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Hill didn't have any choice but to take over the game. Lang was on 
the bench for much of the first half. Center Cherokee Parks spent the first 20 
minutes watching Gators Andrew DeClercq and Dametri Hill outplay him. Capel and 
guard Chris Collins were equally ineffective in the backcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Duke trailed at halftime for the third time during this NCAA 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were good," Hill said. "But when they came out, they were better 
than we thought they were." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Blue Devils struggled, Florida put together a 20-3 scoring run that 
stretched from 6:32 in the first half to 18:13 in the second half. Suddenly 
Duke trailed, 45-32, reason enough for Blue Devil Coach Mike Krzyzewski to call 
a quick timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were still reacting to Florida instead of forcing the action," he said. 
"If we were going to do that, we were going to lose by 25." 
</P>
<P>
 Krzyzewski's message in the huddle during the timeout was short and not so 
sweet. Down by 13 points and the game slipping away, he issued a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is it," he told them. "You have to play 18 minutes of basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 So they did, chipping away at Florida's lead until finally, with 4:42 to play, 
Hill made a short jumper over Brown to put Duke ahead, 61-60. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 30 seconds later, Brown made only his second three-pointer of the 
game to give the Gators their last lead. After that, the Blue Devils squirmed 
ahead and for a change of pace, someone other than Hill helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Capel made a three-pointer at the 2:31 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark slapped the ball from Cross' hands as the Florida guard tried a go-ahead 
shot with 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who was considerably more active in the second half, missed a jumper, 
but grabbed the rebound and converted the second attempt with 14.3 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Lang took a charge from Cross with 10.8 seconds left. And with 1.7 seconds 
left, with Florida unable or unwilling to foul, Lang took a pass from Clark and 
dunked for the final points of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Clark would say later, "that was that." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida's magical season ended after 29 victories and its first Final Four 
appearance. So impressed was Krzyzewski with the Gators' effort that he made 
sure to stop Brown and Cross as they walked off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told them it was an honor to play against them," Krzyzewski said. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling was mutual. Brown couldn't say enough about the job Hill did on 
him. What else could he do? Hill held him to zero points in the first half and 
only nine field goal attempts for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the gracious Cross didn't say a peep about the stripped ball by 
Clark or the charging call in Lang's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was very physical," he said. "The call could have gone either way." 
</P>
<P>
 It went Duke's way, which is why Kevin Kruger spent the postgame with pen and 
program in hand. One of the last players he approached was Parks, who jotted 
his signature and then handed the program back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," Parks said, "tell your dad they played a good game." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone did. Especially the great Hill.

MIKE DOWNEY: COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S AND WOMEN'S FINAL FOURS; HOGS' OLD 
MAN HAS THE TIME OF HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So, maybe you should know about Alex Dillard, student-athlete, University of 
Arkansas. Al is old. He is 25. That is old for a college junior, believe me. 
For a college basketball player, it is Medicare age. Al is older than Shaquille 
O'Neal, older than Chris Webber, older than Shawn Kemp. Older by several years, 
in fact. He says his teammates call him names like Father Time, Grandfather 
Time, Antique. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President of the United States comes to our practice and says he wants to 
talk to me," Dillard says. "So my teammates say, 'Of course the man wants to 
talk to you. Y'all went to high school together."' 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, those youngbloods. Always teasing the old-timer. 
</P>
<P>
 They make Al Dillard laugh and laugh. Darnell Robinson, for instance. The 
fresh freshman from Oakland. Dillard says, "Somebody says something in practice 
I can't hear, Darnell'll say, 'Yo, Granddaddy. You're gettin' senile, ain't 
you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He eats it up. Old Al loves being one of the school kids, even if he is old 
enough to be their professor. He is so proud to be playing with the rest of the 
Razorbacks for the national championship of college basketball Monday night. 
Hey, not bad for a high school dropout. 
</P>
<P>
 Just goes to show, Al says, "Good things come to those who wait. And, believe 
me, I've waited." 
</P>
<P>
 Al was struggling down in his home state of Alabama, and so was his family. 
His mother lost her job. Al lost interest in school. He stopped studying. He 
dropped out, took a job in a fast-food joint, didn't pick up a book for three 
years. All he did was work and play basketball. The older he got, the less time 
he had to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 There he sat, 22 years old and no high school diploma. Al's girlfriend got on 
his case. She kept pushing and pushing to make something of himself. Al 
insisted that he was making something of himself -- a better basketball player. 
His girlfriend told him, "Yeah, a basketball player on some playground. What 
good's that going to do you?" 
</P>
<P>
 She pleaded with him to take his high school equivalency exam. Al was 
reluctant. How could he sit there with all those textbooks and start over? 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose it was you," he says, sitting inside the Arkansas locker room after 
Saturday's game. "Suppose you were to stop reading, stop writing. You might 
read a sports magazine sometime, but that's it. So that's you. You ain't 
reading or writing. And you know you ain't going to be doing no math. So what 
would it be like for you to be going back to high school again? 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend kept after me. She was tougher than any instructor. She pushed 
me. She'd say, hey, you got to crawl before you can walk." 
</P>
<P>
 Al is asked, "And that's what convinced you?" 
</P>
<P>
 He answers, "That and three words: 'I love you."' 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to him that there was still time to become a college 
basketball hero. He passed his equivalency exam. It wasn't easy. Neither were 
those junior-college classes he took. All the basics -- Basic English, Basic 
Math, Western Civilization. He recalls them all. He recalls sitting there at a 
desk, oldest kid in class. He recalls thinking, "Even if I make it, I'm going 
to end up a 26-year-old senior. I'd only have, like, 10 years left on my body 
for playing basketball. And that's if I'm lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 There was one thing that made him think anything was possible. Al could shoot. 
Man, could Al shoot. His junior college coach at Southern Union couldn't 
believe his eyes when Dillard came by for a tryout. Somebody had tipped the 
coach that this kid could really pump the rock. The coach said yeah, yeah, 
heard that one before. Then he gave Dillard a look and later said, "I couldn't 
believe what I was seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Nolan Richardson, the coach from Arkansas, got the word. 
He gave Dillard a shot -- literally. A green light to shoot from anywhere, any 
time. To come off the bench, ice cold, and heat things up. Which old man 
Dillard promptly did. Thirty-nine points against Delaware State in only 25 
minutes. (Twelve three-pointers!) Twenty-three points in 15 minutes against 
Southern Methodist. Sixteen points in 10 minutes against Louisiana State. An 
incredible 72 three-pointers this season, in limited playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 And not any old three-pointers, but ones from far, far behind the three-point 
arc. Al Dillard's bombs-away act made Arkansas crowds go crazy. The pep band 
struck up Paul Simon's "You Can Call Me Al" as soon as he came into a game. No 
Razorback fan was calling him Father Time or Antique. Even President Clinton 
gave an interview in which he called Alex Dillard his favorite player to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine that?" Dillard asks. "The man comes to our practice and says 
he wants to meet me. I'm there wanting to meet him and he says, 'No, I want to 
meet you .' The President of the United States wants to meet me more than I 
want to meet him." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Fan was here Saturday for Arkansas' 91-82 elimination of Arizona. 
Arkansas needed Dillard for only 12 minutes. The coach pulled Al off the bench 
and told him to do his thing. He did it, bang, bang, two trips down the floor. 
Three-pointer from 25 feet. Three-pointer from 27 feet. In a close game, 
Arkansas suddenly was up by a dozen points, and Richardson called Dillard right 
back to the bench until he would be needed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked Dillard's shooting range, Richardson said: "When he walks into the gym." 
</P>
<P>
 And now he's going for a national championship. Has anyone older ever won one? 
Not lately. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about that guy (Ronnie) Highsmith, out of Georgetown?" Dillard asks. 
"How old was he?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Same as you, I think," someone says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, well, I don't know," Al says. "Being the oldest, is that a good thing 
or not? I guess it is. Especially when I'm thinking about where I could be now. 
</P>
<P>
 "My girlfriend said there are three things you can be. You can be below 
average, you can be average, you can be above average. She said it all depends 
on you. I said I'd prefer to be above average. It's, like, who wouldn't? Only 
you just can't sit there and wish for it. You got to go to school and make 
something of yourself."

JIM MURRAY: POLITICAL BARKLEY IS TOO INCORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hate to say this -- he's going to hate me for saying it -- but I have to 
tell you Charles Barkley is a fake, a fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 How do I know this? Well, I've made a kind of study of the man. I read his 
biography, watched him play, sat in on his interviews, even urgently 
recommended him to Clipper owner Donald Sterling once when he came on the open 
market.  
</P>
<P>
 Look, Charles Barkley would have you believe he's the baddest dude in 
basketball, gives no quarter, takes no prisoners, defies convention. He's at 
pains to portray this image. He slugs barflies, spits at members of the 
audience, feuds with coaches, bad-mouths owners, snarls at media, takes pride 
in being his own man. A don't-mess-with-me attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine. He's done all of those things. He's an intimidator. On and off the 
court. He's outspoken. Controversial, even. It's not advisable to come up and 
slap him on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 But, having said that, let's take a look at the man. He's not really Big Bad 
Barkley. He's not a pussycat, but neither is he a mountain lion. He's a sheep 
in wolf's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch him on the floor. He smiles a lot. He has a nice smile. He laughs 
easily. He shakes hands with the court-side customers he knows. Says hello to 
opponents before tipoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a politician, for crying out loud! He's going to -- get this! -- run for 
governor of Alabama. Next stop, who knows? The White House? 
</P>
<P>
 Does that sound like the antisocial dude you've been reading about? The 
Charles Barkley who mugs the opposition, his own team or the paying customers 
with the same degree of skill and enthusiasm? The man you love to hate? 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley's big problem is he has trouble with the diplomatic lie. He might be 
governor, but he could never be secretary of state. World War III would ensue. 
Barkley would tell Yeltsin to sober up, tell the queen mother she was fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley has great difficulty with the truth. Which is to say, he tells it. 
Which creates difficulty. The truth always does. 
</P>
<P>
 The other night at the Sports Arena, his team beat up a docile, uninterested 
bunch of L.A. Clippers so easily Barkley didn't have to play but 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix Suns played him so little because they didn't need him to beat so 
inconsequential a bunch as the Clippers, Barkley told the reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't use your Mercedes-Benz to go to the grocery store. You save it for 
long important trips," he said, dismissing the Clippers. "Their team doesn't 
try hard enough. Someone should tell them winning takes effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Vintage Barkley. In your face. Don't sugarcoat it. If the Clippers don't like 
it -- well, it's a matter of complete indifference to Barkley. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Derrick Coleman a great player? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not as great as he should be," Barkley has evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 Aren't the Knicks great on defense? 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to be," says Barkley. "They have no offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley could spot the warts on the Mona Lisa. He never temporizes, says "No 
comment," or even claims he was misquoted. He was named to the all-interview 
team five years in a row by the beat writers. A dull game? Go find Barkley, he 
will liven it up for you. An open microphone and Barkley were like the iceberg 
and the Titanic. Once when he was criticized by an adversary, Byron Scott, 
Barkley said Scott was "last seen on the side of a milk carton." He once led an 
on-court brawl that set a league record for fines -- $162,500, of which 
Barkley's share was $57,000 in fines and lost salary for suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Reputation meant little to Barkley. He took over for Julius Erving in 
Philadelphia, where Dr. J was second only to Ben Franklin in community esteem, 
but it wasn't long before Erving was turning over the team leadership to the 
brash young Barkley -- at Barkley's insistence. And Barkley once held Larry 
Bird with his arms pinned to his side while Dr. J belabored him with blows. 
Bird wore the wrong color uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, even the uniform didn't matter. When Barkley got traded to Phoenix, 
he chose the first practice to bounce teammate Cedric Ceballos on the floor as 
the team screamed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Olympics, it was the Dream Team teammates who screamed at him when he 
elbowed a player from Angola in the ribs and stomped on his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 But for a guy who can dish it out, Barkley can also take it. When Bobby Knight 
cut him from the Olympic team in 1984, many thought it was because Barkley 
twitted the coach. The Barkley of those days was widely perceived to be a 
talented kid who was going to eat his way out of the game despite his 
undeniable genius for it. The "Round Mound of Rebound" was his nom-de-court in 
the better press releases. Knight wanted him to lose weight, but all Barkley 
did was lose interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Knight cut him, Barkley, astonishingly, defended him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't even close to the player I had been at the (Olympic) trials," he was 
to write. "I was just hanging out, having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He actually thought Knight agonized over the decision to cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's when I finally gained respect for Knight -- realized we were very much 
alike -- he couldn't take less than the best from anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley is also delighted when anyone stands up to him, which is not part of 
the image, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I've blown his cover, shouldn't he rob a train, drown a canary or 
bad-mouth Mother Teresa to get his film-villain image back? First thing you 
know, he will be getting the basketball equivalent of hockey's Lady Byng Award, 
annually awarded to the player who passes out the fewest subdural hemorrhages, 
who uses his stick on a puck, not an ear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barkley is the nearest thing to a megastar in the game, now that Michael 
Jordan has left. He put 16,005 fans in the seats at the Sports Arena the other 
night, and there was no doubt they were there to see him. Sir Charles. They 
booed him, of course. That's part of the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 If his team prevails and wins the championship this year, will he try out for 
the Chicago White Sox next year?  
</P>
<P>
 Barkley laughs. "No. I'm going to be trying for governor."  
</P>
<P>
 Will he make it? 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt! By acclamation," he predicts.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sickness in our society today. Our idiots have given a message to 
our children that your life has no meaning unless you have a big house, a big 
car, expensive clothes and a lot of money. We've taught them that being a cop, 
an honest workman, a trash man or a carpenter, any of the useful things in 
life, are not meaningful. That needs to be addressed. The system isn't working. 
We need to root it out, remake it." 
</P>
<P>
 But can he kiss babies, eat the rubber chicken, make the promises and evade 
the pressing questions it will take to get to the state house? Can he get there 
by being Charles Barkley? Won't a couple of Charles Barkley answers torpedo the 
whole campaign? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so. But the fact of the matter is that despite his mouth, Barkley is -- 
come closer, I wouldn't want him to know I'm spreading this around -- a nice 
guy!

MIGHTY DUCKS KEEP PLAYOFF DRIVE ALIVE; HOCKEY: GOALIE HEBERT SHUTS DOWN 
TORONTO, 3-1, WITH MORE THAN A LITTLE HELP FROM THE PENALTY-KILLING UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks know this is the time when teams wilt. Look at the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only five games between them and the off-season, but the Ducks 
haven't folded. They beat Toronto, 3-1, in front of 17,174 Saturday at The Pond 
of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known teams that really went into the tank when they faced elimination," 
said goalie Guy Hebert, who won his 19th game of the season and carried a 
shutout into the third period. "It's somewhat frustrating that no matter how 
well we play we can't do enough to pass San Jose without their help. But in 
retrospect, it's really positive." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Ducks win all their remaining games, the Sharks only have to tie 
one in their last five to clinch the final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have won four of their last five games, but they're almost out of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maple Leafs, who have the fifth-best record in the NHL but were 1-2-1 
against the Ducks, are limping toward the playoffs. They conducted a 
closed-door meeting after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't kissing each other in there," Toronto Coach Pat Burns said. 
"We're just trying to keep things positive. We're not the favorites any more. . 
. . We have to stick together and play as a team. That's how we got this far." 
</P>
<P>
 That and a hard-working style have gotten the Ducks further than they had the 
audacity to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to play well every night," said Joe Sacco, who scored a goal for 
the third consecutive game. "Plus, it's pride. We've got a lot of pride in this 
room. We'd like to finish ahead of certain teams. I don't know what the 
expansion record was, 31?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was -- until the Florida Panthers broke it by winning their 32nd game. But 
the victory over Toronto was the Ducks' 31st, tying them for second with the 
1967-68 Kings and Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert made 27 saves, but the victory probably belonged to the penalty-killers 
who shut out Toronto on eight power-play attempts and killed a five-minute 
high-sticking penalty against Patrik Carnback in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Coach Ron Wilson was unhappy with the call, which came after Carnback's 
stick hit Todd Gill's face as Carnback tried to recover the puck that Gill 
knocked away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ducks kept Toronto at bay, with Shaun Van Allen blocking a shot by 
Drake Berehowsky. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one big kill after another -- too many for Wilson's comfort -- but the 
Ducks escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't give up many shots," Hebert said. "I think Toronto was trying to 
work plays and make pinpoint passes and get two or three real quality shots, 
but our guys were pressuring them, and they didn't really get many chances." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks took a 1-0 lead into the third on Sacco's first-period goal, his 
18th. Then John Lilley, who played for Team USA at Lillehammer, celebrated his 
first NHL goal after circling behind the net and putting in a backhander off a 
pass from David Williams at 4:37 of the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan Lebeau scored at 6:58 for a 3-0 lead. But Bob Rouse spoiled Hebert's 
shutout bid with a goal at 7:30. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert will be invited to be the goalie for the U.S. team coached by Ron 
Wilson at the World Championships later this month, said Lou Nanne, Team USA 
general manager.

AMERICAN LEAGUE PREVIEW; READY OR NOT, MARINERS AND INDIANS WILL BE CONTENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

 They were the rusted Ford Fairlanes sitting in the parking lot full of 
glistening Mercedeses. They were the plaid leisure suits sitting on the rack 
with Armanis. They were the black-and-white TVs sitting in the showroom full of 
60-inch projection screens. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the Cleveland Indians and Seattle Mariners, who have been the 
laughingstocks of the American League while time has passed them by. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 40 years and four expansion phases since Cleveland last won a 
pennant. They have not finished as high as second since 1959, or third since 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners have been practicing in futility since the franchise's inception 
in 1977. They have failed to finish higher than sixth in 11 of those years, and 
never higher than fourth. Their resume includes only two winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of these two franchises makes this sound so utterly preposterous, 
but entering a new era in baseball with three divisions and a wild card, the 
Indians and Mariners are the teams to beat in the American League Central and 
West. They should be joined in the playoffs by the Toronto Blue Jays of the 
East, and the Chicago White Sox as the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first Indians team in about 40 years that brings a lot of hope 
and promise to the city," Manager Mike Hargrove said. "And it's the right thing 
to expect. In years past, people have fooled themselves to a certain extent, 
thinking this was the team. But this team gives us the best chance in the last 
40 years to do some good. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people expect a whole lot out of this club, they should." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cleveland General Manager John Hart: "I think everyone understands what 
this franchise has been through over the last 30 or 40 years. It's very well 
documented. But in the eyes of the baseball world, we're not perceived as a 
factor." 
</P>
<P>
 While Cleveland appears ready to take advantage of leaving the tough American 
League East, no one expects to prosper more than Seattle. The Mariners, who 
still need to find a bullpen stopper, appear to be the overwhelming favorites 
to win the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, there are the Blue Jays, who are vying for their third 
consecutive World Series championship. This is General Manager Pat Gillick's 
final season before he retires and he's determined to leave with one more ring. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the American League's three divisions, in order of predicted finish: 
WEST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 SEATTLE MARINERS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 82-80, fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The game plan is simple. Make sure the bullpen blows a few games in 
the early going, convince ownership that a closer is necessary, and then rely 
on the finest starting rotation in the league to run away with the division. 
</P>
<P>
 Piniella continues to push for a trade for stopper Rick Aguilera of Minnesota, 
particularly after ownership nixed a deal a few weeks ago for Mel Rojas of 
Montreal. They now have no choice but to go with Bobby Thigpen, who saved a 
record 57 games in 1990 but has had only two saves since the 1992 All-Star 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on the simmering feud between ace left-hander Randy Johnson and 
center fielder Ken Griffey. Johnson criticized Griffey's work habits. Griffey 
demanded an explanation. Nobody's talking. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Faces: Pitchers Bobby Ayala, Greg Hibbard and Thigpen. Outfielder Eric 
Anthony. Infielders Felix Fermin and Reggie Jefferson. Catcher Dan Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must Have: A bullpen stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Have: A general manager as aggressive as Piniella to acquire one. 
</P>
<P>
 ANGELS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 71-91, tied for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The front office indeed has let it be known by their actions that 
the youth movement is dead. The young players are surrounded by veterans. The 
time has come to win. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels accelerated their willingness to put together a contender because 
of the realignment. They have a strong nucleus, surrounded by veterans, many 
hand-picked by Manager Buck Rodgers. It's still a mystery why they are not more 
concerned with their bullpen. Maybe they forgot that Bryan Harvey is still 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Faces: Outfielders Dwight Smith and Bo Jackson. Infielders Harold 
Reynolds, Spike Owen and Rex Hudler. Pitchers John Dopson, Mark Leiter, Craig 
Lefferts and Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must Have: An effective bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Have: Another proven starter, someone such as, say, Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 OAKLAND ATHLETICS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 68-94, seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: It says something about the quality of this division that even the 
Athletics believe they can win it. This is a team that finished last in 1993. 
Left fielder Rickey Henderson hardly is providing any reason this team will be 
better. He was hitting .111 the last week of spring training, and this is after 
batting .210 the final two months with Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Tony La Russa is going to love visiting Cleveland this year. Their new 
ballpark features three pitching mounds in the bullpen. La Russa set an 
American League record with 424 pitching changes last season -- and that was 
accomplished while warming up only two relievers at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitchers Steve Karsay, Carlos Reyes and Dave Righetti. 
Outfielders Stan Javier and Kerwin Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must Have: Henderson pretending it's the last year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Have: The clock set back to their glory days. 
</P>
<P>
 TEXAS RANGERS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 86-76, second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Rangers were the chic pick to win the division throughout the 
winter, but once folks started to catch their pitching act, they realized this 
team is in deep trouble. It didn't stop General Manager Tom Grieve from 
guaranteeing a division championship, which has made Manager Kevin Kennedy a 
bit squeamish. 
</P>
<P>
 They not only are opening the season with Jack Armstrong as their No. 3 
starter, but their three best relievers -- Tom Henke, Rick Honeycutt and Jay 
Howell -- are a combined 113 years old. They all had terrible springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers will be the only major league team without a bullpen coach this 
season. Kennedy believes the relievers can police themselves. This could be 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Infielders Will Clark and Greg Litton. Pitchers Jack Armstrong, 
Bruce Hurst, Jay Howell and Rick Honeycutt. Catcher Junior Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must Have: Will Clark to prove that the last two years were an aberration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Have: A retractable dome to keep the Rangers from wilting during the 
dog days of summer. CENTRAL DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 CLEVELAND INDIANS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Record: 76-86, sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Suddenly serious about winning this thing, the Indians will be 
shelling out a franchise-record $27 million in salaries. Believing they can 
draw 3 million with their new stadium, they signed veteran starters Jack Morris 
and Dennis Martinez -- who have combined to win 452 major league games -- and 
designated hitter/first baseman Eddie Murray. 
</P>
<P>
 They appear to have emotionally recovered from the deaths of relief pitchers 
Steve Olin and Tim Crews last spring, but the anniversary of their deaths 
reminded everyone that they still have not found a replacement to be their 
stopper. Jerry DiPoto was supposed to fill the job, but he underwent surgery 
two weeks ago to remove a cancerous thyroid gland. Steve Farr will be the man 
for now, but his surgically repaired elbow prevents him from pitching on 
back-to-back days. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise of the spring has been the pitching of Morris, who not 
only earned a spot on the team, but opens the season as their No. 2 starter. 
The Indians hope Morris' magic continues. Morris has been on three consecutive 
World Series championship teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitchers Dennis Martinez and Jack Morris. Infielders Eddie Murray 
and Omar Vizquel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must Have: Confidence that the 40-year jinx is over. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't Have: Fond memories of Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO WHITE SOX 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 94-68, first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Although this team still is the most talented in the Central 
Division, they have had this nasty habit of underachieving before last season. 
They also have become concerned about the aching knees of DH Julio Franco this 
spring. Franco underwent surgery on his left knee five months ago, and still is 
not recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Outfielder Darrin Jackson. Designated hitter Franco. Pitcher 
Scott Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Someone in marketing who can convince their city that the White 
Sox are more exciting to watch than the Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Minnie Minoso hanging around to see if he can play with Michael 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 KANSAS CITY ROYALS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 84-78, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Royals are in midst of their longest postseason drought in 
franchise history, last being seen in late October in 1985 when umpire Don 
Denkinger called Jorge Orta safe at first base, and ruined the rest of Whitey 
Herzog's baseball career. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Coleman is expected to lead the charge. Manager Hal McRae is convinced 
that Coleman will have a monster season, wanting to prove that he doesn't 
belong on the most-wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals, however, could have huge problems in right field. Dave Henderson 
is the scheduled opening day right fielder until Felix Jose returns. The Royals 
were being cautious with Jose, delaying his return until March 15, because they 
wanted him to be fully recovered from the shoulder problems that plagued him 
last season. So what happens? He injures his back doing situps at a health 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Runs. The Royals scored only 675 last season, fewest in the 
league.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: George Brett willing to come out of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 MINNESOTA TWINS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Record: 71-91, tied for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Twins' biggest nemesis this spring has been those meddling 
owners. . . . from the other clubs.  
</P>
<P>
 The Twins agreed on a deal last week that would have sent bullpen stopper Rick 
Aguilera to Cleveland for shortstop prospect Mark Lewis and reliever Jerry 
DiPoto, but the trade collapsed when Cleveland owner Richard Jacobs vetoed the 
deal because of Aguilera's hefty contract. In December, the Twins agreed to a 
deal that would have sent center fielder Shane Mack and a reliever to Houston 
for Ken Caminiti and Shane Reynolds. This time, Astro owner Drayton McLane 
vetoed it because he did not want to pick up part of Caminiti's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Twins had completed both trades, their infield would be Caminiti at 
third base, Scott Leius at shortstop, Chuck Knoblauch at second and Kent Hrbek 
at first. Now, the four players who will man the Twins' left side combined for 
four homers in 790 at-bats last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Catcher Matt Walbeck. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Any reason to worry about printing playoff tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 MILWAUKEE BREWERS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Record: 69-93, seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: All you need to know about the Brewers is that Teddy Higuera is 
their healthiest player. Higuera, who has won four games since 1990 when he 
signed a four-year, $14-million contract, actually is being counted on this 
spring to be an integral part of their rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 This team has a chance to be the worst in the league. The outfield is a mess. 
Center fielder Darryl Hamilton not only has a bone spur in his right elbow, but 
a possible tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow. The Brewers 
already have left fielder Greg Vaughn and right fielder B.J. Surhoff returning 
from off-season shoulder surgeries. This could leave a starting outfield of 
Brian Harper in left, Alex Diaz in center and Turner Ward in right. Their 
double-play combination also remains in disorder. Shortstop Pat Listach and 
second baseman Jody Reed have yet to play together. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Second baseman Reed. Outfielders Ward and Harper. Pitcher Bob 
Scanlan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Anyone dumb enough in the front office to give Higuera another 
multi-year contract. EAST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 TORONTO BLUE JAYS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Record: 95-67, first place. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Blue Jays, determining that there's no reason to spend cash 
until it's time, decided they will make do with their own kind. They're moving 
rookie catcher Carlos Delgado to left field, starting 20-year-old Alex Gonzalez 
at shortstop, adding Domingo Cedeno as their utility infielder, and inserting 
Paul Spoljaric as their fifth starter. They opened the season in Class A or 
double-A. 
</P>
<P>
 It is apparent why the Blue Jays were so eager to acquire Gregg Olson during 
the winter. Bullpen stopper Duane Ward twice has needed to see a doctor for his 
sore shoulder, and will open the season on the disabled list. Considering that 
Danny Cox is out until mid-season, the Blue Jays' closer will have to be Todd 
Stottlemyre. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitcher Greg Cadaret. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Ward staying healthy for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Enough room in their trophy case. 
</P>
<P>
 BOSTON RED SOX 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Record: 80-82, fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Red Sox, who traditionally overbid in the free agent market, 
appear to have picked up their best acquisition in years in General Manager Dan 
Duquette. The Red Sox paid the Montreal Expos $500,000 to release him from his 
contract, promised not to raid any employees for two years, nor take a player 
in the Rule 5 draft for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Duquette, tranforming the Red Sox from a bunch of plodders into a track team, 
has decided to utilize speed. They picked up free-agent center fielder Otis 
Nixon in the off-season -- whose 47 stolen bases were more than half of the Red 
Sox's entire team total last season -- and are trying to pick up even more 
speed. Duquette is trying to trade for Brian Jordan of the Cardinals to play 
right field, and he has made a three-year contract offer to Ron Gant to be his 
left fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Butch Hobson, whose job is in jeopardy, appears to be calm. He even 
abolished the one-year ban of alcohol on team flights. Having Roger Clemens 
regain his Cy Young form this spring has a tendency of relaxing everyone in 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Outfielders Nixon and Lee Tinsley. Catchers Damon Berryhill and 
Dave Valle. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Andre Dawson's knees staying intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Patience for a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK YANKEES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 record: 88-74, second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Yankees, who have a funny habit of making their players' lives 
miserable, pulled a fast one on reliever Paul Assenmacher during the spring. 
Assenmacher, who was traded from the Chicago Cubs to the Yankees last year, had 
just sold his home in Skokie, Ill., when he got the news. He was going back to 
Chicago. And house-hunting again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees have come up empty finding anyone to close games, going from 
Xavier Hernandez to Jeff Reardon to Bob Wickman in the course of a few weeks. 
Who's the leading candidate now? 
</P>
<P>
 Yep, Steve Howe. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitchers Hernandez, Reardon, Terry Mulholland and Bob Ojeda. 
Outfielder Luis Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Someone to persuade starter Jim Abbott to stay instead of leaving 
after the season for Detroit as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: A commissioner to suspend George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
 BALTIMORE ORIOLES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 record: 85-77, tied for third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Shelling out $42.85 million this winter in their free-agent 
spending spree, owner Peter Angelos believes his team will win about 140 games 
this year, give or take 20 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has the city convinced that the Orioles will win the World Series, and 
if they don't, guess who's taking the fall? Manager Johnny Oates, who is 
fidgety by nature anyway, already is acting as if he's on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Oates already has changed his mind twice on his outfield alignment, now moving 
Mike Devereaux to center, Brady Anderson to left and Jeffrey Hammonds to right. 
He blamed beat writers for his original statements. If they hadn't pressed him 
in the first place, he said, he never would have lied. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitchers Sid Fernandez, Lee Smith and Mark Eichhorn. First 
baseman Rafael Palmeiro and third baseman Chris Sabo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Lee Smith making everyone forget about Gregg Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: An owner who will tolerate anything less than a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 DETROIT TIGERS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 record: 85-77, tied for third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: This team is not going anywhere in the standings, but it could be 
leaving Tiger Stadium. They keep issuing veiled threats to move to suburban 
Detroit if they do not get more cooperation from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has come at a good time, considering the Tigers look to be in 
for another dismal year. "There's no way for us to beat those three clubs 
(Toronto, Baltimore and New York) unless we do some things," Tiger Manager 
Sparky Anderson said. "If we allow ourselves to sit back, we're dead. It's that 
simple." 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitcher Tim Belcher. Infielder Juan Samuel. Outfielder Junior 
Felix. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Cecil Fielder eclipse Roger Maris' home run record to compensate 
for pitching staff's ineptness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: A fountain of youth for Kirk Gibson, Alan Trammell, Lou Whitaker 
and Eric Davis.

NATIONAL LEAGUE PREVIEW; BRAVES WILL BE PURSUED BUT ARE UNLIKELY TO BE CAUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How would you like to wake up one morning and find yourself in the National 
League East? Think how the Florida Marlins must feel, surrounded by the 
toughest teams in the league, led by the still mighty Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly conceivable to pick against a team that won 104 games and is still 
intact, and so we won't. But when the Braves get to postseason play this time, 
they might want to lighten up a bit. While the Philadelphia Phillies were 
carrying around cans of beer in their clubhouse last fall, the Braves carried 
themselves as if they were at a summit conference.  
</P>
<P>
 Even so, few teams could lose Ron Gant and Chipper Jones, not have a closer 
and still be the division favorite. But if the Braves' bullpen by committee 
falters, the Montreal Expos will be right there. And never count out the 
Phillies, a lesson the Braves learned last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The West is the division to be in. The San Francisco Giants and Dodgers got 
rid of the Braves, the Houston Astros and the Cincinnati Reds. But the Giants 
are only slightly favored here, and the Dodgers will battle them to the end, 
and that's assuming a non-productive Darryl Strawberry. With his bat in the 
lineup, the Dodgers could win the title. It could all be decided in the final 
series of the season, which will again be at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros are solid and will battle the St. Louis Cardinals and the 
Cincinnati Reds for the new Central Division title. But for the Reds to 
challenge, pitcher Jose Rijo might have to visit his homeland again. When Rijo 
went into a slump last season, he went to the Dominican Republic and sacrificed 
a goat. He said it worked so well he's considering sacrificing 12 more before 
opening day. . . . and so it goes in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the division playoffs to include the Braves, the Giants and the 
Astros. The wild-card team should be the Dodgers. But the Braves, with an 
influx of enthusiasm from four rookies, will win the pennant. WEST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish, 103-59, second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Pitching wins championships, as the Giants were reminded last 
season. Two of their starters had great seasons, John Burkett going 22-7 and 
Bill Swift 21-8, but they couldn't do it alone. San Francisco since has signed 
Mark Portugal (18-4), and has closer Rod Beck, who had 48 saves, in a solid 
bullpen. Basically, this is the same team that won 103 games, it has an 
excellent manager in Dusty Baker, the best third baseman in the game in Matt 
Williams, and the best player in baseball, Barry Bonds. Bonds, second baseman 
Robby Thompson, Williams and catcher Kirt Manwaring all won gold gloves last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitchers Portugal and Rich Monteleone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A solid performance from right fielder Willie McGee, who will 
fill Will Clark's third spot in the batting order.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Tom Lasorda's Big Dodger in the sky . . . but Baker has his own 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 DODGERS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish, 81-81, fourth 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Who are these guys, hitting home runs, throwing out runners and 
coming from behind to win? Maybe it was only spring training, but the Dodgers 
showed surprising power, speed and depth except in the area they are most 
famous for -- starting pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 This team doesn't have an ace and really wouldn't need one if the offense 
continued to pound out home runs and the defense kept playing effectively. But 
pitching could be a problem. Pedro Astacio could be the ace, but he has been 
slowed by heart tests and is behind. Kevin Gross, slowed by shoulder 
tendinitis, and Ramon Martinez remain questionable.  
</P>
<P>
 Enter Chan Ho Park, a 20-year-old South Korean right-hander who couldn't have 
better timing. He throws hard, 95 m.p.h., and has an array of pitches that will 
find him a place in the rotation, maybe as soon as this week. Closer Todd 
Worrell appears recovered from arm problems but isn't dazzling, and if he 
falters, look for rookie Darren Dreifort, who is the closer of the future, to 
get a shot. And Darryl Strawberry? This team finally has power and speed 
without Strawberry, but his bat could be the deciding factor in the team's bid 
to overtake the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitchers Park, Dreifort and Gary Wayne. Second baseman Delino 
DeShields.  
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Quick decisions by management on starting pitching so the team 
doesn't get behind early. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: A dominating left-handed reliever. 
</P>
<P>
 COLORADO ROCKIES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish, 67-95, sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Rockies finished third in the league in hitting last season -- 
first at home in the thin air of Mile High Stadium -- and could do better this 
season after signing Howard Johnson, Ellis Burks and Walt Weiss and re-signing 
league batting champion Andres Galarraga. But their pitching is another story. 
Manager Don Baylor used 15 starters last season and they compiled the worst 
earned-run average in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Johnson, Burks, Weiss, pitchers Mike Harkey and Marvin Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A solid season by starters David Nied, who was sidelined 91 days 
last season with a partial ligament tear, Harkey and Greg Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Enough seats in Mile High Stadium for the Colorado fans, who set 
the single-season attendance record last season -- 4.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIEGO PADRES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 61-101, seventh.  
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: This team doesn't look so bad on paper, but there is no bench to 
speak of. The Padres have a solid outfield with Tony Gwynn, Phil Plantier and 
Derek Bell, as long as they stay injury-free. At last report, Gwynn's left knee 
still was sore, a perennial problem that usually surfaces late in the season. 
The last time Gwynn -- one of the the best hitters in baseball -- finished a 
complete season was in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a marvel that pitcher Andy Benes survived the team's fire sale last 
season. . . . but stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Second baseman Bip Roberts and third baseman Archi Cianfrocco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: New ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: A very good team. EAST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 ATLANTA BRAVES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 104-58, first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: This team still has everything, including three Cy Young Award 
winners -- Steve Bedrosian, Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux -- and a lineup from 
the No. 1 slot of Deion Sanders to No. 6 that needs a Cy Young winner to get 
them out. 
</P>
<P>
 The four returning starters -- Glavine, Maddux, Steve Avery and John Smoltz -- 
won 75 games last season. Left-hander Kent Mercker has won the fifth spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The team lost leadoff hitter Otis Nixon to free agency and, with Gant gone, 
the middle of the order is not as powerful. But the Braves still have Jeff 
Blauser, who hit .305, had 184 hits, 15 home runs and 110 runs scored; Terry 
Pendleton (17 homers, 33 doubles and 172 hits), Fred McGriff (37 homers, 101 
RBIs) and David Justice (40 homers, 120 RBIs). Sanders, who predicts stardom, 
will take Nixon's leadoff role. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves will go with closer Greg McMichael, and have several relief 
pitchers who are capable, but this is the area that has cost them. In 
postseason play the last three years, they are 5-13 in one-run games and lost 
the 1991 and 1992 World Series and the 1993 National League pennant.  
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Outfielder Dave Gallagher, who was acquired in the Pete Smith 
trade with the Mets, catcher Charlie O'Brien and closer Gregg Olson, who will 
start the season on the disabled list. Rookie Tony Tarasco will get most of the 
playing time in left, vacated by Gant when he broke his leg in the off-season 
and was released, and rookie Javier Lopez will be the starting catcher. 
Shortstop Chipper Jones was about to take Gant's vacated job in left field 
before suffering a season-ending knee injury.  
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A closer to step up out of a talented group.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Francisco Cabrera, Sid Bream, Brian Hunter, Damon Berryhill, 
Greg Olson, Jay Howell and Marvin Freeman.  
</P>
<P>
 MONTREAL EXPOS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 94-68, second. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: They have had a dismal spring, but if the Expos can get off to a 
quick start, this team is strong enough to challenge the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a strong outfield in Moises Alou, Marquis Grissom and Larry Walker, 
each of whom drove in at least 85 runs last season. They also hit 59 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullpen is deep, led by John Wetteland, who had 43 saves in 49 
opportunities. But the Expos, who believed that power pitching would finally 
put them in first place this season, let Dennis Martinez go to free agency and 
replaced him with Pedro Martinez, whom they acquired from the Dodgers for 
Delino DeShields. * New faces: Martinez, first baseman Randy Milligan and 
shortstop Freddie Benavides. Rookies include outfielder Rondell White and first 
baseman Cliff Floyd, who had a disappointing spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Moises Alou to come back strong from his ankle injury, which he 
suffered last season, so that Grissom can move to the leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: DeShields, who provided speed, runs and left-handed punch.  
</P>
<P>
 PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 97-65, first. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: A strong team returns minus its most celebrated player, relief 
pitcher Mitch Williams, and starter Terry Mulholland, who was traded to the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 A big key to this team's success last season was a fast start, and that might 
not be possible this season because of injuries and John Kruk's continuing 
recovery from testicular cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the team that led the league last season in runs, hits and walks 
remains strong offensively. Lenny Dykstra scored 143 runs and Darren Daulton 
drove in 105. * New faces: Reliever Doug Jones, who came from Houston in the 
Williams trade, and right-handed reliever Bobby Munoz, who came from New York 
in the Mulholland deal.  
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A quick return by relief pitcher-philosopher Larry Andersen, who 
had arthroscopic surgery on his knee and will sit out about a month.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Williams, who did save 43 games. The Phillies hope Norm 
Charlton, whom they signed as a free agent, will recover soon from elbow 
surgery. Meanwhile, Jones will have a chance to close.  
</P>
<P>
 NEW YORK METS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 59-103, seventh.  
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: They are doing what they can to change their bad-boy image, but 
what happens on the field will ultimately change the perception of this team. 
Manager Dallas Green has set a goal of getting his team to .500, but the Mets 
might be only slightly improved from 1993, when they finished with the worst 
record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Bonilla, the Mets' only power hitter, has been moved back to third base, 
not his best position. And they still have Dwight Gooden, who is coming off 
consecutive losing seasons. But they made a good trade, sending pitcher Anthony 
Young to the Chicago Cubs for shortstop Jose Vizcaino.  
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Vizcaino, Kevin McReynolds, first baseman David Segui, acquired 
in a trade with Baltimore, pitcher Pete Smith from the Braves, shortstop Luis 
Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A sound Bonilla, who has been limited since March 15 because of a 
strained right rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Eddie Murray, Vince Coleman, Howard Johnson and Sid Fernandez, 
some of whom the Mets were happy to see go in an effort to sweeten a sour 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 FLORIDA MARLINS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 64-98, sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: They are building, so don't expect much. This team has one of the 
best closers in the game, Bryan Harvey, but getting to use him effectively will 
not be easy, what with an unproven rotation and a weak offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Their three big pluses are Orestes Destrade (20 home runs, 87 RBIs), the only 
Marlin who hit more than 12 homers and drove in more than 80 runs; Gary 
Sheffield, who has moved from third base to right field, hit .292 with 20 
homers -- eight after he was acquired, and center fielder Chuck Carr, who led 
the league with 58 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Third baseman Dave Magadan, who starts the season on the disabled 
list; right-handed pitcher Mark Gardner, shortstop Kurt Abbott, first baseman 
Greg Colbrunn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Patience and a sense of humor to play in this division. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Very much of anything. CENTRAL DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSTON ASTROS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 85-77, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: With rookie Manager Terry Collins, this young team has the best 
chance to win the division title because of its good starting pitching, solid 
offense and good defense.  
</P>
<P>
 Doug Drabek and Greg Swindell, both flops last season, are too good not to 
come back, joining Pete Harnisch (16-9) and Darryl Kile (15-8). Closer Mitch 
Williams may give Collins a few ulcers, but will be good for 30-35 saves.  
</P>
<P>
 The infield of Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio, Andujar Cedeno and Ken Caminiti 
combined for 65 home runs last season. The outfield is strong, with left 
fielder Luis Gonzales, who hit .300 with 15 homers, and rookie right fielder 
James Mouton, who scored 126 runs at triple-A Tucson. * New faces: Mouton, 
Williams, reliever Mike Hampton. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Comebacks from Drabek and Swindell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Much bullpen depth.  
</P>
<P>
 ST. LOUIS CARDINALS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 finish: 87-75, third. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Had the pitching not collapsed last season, Manager Joe Torre could 
go into this season resting much easier. Bob Tewksbury has had shoulder 
stiffness recently, but the starting rotation is good, albeit inconsistent. 
Donovan Osborne, the No. 2 starter, is out for the season after shoulder 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the team has no weak links in the everyday lineup, and is deep on 
the bench. The offense is strong, with first baseman Gregg Jefferies coming off 
a .342 season and right fielder Mark Whiten coming off a 25-homer season. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Pitcher Rick Sutcliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Better defense. The Cardinals had 159 errors, fewer than only San 
Diego and Colorado. Also need an effective season from reliever Mike Perez.  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Catcher Tom Pagnozzi, who is out until May after knee surgery, 
and stopper Lee Smith, traded to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 CINCINNATI REDS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 season: 73-89, fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: It looks like more of the same for the Reds, and that's a shame, 
because without the distractions and injuries, their talent could put them in 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer Rod Dibble, who hasn't been able to find the strike zone, got upset 
with Manager Davey Johnson because he sent Dibble to a doctor. Dibble will 
start the season on the disabled list with tendinitis. Johnson's job is in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't win the first (game), I might not be here for the second one," 
Johnson joked, kind of. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullpen looks good and the starting rotation is solid, led by ace Jose 
Rijo. 
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Second baseman Bret Boone, pitchers Jeff Brantley, Erik Hanson 
and Chuck McElroy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A healthy Kevin Mitchell, especially with Chris Sabo gone to free 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: Bobby Kelly . . . Roberto Kelly is back. 
</P>
<P>
 CHICAGO CUBS 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 season: 84-78, fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: The Cubs still have Ryne Sandberg, Mark Grace and will again have 
Shawon Dunston, but even they will have a tough time playing behind a shaky 
pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Morgan, coming off a 10-15 season, is the opening-day starter. New 
Manager Tom Trebelhorn does have closer Randy Myers, who set a league record 
with 53 saves last season. Now, if only the starters and mid-relievers can keep 
the team in the game that long.  
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: Starting pitchers Willie Banks, Anthony Young, acquired from the 
Mets, and rookie Steve Trachsel, the Cubs' best pitcher this spring, and 
reliever Larry Luebbers.  
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: Optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: A lot to offer the best fans in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 PITTSBURGH PIRATES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 season: 75-87, fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: They have suspect pitching but they have Manager Jim Leyland, who 
is trying to rebuild the club for the second time. But even Leyland, who can 
get the most out of a staff, might not be able to pull this one off. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Pirates compiled a 4.77 ERA, the second-worst in the league 
and the franchise's most dismal performance in 40 years. The team was smart to 
volunteer to leave the East Division for the Central, but their pitching staff, 
and problems, remain.  
</P>
<P>
 * New faces: First baseman Brian Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Must have: A bullpen. The one that opens the season has 15 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't have: A lot of hope.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; MAKE IT TWILIGHT TIME FOR THE ZONE DEFENSE RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember the good old days when fans complained that nobody played defense in 
pro basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 Now NBA teams are barely averaging 100 points. The game has slowed to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the little rascal that did it: 
</P>
<P>
 Rule 12, Fouls and Penalties A Technical Foul Section I, Illegal Defenses 
Subsection 2, Defensive Coverage d. When an offensive player, with or without 
the ball, takes a position above the foul line, the defensive player may be no 
farther (toward the baseline) than the "middle defensive area." Defensive 
player(s) may enter and re-enter the "lower defensive area" as many times as 
desired, so long as he does not exceed 2.9 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one of 18 paragraphs spelling out the famous zone defense rules. It's 
not true that you have to be a lawyer to play this game, but even for a league 
run by law school graduates, it's a beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't understanding it, however. The problem is, it's strangling 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA, for those of you switching over from the NCAA tournament for a day, 
plays a form of basketball wherein a team's two stars set up on one side of the 
floor while three teammates park themselves outside the three-point line on the 
other, obliging their defenders, according to the zone rules, to stand near 
them, clearing the middle for stars A and B. 
</P>
<P>
 A -- someone like Shaquille O'Neal or Hakeem Olajuwon -- gets the ball in the 
post, easily because defenders can't double-team a player who doesn't have the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest proceeds mechanically. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense "doubles down" on A. A "kicks" it back to B -- or C at the top of 
the key or D on the other wing or E in the far corner. The defense "rotates" to 
the man with the ball. He "swings" it before the defense can rotate again for 
an open jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they're done, they've run 20 seconds off the clock. This is the 
reason scores are dropping each year while shooting accuracy increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer? Bring the three-point line in six or nine inches, throw out the 
zone rules and let teams play any defense they want. 
</P>
<P>
 The pros are already shooting 33%, the equivalent of 50% for two-pointers, 
from the present distance, 23 feet 9 inches. Moving them in will force defenses 
to guard them, keeping the middle clear. The game will become fluid again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much isolation," grumbles Larry Brown, whose Indiana Pacers 
recently averaged 87 points over a 12-game stretch -- while driving toward the 
franchise's best record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three-point line is too far. The lane is too narrow. We should go to 
international rules (with a conical lane and a 21-6 three-pointer) and let 
teams play. It's becoming a bump-and-grind game. People are jamming it in, 
holding and grabbing. It's hard to do anything, and then everybody ends up 
playing half-court." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Pete Newell, who coached NCAA and Olympic champions and now scouts for 
the Cleveland Cavaliers, "I think it's almost ludicrous. Here are the greatest 
players in the game and certainly the highest-paid coaches and they can't play 
the same game the rest of the world plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the same thing in football if they said you couldn't zone, which 
they do in all-star games. In the NBA, it's like we're always playing an 
all-star game. They take tactics and strategy out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say if you do that, it'll just be a jump-shooting game. What do they 
think they've got now with the double-down? 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'It's built on the star system. We've got to have the stars.' There 
are still going to be stars. I don't give a damn what you do, as long as you 
put a basket at one end and a basket at the other, Michael Jordan is going to 
dominate. But to contrive a game that takes away the tactics and strategy -- 
that's why a lot of people don't like to go to NBA games. They prefer college 
because there's an interesting aspect to it you don't really find in the NBA 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marketing is what the thing is. As long as you have a Jordan and a Magic 
Johnson, those kinds of players, you may have good arguments to change the 
rules, but nobody's listening. Now there aren't those kinds of attractions and 
they're finding out it's kind of an antiseptic game. Really, they've taken a 
good game and kind of cut an arm off it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago, I almost had enough support among the coaches to get it in 
and then the commissioner kind of kiboshed that. He doesn't want the coaches to 
talk about any rules." 
</P>
<P>
 They're talking again. They're right, too. WIZARD OF WESTWOOD, INDY, L.A., 
S.A. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Pacers win eight of their last 13, Brown will have pulled off the 
astounding feat of posting the franchise's best record -- for all six he has 
worked for. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also had two college jobs, taking UCLA to its last Final Four and 
winning Kansas' last NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's even more remarkable at Indiana. As Brown arrived, the Pacers were 
obliged to melt themselves down, trading free-agent-to-be Detlef Schrempf and 
his 19-point, nine-rebound average for Derrick McKey's 12-6. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, Brown will have been through his I-love-everyone-here phase and his 
trade-them-all phase and should be nearing his we've-gone-as-far-as-we-can 
with-this-nucleus phase in which he'll work out a three-team trade involving 
nine players. However, he now works for an old friend, General Manager Donnie 
Walsh, who is in charge of mellowing him out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Boston last week, someone asked if Brown was interested in the Bruins' 
assistant GM post after Mike Milbury went to Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown, smiling, "How much does it pay?" THE MACE IS BACK IN YOUR FACE 
</P>
<P>
 If you accept what your players think is their best, you will lose. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't accept their limits, you will lose. 
</P>
<P>
 If you allow them to tolerate any goal but victory, you will lose. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can do them all at the same time, you are Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite appearances, it wasn't his day trip to Reno or his new lineup that 
changed the Knicks from klutzes who lost four in a row without shooting 40% to 
winners of 15 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his greatest gift, his ability to keep them playing their hearts out. 
When you play for Riley, you always fight back, because the alternative is 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 They won the first nine on sheer defense, holding everyone under 90 points. 
Their swagger returned. Team president Dave Checketts said the league's new 
anti-mayhem rules had spooked them, but Charles Oakley is now one flagrant foul 
from the first suspension on points. Anthony Mason, who inspired that "Mace in 
Yo Face" banner, has dropped his new Mr. Nice Guy act. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's victory over Charlotte was a vintage near-brawl. Mason squared off 
with Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson. The Hornets were reduced to beating 
their chests in the dressing room to show they were tough, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost fair and square," Coach Alan Bristow said in a rare concession. "But 
some of these referees have to learn how to call Knick games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kenny Gattison: "You can't call every hold and grab. That's what they do. 
They grab, hold and talk crap the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mourning: "They've got to come back to Charlotte and they know it. That's 
definitely a win in our pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Riley if that isn't the sweetest music he has heard all season. WINNERS 
AND LOSERS 
</P>
<P>
 These updates from the NCAA tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Yinka Dare -- Coming out and headed for the lottery, simply for his awesome 
7-foot-1, 265-pound body. "I don't like him," a personnel director says. "He's 
not ready. He'll go No. 5 to 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Juwan Howard -- Says he is staying, but jumped from the low teens to the 5-7 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson -- Big Dog says he is staying. Someone might offer him one of 
those Magic Johnson pieces of ownership to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Rozier -- Real Dog was in the lottery, but showed little and didn't try 
hard, either. No word if he is coming out, but, on the other hand, who cares? 
</P>
<P>
 Jalen Rose -- Hard to get a handle on. Fine handler for 6-8, tough kid, step 
ups, but makes bad decisions. Probably in the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Reeves -- He was in the 20s when the tournament started. He might make 
the lottery now. 
</P>
<P>
 Donyell Marshall -- Disappointing in tournament games, but scouts still like 
him. No. 4 if he comes out. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Hill -- To know, know, know him is to love, love, love him. FACES AND 
FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Home is where(ever) the heart is: It's great that Dominique Wilkins is so 
enthusiastic about staying with the Clippers, talking Ron Harper into signing, 
and all. Of course, Wilkins' agent recently told the Clippers that if Wilkins 
doesn't get his price -- $21 million for three years -- he might try the 
Lakers. In New York on the last trip, Wilkins suggested 'Nique the Knick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm perfect for the Knicks," he said. "We could be scary. Right now they 
rotate the ball, Patrick (Ewing) out to (John) Starks. There's nobody else to 
hit the shot. . . . I might take less money. It just depends on the situation. 
I just want to play for a team that has a chance." No, the Knicks have no cap 
room, either. Like the Lakers, they could give him only a one-year deal at half 
his present $3.5-million salary. 
</P>
<P>
 You know you are in trouble when you are following someone named Mad Max: 
Olajuwon recently told Houston teammate Vernon Maxwell he was the team's 
emotional leader and urged him to assert himself. After that, Max was arrested 
for carrying a gun in his car. Then he was thrown out of a game in Sacramento, 
refused to leave, threw his gum at referee Joe Forte, tossed ice on the floor, 
was fined $10,000 by the league and forced Coach Rudy Tomjanovich to put in a 
rule against post-ejection tantrums. "We've worked too hard to make this a 
respectable basketball team," Tomjanovich said. "I don't want something like 
this to ever happen again." Comment: Obviously, the operative word was 
emotional, not leader . 
</P>
<P>
 Who's teaching whom what? Orlando Coach Brian Hill urged O'Neal to stop 
telling everyone how wonderful he was every time someone criticized him. Said 
Hill, "Shaq and I have talked about it. It's like, let's just work on winning 
basketball games and forget all the personal woofing." A few days before, 
noting O'Neal's faint MVP support, Hill had said, "The only thing I can point 
to is jealousy." After their talk, O'Neal warmed up for the Knick game by 
saying of Ewing: "He claims he's the man, but he knows the deal."(MORE)

NBA ROUNDUP; BLUE-COLLAR BONNER AIDS KNICKS IN NO. 15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The victory was their 15th in a row, which tied Houston's 15-0 start for the 
season's longest winning streak, and symbolic of the New York Knicks' play was 
that of Anthony Bonner. 
</P>
<P>
 He missed eight of nine shots, most from near the basket, in their 110-87 rout 
of Miami at New York, but he led the Knicks with 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pat Riley made certain everybody took notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the quintessential role player," Riley said of Bonner, who has started 
each of the 15 games during the streak. "He took four or five charges, got 
three or four loose balls and all those rebounds. It's incredible what he has 
given us the last 15 games. If there's ever a player that epitomizes how we 
play, it's Anthony Bonner." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also Charles Oakley, who had 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Patrick 
Ewing, who had 15 points, 11 rebounds and six blocks.  
</P>
<P>
 The common thread is the Knicks' defensive play, The Heat is the 11th opponent 
to be held below 90 points during the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have the best team and the best defense in the NBA right now," 
Miami Coach Kevin Loughery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Miner scored 15 points and John Salley 14 for the Heat, which played 
without leading scorer Glen Rice, who was suffering from flu, leading rebounder 
Rony Seikaly, who has a sprained right ankle. Miami fell from sixth place to 
eighth in the Eastern Conference, but the Heat still has a five-game lead over 
Charlotte for the last playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 101, Denver 91 -- Karl Malone scored 31 points and had 12 rebounds at 
Salt Lake City as the Jazz won for only the third time in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek scored 17 points in a reserve role for the Jazz, who gained the 
lead for good in the second quarter, then held off a handful of Denver rallies. 
Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf paced Denver with 19 points, and Nugget center Dikembe 
Mutombo had 14 points and 16 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 128, Orlando 113 -- Reggie Miller, Haywoode Workman and the Pacers all 
had season highs in a victory over the Magic at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made all 15 of his free throws and scored a season-high 38 points. 
Workman, who played 37 minutes after Vern Fleming suffered a cut on his lower 
lip after Shaquille O'Neal fell on him, had 15 assists. Indiana's previous 
season high for points was 126, scored in victories over New Jersey and the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rik Smits had 26 points as Indiana overcame a 33-point, 15 rebound effort by 
O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 95, Dallas 88 -- John (Hot Rod) Williams led a fourth-quarter rally 
with six of his 23 points at Dallas, where the Cavaliers handed the Mavericks 
their 17th consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who also had 18 rebounds, scored six consecutive points as the 
Cavaliers opened the fourth quarter with a 12-4 run, improving a one-point lead 
after three quarters to 82-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price scored 16 of his 24 points in the first half for the Cavaliers, who 
have won four of their last five. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 104, Milwaukee 96 -- The Bullets got 29 points and 10 rebounds from 
Don MacLean and defeated the Bucks at Landover, Md., for their first winning 
streak since January. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 117, Charlotte 111 -- David Robinson scored 24 points and Dennis 
Rodman had 20 rebounds and a career-best eight assists at San Antonio, where 
the Spurs never trailed en route to their sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 119, Golden State 109 -- Sam Perkins led a game-breaking rally with 
six points and Shawn Kemp scored a season-high 32 points at Seattle as the 
SuperSonics won their eighth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mullin led the Warriors with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics had 20 steals and forced the Warriors into a season-high 31 
turnovers, which Seattle converted into 36 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 102, Minnesota 87 -- Wayman Tisdale scored 15 of his 24 points in 
the first quarter as the Kings took an early lead and cruised past the 
Timberwolves at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings snapped their six-game losing streak and won for only the second 
time in their last nine home games. Minnesota lost its fifth in a row.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S AND WOMEN'S FINAL FOURS; STRUGGLING PARKS 
WEIGHS MATTERS, DELIVERS BIG; DUKE: CENTER SCORES PIVOTAL BASKET ON PUTBACK 
AFTER FINALLY OVERCOMING 6-FOOT-6, 300-POUND DAMETRI HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Duke's Cherokee Parks is the first to acknowledge that Florida's Dametri Hill 
dominated him for the first 24 minutes of Saturday's NCAA semifinal game. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was going for a rebound or stopping a shot, Parks had a difficult 
time trying to keep a 6-foot-6, 300-pound mass away from the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks knew how much Hill was controlling the inside at the 18-minute mark of 
the second half with Duke trailing, 45-32. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was giving me fits up to that point because of his big body and the way he 
worked inside," said Parks, a 6-11 junior from Huntington Beach. "Instead of 
playing behind him, I was trying to avoid him and slip around, but he was just 
too big. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny because when I first saw him on the court, he was shorter than I 
had expected. But, he was every bit as round as I had thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, who scored only five points in the first half and had missed four of 
his first seven shots, knew that in order for the Blue Devils to keep their 
season alive, he would have to try to contain Hill, who already had 12 points 
and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next five minutes, Parks revived himself, and the Blue Devils.  
</P>
<P>
 He shut down Hill, scored four points and had four rebounds as Duke closed 
within 53-50 with 12:48 remaining. It wasn't until the game was was down to a 
pivotal moment that Parks made his best play.  
</P>
<P>
 With Duke holding a one-point lead with 15 seconds remaining, Parks rebounded 
his own missed shot to score to give the Blue Devils a 68-65 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Jeff (Capel) driving, so I moved to an open area," Parks said. "Once he 
passed it to me I knew that I had to shoot because the shot clock was going 
down. But as soon as I shot it, I knew it wasn't going in so I moved to the 
basket where the ball rolled off the rim right to me. I was fortunate to be 
there and was able to put it back in." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks' play forced Florida to hurry to get the ball upcourt, where the Gators' 
Dan Cross was called for charging into Duke's Antonio Lang to seal the game 
with 10.8 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for us was that we didn't panic and start throwing up bad shots when 
we got down by 13," said Parks, who finished with 11 points and 11 rebounds. 
"We were struggling at times, but we knew that we had a lot of time left. We 
just had to settle down and not get caught up running up and down the floor 
like we did early in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks also knew that with roommate Grant Hill on his side, things could turn 
around. Hill had a game-high 25 points, six rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had them on the ropes, but there was a lot of basketball game left," said 
Dametri Hill, who had 16 points and nine rebounds. "We felt good, but we felt 
that we had to keep doing what we were doing. Duke is a very good basketball 
team that made the plays when they needed." 
</P>
<P>
 An advantage for Duke down the stretch was its Final Four experience. Parks, 
Lang and Grant Hill all played major roles on the Blue Devils' national 
championship team of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Their leadership helped give confidence to Duke's younger players such as 
freshman Capel and sophomore Chris Collins.  
</P>
<P>
 Capel, who made only three of 10 shots, gave Duke a 65-63 lead with 2:31 
remaining with a three-point basket only seconds after he had committed a 
costly turnover. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff's shot was probably the biggest one of the game," Parks said. "What made 
it so special is that he had just thrown the ball away and had not really been 
hitting for most of the game. But he knew that we had confidence in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the thing with this team that I think makes it so good. We have just 
the right combination of experienced players who have been here before along 
with our younger guys."

 Alabama seemed to lose its momentum when Niesa Johnson, the team's floor 
leader, cut her right hand hitting a faucet in the locker room at 
halftime.Seven stitches were needed to close the cut and she missed the first 4 
1/2 minutes of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right at the start of the second half, I couldn't feel my fingers, but it 
started coming along fairly quickly," Johnson said. "I would not have played in 
a normal situation."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; THERE'S DEFINITELY MORE ROOM AT THE TOP IN 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Twenty-three teams won division titles in the 25 years the American and 
National leagues were in that alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Be it parity or parody, only Texas, Seattle and Cleveland have failed to reach 
the playoffs, excluding Florida and Colorado, which debuted in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 season begins tonight amid the dark cloud of another potentially 
bitter labor negotiation between owners and players and the brighter promise of 
even wider and deeper competition in the six realigned divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight teams, including the six division winners and the team with the next 
best record in each league, will advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in baseball remain concerned over possible dilution of the 162-game 
regular season because of wild cards and four-team divisions, but the broader 
perspective is one of enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that it involves more cities and more teams and gives more 
players and fans a reason to come to the park in August and September," said 
Hal McRae, Kansas City Royals' manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the excitement expansion created in Denver and Miami. The game needs 
it. This may even create some new rivalries. It was a good move, a smart move. 
You have to change with the times."  
</P>
<P>
 McRae's Royals are moving from the AL West to the AL Central They will still 
be hounded by the Chicago White Sox, who are making the same move. 
</P>
<P>
 John Schuerholz, general manager of the Atlanta Braves, who are moving from NL 
West to East, said he endorsed the new structure on the basis that 54% of 
12,000 fans polled by baseball favored it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a clear preference, so I say, 'good, let's give it a try,' and I 
say that as a staunch traditionalist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude is one of willingness to see how it works, to see if it creates 
excitement for the fans, to see it it gives a fresh lift and look to the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only look at the geography, all the clubs are basically where they 
should be now. On the other hand, the alignment is something of a moot point, 
in that you still play as many games out of your division as in it." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Pat Gillick's Toronto Blue Jays will be seeking a fourth 
consecutive title in the AL East, which changed only to the extent that 
Cleveland moved to the AL Central. Of that change, Gillick said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was evident by the survey this is what the public wanted, and we're in the 
entertainment business. But personally, I don't like it. The emphasis should be 
on the regular season, and this has the potential to take away from that with a 
diluted playoff in which a second-place team can go to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 162-game season is an endurance test that has always set baseball apart 
from the other sports. The winning teams should advance directly to the league 
championship (rather than playing a best-of-five-game preliminary embracing a 
wild card)." 
</P>
<P>
 However, with only eight of 28 teams advancing, the baseball playoff is still 
a closed affair compared to 16 of 26 in the NHL, 16 of 27 in the NBA and 12 of 
28 in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition is one thing, but time, dimensions and demographics change. Joe 
Torre, the St. Louis Cardinals' manager, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the greatest sport in the world, as far as I'm concerned. I liked 
having one team win, that's the best way, but you can't do it anymore. There 
are too many teams, and you have to find a way to keep more involved later in 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing about baseball, though, is the game on the field is still the same. 
Football is always changing its rules, even its point totals, and the way 
basketball is going they might have to raise the rim to 15 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to change baseball. It's still the same game we played as 
kids. It's still pure." TOUGHEST DIVISION 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be no automatic winner in any of the six divisions, no 
clear-cut evidence one team or another got the best of realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The AL West becomes a four-team scramble with the White Sox's departure, 
and the NL West becomes a Dodgers-Giants dogfight without the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago can dominate the AL Central with its pitching, but faces a sleeper 
in Cleveland, happy to be out of the AL East, just as Houston and Cincinnati, 
happy to be out of the NL West, suddenly become the Central favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Competition is probably deepest in the AL East, where all five teams have a 
shot. But the NL East might be toughest of the tough, considering it features 
three of the top five winners of 1993: 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Division champion Braves, 104 regular-season victories and two 
more in the postseason; the defending Eastern Division champion Philadelphia 
Phillies, 97 regular-season victories and six more in the postseason, and the 
young, restless and talented Montreal Expos, runners-up in the East with 94 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher than the West of '93? 
</P>
<P>
 Schuerholz, the Braves GM, shook his head and said: "How can it be? We had to 
win 104 games to beat the Giants. We had to play like gangbusters from the 
All-Star break on, feeling we couldn't stub our toe even once. I don't see how 
the Phillies and Expos could be tougher than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta, of course, isn't the same team. Ron Gant and Otis Nixon are gone. Can 
Tony Tarasco, Ryan Klesko and Mike Kelly fill the vacuum left by Gant? Can 
Deion Sanders replace the catalytic Nixon over a full season? Can Javier Lopez, 
baseball's top catching prospect, handle that veteran pitching staff and hit as 
well as he did in the minors? 
</P>
<P>
 Can Manager Bobby Cox continue to ride the hottest horse, looking for saves 
from Mike Stanton, Greg McMichael and Mark Wohlers while Gregg Olson, signed as 
a free agent, rehabilitates his elbow on the disabled list? 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Fred McGriff from the start of the season and with Lopez giving us 
more offense as the catcher, with Kent Mercker as the fifth starter and with 
Olson likely to be our eventual closer, we might be better than we've been in 
the past," Schuerholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to try and win 100 games again, and with our starting pitching, 
there's no question we have the ability to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Braves aren't intimidated going head to head with the team that upset 
them in the NL playoff, the Phillies can muster similar bravado despite 
question marks of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're equal to the task. I think they're as concerned with us as we 
are with them," General Manager Lee Thomas said. "I think it will force us to 
stay at our best." 
</P>
<P>
 With Terry Mulholland traded to the Yankees, Ben Rivera, who had 13 victories 
as the No. 5 starter, steps up to No. 4, and Jeff Juden, acquired from Houston 
with reliever Doug Jones, gets first crack at No. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kruk is receiving radiation after surgery for testicular cancer and Wes 
Chamberlain is recovering from knee surgery. But both might be ready by the 
April 11 home opener. Norm Charlton, signed as a bargain free agent in the 
midst of a long rehabilitation from elbow surgery, could be ready by May to 
help "Mild Thing" Jones replace the 43 saves of "Wild Thing" Mitch Williams, 
now with Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies led the majors in runs last year, maybe in chemistry, too. Both 
will be difficult to duplicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was expecting us to win last year. That was the hard part," Manager 
Jim Fregosi said. "If we stay healthy, we can win again. We won a total of 103 
games last year. It takes a pretty good club to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Off last year, three of the five toughest clubs in baseball are now in this 
division, but you can't harp on that. Win enough games to get to the postseason 
and anything can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies have proven that to the Braves once already. WARHORSE'S VIEW 
</P>
<P>
 The '94 season will be played against the backdrop of the owners' attempt to 
impose a salary cap. Marvin Miller, the founding father and former executive 
director of the players union, questions whether a salary cap is an issue the 
union has the authority to collectively discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recognition clause (in the bargaining agreement) gives the union the 
right to serve as a bargaining agent only for the minimum salary, nothing above 
that," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't act as the bargaining representative for all salaries above the 
minimum, which, in effect, it would be doing since a salary cap establishes an 
overall level of compensation, even though individual salaries would still be 
negotiated between the player and his club. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union, in my view, has the right to say it isn't the bargaining 
representative on all issues, a salary cap being one of them. It has the right 
to say, 'We decline to discuss that, next subject please.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Don Fehr said there are too many other critical issues to 
delve into the legalities of the recognition clause at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that the union is unlikely to approve a cap, period.

 What was supposed to be a coming-out party for baseball -- divisions 
realigned, playoffs revised, opening day given new prominence -- has became 
just another controversy involving Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott's Reds eagerly volunteered to play the St. Louis Cardinals in the first 
Sunday night opener on ESPN, then made a fuss when she learned a team oversight 
meant there could be no pregame parade. 
</P>
<P>
 She tried too late to renege on her commitment, then blamed the network and 
major league baseball for everything. Finally, she decided to snub the game, 
pretending it didn't count. There will be a parade before Game 2 on Monday, 
which is designated as the opener on the Reds' schedule. 
</P>

 "ESPN and major league baseball will have their opening day Sunday night," she 
said. "The Reds' opener is Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a special opening night," ESPN senior vice president Loren 
Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is special in several ways, notwithstanding Schott. Len Coleman gets to 
throw out the ceremonial first pitch, his first act as National League 
president. The game will be the first between teams in the new NL Central 
Division.

 The Toronto Blue Jays put bullpen stopper Duane Ward on the 15-day disabled 
list retroactive to March 25. Ward has been bothered by bicep tendinitis since 
reporting to spring training in late February. Todd Stottlemyre is expected to 
be the stopper until Ward returns.

 Shortstop Jeff Blauser and rookie left fielder Tony Tarasco will not be in the 
starting lineup when Atlanta opens the season Monday at San Diego because of 
injuries sustained during the final week of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Blauser bruised the ring finger on his throwing hand Friday on a bad-hop 
grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not broken, but it's swollen real bad," Manager Bobby Cox said. "The way 
it looks now, I don't think he'll play in the opener." 
</P>
<P>
 If not, Blauser will be replaced by Rafael Belliard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarasco strained his right thigh muscle last week against Dodgers. Cox said he 
wants to rest Tarasco until he's 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rookie, Ryan Klesko, will replace Tarasco in left.

 Former Dodger Pedro Martinez yielded one hit and struck out eight in five 
innings, including the first six batters, as Montreal defeated Colorado, 2-1, 
in an exhibition game at Vancouver, Canada.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; FREEWAY SERIES; ANGELS MAKE IT OFFICIAL AND SEND SNOW 
TO VANCOUVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Outfielder Dwight Smith completed a workout before Saturday night's game 
against the Dodgers at Anaheim Stadium and said his strained calf muscle "felt 
real good." As a result, the Angels optioned first baseman J.T. Snow to the 
club's triple-A affiliate in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was not official until the Angels made the announcement at 8:30 
Saturday night, but Snow, who said last week that he hoped to be traded, seemed 
resigned to his fate before Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the trade rumors started three weeks ago, it was kind of mind-boggling, 
but now. . . ." Snow said. "It's just that I don't think I have anything left 
to prove in triple A." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow hit .313 with triple-A Columbus in the Yankees' organization in 1992 and 
.340 with Vancouver last season. He became the odd man out when the Angels 
decided Eduardo Perez' tender elbow would not hold up for a season in the 
outfield and switched him to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they wanted to get 500 at-bats for Eddie and that would have to be 
at first," Snow said. "I have nothing against Eddie and I hope he's a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I was American League player of the week twice last year and one of the 
best defensive first basemen in the league. I came back strong at the end of 
last season, worked my tail off during the offseason and this all is just hard 
to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, 26, hit .241 with 16 home runs and 57 RBIs in 129 games last season. He 
hit .208 with one homer and five RBIs this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 What can he do in Vancouver to convince the Angels to recall him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, when there's a guy ahead of you, if he plays well and doesn't get 
hurt, there's nothing you can do," Manager Buck Rodgers said. "He just has to 
go down there and do the best he can and keep his trade value up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Bill Bavasi said Saturday night that the Angels will not make 
just any deal to accommodate Snow's wish to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he's a very talented player with a bright future and we don't want 
to just throw that away," Bavasi said. "We'll proceed on a daily basis to try 
and improve the club and we'll listen to offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow is a quality player and there will be options, but right now, we think 
the best thing for him is to play every day." 
</P>

 The Dodgers released infielder Mike Sharperson from his minor league contract.

 One man's view of the realigned races: 
</P>
<P>
 NATIONAL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 * West: 1. Dodgers; 2. San Francisco; 3. Colorado; 4. San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment: It doesn't make sense to pick against the Giants, unless you assume 
that Darryl Strawberry will avoid the DL and IRS, and Chan Ho Park will 
eventually move into the rotation to become the big-time stopper the Dodgers 
lack. 
</P>
<P>
 * Central: 1. Houston; 2. Cincinnati; 3. Chicago; 4. St. Louis; 5. Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment: Owner Drayton McLane is the key. A budding Steinbrenner, he needs 
to butt out and let the Astros find their way under Manager Terry Collins 
before prematurely deciding to trade the high-salaried Doug Drabek or Greg 
Swindell. Don't count on it. The Astros let Mark Portugal leave as a free agent 
and virtually gave away setup man Xavier Hernandez to the Yankees and 
outfielder Eric Anthony to the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 * East: 1. Atlanta; 2. Montreal; 3. Philadelphia; 4. Florida; 5. New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment: The Braves have a new catcher, left fielder and center fielder, but 
Fred McGriff will be at first base from the first day, and the rotation still 
includes Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Steve Avery. Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wild Card: Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 AMERICAN LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 * West: 1. Seattle; 2. Texas; 3. Angels; 4. Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment: A four-deep rotation of Randy Johnson, Chris Bosio, Dave Fleming 
and Greg Hibbard is the difference for the Mariners, providing Bobby Ayala 
(7-10, 5.60 ERA at Cincinnati) can save enough games. The Seattle outfield 
might generate 100 home runs, with former Astro Anthony joining Ken Griffey and 
Jay Buhner. 
</P>
<P>
 * Central: 1. Chicago; 2. Cleveland; 3. Kansas City; 4. Minnesota; 5. 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment: Former Angel Scott Sanderson is the fifth starter for the White 
Sox, but it should hardly matter after Jack McDowell, Wilson Alvarez, Alex 
Fernandez and Jason Bere get through. There's a lot of optimism in Cleveland, 
but with two 38-year-olds in the rotation, Jack Morris and Dennis Martinez, 
pragmatism might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * East: 1. Toronto; 2. New York; 3. Baltimore; 4. Boston; 5. Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Comment: Duane Ward's delicate shoulder is a major concern, but the Blue 
Jays always find a way to win, though the competition runs deep. The Yankees, 
Orioles and Red Sox are all improved. The Blue Jays will have to prove they 
haven't regressed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wild Card: New York.

GOLF / DAN HAFNER; SHE'S HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME KEEPING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life is really pretty easy on the professional golf tours, especially on the 
Senior PGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the golfers have to play only three rounds in a tournament, 
they are met at the airport, they get a fancy car to drive, they stay at nice 
hotels and there is plenty of money to be made. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it is for last year's player of the year, Dave Stockton. His 
life, compared to his wife Cathy's, is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 She spends more time reading airline schedules than an avid reader does a 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Stockton has her husband on the senior tour. One son, David, 25, is on 
the regular PGA Tour. Another son, Ron, 23, plays on the University of Redlands 
golf team. Trying to keep tabs on all three has Cathy flying in circles. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time their sons or daughters are old enough for anything beyond Little 
League or Pop Warner, most sports fathers are no longer competing. Not so in 
golf. In fact, Dave Stockton's career is peaking just as his sons are 
beginning.  
</P>
<P>
 "I try to lend moral support for all my men," Cathy said. "Trying to figure it 
all out has become difficult since David made it through qualifying school last 
fall. That changed everything." 
</P>
<P>
 The best week so far was at the AT&T at Pebble Beach. The whole family was 
there and in the same foursome. Cathy, a pretty good golfer herself, was Ron's 
caddie. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could all be like that it would be perfect," she said. "It was the 
first time for me to be inside the ropes. I enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 This year she has attended three senior events, including the Tradition this 
week, all four regular tour events in California and the Division III NCAA 
tournament in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where Ron finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't really a change in my life," Cathy said, "it's just more hectic. The 
boys were out on the road with us since they were 3 weeks old. When they became 
school age, we found a wonderful woman who took care of them when I joined Dave 
on tour. Dave and I tried to make sure we never were apart more than two weeks 
at a time." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were exposed to all sports and each summer they joined their parents 
on the road. They seemed to love it. By the time David was 14 he knew he wanted 
to be a professional golfer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We exposed them, but never pushed them," Cathy said. "David was still at USC 
when he said he wanted to turn pro. We held a family meeting and decided that 
was the right move. That's when life started to get hectic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been tough following Dave around and suffering when he had 
problems, but the regular tour is something else now. 
</P>
<P>
 "When David first went to qualifying school, it was a revelation. There were 
all those older men, married and with kids, still trying to qualify. To me it 
was amazing that David made it on the fourth try last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm lucky that I love golf, because it is really tough on the regular 
tour. Fortunately, David made the cut in all the California tournaments except 
the Hope. But the pressure there is terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really felt good to get back to the Senior tour here at the Tradition. For 
one thing, there's no cut. Also, it's a more relaxed atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, with Ron serving as caddie for Dave because it's spring break, only 
David is on his own, in New Orleans, where he missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew there would be a year like this," Cathy said. "For a family 
that's always done things together, it sometimes gets difficult. For the rest 
of the year, I'll mostly join David for Thursday and Friday rounds. If he 
misses the cut and it's possible, I will rush to the senior tour. Sometimes, 
even if he makes the cut, I'll join Dave. I'll also have to find time for Ron's 
college events. It would be easier, if like Ray Floyd, Dave was able to play on 
both tours." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy, who is from Redlands, near the family's present home in Mentone, and 
Dave met in 1964 on a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave was still at USC and he lived in San Bernardino," Cathy said. "Our 
parents knew each other and that's why the first date. A month later I was 
pinned. We already knew we wanted to marry. It's been a wonderful life, but 
lately I haven't found much time to get any work done at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Dave needed some fishing time and had to go to Palmilla in Los 
Cabos, Mexico, the club he represents. While there he broke the club record 
with a 67. The record he broke was David's 69. Then Dave and Cathy went 
fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing things together is an idea we had from the start," Cathy said. "We 
always hunted, fished and golfed together. I caught some fish, too." Golf Notes

SENIOR GOLF / THE TRADITION; FLOYD SITS WELL, BUT SO DOES COLBERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news for the Senior PGA Tour is that Raymond Floyd plans to 
concentrate on the older golf circuit. The bad news is that he might take over 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time he tees up in the 50-and over set, he automatically becomes the 
favorite. About half the time he is either first or second. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the $850,000 Tradition, being contested on the 6,869-yard Desert 
Mountain Cochise course, is not an exception for Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 After building a four-shot lead at one point Saturday, Floyd settled for a 
four-under-par 68, a 54-hole total of 203 and a one-stroke lead over Jim 
Colbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert, barely missing an eagle on No. 18, also had a 68 for 204. Another 
shot behind was Dale Douglass, who birdied the last three holes for a 69 and 
205. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Coody, co-leader after 36 holes, was at 206 with a 71. Gibby Gilbert, 
the other co-leader, double bogeyed the first hole, never recovered and shot a 
one-over 73. He is with five others at eight under par. At 209 is Isao Aoki, 
four shots behind Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend in the seniors this year has been for a big come-from-behind victory 
on the final day.  
</P>
<P>
 It happened to Floyd in his previous senior event, the GTE Suncoast at Naples, 
Fla. Floyd shot a final-round 66, but Rocky Thompson shot a senior-record 61 to 
win by a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Floyd's 23rd senior tournament. Instead of his sixth victory, it was 
the sixth time Floyd finished second. He has a chance for his 12th top-two 
position in 24 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd faltered on the last hole Saturday, a 531-yard par-five reachable in 
two. Instead of a birdie, he had a bogey. His first poor drive of the 
tournament sailed to the right into the desert. He hit a provisional ball also 
into the desert. Luckily, he found the first one, so it cost him only one 
stroke when he took an unplayable lie. A lost ball would have cost him two 
strokes. As it was, he still almost chipped in for what would have been an 
amazing par. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I played better than a 68," Floyd said. "After a poor second shot on 
No. 3 led to my first bogey of the week, I played rather well. 
</P>
<P>
 "On both 15 and 17, I had putts that would have gone in except for the paint 
they use on the cups so they can be seen on TV. Late in the day it hardens. 
Both putts would have been in otherwise. I guess the answer is to putt the ball 
into the center of the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd said he felt good about the way he was playing.  
</P>
<P>
 "I will go out and shoot the best I can," he said. "I have no control over 
anybody else. Someone could come along and shoot like Rocky did, but I'll take 
my chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Colbert has had his own experience at losing to a hot finisher. In 1991, he 
led this tournament by five shots. But Jack Nicklaus, wiping out a 36-hole 
deficit of 12 strokes, beat him by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 An even worse experience for Colbert was last month at Ojai. Jay Sigel, 
trailing by 10 shots going into the final round, rallied to tie Colbert and won 
on the fourth playoff hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you trail Raymond Floyd in the last round, you can't feel too 
confident," Colbert said. "A bad round for Floyd here would be a 69 or 70. So, 
if he plays his normal game, it will be tough beating him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Littler, 63, shot a one-over 73 for a 216 total to beat Don January by 
one shot in the super senior event. He won $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his third victory in 60-and-over competition this spring.

LILLEY NO WILTING FLOWER WHEN IT COMES TO HITTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He ran amok for seven games, hitting everyone in sight and looking very much 
like the red-devil-with-hockey-stick tattoo on his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 John Lilley made friends quickly with the Mighty Ducks, his feisty style 
making him seem larger than his 5-foot-9, 170-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one thing missing -- his first NHL goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, in his eighth big-league game, it happened. Against the Toronto 
Maple Leafs. On Hockey Night in Canada. In front of 17,174 at The Pond of 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 David Williams slipped a cross-ice pass through a tangle of bodies and onto 
Lilley's stick. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilley, alone in front of Maple Leaf goalie Damian Rhodes, didn't miss with a 
backhander. 
</P>
<P>
 It came at the 4:37 mark of the third period and proved to be the game-winner 
in the Ducks' 3-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not mean anything to John, but it came on a national telecast all 
across Canada," Coach Ron Wilson said. "It's like Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't get Hockey Night in Canada in Wakefield, Mass., Lilley's hometown, 
but he hoped his folks were watching on the satellite dish at the home of 
teammate Joe Sacco's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, well, Lilley, 21, has a compelling story next time he phones home. For 
keepsakes, he had a score sheet, which he promptly folded in half. And, of 
course, the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Randy Ladouceur picked it up for me, but I don't know where it is right now," 
said Lilley, a member of the 1994 U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, equipment manager Mark O'Neill handed it over. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a great play on it," Lilley said of Williams' pass that set up the 
goal. "I was standing alone in front and I got it up a little bit and 
fortunately it went in the net." 
</P>
<P>
 With his first goal out of the way, Lilley can return to basics.  
</P>
<P>
 "He plays the game hard," linemate Garry Valk said. "A lot of kids when they 
come in are timid right off the bat. But he's banging and working hard. He's a 
small guy but he plays the game big." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "He's very quick and in your face. He hits everything that moves 
and I think the rest of the guys feed off that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lilley dismissed comparisons to Tony Granato and Mike Donnelly of the Kings. 
But it's clear from his play that, like Granato and Donnelly, he isn't willing 
to back down despite his size. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be in awe of guys I've watched my whole life," Lilley said. "(Playing 
a physical game) is what I have to do to be effective. I'm not going out there 
and (float) around the net." 
</P>
<P>
 And about the tattoo? 
</P>
<P>
 "A stupid thing I did a few years ago," he said.

MIKE PENNER: MOVIE REVEALS DISNEY ISN'T PRACTICING WHAT IT PREACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There are two great evils in the world today, according to the makers of "D2: 
The Mighty Ducks," and I'm not quite sure which is worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Runaway commercialism in sports? 
</P>
<P>
 Or those darned Icelanders? 
</P>
<P>
 This may come as news as you pull on your official Mighty Ducks Tie-Dye Shorts 
(list price: $24), button your official Mighty Ducks Hydrowash Jacket (list 
price: $205) and dress up little Suzie in her official Mighty Ducks Toddler Jog 
Suit (list price: $22) and official Mighty Ducks Hair Twistie (list price: $8), 
so you'd better hold on to your official Mighty Ducks Two-Tone Wool Cap ("As 
seen on Michael Eisner at Mighty Ducks press conference;" list price: $20), 
because the story I am about to retell is true. 
</P>
<P>
 "D2" is the second sequel to "The Mighty Ducks," the insanely profitable 1992 
Disney kids' movie that also spawned the 1993-94 professional hockey team. 
Emilio Estevez is back as the Toe Blake of pee-wee hockey, as are the eponymous 
rink rats of the original, this time bidding to win the championship of the 
Junior Goodwill Games and rid the sport of avarice and greed, sermonizing while 
they work. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one heavy message, especially as it is delivered between Estevez's 
clarion call to the troops on a Mighty Ducks whistle (list price: $10) and a 
post-victory campfire sing-along rendition of Queen's "We Are The Champions," 
(catalogue rights owned by the Walt Disney Co.) 
</P>
<P>
 Estevez, as the ever-reluctant Coach Gordon Bombay, is lured into reassembling 
the Ducks only when he is approached by a greasy businessman, played by Michael 
Tucker, who entices Bombay with an obscenely huge endorsement contract. How 
obscenely huge we never know, but judging from Bombay's jaw-dropping reaction, 
it's presumed to be in the vicinity of what Paul Kariya is asking for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sell you, you sell the sport, we both get rich," the greasy Mr. Tibbles 
hisses into Bombay's ear as they conspire in the back seat of a stretch limo. 
"Gordon, life can be great when you know the right people." 
</P>
<P>
 So, of course, Gordon signs and sells his soul. His crimes against the purity 
of the game are, in rough order of severity, slicking his hair like Pat Riley, 
trading his letterman's jacket for Armani, moving into a beachside condo, 
attending catered parties and sharing two scoops of Haagen-Dazs with the comely 
female trainer of the Iceland team. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, this sounds like the standard profile for the Orange County Mighty Duck 
season-ticket holder, but in the eyes of the young Ducks, their coach has 
strayed. It is up to them to bring him back to the fold, make him see the light 
. . . and purge us all of the Icelandic menace presently threatening our 
shores. 
</P>
<P>
 Iceland, Evil Empire. It has to be tough casting villains in 1994, what with 
the Soviet Union no longer available and Japan not much for penalty-killing. 
But Iceland? Did they lose a coin flip with Denmark? Are they saving France for 
"D3: EuroDisney Strikes Back?" 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, the role of Public Enemy No. 1 in "D2" goes to a tiny 
knob of volcanic rock bobbing in the Norwegian Sea -- with a population half 
the size of Memphis, but, apparently, many hulking, brooding sinister right 
wingers named Gunnar and Olaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black from head to toe, Team Iceland pummels the scrappy Ducks in 
an early-round matchup, giving Bombay and Iceland Coach Wolf (The Dentist) 
Stansson, a kind of Drago on skates, numerous chances to scowl at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 As you might expect, the Ducks do regroup for a scintillating, climactic 
rematch -- and what a group it is. Goldberg the goalie works in his dad's 
kosher delicatessen. Mendoza, a recruit from South Miami, takes the ice to 
Latin music. Robertson is a lasso-twirlin' cowpoke. Ken Wu is a transplanted 
Korean figure skater. Tyler is a trash-talkin' walk-on from inner-city Los 
Angeles. Team Iceland, meet Team Baskin Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also two girls on these Ducks, one a goalie from Bangor, Maine, and 
this is where "D2" lapses into preposterous fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 In real life, players from Maine do get drafted by the Mighty Ducks, but never 
play for them. 
</P>
<P>
 All hope appears lost until the bedraggled Ducks pay a visit to South-Central, 
where a tough-looking group of locals, decked out in very expensive roller 
hockey gear, challenges them to a game of "schoolyard puck." There are now kids 
living in Iowa, who, after seeing "D2," believe this to be an everyday 
occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the Ducks learn some slick moves, Wu the figure skater is taught how to 
drop the gloves and a brotherhood is forged -- with police helicopters 
chirping, sirens blaring and dogs barking in the background for added effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Switch scenes to clean, pristine Anaheim, palm trees waving outside the 
glorious Pond, a veritable oasis, and site of the championship finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the Ducks look overmatched. They are down. They are out. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, Bombay breaks out new uniforms. Real Mighty Duck of Anaheim 
uniforms, purple, green and white uniforms. Lose the ratty red, white and blue, 
guys. Get rid of that tired U S A logo, too. You're playing for a higher entity 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 And kids in the theater, pay close attention to what happens when our boys and 
girls don the official colors of the Mighty Duck. In those jerseys, wondrous 
things happen. Magic happens. 
</P>
<P>
 List price: $69.

SANTA ANITA; NAKATANI SUFFERS BROKEN ANKLE WHEN HORSE TRIES TO JUMP RAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Corey Nakatani will be sidelined for about eight weeks after suffering a 
broken right ankle in a spill during the sixth race at Santa Anita on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding Flying Marfa, a 3-year-old maiden who was making his second start, 
Nakatani was injured when the gray gelding tried to jump the rail while tiring 
inside the sixteenth pole. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, 23, hit the rail, then bounced off the protective nylon over the 
drainage ditch inside the rail. A splint was placed on his leg almost 
immediately, and he was taken to Arcadia Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the most serious injury suffered by Nakatani, who has been riding 
since late 1988. He is tied with Chris Antley for fifth in the Santa Anita 
standings with 53 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Owners John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery and trainer Paco Gonzalez don't need to 
run Bien Bien on the main track anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 They found out Saturday that Del Mar Dennis can hold his own against stakes 
horses on dirt, so Bien Bien, the stable star, can stick to the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Making only his sixth start and second in a stake, Del Mar Dennis, the 
4-year-old Dixieland Band gelding, rallied from midpack to beat Hill Pass and 
six others in the $219,400 San Bernardino Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Sal Gonzalez Jr., Del Mar Dennis was several lengths off of a 
relatively quick pace, swung wide entering the stretch and got the best of Hill 
Pass to win by a length in a moderate 1:48 1/5 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of an allowance race on Santa Anita Handicap day, Del Mar Dennis had 
bled slightly and was treated with Lasix for the first time Saturday. The 
half-brother to Forty Niner Days, a multiple-stakes winner on turf, had also 
trained exceptionally well since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to run well by the way he was working," Paco Gonzalez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Sal there was a lot of speed in the race. I told him to let him break 
well and then take him back. This horse is easy to rate now. Before, he was a 
little rank. He wanted to go to the lead, but now it's easy to rate him." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuka, winner of the Big 'Cap after The Wicked North's disqualification, 
finished seventh in the San Bernardino. Best when he is outside of horses and 
off the pace, Stuka moved up along the inside to be third after a half-mile, 
then faded late. He was ridden by David Flores because of Nakatani's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Furiously, the 2-1 favorite, was the only horse Stuka beat. He sprinted to the 
lead under Eddie Delahoussaye but was done before six furlongs had been run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Canaveral, unbeaten in three starts, will be heavily favored to win the 
$200,000 Flamingo Stakes today at Hialeah. 
</P>
<P>
 Unraced as a 2-year-old, the son of Relaunch has three consecutive victories 
at Gulfstream Park, and winning today would earn him a trip to the Kentucky 
Derby, according to trainer Frank Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Sellers will ride Canaveral, who beat a field of allowance horses by 8 
1/2 lengths in his last start on March 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Flamingo entrants: Sangre De Toro, Pad, Honest Colors, Signal 
Tap, Bay Street Star, Meadow Flight, Amathos, Senor Conquistador and Warm 
Wayne. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar Dennis, purchased for $65,000 as a yearling at Keeneland, was named 
for bloodstock agent Dennis Lynch, who is a friend of McCaffery and Toffan. . . 
. Flying Marfa, a half-brother to 1992 San Juan Capistrano winner Fly Till 
Dawn, apparently escaped injury in the sixth race mishap. . . . Antonio 
Castanon, disqualified from first to third aboard heavily favored Miss Turkana 
in Thursday's eighth race, was suspended for five days by the stewards. The 
suspension begins today. . . . Thirty Slews, who hasn't run since finishing 
fourth in the Breeders' Cup Sprint, worked five furlongs in 58 3/5 seconds 
Saturday morning. . . . Pat Valenzuela was off his six mounts Saturday because 
of illness.

LEWIS' NCAA MARK BROKEN IN LONG JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arkansas' Erick Walder jumped 28 feet 8 1/4 inches on Saturday at the Texas El 
Paso Invitational to break Carl Lewis' 13-year-old college long jump record by 
4 3/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Walder, a two-time NCAA outdoor champion and a three-time indoor champion, 
came to UTEP hoping the 3,600-foot altitude would help his chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out here hoping to beat 28 feet, but I didn't think for a while I 
would do well," Walder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I got rested, I got to jumping better." 
</P>
<P>
 The wind gusted all day, then died to 1.99 meters per hour, under the limit of 
two meters per hour, as Walder began his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Houston, Lewis leaped 28-3 1/2 at Sacramento in 1981 to set the old 
mark. Mike Powell holds the world record of 29-4 1/2, set at the World 
Championships in Tokyo in 1991.

YOUR MORTGAGE; CONTROVERSIAL PROGRAMS AVOID FORECLOSURE, TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top home mortgage industry executive calls it "pushing the envelope of the 
law" and vows to fight it nationwide if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Internal Revenue Service say they've recently become aware of 
it and are studying its possible tax implications for participating homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 What they're talking about is 1994's latest, creative wrinkle in mortgage 
credit: 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that offer financially distressed homeowners a way to avoid 
foreclosure, negative marks on their credit bureau files and -- most 
significantly -- large tax liabilities to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders say such enterprises have been encouraged by a 1993 federal tax code 
change that requires lenders to report "debt relief" they extend to borrowers 
in excess of $600. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the concept works. Say you bought your home at the top of the 
market cycle several years ago, and you know its sale value today is less than 
the mortgage balance. To compound matters, your spouse's employer closed last 
year, cutting your family income by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 You've been missing mortgage payments and you're staring at the grim reaper of 
foreclosure two or three months down the road. What to do? There are several 
options, but the one that's bothering lenders involves deeding your property 
over to a third party. The "purchaser" makes no payment to you, but agrees to 
become the owner of legal record on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 A firm active in this field is Boston Harbor Corp., based in San Diego. For an 
upfront fee equal to 1% of your original mortgage principal balance, the firm 
steps into your shoes and immediately contacts the lender. The first thing 
Boston Harbor says to the lender, according to its general counsel, Eric F. 
Fagan, is that "there will be no further payments" on the loan. Instead, the 
firm will provide a service free of charge: It will sell the property quickly 
at the best price it can get -- often less than the loan amount -- and turn the 
net proceeds over to the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage (to mortgage lenders)," according to Fagan, "is that they avoid 
all the expense and time of a foreclosure" as well as the possibility of having 
to hold the property in portfolio for months or years as REO -- real estate 
owned. 
</P>
<P>
 The attractions to the erstwhile homeowners? Several, in Fagan's view. First, 
they get out of the financial jam they were in. Second, they avoid the Scarlet 
Letter on their credit report that would haunt them for years following a 
foreclosure. Even if their lender ultimately did take back the house, the party 
foreclosed upon -- the legal owner of the property -- would be Boston Harbor, 
not the original homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if the sale of the property yielded less than the mortgage balance, 
the homeowners would avoid the sticky tax trap known as "debt relief." Under 
the federal tax code, any relief of indebtedness on behalf of a borrower 
constitutes taxable income to the borrower. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, say the foreclosure sale of your home, with your name on the 
property deed, yielded $125,000 but you owed $150,000 to the bank. If the bank 
licked its wounds and walked away, your debt relief on the transaction would be 
$25,000. In the 31% marginal tax bracket, that could mean you owe $7,750 in 
additional federal taxes. And under a provision of the 1993 tax law, the bank 
is now required to report your $25,000 in debt relief to you -- and to the IRS 
-- on tax form 1099. The law mandates such reporting for all debt forgiveness 
over $600. 
</P>
<P>
 If Boston Harbor's name was on the deed, however, argues Fagan, the debt 
relief would go to Boston Harbor. As a corporation that buys and sells houses, 
it would be able to offset the $25,000 "income" (debt relief) against the 
$25,000 paper "loss" it recorded on the sale. Fagan's program defines the price 
it pays for a house as the outstanding mortgage balance at the time of 
acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners' tax position after all this? According to Fagan, presto: 
They're out of the loop. They owe neither Uncle Sam nor their former lender a 
cent. Boston Harbor, meanwhile, has pocketed 1% of the original loan balance in 
cash. That's $1,500 on a $150,000 mortgage, $3,000 on a $300,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Fagan says business is booming. By his count, the firm has initiated or 
completed over 100 transactions in the past six months alone. But that doesn't 
necessarily sit well with lenders. Richard D. Bryan, an executive vice 
president at Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., says the firm 
is encountering more of these transactions and vigorously opposes the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 By encouraging homeowners to walk away from their financial obligations and 
promising tax and credit-file benefits, said Bryan, such firms are "pushing the 
envelope of the law." Freddie Mac, for its part, will send 1099s and report 
foreclosures in the original borrowers' names, Bryan warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS, in the meantime, says it is "looking at" the whole subject of 
mortgage debt relief. Asked if he had contacted the IRS for an opinion to 
safeguard his homeowner clients, Fagan confirmed that he had not. His own tax 
attorney cleared the plan, according to Fagan. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot on mortgage debt relief programs for consumers: Be aware that 
they're controversial at the least. Get solid legal and tax advice before 
plunging ahead.

HOT PROPERTY: ROOTS PULLING ROCKER HOME

 BRET MICHAELS, lead singer and songwriter for the popular rock band Poison, 
has listed his Calabasas estate at just under $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go back to the East Coast, where my whole family is from, and buy a 
big ranch, maybe 100 acres, where I can ride my motorcycles every day," said 
Michaels, who is a national spokesman for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and 
has been a diabetic for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want an area where I can take five old cars and have Figure 8 Derbys. I 
grew up in Pennsylvania, where we did that, and I miss it." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean that Michaels, 31-year-old frontman of the band that has 
been considered a pop alternative to the darker Guns N' Roses, is deserting Los 
Angeles, where Poison is recording its sixth release, to follow its 
million-selling "Native Tongue" album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love L.A.," he said. "You can't beat the weather. I would like to have a 
condo here." But first he plans to sell his Calabasas home and former residence 
in Sherman Oaks, which he bought soon after he moved to California in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 He purchased the 3.25-acre Calabasas estate in 1991. "One of his hobbies is 
dirt biking, and he used to ride in Calabasas, where he watched his house being 
built," said listing agent Lynne Weiss of Coldwell Banker in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A Beverly Hills couple built the home in 1989, then decided that it was too 
remote. So Michaels bought it and leased out his Sherman Oaks residence, which 
is for sale now at $550,000, with five bedrooms and a Valley view. His 
Calabasas home has five bedrooms and a corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels has two Arabian stallions and four large dogs on the estate, which 
suffered the loss of one outbuilding in the firestorms of last fall. "The fire 
came up to the edge of his house, then blew away," said Weiss, who had helped 
Michaels then by loading his gold and platinum records into her mini-van for 
safe keeping. 
</P>

 TINA LOUISE, who lives in New York and appears regularly on the TV soap "All 
My Children," has put her Beverly Hills-area home on the market at $1.2 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The actress, best known for her role as Ginger on the syndicated sitcom 
"Gilligan's Island," originally listed the 3,000-square-foot home in the fall 
of 1992 at $1.6 million. The one-story, three-bedroom residence, described as 
"an Asian-style ranch home," has a koi pond, 40-foot-long swimming pool and 
guest house. Mike Silverman and Jackie Bright, both of Mike Silverman Estates, 
a Jon Douglas Co., have the listing. 
</P>

<P>
 Actress ELISABETH SHUE, sister of Andrew Shue (who plays hunky writer Billy 
Campbell on TV's "Melrose Place"), and her fiance, film director David 
Guggenheim, are getting ready to move into a Spanish-style home they bought 
just outside of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot home, which is being renovated, was 
purchased for slightly more than $400,000. "It was a foreclosure sale, which 
went for far less than it is worth," a source said. "It's in a neighborhood of 
million-dollar homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Elisabeth Shue played Tom Cruise's love interest in "Cocktail" (1988) and 
Marty McFly's girlfriend, Jennifer, in the second and third installments of 
"Back to the Future." She also played the aspiring actress/niece of a 
soap-opera star in "Soapdish" (1991). 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Novinger of ReMax, Beverly Hills, represented the buyers, and Lois Crane 
of Prudential California Realty, Santa Monica, represented the sellers. 
Financing was arranged by W. Alex Glasscock of Brodon Mortgage, Santa Monica.

 ROBBY BENSON, voice of the beast in the Disney animated film "Beauty and the 
Beast" (1991), has purchased a newly built, $620,000 house in Park City, Utah, 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson, who hosted the March TV special "American Express Presents Backstage 
Pass . . . Disney's Beauty and the Beast Goes to Broadway," bought a 
four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot house with a golf-course view. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley resident, Benson plans to take occupancy of the Park 
City home, built by Zamir Unique Homes, in June, sources say. The actor also 
teaches at the University of Utah.

</P>
<P>
 ROBERTA WEINTRAUB, who was on the Los Angeles Board of Education for 14 years, 
has leased a home in Bel-Air. Her Sherman Oaks home was damaged in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub, now on the L.A. library board and L.A. County Commission on Local 
Government Services, leased a home owned by Barry Barnholtz, senior vice 
president of Trimark Pictures, and his wife, Kate. The Barnholtzes moved to 
Malibu some time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub is leasing at $6,250 a month for a year, sources say. The house had 
been listed by Victoria Lockwood of Fred Sands Estates, Beverly Hills. Joe 
Babajian, of the same office, and Jody Fine, of the firm's Pacific Palisades 
office, represented Weintraub.

 Q: How do I find a good real estate agent? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Experts recommend that home buyers and sellers start by asking friends and 
relatives for recommendations.Then ask them if they would use the same agent 
again, advises Dian Hymer, author of "Buying and Selling a Home in California" 
(Chronicle Books). 
</P>
<P>
 "If personal contacts don't generate enough leads, call the managers of 
reputable local real estate companies and ask for recommendations of agents who 
specialize in the neighborhoods where you are selling or buying," Hymer writes. 
It is also advisable to find out if the agent has experience handling homes of 
the type you are selling or buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers and sellers are advised to make sure that the real estate agent is 
licensed. This can be done by asking for a copy of the license and checking its 
status with the state Department of Real Estate, which regulates agents, at 
(213) 897-3399. 
</P>
<P>
 Some buyers and sellers also ask for the names and phone numbers of recent 
clients the agent represented.  
</P>
<P>
 Other Sources: To find out if an agent is a member of a local real estate 
trade group, call the California Assn. of Realtors at (213) 739-8200.

GLENDORA REALTOR NAMED TOP SELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendora real estate agent Marty Rodriguez was named top seller in the world 
by Century 21 Real Estate Corp. for an unprecedented third year in a row. She 
was also No. 1 in North America for the fifth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez sold 173 houses worth more than $40 million in 1993 and earned more 
than $1.22 million in gross closed commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted to be No. 1 in the world and North America again in 1993," 
said Rodriguez, who has a staff of eight. "It's nice to see the hours of work 
and late nights pay off."

MORE THAN SHELTER: HOME, HELP, HOPE; CASA LOMA GOES BEYOND AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
OFFERING RESIDENTS ENGLISH LITERACY CLASSES, JOB TRAINING AND CHILD CARE.

 Beatriz Olvera Stotzer, a manager with the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power, recalls plenty of bunk beds in the one-bedroom Boyle Heights house that 
she and her sisters and brother shared with their parents, who for a long time 
slept on the kitchen floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Valadez, an attorney and developer whose father earned minimum wage, 
came from a family of eight and often shared her bed with a sister. She never 
had a bedroom of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Serrano Sewell, a preschool administrator, had her own room. But as the 
daughter of a labor organizer in the Ohio steel mills, she was weaned on the 
idea that power means little unless it is shared. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 the three Latino feminists met with several others at a preschool in 
the Pico-Union neighborhood of Los Angeles. With more theory than track record, 
they organized a nonprofit real estate development corporation called New 
Economics for Women (NEW). 
</P>
<P>
 And with an attitude that didn't take "no" for an answer, they undertook the 
development of Casa Loma, an $18-million, 110-unit apartment complex on an acre 
of land a mile west of downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, their years of work culminated when their four-story, peach-stuccoed 
vision opened its doors to the community's largely Latino working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just affordable housing, Casa Loma also offers English literacy 
classes, job training and child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really unique," said Carrie Sutkin, planning deputy for Supervisor 
Gloria Molina. "It goes beyond the traditional residential housing needs -- not 
just the design of the units but the underground child-care center, the 
computer learning center and the community center." 
</P>
<P>
 (Molina, who was then the city councilwoman for the district, helped NEW get 
the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) seed money needed to 
attract other public funding for the Casa Loma project.) 
</P>
<P>
 News of the pioneering venture has spread. In May, Housing and Urban 
Development Secretary Henry Cisneros hailed Casa Loma as "a model for the 
nation." More recently, NEW received special recognition for Casa Loma from 
Compact, a nationwide organization of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW grew out of a Latina feminist organization called Comision Femenil 
Mexicana Nacional (CFMN). Most of its members carried memories of childhoods 
spent in overcrowded or substandard housing. All were disenchanted with the 
white middle-class activism of the 1970s, which they felt assumed that someone 
else would make the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The women also shared a fascination with the vision expressed in a Ms. 
magazine article by Yale urbanism professor Delores Hayden. Her idea of 
responding to the needs of working mothers by reinventing housing concepts 
excited them; it also dovetailed nicely with their interest in empowering women 
through economic initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But there weren't any models for the activists' goal of using housing as a 
base to stabilize the family. That suited them just fine. "NEW is very careful 
not to impose preconceived ideas on the families and the community that they 
are building in," Valadez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Focus groups made up of working mothers from the neighborhood were asked about 
their needs. From such gatherings Casa Loma planners learned what was 
imperative: lots of security, combination kitchen-dining rooms and plenty of 
open yet sequestered spaces where mothers could relax on benches and yet still 
watch their children.  
</P>
<P>
 Architect Pedro Birba responded with one entrance leading in and out of the 
building; a round-the-clock security guard sits in a glassed-in office at the 
entrance to the garage and security cameras ring the structure's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents at Casa Loma range from $89 a month for a studio apartment to $450 a 
month for a four-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Birba said the biggest challenge in designing Casa Loma was the task of 
"massaging" a very dense site for every square foot of added open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone involved in the project, Birba calls it a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 There was his surprise, for example, when walk-in closets were rejected by the 
focus groups. "We found that people might decide to use those closets as 
additional living space," Birba said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His notion of townhome-style units was also "blown out of the water" by women 
who did not want to face climbing stairs after a long work day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We broke some planning rules in terms of (the) conventional way people look 
at apartments," Birba said. "They taught me that as an architect you don't 
always have all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Designing the kitchens was also educational. The apartments' dining and 
cooking areas are blended, to allow the mothers to supervise their children 
while they cook. "It took us six to eight months to convince (the CRA) that it 
was a design that was going to be conducive to this atmosphere," Stotzer said. 
"I don't think they really felt that we had it together." 
</P>
<P>
 John McCoy, CRA director of housing, disagrees. "I think these are some pretty 
extraordinary women (with) a combination of having a dream and having the 
practical business orientation and technical expertise to realize that dream. 
It is tough to find that combination in people." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, from the very beginning NEW understood where it was going. 
</P>
<P>
 Their search for an affordable site for the Casa Loma project received a 
jump-start in 1986 with an allocation of $97,000 in seed money from the United 
Way. Two years later the appearance of a "For Sale" sign in front of the 
child-care center where they held their meetings signaled the end of their site 
search. The large piece of property owned by the Cancer Detection Center in the 
community they wanted to serve was the perfect location, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of developers who were interested in the land," Stotzer 
recalled. "We were able to convince the owner -- another nonprofit -- to sell 
to us because it was going to be very political to try to get rid of the 
child-care center. We had committed to relocate Centro de Ninos nearby. (It) 
had been there 15 years and it was a real needed service in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 "We managed to tie up a $3 million parcel with $10,000," Valadez said. "I 
think we felt we were doing a good deal." Although their offer of 50% of the 
asking price was turned down, Valadez said, eventually a deal was struck 
because of the "seller's willingness to believe in the capability of a 
nonprofit to close on the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh hurdles, though, remained. "It was very difficult for (the CRA) to grasp 
what we were trying to do -- to accept (housing) being combined with social 
services and child care on site," Stotzer said. "We fought constantly, saying 
that all three elements were part of the whole." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One obstacle that needed to be cleared was the sheer magnitude of the venture 
being undertaken without a significant track record. Another was sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenges to the women's expertise came from representatives of building and 
development industries traditionally dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
 "That we were a garden club that had somehow gotten together and were 
developers because it was a good thing to do is the kind of concept that got 
back to us," Valadez said. For example, the experience of being cast by one 
member of a loan committee as "just a bunch of women" without any knowledge of 
construction was typical, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, the women prevailed, and in 1990 the agency increased its 
original $3.5-million pre-development and land-acquisition loan to $5 million 
-- enough to build an on-site child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 This breakthrough enabled Valadez and Carmen Luna, a community outreach 
manager for American Savings Bank, to lead a drive for other funding. Money 
from the Century Freeway Housing Program, the State Rental Housing Construction 
Program, equity tax credits and a bank loan were assembled to form Casa Loma's 
$18 million financing pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-month construction of Casa Loma was dogged by adversity. "We had 
everything happen to us during construction that could possibly happen to us," 
recalled Valdez. "The worst rains flooded our construction site twice. We had 
an arson fire -- we lost one-third of our project. The drywallers went on 
strike. I think that is why we were so proud of the fact that we had come in on 
time and on budget." At the same time, NEW insisted that women be represented 
on all the trades that worked on the building. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW's idea of Casa Loma as a transitional haven has always turned on the 
presence of the Centro de Ninos child-care center. 
</P>
<P>
 While an on-site social worker and counselor are available to help residents 
set goals -- to own a home or a business -- the state-supported 
bilingual/bicultural preschool offers mobility to mothers preparing for better 
futures by working or going to school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, their children have the benefit of a preschool environment that 
expresses "space, safeness and tranquillity," said Centro's administrator, 
Sandy Sewell. 
</P>
<P>
 As a counterpoint to the congested living conditions so familiar to these 
preschoolers, an aquatic theme was chosen, she said. It is carried out in the 
child-care center, which is decorated in soothing shades of blue, green and 
turquoise and repeated in the sculptured fish and cloth streamers representing 
kelp and clouds that form the ceiling treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the progressively rising classroom ceilings -- an architectural 
element intended to parallel the children's growing ages -- are educational 
activity sections flowing freely into each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the large learning spaces, Sewell said, "It gives the children the 
opportunity to hear themselves think and for them to realize that their 
thoughts are worth having." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, more than $100,000 has been raised by Centro's parents -- enough 
to equip the preschool with an industrial kitchen, new furniture, a washer and 
dryer for diapers, a science area, an art room and computer terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 After a delay that was caused by state budget cuts, the preschool opened in 
late January. With federal help, Centro de Ninos began serving 55 children. 
Supplementary resources are being sought by NEW to bring the center up to its 
75-child capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, budget problems have not dampened the enthusiasm of Jaime Cevallos. 
In fact, the smile of the Salvadoran immigrant is the only thing brighter than 
the sunlight in his gleaming three-bedroom, two-bath apartment, a still 
sparsely furnished unit on the second floor of Casa Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 A shipping clerk for a Culver City sock manufacturer, Cevallos, 30, says he 
and his wife, Blanca, had been paying $525 for a one-bedroom Pico Union 
apartment. Now they spend $330 in a building where his two children can play 
outdoors safely. 
</P>
<P>
 After reeling off a few other pluses -- more money left in his paycheck, 
English classes, membership on a resident's council -- he concludes, "We are so 
happy here. This is like God has given to us something special."

APARTMENT LIFE: POST-QUAKE PAINT UP TO TENANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), 
an apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I live in Sherman Oaks and I have an earthquake-related question for 
you. Since the earthquake I have been trying to find out whether it is a 
landlord's responsibility to fix an apartment back up to its pre-quake 
condition after an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In our 10-unit apartment building, the landlord has patched the walls but 
indicated that he will not repaint the apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the units were vacant and only required a little touch-up paint. The 
other seven have been occupied from five to 20 years and have not been painted 
since they were vacant. The paint has aged and is discolored making touching 
them up impractical. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the landlord's obligation? Is he required to paint after patching the 
cracks or is this considered cosmetic? Can we withhold the rent until painting 
is completed? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: While cracks must be patched and touch-up painted, repainting is 
considered cosmetic. The only way a landlord might have to repaint is if the 
earthquake were his fault instead of Mother Nature's. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, you cannot withhold your rent for painting. You can seek the 
landlord's permission to repaint or have the unit repainted. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, landlords will allow repainting as long as the color scheme is 
reasonable or matches the other units in the building. Sometimes, the landlord 
will pay for the paint or some of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not repaint without permission. Most leases and rental agreements contain 
provisions prohibiting alterations to the unit, which includes painting. 
Security Gates Add Another Problem 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in the Palms neighborhood of Los Angeles and I have a problem. Last 
year the owners of this property installed security gates at the property as a 
response to the rise in gang-related crime in the area. Unfortunately, they did 
not install an intercom system with the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tenants asked the landlords to install an intercom system, their 
angered answer was an absolute no. We don't want to move, and we tried 
installing individual doorbells, but this was short-lived because when one rang 
they all rang. 
</P>
<P>
 We really believe that we need an intercom system since we cannot have 
spontaneous visitors or deliveries without it. If we can't get the owners to 
install an intercom, we could just as soon have the gates removed. What 
recourse do we have? If none, do you have any ideas on how we can solve this 
problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You probably cannot compel the owners to install an intercom system at the 
property. Here are some alternative solutions to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the cost of such an improvement is probably a major factor in their 
decision not to install an intercom system, the tenants can offer to pay for 
part or all of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 This is possible even if the unit is under the jurisdiction of L.A.'s rent 
control law. According to Shahry Deyhimy, Public Information Officer, L.A. 
Housing Dept., "They can enter into an additional services contract as long as 
it is in writing and the parties agree to it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the tenants can't afford that option, you can try to persuade the owner, or 
phone company, to install a pay phone at the gate. How to Turn Vacancies Into 
Occupancies 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've had major vacancies in my L.A. apartment building this past year. The 
traditional methods of turning vacancies into occupancies just aren't working. 
What else can I do to reach prospective renters and drive foot traffic to my 
property? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Because these are tough financial and economic times, particularly in 
Southern California, you must be more creative in your marketing efforts and 
try a number of diverse tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Some avenues to explore besides traditional advertising include resident and 
store incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident incentives might include hosting a party for your residents so that 
their friends will see your units. Also, offering your residents a rent 
discount or cash for qualified referrals who rent can be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a free month's rent (for the 12th month of a 12-month lease) attracts 
other prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Networking with area apartment owners and managers to refer qualified 
referrals to each other that you or they can't accommodate can also work. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross promotions and incentives in cooperation with local merchants can also 
help fill those vacancies. For example, you might maintain a list of local 
merchants in exchange for them posting notices or handing out fliers about your 
rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't use them now, signs and banners are yet another inexpensive 
method for driving foot traffic to your door.

USC HONORS ARCHITECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Architects Calvin C. Straub, FAIA, and Donald C. Hensman, FAIA, will be 
honored as the 1994 distinguished alumni of the USC School of Architecture at 
the annual dinner of the school's Architectural Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial tribute to architect Conrad Buff III, a former partner of Straub 
and Hensman who died in 1988, will be a part of the April 19 program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every California architect educated after the early '50s has been influenced 
by the work of Buff, Straub and Hensman," said Victor Regnier, dean of the USC 
School of Architecture. The three men were influential in the invention of new 
architectural forms, Regnier said. "Their legacy extends from the Case Study 
House program to the development of post-and-beam construction," he said. 
</P>

JAMES FLANIGAN: HOW FALSE ASSUMPTIONS CAUSED A REAL MARKET DIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there any connection between the stock market and the real world? That 
question was heard loud and clear last week as stock prices gyrated wildly 
downward while U.S. industry continued to increase sales and profits and plans 
for a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is, yes, there's a connection. The market's behavior reflects the 
actions of a majority of investors. But the majority is not always right -- and 
that's what makes stock markets and horse races and times like the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors believe interest rates are going up and that is true, so some drop 
in stocks is rational. But the market also seems to think inflation is 
accelerating and that is false, because most investors are acting on outdated 
information. Thus, confusion and fear rule the markets, in dramatic contrast to 
the real economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as stocks dropped sharply last week, the government reported that the 
U.S. economy grew 7% in the closing three months of 1993 -- the strongest 
quarterly showing in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And purchasing agents in Chicago said industrial production continues at a 
high level, with new orders setting the stage for more growth in the second and 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are putting their profits to work. Eaton Corp., a truck axle maker 
that increased earnings 51% last year, announced that it would build a new 
parts plant south of Cleveland -- the once depressed city that is growing again 
and looking forward to celebrating its 200th anniversary in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole Midwest is looking forward confidently, from companies like Nordson 
Corp., a coatings equipment maker in Westlake, Ohio, to Cummins Engine, a heavy 
truck engine maker in Columbus, Ind., to Giddings & Lewis, a manufacturer of 
computerized factory equipment in Fond du Lac, Wis.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only the Midwest is confident. The American Electronics Assn., in Santa 
Clara, Calif., predicts that its companies, which supply the computers and 
software and automation systems that have made U.S. industry increasingly 
productive, will grow 46% in the next two years to $940 billion in total sales. 
U.S. output in computers and related equipment was more than $500 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in electronics that you'll find the key to today's economy and the 
explanation for investors' confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers and chips and software programs that now drive the machines of 
industry are not themselves rising in price. In fact, prices of computer power 
are falling -- each new chip or program delivers more power than the last for 
the same or less money. 
</P>
<P>
 And when electronic advances are used in manufacturing plants or in truck 
engines or construction tractors, they allow more work to be done with less 
labor. That's called productivity or progress or the power of innovation. But 
it is not called inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet fears of inflation are driving stocks down because investors are missing 
the effect of electronics. They are assuming that if companies are producing so 
much, they must be reaching the limits of capacity; that if so much work is 
being done, wage pressures must be building up. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors see the growing profits in U.S. industry but they don't make the 
connection to the new efficiency and productivity of that industry. So they 
sell on their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Could their selling affect the real world by stalling out the economy's 
expansion? It could, if disorder in the markets caused mortgage interest rates 
to rise further, shutting off housing. Or if stock prices fell dramatically 
enough to discourage corporate investment in new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no great sign of that. Housing markets so far seem to be 
surviving a rise in mortgage rates. And business investment in industrial 
equipment is running strong -- 12% to 25% ahead of last year, with the fastest 
growth in computer related advances. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticks and carrots are driving such investment: the need to cut costs to keep 
ahead of competition, and the returns on investment in an advancing economy and 
in world markets that are only now awakening. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the stock market go back up? Markets, like life, are unpredictable and 
not entirely rational. Investors right now are taking profits after an almost 
uninterrupted three-year run-up in stock prices. Also, problems in large, 
speculative hedge funds are having an unsettling effect on interest rates and 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 New fears of inflation might show up in Monday's market after Friday's strong 
report on employment, although why more Americans working should make stocks 
fall is a prime example of irrationality. 
</P>
<P>
 But the antidote to fear is knowledge. Think back to the last time the Midwest 
was basking in prosperity, in the 1970s. Crop and farmland prices soared, 
industry reported high profits and workers earned big raises. But it was all 
funny money. Inflation rose 10% and more per year, making an illusion of wage 
and profit gains and bringing disaster to the farm belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously enough, the market saw through the illusion: The 1970s were 
characterized by long and dreary bear markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Now contrast that with today: As sales and profits rise in U.S. industry, 
labor costs are going up less than 1% a year. Overall inflation is rising 2.8% 
on an annual basis and even medical inflation is now under 6% after more than a 
decade of double-digit growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit electronics for that, says economist William Finan of Technecon 
Analytic Research, a Washington consulting firm that specializes in the 
electronics industry. "We are the deflationary engine," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Finan believes the market underestimates electronics' effect because U.S. 
government statistics don't really capture the industry's falling prices. 
Computer prices alone fell 30% last year, he reckons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the majority of investors realize the implications of that in the real 
world of U.S. industry, the stock market may rise again.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / ROBERT EISNER: CONCEPT OF A 'NATURAL RATE OF 
UNEMPLOYMENT' IS GROSSLY INFLATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EISNER, ROBERT EISNER is William R. Kenan professor of economics at 
Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He is the author of The Misunderstood 
Economy: What Counts and How to Count It. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Economics long has had a reputation as the "dismal science." We economists are 
full of such aphorisms as "There is no free lunch" and "No gain without pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the great classical economists insisted that we could not permanently 
raise the wages of workers living at the brink of starvation. If we tried to, 
they argued, we only would permit them to live longer, reproduce and increase 
the number of mouths to be fed from limited supplies of food. Real wages then 
would be forced down further, until enough people died of starvation for the 
shares of food -- and real wages -- of survivors to return to their original 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a remedy proposed -- the 19th-Century original of the "Just Say No" 
injunction: Just say no, said the eminent Thomas Malthus, to early marriage and 
sex to hold down the population. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder economists were considered a dismal lot! 
</P>
<P>
 But all this is not just ancient history. Dear to the hearts of many 
economists working today -- and underlying the decisions of all too many 
policy-makers -- is the infamous concept of a "natural rate of unemployment" 
that we cannot over the long run escape. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this notion, if we try to get unemployment below the natural 
rate, we will bring on increased inflation. And worse, as long as we stay below 
the "natural" unemployment rate, inflation will keep accelerating. Only if 
unemployment is at the natural rate will inflation, whatever it is, stay 
constant. The natural rate is thus called the "NAIRU" -- the acronym for that 
mouthful, "non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting and trying to keep unemployment even one percentage point below NAIRU 
will presumably give us not just more inflation -- say, an increase from 2% to 
3%. Rather, proponents of this view contend, it will mean inflation going first 
to 3%, but then to 4% and then 6% and then 10% and so on. Before long we will 
have hyperinflation, as in Germany between the world wars, with people carrying 
wagons full of money to the bakery to buy a loaf of bread. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to stop inflation from increasing is to allow unemployment to get 
back to its natural rate. But by then we will have a high -- if constant -- 
rate of inflation. To get inflation down again, the NAIRU theorists say, will 
require excess unemployment; that is, unemployment higher than the natural 
rate. Since we presumably will not permit inflation to stay sky-high, accepting 
more inflation to reduce unemployment now would necessitate more unemployment 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a doctrine with little or no consistent factual support. 
Unemployment in the United States has bounced all around its so-called natural 
rate with no indications of permanently accelerating inflation from our 
episodes of low unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 And if unemployment is natural, God has certainly treated his children 
differently in different times and places. Much of Western Europe used to have 
unemployment rates well below ours, in the 2% or 3% range. But Europe has been 
experiencing double-digit rates for years -- without the accelerating deflation 
NAIRU doctrine calls for. Japan's rate remains under 3% -- with little or no 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seems to phase at least some "natural raters." I have quipped, on 
the basis of fairly solid observation, that the difference between 
conservatives and liberals is that conservatives put the natural unemployment 
rate around 6.5% -- if they don't go to the extreme of arguing that the actual 
unemployment rate, no matter how high, is natural -- while liberals put it at 
5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course we cannot expect the unemployment rate to be zero. Economists allow 
for some "frictional" unemployment. Even under conditions that we would call 
full employment, some people may be briefly unemployed looking for the right 
new job when they lose their old one. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have had unemployment as low as 1.2%, amid the huge government spending 
of World War II. If business can sell all it can produce, it will try to hire 
everyone available. During the Vietnam War, from 1966 to 1969, unemployment was 
in the 3% range while inflation "accelerated" over the years 1968 to 1971 all 
the way from 5.0% to 5.4%.  
</P>
<P>
 From 1988 to 1990, unemployment in the United States remained under 5.5%, 
again below the presumed NAIRU, and the rate of inflation moved from 3.9% in 
1988 to 4.4% in 1989, remained at 4.4% in 1990 and came back down to 3.9% in 
1991 -- hardly evidence of dangerously accelerating inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a minority of senators succeeded last year in blocking President Clinton's 
stimulus plan, which was designed to reduce unemployment. Their underlying 
objection was that stimulus could not work to reduce unemployment below its 
natural rate. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Alan Greenspan shocks the financial world, and the economy, by moving 
to raise interest rates -- in order to combat an inflation that nobody can 
find. The justification? The economy is doing too well! If we don't slow it 
down and hence keep unemployment from getting below the current 6.5% -- which 
Martin Feldstein, chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, 
is quoted as calling " . . . essentially full employment" -- we shall have that 
accelerating inflation! 
</P>
<P>
 In deference to that dogma, more than 8 million Americans remain totally 
unemployed, millions more can find only part-time jobs and still more millions 
are not even counted because they have given up looking for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing natural or necessary about all this misery, or the damage to 
the economy.

GREEN MAGAZINES GET BLUES; ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLICATIONS HURTING FROM FALLOFF IN 
INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 They harbored dreams of spreading the green gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers rolled out new magazines like Buzzworm and Garbage that preached 
waste reduction, energy conservation, forest preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the roughly half-dozen publications that sprang up around Earth Day's 
20th anniversary -- four years ago this month -- are falling about as fast as 
clear-cut trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzworm is in bankruptcy. Garbage cut its frequency after barely breaking 
even. E magazine is living hand-to-mouth. Even entrenched magazines are 
hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 The shakeout is most profound in periodicals, but the trend suggests a falloff 
in environmental interest with implications beyond the publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the popularity of recycling and other initiatives, Americans in 
general -- and magazine readers, in particular -- are not as interested as 
environmentalists in green product updates and the latest dirt on polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they are reluctant to pay about $30 a year for magazines when much 
of the same fare is supplied by newspapers, news weeklies and television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure there was a euphoria except by the publishers themselves," 
publisher Joel Makower said. He should know. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Makower started the Green Consumer Letter, a monthly 
eight-page newsletter with information on green investing to energy 
conservation printed on recycled paper. He was forced to close it in January 
after subscriptions fell to a few thousand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the naive but rational-at-the-time assumption that there was going to 
be a good steady market for this," Makower said. 
</P>
<P>
 What's clear is that publishers overestimated the concern aroused by Earth Day 
fervor, the anti-regulatory policies of the Reagan decade and disasters such as 
the Exxon-Valdez oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 A Roper Starch Worldwide poll finds that 20% of Americans felt strongly about 
the environment last year, down from 25% in 1991. Consumers most likely to 
spend more for green products fell from 11% in 1990 to 6% to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is the economy's sluggish emergence from the 1990-91 recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers are less likely to renew subscriptions to magazines not considered 
essential. Faced with a choice, Americans with only modest interest have turned 
to more conventional news sources that have expanded their green coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend watchers expected the shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a new issue comes up on the radar screen, there tends to be an 
initial panic. Then we become more informed, people start to take action, 
address the problem, and people's concerns become a bit muted," said Bradford 
Fay, vice president at Roper Starch, the marketing and public opinion research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not because the issue has gone away, it's because progress is seen. The 
fact that we had a recession forced this sort of pragmatic thinking to move in 
quicker than it might have otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The shift has converted enthusiasts to cynics. "I'm not 100% convinced 
environmental journalism is a mainstream consumer interest," said a humbled 
Joseph Daniel, the publisher and founder of Buzzworm. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched six years ago, Buzzworm broke stories like pesticide spraying on 
airplanes and amused readers with irreverent pokes -- including a parody of a 
poacher's catalogue of endangered wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Circulation grew to 110,000 at its peak. Buzzworm was one of the few to claim 
success in luring big advertisers such as Chrysler and Absolut vodka. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with ads the bimonthly lost money, renewal drives were too expensive and 
readership fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Buzzworm changed its name to Buzzworm's Earth Journal to reflect a 
fresh emphasis on culture, eco-travel and literature, and halved frequency to 
four times a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the publisher of Earth, an earth science magazine, sued Buzzworm over the 
new name as the company was trying to recapitalize its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 When the deal fell through, the legal expenses helped push the company over 
the edge. In December, Buzzworm sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
federal court in Denver, nearly $2 million in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage magazine also is struggling for a profitable identity. Started in 1989 
by the publisher of the Old House Journal, the bimonthly initially offered 
standard fare such as articles on composting and walking to work. Subscriptions 
grew to 125,000 by late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid disappointing renewals, Garbage grew more adversarial by challenging 
accepted environmentalist opinions on key subjects. One story questioned 
whether the ozone layer's depletion was a serious problem. Garbage lost some 
angry readers in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Garbage underwent an even more fundamental shift. The publication 
halved its frequency to quarterly, dropped advertising and refocused on what it 
calls "environmental insiders" -- readers like environmental activists, 
regulators and corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time to Dump Plastics Recycling?" asks a story in the debut Spring 1994 
issue. Another details Earth First! founder Dave Foreman's plan for returning 
millions of North American acres to wilderness -- and stresses that "eminent 
biologists back him." 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've come to think is there's really nothing such as a stand-alone 
environmental lifestyle," said editor and publisher Patricia Poore, who also 
heads the Old House Journal. "It's really an oxymoron -- you can't really live 
in the 20th Century and really be back to the land." 
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't know it from E, a 5-year-old magazine steeped in environmental 
values. The February issue, for example, tells "the Dirty History of Nuclear 
Power" and how caffeinated environmentalists can choose "Coffees With 
Conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its nonprofit status -- foundation grants total up to 18% of its 
$1-million annual budget, with the rest from subscriptions -- the monthly was 
forced recently to cut costs by slicing circulation one-third to 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been pretty hand-to-mouth," publisher Doug Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even environmental groups that publish large-circulation magazines for their 
members are struggling. In 1991, Greenpeace closed its member magazine, no 
longer able to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra magazine, published by the Sierra Club, has had limited success in 
luring big advertisers because of a predicament faced by all environmental 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disseminate an anti-consumption message -- travel less, consume less, 
pollute less," said Jonathan F. King, editor in chief. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopeful area is in catering to businesses. Makower continues to publish 
his Green Business Letter -- with advice on how to make companies greener -- 
because an annual subscription commands at least $100 more than what he could 
charge readers for the consumer version. 
</P>
<P>
 "That isn't a market that has been glutted by other media outlets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not yet, anyway. ECO (pronounced echo), which bills itself as a business 
magazine about the environment, debuted last fall with attacks on excessive and 
costly government regulation and an eclectic list of advertisers including 
Dupont, utilities and the World Wildlife Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 ECO envisions profitability by 1996. But other start-ups with similar themes 
may obstruct that plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "To repeat the same old thing, 'Everybody is terrible and industry is awful,' 
some of it has become old hat by now," said ECO Editor and President Igor 
Gordevitch, former publisher of Geo and a variety of other magazines. "It's a 
question of picking out who your readers are."

A FORMULA FOR FRAUD?; HONDA KICKBACKS ARE OLD STORY TO SOME AUTO INDUSTRY 
VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When consumers were clamoring for Honda's highly dependable cars in the early 
1980s, longtime Southern California car dealer Bob Estes put in his bid for a 
Honda franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 With his Beverly Hills location, solid financing and 40 years' experience 
selling Volkswagens, Porsches, Lincolns and Mercurys, Estes figured he would 
land a dealership with ease. "I'd known Honda since they first came to the 
country, and they loved my facilities," said Estes, who has since retired but 
still holds a dealer license. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations took an unexpected twist, though, when another dealer described 
"a little deal" that he said required new dealers to pay a surcharge of $150 a 
car to a Honda sales executive in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them to kiss off," said Estes, a past president of the California 
Motor Car Dealers Assn. "I was insulted that they'd come at me that way. . . . 
I'd never bought a dealership in my life, and I wasn't going to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators on March 14 said they had filed criminal charges against 
13 former American Honda Motor Co. executives, including seven who lived in 
Orange County, in connection with alleged kickbacks and bribes during the 
1980s. Estes says he wonders now whether "I should have gone along for a little 
while and then rung a bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda executives last week would not comment on Estes' allegation or an 
ongoing FBI investigation. Federal agents allege that as many as 13 Honda and 
Acura division executives defrauded Torrance-based American Honda out of $10 
million. Since October, eight former Honda and Acura executives have pleaded 
guilty to fraud-related charges and five more former executives have been 
indicted on criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes and others in the automobile and motorcycle sales business say that they 
were not surprised to learn of the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that it has taken this long for the issue of dealer payoffs to Honda 
to come to light is nothing short of amazing," said Don Moery, national sales 
manager for Yamaha Motor Corp. until 1990. "These payoff stories have been out 
there for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Search warrants, indictments and other court papers generated by the yearlong 
FBI investigation are peppered with allegations of bribes and kickbacks, 
including $750,000 linked to a Moreno Valley dealership, $50,000 to a 
dealership in Round Rock, Tex., and $100,000 to an Acura franchise in Cocoa 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also allege that the former executives pocketed funds earmarked 
for dealer advertising campaigns, took kickbacks from vendors who supplied 
training programs for dealers' employees and earned under-the-table profits by 
reselling damaged cars to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda said its internal investigation into possible fraud uncovered 
"isolated policy violations." But the complexity of the schemes "made it 
difficult for us to immediately detect and identify them as interrelated," the 
company stated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Estes said he told Honda Motor Co.'s founder, the late Soichiro Honda, 
about the alleged kickback scheme shortly after abandoning his own attempt to 
win a dealership: "I let him know (through an interpreter) what was going on. I 
told him of my dissatisfaction, so the company knew what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents and federal authorities outlined some of the alleged schemes in 
search warrants, indictments and other documents. Some of the schemes they 
describe are relatively simple: Executives bought damaged cars from the company 
at a discount, and generated thousands of dollars in illegal profits by 
reselling them to dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other operations were more complicated. Court documents allege that Newport 
Beach resident Edward A. Temple, a former Honda zone manager who now owns Costa 
Mesa Honda, played a key role in at least two schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, a Honda employee from 1981 to 1989, pleaded guilty in October to one 
count of conspiracy in connection with the fraud investigation. His office 
referred questions about the investigation to Honda executives in Torrance, who 
would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indictments and other papers filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and in 
Concord, N.H., portray Temple as "a close confidant" of Stanley James Cardiges, 
formerly the top sales executive in the Honda division, who was indicted on 
criminal fraud charges on March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that Temple, Cardiges and others at American Honda 
steered potentially lucrative Honda and Acura franchises to "straw dealers" -- 
groups that had no intention of remaining in business. After American Honda 
awarded dealerships to the bogus groups, court documents state, the exclusive 
franchises were sold, generating kickbacks ranging from $250,000 to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators say that Temple, Cardiges and other Honda executives 
also took illegal stakes in partnerships that were competing for Honda and 
Acura dealerships. In 1987, investigators allege, Temple and Cardiges steered a 
dealership to a businessman in Arkansas in return for a 25% stake in the 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda executives each received checks for $162,000 after the dealership 
was sold, according to court documents. Cardiges subsequently demanded that 
Temple prepare a fraudulent promissory note to mislead Honda's internal 
investigation, federal investigators allege. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges, arrested March 11 at his home in Laguna Hills, pleaded not guilty 
Thursday during a brief appearance in U.S. District Court in Concord, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident the evidence will ultimately show that Jim Cardiges didn't 
defraud anyone, including American Honda," his lawyer, Philip D. Israels of 
Sherman Oaks, said at the hearing. Israels described Cardiges -- who is charged 
with racketeering -- as a scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges remains free on bail pending a trial scheduled for June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that Cardiges also worked on illegal schemes with several 
other former Honda sales executives, including Corona del Mar resident Mark L. 
Benson, who was Honda's assistant zone manager in Connecticut until 1991. In 
October, Benson, who also has declined to comment on the investigation, pleaded 
guilty to one count of mail fraud in connection with the awarding of 
dealerships in Connecticut and New York state. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related search warrant unsealed March 14 in Santa Ana, investigators 
allege that Benson received $250,000 after helping to steer a franchise to a 
dealer in Auburn, N.Y., and $150,000 and a $40,000 Porsche in return for 
influencing the outcome of an application in Westerly, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of Honda executives, investigators allege, also misused millions of 
dollars in advertising and dealer-training funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators maintain that Cardiges and former Honda executive Dennis R. 
Josleyn, who lives in Southern California, took about $2.5 million in kickbacks 
in 1991 and 1992. Josleyn and Cardiges could be sentenced to 30 years in prison 
if convicted of racketeering, mail fraud and conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators allege that the two men steered funds from Honda dealers across 
the country to an unidentified company that provided direct-mail advertising 
and marketing programs -- and kicked back payments to the Honda executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Josleyn, a nine-year Honda veteran whose last position was West Coast manager 
for Acura, was unavailable for comment. Honda officials would not comment other 
than to state that executives are prohibited from taking gifts or investing in 
companies that have transactions with the auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 But court records show that the former Honda executive's brother was the head 
of an advertising agency that did business with the Honda and Acura divisions. 
Josleyn claimed to be owed $200,000 from a now-defunct Yorba Linda advertising 
agency that went bankrupt in 1992. The agency, Garey & Associates, was owned by 
his brother, Don Gary Josleyn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and early 1992, the advertising agency did business with Honda 
and Acura, said Carolyn Davis, credit manager for Colorgraphics, a Los Angeles 
printing company that is still owed more than $100,000 by the failed agency. 
"We knew that (Don Gary's) brother worked for Honda," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the work we did (for Garey) was related in one way or another to 
Honda and Acura," Davis said. Colorgraphics also printed a sales brochure for 
Worldwide Dyve Inc., a now-defunct sports apparel company owned by Cardiges. 
</P>
<P>
 In court records, Don Josleyn stated that his ad agency went out of business 
in the spring of 1992 because it had lost its two major clients. The bankruptcy 
filing -- which showed more than $12 million in gross income between 1988 and 
1991 -- indicated that the firm had $1.4 million in liabilities and no assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorgraphics' last American Honda order from Garey came in February, 1992. 
And, according to Honda, Dennis Josleyn left Honda in April, 1992, just months 
before Garey & Associates entered bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorgraphics executives recall being baffled at the time, because Josleyn's 
agency had paid its bills promptly for two years. Colorgraphics eventually 
filed a civil lawsuit against the failed company seeking $160,000 in unpaid 
bills. The case was settled through the bankruptcy court with a payment of 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was better than nothing," Davis said. "From looking at the bankruptcy 
filing, it appeared that to look for anything more would have been beating a 
dead horse."

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: GOT LOTS OF MONEY TO BURN? TAKE UP SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget the health risks. If you're thinking about smoking, consider the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is weighing a massive increase in cigarette taxes that could easily 
push the cost of a pack of cigarettes to $3 or more, compared to between $1.60 
and $2.25 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Add that higher tax to the already substantial out-of-pocket expense of 
smoking, and it's enough to give pause to anyone thinking about taking up the 
habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Liam, a hypothetical consumer who smokes one pack a day. Liam is 15. 
(A recent study from the U.S. Surgeon General's office showed many youngsters 
start the habit in sixth grade. They think smoking will make them appear "slim, 
sexy, sociable, sophisticated and successful," according to Surgeon Gen. 
Joycelyn Elders.) 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that he pays $3 a pack -- a reasonable estimate, if a new cigarette 
tax goes through -- he'll puff away the down payment for his first car -- 
$1,095 -- in his first year of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Liam is 25, he will have spent $10,950 on cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 If, instead, he had saved the cigarette money and put it in a mutual fund with 
an 8% annual investment return, he would have socked away $16,694 in cigarette 
savings alone. That's enough to make a down payment on a house. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 65, Liam will have spent at least $54,750 on cigarettes. But pure 
spending figures understate the case. If he had invested that $3 a day instead 
of spending the money on cigarettes, he would have accumulated a nest egg of 
$723,770. (That, again, assumes a fairly conservative 8% annual average 
investment return.) 
</P>
<P>
 But the price of cigarettes is just one of the extra costs Liam started paying 
when he began smoking. He's also probably paying more than nonsmokers for many 
types of insurance -- life, medical, homewners and automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in the cost of life insurance is the easiest to quantify. 
Smokers generally pay between 20% and 100% more for life insurance than 
nonsmokers, says Steven Stark, vice president of marketing at SelectQuote 
Insurance Services in San Francisco. The difference in rates depends on the 
buyer's sex, the insurer and whether you're buying a whole life or term life 
policy.

 For example's sake, we assumed that Liam would buy term insurance -- the least 
expensive type of life insurance -- for 20 years, starting on his 30th 
birthday. That's presumably an age when he would have dependents relying on him 
for support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Liam would pay an average of $702.50 a year for a $250,000 policy, Stark says. 
If Liam did not smoke, he would pay an average of $297.50 a year, he adds. Over 
20 years, that $405 annual difference amounts to $8,100. If you account for the 
time value of money -- the amount Liam would have if he could invest the annual 
difference, instead of paying it to a life insurer -- Liam is behind by 
$19,879. 
</P>
<P>
 If Liam buys health coverage through a group plan, he generally wouldn't pay 
more than a nonsmoker. However, should he have to buy an individual policy, he 
would pay substantially more than a nonsmoker, insurance experts say. For 
example's sake, we'll assume Liam can buy health insurance through a group 
policy and pay the same premium as a nonsmoker. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to homeowners and auto insurance, the amount Liam would pay 
would vary widely based on the insure, as well as Liam's age, his driving 
experience, the car he drives, the value of his home and where he lives. 
Farmers Insurance Group ran a sample comparison based on a 38-year-old man 
living in Canoga Park, driving a fairly standard car and living in a modest 
house. This man, if he smoked, would pay about $19 more than a nonsmoker in 
identical circumstances for homeowner's insurance and about $108 more for auto 
insurance, a Farmers spokeswoman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the $127 annual price differential holds, and that he needs to insure 
both a house and a car for 40 years, Liam would pay a total of $5,080 more than 
a nonsmoker with similar needs. If Liam had invested that $127 each year, he 
would have accumulated $36,946 at the end of the 40-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies indicate that smokers also pay substantially more for a plethora 
of health-related items, such as hospital stays, doctor's services and 
long-term care. A recent congressional study estimated that a smoker pays 
roughly $229 a year more than a nonsmoker in hospital bills, $43 more than 
nonsmokers to doctors, $37 more for nursing homes and $19 more for medication. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional costs, including $2 in the "other professional" category, 
amount to $329 a year. Over Liam's 50 years of smoking, that amounts to $16,450 
-- or $217,461 when adjusted for an 8% annual opportunity cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding it all up, Liam is about $998,155 poorer at age 65 than he would have 
been if he had not taken up smoking. In other words, that "sophisticated" habit 
has cost him what he could have spent to to buy an oceanfront mansion and a 
Porsche.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: OLDER HOME BUYER MAY GET A BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: If you sell a house that was bought before Prop. 13 passed, and now you buy 
another house of equal or lesser value, are you now taxed according to 
post-Prop. 13, or do you get to keep your pre-Prop. 13 rate? -- A.R.F . 
</P>
<P>
 A: This subject continues to draw questions, so we will again cover the 
special Prop. 13 property tax reassessment exemptions available to California 
home buyers over age 55. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of these loopholes was approved in 1986, when California voters 
passed an initiative allowing homeowners over age 55 to transfer the assessed 
value of the home they were selling to a new home. This initiative effectively 
allowed these older homeowners to bypass provisions of Prop. 13, also known as 
the Jarvis Amendment, that automatically set the sales price of a home as its 
assessed value. However, this initiative, approved by voters as Prop. 60, 
contained important restrictions: the replacement house had to be of equal or 
lesser value than the old home, and both the old and replacement homes had to 
be in the same county. In addition, a homeowner was entitled to only one 
transfer of a pre-Prop. 13 value. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Prop. 90. Approved by California voters in November, 1988, it allows 
homeowners over age 55 to transfer the assessed value of their old home 
anywhere within the state so long as the value of the new home is the same or 
less than that of the old. But the initiative stipulated that homeowners could 
only take advantage of Prop. 90 if the county into which they were moving voted 
to participate in the special property assessment program created by Prop. 90. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Boards of Supervisors of just 12 counties -- Alameda, Inyo, Kern, 
Los Angeles, Marin, Modoc, Orange, Riverside, Santa Clara, San Diego, San Mateo 
and Ventura -- have agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do only 12 of the state's 58 counties participate in this program? 
Counties are leery about joining the program since it potentially restricts the 
amount of property tax revenues they can collect without offering any 
commensurate decrease in the amount of public services they are expected to 
provide their residents. In fact, Contra Costa County has withdrawn from the 
program and Riverside County supervisors are thinking about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program has proved popular with older taxpayers who now have the 
freedom to move without facing the same tax consequences of their action that 
younger homeowners do. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Jarvis Amendment, the assessed value of a home was set as of March, 
1975, and allowed to increase just 2% per year as long as its owner as of 1975 
lived there. Once sold, however, the house would be reassessed at fair market 
value, essentially its sale price. Local governments benefit every time a home 
sells for more than its previous sale price and have come to count heavily on 
home sales to increase the public coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1986, the automatic property tax reassessment contained in Prop. 13 kept 
many older homeowners from moving into smaller, retirement housing because the 
property tax hikes were too great. For example, if a couple has been living in 
their home since 1974 it might have a property tax assessment of $75,000 and be 
worth well over $300,000 or $400,000 on the open market. Even if the couple 
were to buy a smaller, less expensive home, their property taxes might easily 
double on the purchase of the new home. That's why older homeowners sought and, 
with the help of the state's real estate lobby, won an exemption from the 
Jarvis Initiative. Still, the state Board of Equalization reports that few 
homeowners have invoked their right to the exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are at least age 55 and moving within the county where you currently 
reside, you are eligible for the Prop. 60 exemption. If you are moving to one 
of the 12 counties that have voted to join the special assessment program, then 
you can take advantage of the Prop. 90 exemption. 
</P>
<P>
 Note that you have only three years after purchasing your new house to claim 
the exemption from your county assessor's office. If you fail to claim it 
within that period, it is forever lost.  
</P>
<P>
 One last note: You are only entitled to one exemption, either Prop. 60 or 
Prop. 90, over a lifetime. Once you've used it, it's gone. Payments as 
Co-Signer Are Fully Deductible 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My husband co-signed a note for a large amount of money for a friend who 
has now gone bankrupt. Unless we make the payments, we will lose valuable 
property we pledged as collateral. Are these loan payments tax-deductible? -- 
J.G.  
</P>
<P>
 A: If you guaranteed the loan with the genuine expectation that you would be 
repaid if you ever had to make the payments, you are entitled to consider your 
payments a short-term capital loss. Your payments are fully deductible against 
any capital gains and may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year. 
Unused portions of the deduction may be carried forward until fully written 
off. Withdrawals Must Be Taken by Year-End 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am making mandatory minimum withdrawals from my individual retirement 
accounts using the "term certain" method. Must I make the withdrawal on my 
birthday or at the end of the year? -- E.S.  
</P>
<P>
 A: You must take the distribution by the end of the calendar year. 
</P>
<P>
 Your question provides an opportunity to correct information offered here last 
month regarding the "term certain" withdrawal system. Using IRS unisex life 
expectancy tables, a 70-year-old taxpayer is required to take one-sixteenth of 
the total account in his or her first distribution. The following year, the 
minimum withdrawal would be one-fifteenth of the remaining amount; at age 72 it 
would be one-fourteenth, and so on. The required distribution is not 
one-sixteenth every year as previously written.

ANALYSTS SAY COMPETITION MAY FORCE GENERAL MOTORS TO PUT NEW SPIN ON SATURN; 
AUTOS: SOME SUGGEST GM ROLL ITS EXPERIMENTAL LINE INTO ONE OF ITS MORE 
ESTABLISHED DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since its inception, General Motors Corp.'s Saturn division has been allowed 
to operate as a laboratory for new ideas and concepts, with little 
accountability to the rest of GM. 
</P>
<P>
 But with competition heating up and GM's unlimited financial support no longer 
guaranteed, some industry experts have started to wonder if Saturn would be 
better off joining one of GM's seven more established divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to save Saturn is to kill it unless they can figure out a way to 
roll it into another division," said Lehman Bros. auto analyst Joseph 
Phillippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a move would make it easier for Saturn to get approval for new products 
and another assembly plant. But GM officials fear a merger would undermine 
Saturn's credibility with its customers and spark a bitter culture clash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like saying, 'I've got a bucket of water and a bucket of oil, 
let's just dump them together and let it merge,' " said Oldsmobile General 
Manager John Rock. "When they advertise themselves as a different kind of a car 
company, it really is true." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn Vice President Donald Hudler said a major factor behind Saturn's 
success has been its ability to attract import buyers, women and people who 
otherwise would never have stepped into a GM dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of double-digit sales gains, Saturn has started to feel the 
heat of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month Saturn had more than 90 days worth of cars on hand, far above the 
industry average of 65 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler blamed part of the overhang on bad weather in many parts of the 
country, but industry analysts say Saturn's 4-year-old design is starting to 
show its age, particularly when compared with Chrysler Corp's Neon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler denied Saturn's styling has fallen out of favor and he predicted sales 
will pick up when the company adds another 60 outlets to its distribution 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that buy our product think it's very fresh and contemporary," 
Hudler said. "There's nothing dated, in our opinion, about our cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Saturn is no longer on the cutting edge of technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 Dodge Neon and Chevrolet Cavalier both have one more airbag than does 
the Saturn and they have a more powerful engine, giving them an important edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler said Saturn does not compete directly with the Neon or the Cavalier, 
but industry executives say Saturn really needs a new car to stay ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think it would be criminal for GM not to let them succeed," said 
Ford's Roberts. "I really hope that GM gives them some new product." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Hudler said Saturn has no plans to offer a larger car, and 
it will have to make do with what it has. This fall Saturn will add a second 
airbag to its cars and a year later it will roll out a new exterior.

VALLEY BRIEFING: BLOSSOMING HILLSIDES ; POST-FIRE AREAS YIELDING COLORFUL 
WILDFLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire is part of the natural life cycle in the mountains, one that is 
destructive, yet alsorestorative. Portions of the Santa Monica Mountains 
blackened in the fall's fires have sprung to life with pink, yellow, blue and 
purple flossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 These "fire followers," as they are called, appear only after fires and have 
joined the usual display of wildflowers that bloom every spring in the 
mountains ringing the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of some plants actually need the heat of fire to germinate and can 
remain dormant for decades before sprouting. Scientists are also discovering 
that a chemical in charred wood or smoke also seems to trigger germination. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires also clear away competing plants, allowing these specialized wildflowers 
to grow. Fire followers are the showiest flowers to appear after a fire, and 
will predominate the next few seasons until they become crowded out by other 
vegetation. Catalina Mariposa Lily 
</P>
<P>
 Calochortus catalinae * When it blooms: March-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Grassy slopes in heavy soil, Grassland and Coastal Sage 
habitats at low elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Mariposa means "butterfly" in Spanish and single 2-to-3-inch 
flowers sit on delicate 1-to-2-foot stems. Yellow Mariposa Lily is another 
dominant fire-follower, found from April to June on dry slopes in Chaparral. 
Foothill Lupine 
</P>
<P>
 Lupinus succulentus  
</P>
<P>
 * When it blooms: February-April. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Heavy clay soil on grassy slopes, Grasslands and Coastal 
Sage Scrub plant communities below 1,500-foot elevations. Currently blooming at 
Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa, along with Silver Leaf and Dove Lupine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Stout, erect branching stem 8 to 24 inches high. This lupine is 
thicker and fleshier than other lupines. Other lupines that follow fire are 
Dove and Coulter's lupine. Parry's Phacelia 
</P>
<P>
 Phacelia parryi * When it blooms: March-May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Chaparral and Coastal Sage in western Santa Monicas. 
Large-flowered and Parry's Phacelia currently blooming at Circle X Ranch.  
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Reaches two feet high with sticky, single or sparsely branched 
stems. Other related fire followers are Large-flowered Phacelia and California 
Bells. Large-flowered Phacelia is an abundant fire-follower which is lighter 
purple and blooms Feb.-June. Fire Poppy 
</P>
<P>
 Papaver californicum * When it blooms: April-May first season after fire. 
Rarely found non-fire years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where it blooms: Oak woodland and chaparral in central Santa Monicas. 
Currently blooming at Circle X Ranch. California Poppies blooming at Rancho 
Sierra Vista/Satwiwa.  
</P>
<P>
 * Description: Slender stems reach one to two feet high. The four petals are 
not as satiny as related California Poppy. Other related fire-followers are the 
Wind Poppy, which is darker orange-red and bush poppy, a short-lived shrub with 
yellow flowers that germinates only after fire. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where To Go Nature lovers can see 55 wildflower species currently blooming 
at Circle X Ranch and 66 species at Rancho Sierra Vista/Satwiwa, about a dozen 
which are designated as fire followers. * Who to Call The California Native 
Plant Society's local chapter is sponsoring Fire-follower Wildflower Walks, 
including one at 10 a.m. today (Sunday) at Cold Creek watershed. Call 
310-573-1805 for information. For area wildflower updates, Theodore Payne 
Foundation has a Wildflower Hotline--818-768-3533.  
</P>
<P>
 Cycle of Life The showy rebirth of wildflowers after fire is just one link in 
a cycle that has been occurring for thousands of years in our mountains. 1. 
Fires burn hillsides in winter, clearing brush and leaving layer of ash. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Rains fall the following spring. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Ash acts as fertilizer for wildflowers, which are first plants to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Following year larger plants continue to grow. Wildflowers come back for 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Next year woodier plants take over, smothering wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Fires burn hillsides and cycle starts again.
