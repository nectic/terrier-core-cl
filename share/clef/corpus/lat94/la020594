 Dear occupant -- Hope you still have something to occupy: Lorraine Hillman of 
Encino received a letter addressed to "Residents" -- but it wasn't junk mail. 
It was a handwritten note of sympathy from Cathy Martin of Vidor, Tex., who 
grew up in the house where Hillman lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been watching TV and seeing all the damage," Martin wrote. "I really do 
hope you didn't get hurt or suffer any damage. . . . I went to school at Reseda 
High. I have very fond memories there. If there is anything I can do, please 
let me know." 
</P>
<P>
 Hillman says: "I thought it was very touching and I plan to respond to Ms. 
Martin -- after I clean up." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But do we have that much rope?"Riots, fires, recessions -- and now an 
earthquake," London's Economist said in a recent issue.  
</P>
<P>
 "In times past, a Savonarola or a Moses would have warned Los Angeles that the 
gods had to be appeased. Sex-mad screenwriters would have been strung up along 
Sunset Boulevard; bureaucrats would have been trussed in their own red tape; 
defense workers would have created a massive altar out of old Stealth bombers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, let's not get carried away! We're sure that stringing up the sex-mad 
screenwriters should be more than enough to satisfy the gods -- not to mention 
us mere mortals. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrito wisdom: Earthquake songs are common, but there's a kind of irony in 
"Sin City," written 25 years ago by onetime Flying Burrito Brothers Chris 
Hillman and Gram Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
 They were living in Reseda at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sin City" -- yes, the title refers to L.A. -- warns: 
</P>
<P>
 This old earthquake's going to leave me in the poorhouse  
</P>
<P>
 Seems like this whole town's insane  
</P>
<P>
 On the 31st floor, a gold-plated door  
</P>
<P>
 Won't keep out the Lord's burning rein  
</P>
<P>
 "It was meant tongue-in-cheek," Hillman says now. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the high-rise reference. 
</P>
<P>
 That forecast, Hillman adds, was directed at a resident of a Sunset Strip 
condo -- his ex-manager.

 Whittier in shorts: Laurel Hall and Katy Ayer each sent along photos of a 
timely marquee in their hometown. "We in Whittier know from experience what you 
really appreciate after an earthquake," wrote Ayer, referring to the 1987 
Whittier Narrows jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting to note that the city was founded by a religious group whose 
name now takes on a sort of double meaning in seismic California. Aren't we all 
quakers?

 Even panhandling campaigns have sequels: A street gent with the ubiquitous 
"Why Lie? I Need a Drink" sign was spotted in Long Beach, standing next to a 
colleague, whose sign said: "Me Too." miscelLAny:

<P>
 The publishing notes in "Finnegan's Week," by ex-L.A. cop Joe Wambaugh, 
reveals that the book is cross-indexed in the Library of Congress under several 
categories, including "Hazardous wastes -- fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 A novelist might be insulted by such a description, except that this mystery 
does involve a toxic spill. It's a real whodumpedit.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Give us this day our daily bread" is a call to action for religious relief 
workers such as the Rev. Don Hargis, disaster relief coordinator for the 
Southern Baptist Convention who is overseeing preparation of about 90,000 hot 
meals daily for earthquake victims in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The meals are cooked by Southern Baptist Convention and Seventh-day Adventist 
volunteers and distributed free by the Red Cross at Van Nuys Airport and four 
other locations in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether on the scene or behind it raising money and collecting clothing, 
furniture and household goods, religious communities are lending a hand and a 
dollar, moral support and spiritual succor to victims of the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargis, who is based in Fresno, has greeted about 200 Southern Baptist women 
and men who have taken time from their jobs in Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, 
Oklahoma, Mississippi and California to volunteer in trained units that operate 
field kitchens out of tractor-trailers and a commercial catering van. About 250 
other volunteers have helped cleanup efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty Adventist volunteers a day staff two shifts in the denomination's mobile 
kitchen. Unlike the Baptists, Adventists have used almost all local volunteers 
-- more than 800 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious relief workers are experienced with disasters and with Southern 
California. "We were here for the riots, feeding people, and to help people 
sandbag and clean up during the Malibu and Laguna fires," Hargis said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hargis' volunteers dish out religion with meals. "Always," he said. "We always 
tell them that Jesus loves them and that's why we go to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can offer help," he added. "I believe that only God can offer hope, 
and I believe that that's what people are looking for when everything is 
crumbling around them." 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster relief ministry was founded 25 years ago, shortly after Southern 
Baptist scouts got caught in a hurricane near Corpus Christi, Tex., and began 
cooking food for the survivors. After the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, it 
signed an agreement with the American Red Cross to cook meals for disaster 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their disaster readiness may be more well-honed than that of some 
other religious organizations, the Baptists' and Adventists' spirit and sense 
of mission are emblematic of the response of religious communities across the 
board that are offering help on a non-sectarian basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council has been working to link 
resources and individuals in need. It is seeking donations of food, household 
goods and clothing, repair and building services. Call (818) 718-6460 for 
information or to request help. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seventh-day Adventists need local volunteers to service their kitchens. 
(818) 409-0114. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Charities Earthquake Disaster Fund has been distributing goods so 
hurriedly that it is experiencing a shortage. For the addresses of drop-off 
points, call (213) 251-3400. (Monetary donations may be sent to 1400 W. 9th 
St., Los Angeles 90015.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles has established a relief 
fund and a hot line, and mobilized 16 agencies to address crisis relief issues 
of food, legal and employment needs, loans, and counseling, among others. 
Contact the Jewish Federation Council Earthquake Relief Fund, 6505 Wilshire 
Blvd., Los Angeles 90048. Prospective hot-line volunteers may call (800) 
365-9065. 
</P>
<P>
 National and international organizations have also sprung into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Church World Service, affiliated with the National Council of the Churches of 
Christ, has issued an appeal for $500,000 to provide emergency and long-term 
assistance. (P.O. Box 968, Elkhart, Ind. 46515.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Conservative movement of Judaism has established the United Synagogue of 
Conservative Judaism Natural Disaster Relief Fund (155 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. 
10010), and the Aid Assn. for Lutherans has stepped up its donation-matching 
program. (Aid Assn. for Lutherans, 431 N. Ballard Road, Appleton, Wis. 
54919-0001.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of North and South America allocated $25,000 
and called upon members to contribute to its Greek Orthodox Archdiocese 
Earthquake Victims Fund (10 E. 79th St., New York, N.Y. 10021). 
</P>
<P>
 Another offer of help came from Taiwan. The Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu-Chi 
Foundation pledged $500,000 to help Santa Clarita Valley's poorest residents 
displaced by the quake and also wants to aid Sylmar and Santa Monica quake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do these groups and others want to help? Hargis says, "Within all of us 
there is that innate longing to help. I believe that when people hear there are 
others hurting, they think, 'Hey, this could be me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the locations of Southern Baptist-Red Cross feeding stations, call (818) 
781-3818. The California Southern Baptist Convention is accepting donations 
designated for disaster relief at 678 E. Shaw Ave., Fresno, Calif. 93710. DATES

WHEN GOD WAS A WOMAN; UCLA SCHOLAR GIMBUTAS' WORK PAINTED A DIFFERENT PORTRAIT 
OF THE FEMALE ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If a single man plant himself indomitably on his instincts, and there abide," 
Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, "the huge world will come round to him." It will 
also come round to a single woman thus planted on her instincts, and it came 
round most remarkably to the indomitable Marija Gimbutas, a UCLA professor who 
died Wednesday of cancer at 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Gimbutas, a Lithuanian immigrant, was a student of the paleo-linguistics and 
Paleolithic archeology. Through her studies, she inferred the existence of a 
European society that died long before Christianity was born. Evidence of it, 
even in classical mythology, was to be sought at the margins rather than in the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so academic. For many years, Gimbutas toiled in obscurity, known and 
respected by her academic colleagues but unknown to the larger world. Then, 
gradually, her work began to have an utterly un-foreseen relevance to a 
contemporary social transformation. For the world that Marija Gimbutas 
discerned behind the mental and social world in which we all now live was one 
in which women played a strikingly different, and larger, role than they have 
played in all of recorded history. 
</P>
<P>
 The buried memory of that lost world is what her books -- especially "The 
Language of the Goddess" and "The Civilization of the Goddess" -- sought to 
recover. And whether or not, for all her remarkable erudition, she ever quite 
established her historical case, her work has been deeply stimulating to 
feminist thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day when scholarship on "obscure" topics is under steadily increasing 
attack, Gimbutas' story has a clear moral. It is not only in the sciences that 
pure research yields discoveries whose relevance will only gradually and 
unpredictably become apparent. Gimbutas added luster to the reputation of UCLA 
during a long and distinguished career. May Gaea give her the welcome she 
deserves.

CLEANING UP SUPERFUND ITSELF; CLINTON TRIES TO INJECT NEW LIFE INTO THIS BUST 
OF A PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few would argue that Superfund, the 14-year-old federal program designed to 
clean up the nation's most polluted places, has been a success.  
</P>
<P>
 Superfund's problems have been as obvious as the toxic stew that has bubbled 
to the surface at the most egregious sites: too much litigation and too little 
cleanup. A recent RAND study concluded that as much as a third of all money 
spent on Superfund cleanup projects had gone to pay for lawyers fighting over 
cleanup responsibilities. And the discovery of new polluted sites has far 
outpaced cleanup at previously known sites. By last year, 1,286 toxic waste 
sites were on "Superfund's national priority list" for cleanup. But after 
government expenditures of $1.5 billion annually -- and more by private 
industry -- only 217 sites have been declared officially clean. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has pronounced the Superfund program "a disaster" and 
directed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to overhaul the act. But 
reaching consensus on just how to restructure Superfund has not been easy.  
</P>
<P>
 Given the political obstacles to consensus and the financial interests at 
stake, Clinton has put together a good, thoughtful reform plan. The proposal, 
presented to Congress this week, should cut the legal wrangling and costs and, 
most important, speed cleanup. Specifically, Clinton wants to establish a 
minimum national generic cleanup standard for specific types of wastes to 
reduce the need for duplicative studies and reviews at each site, and he wants 
to provide for greater community involvement in determining cleanup standards 
and future use of Superfund sites. Those ideas make eminent sense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also wants to create a fund, financed by the insurance 
industry, to settle claims on older sites -- sites over which the most intense 
legal wrangling takes place. Getting the industry to agree to this fund -- 
expected to generate between $500 million and $800 million a year -- will be 
tough, but something like this is necessary to finally move the process of 
toxic cleanup out of the courtroom and onto the waste site.

LEARNING FROM QUAKES: LOTS DONE, MORE TO DO; STARCH IN PARKING STRUCTURES; 
VIGILANCE IN MAKING GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parking garages are as integral to Southern California's automobile culture as 
freeways themselves. Without them many shopping malls couldn't survive; driving 
to work, to a medical appointment, to a college might be all but impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Northridge earthquake at least eight parking structures were damaged 
significantly. If the temblor had come only a few hours later, many lives 
surely would have been lost in these structures and many, many more cars would 
have been destroyed. Take these eight cases as one more warning to be acted on 
quickly, as a primary matter of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts are still studying why some parking structures tipped, tilted or 
collapsed in the San Fernando Valley, other parts of Los Angeles and Glendale. 
As The Times reported Friday, two key indications already have emerged. Precast 
concrete structures, linked together at the site, seem less seismically stable 
than cast-in-place structures. And cutting costs -- one of the appeals of using 
precast construction -- often invites trouble, even when building code 
standards are met. 
</P>
<P>
 Structural engineers will have to first agree on what changes are needed and 
then recommend changes in the Uniform Building Code. The problem is that the 
code isn't scheduled for review until 1997. Ensuring parking structure safety, 
in terms of either new construction or retrofitting, must not wait until then. 
The California Building Standards Commission could require local governments to 
meet higher standards a lot sooner; it should do just that, as soon as 
practical. Lives are at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is helping many quake 
victims climb back from disaster. But, as Times staff writer Carla Rivera 
reported, FEMA has sent checks to some who may not be eligible. To that, the 
agency's director vows that federal and state inspectors will verify every 
check, mistakes will be rectified and cheaters prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers need that reassurance, especially while President Clinton's 
$8.6-billion earthquake aid bill works its way through the Congress. Any hint 
of fraud will cost votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate in Congress is not limited to how much money Southern California 
should receive. Many politicians are using the temblor to posture on other 
issues, from illegal immigration to the federal deficit. Certainly vigilance in 
all government programs is needed, as fraud in the post-quake emergency food 
stamp program showed. But vigilance always must be tempered with common sense 
and compassion. If fraud has occurred -- perhaps even substantial criminality 
-- then the violators must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But 
this does not eviscerate the essential value of the effort: to help the quake's 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, FEMA has improved aid delivery. After the 1992 riots here, checks took 
too long to arrive and more than half of those who filed applications failed 
the documentation requirements. In response to last year's Midwest floods, the 
Clinton Administration revised the rules to provide more timely relief and this 
region has benefited from that new policy.

REGULATING SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an American Cancer Society volunteer dedicated to the society's goal of 
reducing the devastating human and societal toll exacted by tobacco use, I 
heartily endorse the position taken in your editorial "Smoke Screen" (Jan. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 No Californian should sign the petition put forth under the rubric of the 
"California Uniform Tobacco Control Act." To do so would offer the Philip 
Morris Co., the principal sponsor, the opportunity to potentially subvert or to 
destroy more than 300 city and county local ordinances written to protect 
nonsmokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke. Local ordinances 
should not be overridden by a callous industry, which disdains the 
incontrovertible evidence proving its products are a public health menace. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco-related diseases are the single most preventable cause of disease in 
the U.S., yet they are responsible for more than 400,000 deaths annually -- 
approximately 53,000 of these attributable to secondhand smoke.

<P>
 * In your editorial you imply that passive smoke is a license to kill. As to 
the surgeon general's figure of 44,000 death attributed to secondhand smoke, 
that is the real smoke screen. There is absolutely no proof that secondhand 
smoke is responsible for a single death, let alone 44,000 annually.  
</P>
<P>
 You chastise the tobacco industry for trying to get a statewide smoking 
regulation in effect, instead of each city and county having its own. What we 
have now is the most unfair treatment to restaurant owners in cities where 
there is a ban. How would it work if you applied the same method to the 
seat-belt law or the helmet laws for motorcycles and bicycles? Should cities 
have their own regulation? 
</P>
<P>
 You say gross human stupidity could be prevented by fighting the tobacco 
industry. I believe a greater amount of stupidity will take place if we kill 
our tobacco industry, as the anti-smoking Establishment would wish by the year 
2000. Some research should be directed toward the devastating financial impact 
such a move would bring about.

INFORMATION HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Jan. 23 editorial on connecting classrooms and libraries to the 
information highway identified the vitally important question of public access 
to the information highway. But your discussion did not articulate that 
universal access includes much more than simply connecting to the information 
highway.We need to accompany that connection with the associated capabilities 
to make that connection functional. That means wiring the classrooms, providing 
computers and software, training the teachers and librarians, and making usage 
charges affordable. Only then will we have true access to the formidable 
capabilities of the information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 If we believe that public access to the information highway is essential, and 
I do, then we must find a means to pay for it. As chair of the Assembly 
Utilities and Commerce Committee I am committed to finding a solution and would 
welcome the input of others. Because there is a consensus on the need for 
universal access and a recognition of the value of computers in schools and 
libraries, I am certain that a solution will emerge this year that will ensure 
true universal access.

SPIRIT OF LOS ANGELES IN QUAKE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a foreign correspondent who has lived and worked in Los Angeles since 1970 
(and who lives right next to three red-tagged houses in the hills of Sherman 
Oaks) I would like to tell you how impressed I have been by the people of this 
city during the past two weeks -- by the way they helped each other, worked as 
long and as hard as was necessary and, above all, by the way they managed to 
keep their spirits up. 
</P>
<P>
 I was impressed by the workmen and by the DWP people who came at 1 a.m. to 
board up a heavily damaged neighbor's house and to check the cracks in the 
street respectively. I was impressed by the people running our local In-N-Out 
Burger who managed to cheerfully open in a heavily damaged area without power 
with the help of a generator. And I was impressed by the patient and 
sympathetic building inspectors who came by on a Sunday morning. I am not ready 
for "the Big One" but I'd rather experience it here than anywhere else.

 * I relocated my family to Los Angeles three weeks ago. It was a decision I 
had serious doubts about early on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been nothing but impressed by the response of local and state 
government, business and civic leaders and residents of our newly adopted home. 
After a few days of sheepishly admitting that I had moved to the Los Angeles 
area, I now announce it with some pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature and mankind have taken several mighty swings at Los Angeles. Things 
looked very bad in the opening rounds. I watched the riots on CNN from my safe 
haven in Hong Kong and sneered at this troubled American city clearly in 
decline.  
</P>
<P>
 Still in Hong Kong, but preparing to move, I watched the city and those 
surrounding it deal with killer fires. I sensed a change. Nature was a powerful 
opponent, but one whose challenge could be met. I saw things working, despite 
the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived the region's pain since Jan. 17 -- and I have increasingly sensed 
its pride. I have seen a community come together. I have seen real leadership 
from Mayor Riordan, true professionalism and dedication from police, fire, 
public works, gas, electric and transportation officials and workers, and 
honest corporate citizenship in the generous donations of the area's business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 I also have learned the strengths of the city and its residents. Those 
strengths are the reason people, and businesses, stay here. As the new guy on 
the block I say: "Well done, Los Angeles! I'm proud to be part of your extended 
family." And, I offer my hand to help.

 * Let's stop perpetuating the myth of this natural phenomenon being the wrath 
of Mother Nature toward the sinners of La-La Land. The fault-riddled earth 
under Southern California would have shaken whether we were here or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest FEMA public service announcement being aired refers to our once 
again having been subjected to "nature's fury." Do we really need this guilt 
complex on top of everything else? 
</P>

 We murder more people in Los Angeles County in one month than are killed in 
natural disasters in one year. Crime is still public enemy No. 1 -- not Mother 
Nature.

USC TAKES STUBBORN UCLA OUT; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: TROJANS OVERCOME LISA LESLIE'S 
FOUL TROUBLE AND BRUIN CENTER NATALIE WILLIAMS' PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The USC women's basketball team got only half a game out of foul-troubled Lisa 
Leslie and also had to overcome poor first-half shooting Friday night, but 
still finished strong to beat UCLA, 85-70. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans -- who outscored UCLA, 49-30, after a tightly played first half -- 
preserved their No. 5 national ranking and moved to 16-1 overall and 9-0 in the 
Pacific 10 Conference before 1,609 at the Lyon Center. UCLA is 10-8, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, the Trojans' 6-5 senior All-American, was matched against 6-1 senior 
Natalie Williams, who tore USC apart after Leslie went to the bench in the 
first half with her third foul, barely six minutes into the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams, one of the nation's best rebounders, finished with a career high 23 
rebounds. But in the first half, when UCLA was driving to a 40-36 lead, she had 
21 points and 16 rebounds. She finished with a game-high 28 points in 39 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' 23 rebounds were the second highest one-game figure in UCLA history, 
behind 25 by Denise Curry in 1978. And it was Williams' fifth 20-rebound game. 
</P>
<P>
 But few of those occurred with Leslie in the game. Leslie, the national leader 
for the player-of-the-year award, played 20 minutes and had 17 points and 14 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA got what it needed early -- Leslie in foul trouble -- but Kathy Olivier's 
team needed a bigger lead than it could achieve with Leslie out. 
</P>
<P>
 USC shot 41.9% from the field after hitting only 29.3% in the first half. UCLA 
shot only 30.6% for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' first-half lead reached 29-19 at one point, but USC had recaptured 
the lead by the time Leslie picked up her fourth foul with 10:39 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Thompson, a freshman from Inglewood, scored eight points in a four-minute 
span that resulted in a 55-49 USC lead, shortly before Leslie went out with her 
fourth foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Olivier paid tribute to the winners afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very good," she said. "What are they ranked, fifth? They're in the 
top four in the country. They got to rest their starters in the first half 
tonight, then they poured it on in the second half.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been nice to have Lisa and Natalie on the floor at the same 
time -- it's too bad we have referees." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach Cheryl Miller saluted some substitutes who brought their team to a 
driving finish -- Jody Anton and Cindy Page. Anton, a sophomore from Brea who 
has played with a hip pointer for a month, had a string of missed 
three-pointers in the first half, but finally found the range. 
</P>
<P>
 She sank two while USC was opening the margin midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson gave USC the lead for keeps at 47-46 with 16:08 to go. After that, 
with Leslie in the game and hitting short jumpers, the Trojans quickly produced 
an 11-point lead, on Anton's three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, Miller said, has registered three major efforts in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tina is a freshman-of-the-year candidate now, and if she keeps this up, she's 
an All-American candidate," Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tina shut down Rachel Hemmer of Stanford last week. She's just done a great 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Rapidly improving junior off guard Karleen Shields had 15 points and two 
steals in 21 minutes.

ANOTHER FIRST FOR DUCKS; HOCKEY: HEBERT MAKES 22 SAVES AGAINST CANUCKS TO 
RECORD TEAM'S INITIAL SHUTOUT AT HOME, 3-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean Hill toyed with the puck behind the Mighty Ducks' net as the final 
seconds wound down, then skated around to present it to goaltender Guy Hebert 
with a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert had just shut out the Vancouver Canucks, 3-0, in front of a sellout 
crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena on Friday for his second shutout of the season 
and the third of his career.  
</P>
<P>
 It was also the Ducks' first shutout at home. 
</P>
<P>
 This was one game in which there weren't enough pucks to go around. Hebert had 
to make only 22 saves, and spent much of the third period watching the action 
from afar as the Ducks played conservative offense and clogged up the neutral 
zone at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my favorite spot to be in, when the puck's in the other zone," Hebert 
said. "This was great for our fans. We'd had a tough time at home and hadn't 
had the results we wanted. But tonight everyone was blocking shots and the 
forwards were coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a team effort -- "a full 60 minutes," Coach Ron Wilson said -- and it 
moved the Ducks into sole possession of third place in the Pacific Division and 
the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 They also broke a three-game winning streak by the Canucks, who are second in 
the division. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just a good, old-fashioned whupping," Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn 
said. "They beat us to the puck all night. I don't care if on paper we have 
more talent, you're not going to win if the other team wants it more and plays 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert, who is 9-5-2 in his last 16 decisions, had to make 38 saves Dec. 15 
against Toronto to record the first shutout in Duck history. This time, it was 
much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he had a couple of point-blank saves," teammate Terry Yake said. "We 
expect that from our goalies. For the most part, I think it was one of his 
easier shutouts, but you'd have to ask him. It's a big deal for all of us, not 
just Guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks led, 2-0, after the first period. They scored a shorthanded goal at 
4:32 when Shaun Van Allen took a pass from Joe Sacco off the boards and carried 
the puck in to the left circle for a slap shot. His shot seemed to glance off 
goalie Kay Whitmore's left pad, but the puck still found its way into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov, who returned recently from a seven-week layoff with a 
dislocated left elbow and had sat out the last two games because of lingering 
soreness, scored the Ducks' second goal on a perfect pass from Tim Sweeney at 
15:26. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney held the puck in the right circle and faked a shot as Semenov cut to 
the net, then passed across the slot to Semenov, who scored from just in front 
of the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by two goals, the Canucks tried to counter with aggressive 
forechecking. With the Ducks trying to clog the neutral zone, the result was 
mostly a game that seemed to go nowhere, and a scoreless second period. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-goal lead was too tenuous for the Ducks to relax until late in the 
third, when Bob Corkum's goal at 16:04 made it 3-0. The goal, assisted by Garry 
Valk and Sean Hill, was Corkum's team-leading 18th. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Bill Houlder, who is the team's third-leading scorer but is a 
minus-19, was scratched for the first time this season. The decision was 
probably because of Houlder's most recent blunder, when his bad pass in the 
defensive zone led to the tiebreaking goal in a loss to Calgary on Wednesday. . 
. . Sunday's game against the Chicago Blackhawks at Anaheim Arena is a rare 
afternoon game, with a 1 p.m. start. . . . The crowd of 17,174 was the 11th 
consecutive sellout at Anaheim Arena, and club President Tony Tavares said the 
Ducks might sell out all their remaining home dates this season.

 Your heartwarming story about Karleen Shields in the Jan. 30 edition caused me 
a great deal of concern. While I realize Ms. Shields may have a transportation 
problem, she should be aware, as a caring mother, that she is endangering her 
daughters by riding three on a bicycle. It is also illegal, as is the lack of 
helmets on anyone under age 18 on a bicycle.

 Has anyone looked into a conspiracy theory regarding the Super Bowl? Isn't it 
strange that Buffalo was ahead at the half, 13-6, and then the Cowboys came 
roaring back and shut the Bills out in the second half, 24-0? 
</P>

 Methinks the Cowboys and NBC, wanting to avoid another blowout like last year 
and the subsequent loss of viewers, decided to make it interesting for a half

THE TRAVAILS OF TONYA: FEELINGS WELL MIXED RIGHT DOWN THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Randy Harvey's laughable qualities is his uncanny ability to answer 
unasked questions. Humorist he is. Judge he is not. 
</P>
<P>
 His litany on the "crime" of Tonya Harding (Jan. 28) is supported by a quote 
from an obscure U.S. Olympic Committee member and a ho-hum recitation of the 
USOC code of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Has he observed any miscreants in the athletic world guilty of equally heinous 
"crimes" other than this 23-year-old, 113-pound "criminal" from Portland? His 
pious dictum on Tonya's failed responsibilities as a citizen and Olympian has 
fallen on at least one pair of deaf ears.

 Congratulations on your Jan. 28 lead story on Tonya Harding. Randy Harvey

the game."

<P>
 Randy Harvey's harsh criticisms of Tonya Harding in his front-page commentary 
are unfair and unfounded. Mr. Harvey expects a standard of behavior from 
Harding beyond anything required of any human being, even a prospective Olympic 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Mr. Harvey completely fails to comprehend the enormous complexity 
inherent in Harding's situation. What would Harvey do if he discovered that his 
wife, relative, or even a close friend had committed a serious crime -- say 
disabled a rival journalist? Would he immediately and unconditionally notify 
the authorities, even when he didn't know all the facts, and even when he knew 
that such a confession would likely ruin what he had strived for the better 
part of his life to achieve?

<P>
 Tonya Harding's emotional plea to remain on the Olympic team because she wants 
to represent her country is complete bunk. Money and fame are her prime 
motivators. As a two-time Olympian and a Vietnam veteran, I say that 100% of 
the athletes who ever qualified for the U.S. Olympic team did it for 
themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 If she wants to represent her country, she should politely withdraw her 
position on the Olympic figure skating team before she is further embarrassed 
and seek out her local Army recruiter.

 Mike Downey (Feb. 2) is more predictable than the Raiders' fourth-quarter 
offense. Only a fool could have expected such a righteous, self-styled, 
working-class hero like Mike to come out against Tonya Harding. Rich vs. poor, 
the old boss vs. the new boss, male vs. female, you can always rely on Mike to 
be politically correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that Tonya shows every sign of being a Hall of Fame liar. Forget that 
this iron-willed dynamo, with her tough-talking mom, looks about as easy to 
manipulate as Bruce Smith's shoe. No, our gallant defender of "tiny Tonya" 
can't help but sympathize with his plucky little victim, while letting loose an 
ad hominem blast on the rest of the Gillooly Gang.

 Call me an old-fashioned kind of guy, but I remember when the only suspense in 
the weeks leading up to the Olympics concerned who was going to make the team. 
Years from now, the 1994 Winter Games will be remembered as when the Olympics 
met "America's Most Wanted."

 Davis Love III and Tom Watson took advantage of relatively sedate conditions 
and light winds to reach the top two spots on the leader board Friday in the 
second round of the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bulk of the vast gallery flocked to Poppy Hills to watch celebrity 
amateurs, Love and Watson played at Pebble Beach amid what Watson called 
"pretty easy scoring conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Love had four consecutive birdies in a six-under-par 66 that put him at 135, 
nine under par, through 36 holes.

 Watson had a 67 for 136, tied with first-round leader Dudley Hart.

PEPPERDINE BACK ON TRACK, 77-64 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing to Loyola Marymount last week, Pepperdine was on the verge of 
falling out of the West Coast Conference title race. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Waves climbed back into contention with a 77-64 victory over Portland 
Friday night before 2,413 at Firestone Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Dana Jones, the Waves' leading scorer the last two seasons, had a 
career-high 31 points and added 14 rebounds as Pepperdine, 12-7 overall and 4-3 
in the WCC, moved into a four-way tie for second with Portland, San Francisco 
and Santa Clara.  
</P>
<P>
 The Waves also pulled to within two games of Gonzaga. Pepperdine plays its 
next two games against the Bulldogs, including tonight at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can control our own destiny," Coach Tom Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine shot 51.6% in the first half against Portland (11-11, 4-3) and led 
by as many as 14 points before settling for a 38-28 halftime lead.

NHL ROUNDUP; LEMIEUX STILL NOT READY, BUT BARRASSO IS FOR PENGUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pittsburgh Penguin star Mario Lemieux didn't make his return Friday night, but 
Tom Barrasso certainly did. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguin goalie showed little rust after a 14-game absence, making 29 saves 
and leading his team to a 6-3 victory over the Red Wings at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was razor sharp," Penguin Coach Ed Johnston said. "He made a couple of 
great saves when the game was close. After we got up 5-2, we got a little 
lackadaisical, but Tom made some big saves again." 
</P>
<P>
 Barrasso's biggest save perhaps came early in the second period. With Detroit 
leading, 2-1, Dallas Drake shot from point-blank range only to have Barrasso 
kick it aside. The Penguins eventually went ahead, 3-2, later in the period and 
stayed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrasso had been sidelined since Dec. 28, when he sprained his knee against 
the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux participated in the Penguins' Friday morning skate, but left after a 
few minutes. He missed his 35th consecutive game, still recovering from 
off-season back surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Washington 0 -- Vincent Damphousse scored three goals for the 
second time this season and Patrick Roy stopped 24 shots for his NHL-high sixth 
shutout as the Canadiens won at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg 2, Hartford 2 -- Geoff Sanderson scored the tying goal in the third 
period as the Whalers came from behind to tie the score at Winnipeg, extending 
the Jets' winless streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 7, Florida 2 -- Randy Wood scored twice at Miami as the Sabres handed 
the Panthers their worst loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Ottawa 2 -- Valeri Zelepukin scored twice at East Rutherford, 
N.J., and the Devils avoided their first three-game losing streak of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Edmonton 1 -- Rich Sutter had two goals to help the Blackhawks beat 
the Oilers at Edmonton. Sutter, who grew up near Edmonton, opened and closed 
the scoring against the Oilers, who have one victory in their last 11 games.

NBA ROUNDUP; HAWKS WINNERS AS PUSH COMES TO SHOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A third-quarter shoving match seemed to provide the spark for the Atlanta 
Hawks, who responded by surging to a 19-point lead and holding on to defeat New 
York, 114-102, Friday night at Atlanta, ending the Knicks' six-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made some kind of statement," Atlanta's Craig Ehlo said.  
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation began with 8:33 to play in the third quarter when John 
Starks was called for an offensive foul, an elbow to the jaw that knocked down 
Ehlo. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks and Ehlo got into a shoving match, as did Kevin Willis and Patrick 
Ewing, with all four players drawing technical fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins scored 34 points and Willis had 25 points and 14 rebounds as 
the Hawks moved one-half game ahead of the Knicks for the best record in the 
Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 101, Golden State 99 -- Scottie Pippen scored 30 points and the 
streaking Bulls held off the Warriors at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Horace Grant added 24 points for Chicago, which improved to 3-0 on its 
six-game trip. The Bulls have won four straight games overall and 11 of their 
last 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 98, Orlando 92 -- Vin Baker gave Milwaukee the lead for good with 
2:23 to play and Eric Murdock made four free throws in the final minute as the 
Bucks ended a five-game losing streak with the victory at Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Brickowski had 21 points for the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal led Orlando with 29 points. He and Anfernee Hardaway, who had 
28 points, 13 rebounds and seven assists, fouled out in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 100, Boston 91 -- David Robinson scored 34 points at Boston and 
the Spurs extended their winning streak to six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Del Negro's streak of 50 consecutive free throws ended in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 124, Charlotte 118 -- Rony Seikaly scored 10 of his 21 points as the 
Heat outscored Charlotte, 30-12, to open the third quarter at Charlotte, N.C., 
then held off a comeback to hand the Hornets their fifth loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 108, Detroit 84 -- Kendall Gill scored 18 points at Auburn Hills, 
Mich., as the SuperSonics handed the Pistons their 21st loss in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 114, Minnesota 93 -- Rik Smits scored 21 points at Indianapolis, 
leading the Pacers to their fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacer Coach Larry Brown collected his 454th NBA victory, tying him for 17th 
place with Billy Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 102, Philadelphia 95 -- Tom Gugliotta had 24 points and 10 rebounds 
at Philadelphia as the Bullets won for only the fifth time in 22 road games. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon scored 29 points for the 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 108, Sacramento 83 -- LaPhonso Ellis scored 19 points and Mahmoud Abdul 
Rauf and Brian Williams had 16 and 15 points, respectively, to lead the Nuggets 
at Sacramento.

SOMEBODY'S EX REVIEW PUTS WORDS BEFORE MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's typical of a self-absorbed music critic like Mike Boehm to focus on the 
lyrical content of a (band's songs), with almost complete disregard for its 
musicianship. Case in point: Somebody's Ex and its debut CD, "Defective" 
(Record Reviews, Jan. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm's biased critique of the songwriter's so-called "frank expression of 
female lust" is pretty irrelevant, considering that this band's first effort is 
brimming with solid musical content. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it not important that this all-female group has come up with some extremely 
potent original material its first time out? Perhaps if Boehm had caught the 
band's show at the Coach House, he might have been more informed. 
</P>
<P>
 Why trash an artist solely because you don't happen to share the point of view 
expressed in his or her lyrics? 
</P>
<P>
 Hats off to the three-chord thrash tunes from the other bands featured on the 
TimesLink phone excerpts.

MOVIE REVIEW; ECOLOGICAL 'SAVIORS' GO ON THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Saviors of the Forest" (showing weekend mornings at 11 at the Monica 4), a 
feature-length look at the disappearing rain forests, is being touted as a 
"comedy documentary." 
</P>
<P>
 It's actually more whimsical than comedic, per se, but you can understand why 
they picked the tag. The two guys who made it want to put out an amusing piece 
that's user-friendly to those who might not sit still for hard-core 
environmental agitprop, and in that they do a good job. Unfortunately, they 
also want to capture some of the populist aura of "Roger and Me," which is 
biting off more than they can chew. (Or should that be chopping down more than 
they can saw?) 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's very loose through-line is cameramen-cum-directors Bill Day's and 
Terry Schwartz's own quest to find an ecological story of value to film down in 
Ecuador. The corporate villains they hope to stumble across prove elusive. On 
the heroic side, they do find some British idealists who've formed a small, 
politically correct lumber company that intends to introduce "sustainable 
forestry" to the Ecuadorean villagers who sell their fields, as an alternative 
to the clear-cutting done by the bigger companies. But the Brits' equipment 
gets held up for weeks in customs, so the documentarians come back to L.A. and 
film a Greenpeace raid on a lumber ship. Then they go to Spain to look for an 
environmentalist financier, who turns out to be in Mexico. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the fleeting "comedy" comes from Day and Schwartz wandering from 
country to country, trying to find a theme for their film and a subject for 
their well-meaning activism. They never do. Most filmmakers would keep that 
kind of confusion under wraps, but at least Day and Schwartz are as amiable as 
they are honest. They don't have nearly the wits required to pull off the 
Michael Moore routine they're attempting, but injecting their own quasi-bemused 
travails into the story does lend the movie's artless loose ends a little 
narrative drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And loose ends is all the movie really consists of, which is not to say the 
points covered aren't educational. You wouldn't want to clear-cut a path to see 
it, necessarily, but in its messy, intermittently diverting way, "Saviors of 
the Forest" does provide a reasonable primer in a lot of the key questions 
surrounding deforestation; for answers, you and the trees are still on your 
own.

SEEING THE HUMOR IN 'LIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading "Did Cultures Clash Over 'Schindler's'?" (Jan. 22) brought a smile to 
my face. Am I irreverent? 
</P>
<P>
 I am 42 years old, white, female.My daughter, 17, and I attended a showing of 
"Schindler's List" on New Year's Eve in Costa Mesa. We found ourselves finding 
humor (perhaps cynical) as well as horror, and compassion not only for the Jews 
but also for the Nazis. The whole situation was a tragedy. I am aware of the 
Holocaust and its atrocities to the Jews, but I felt this film transcended to 
the horror of the situation of all involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting of the Jewish woman, the engineer, rang with a cynical humor, but 
I noticed only a few very tightly held smirks. The small boy who hid in the 
latrine, only to be told it already belonged to someone else, was humorous. 
This feeling was not shared by a large percentage of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this was a cultural clash; perhaps I have seen too much intolerance. 
But isn't it funny that the Holocaust survivors didn't want those children 
there to disturb their memorial -- and on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, too? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but I find it humorous in a cynical sort of way.

THEATER REVIEW; TV'S 'JEFFERSONS' MOVIN' ON UP TO STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Jeffersons -- Movin' On Up Tour," which opened Thursday at the Vision 
Theatre Complex, is a staging of three scripts from the long-running CBS 
sitcom. But it's not so much a theatrical as a cultural event, treading as it 
does on nostalgia for the longest-running African American show of the 
mid-1970s to mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The three scenarios offer stock "Jeffersons" setups, pitting upwardly mobile 
George (Sherman Hemsley) against his wife, Louise (Isabel Sanford), and their 
maid Florence (Marla Gibbs), with neighbor Tom Willis (Franklin Cover), his 
daughter Jenny (Berlinda Tolbert) and Ralph the doorman (Ned Wertimer) also in 
on the squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
 In each story, George gets in trouble for his unthinking entrepreneurship and 
sexism. Yet by the end of the 22-minute scripts, George and Louise always kiss 
and make up, and George and Florence go on sniping at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jeffersons -- Movin' On Up Tour" is a straightforward transfer from small 
screen to stage. Normally, it's a crossover ploy that wouldn't be promising -- 
especially since staged TV has to compensate for scripts built around 
commercial breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet what saves the evening is that the original cast ensemble, directed by 
Edmond J. Cambridge, projects a surprising amount of presence, even in the 
1,050-seat Vision Theatre. And the opening-night crowd, which included "The 
Jeffersons" producer Norman Lear and civil-rights icon Rosa Parks, seemed 
especially glad to see the show in a venue that belongs to one of its stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs, who plays Florence and has owned the theater since 1990, is also 
planning to produce a season of plays at this location starting later this 
month. So as they might say on "The Jeffersons" . . . Go, Flo! 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; 'OZ' WORKS SOME MAGIC IN GLENDORA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theater-goers had to dodge a light drizzle to get there, only a few snowflakes 
fell during the poppy scene, Toto stole the show with every wag of his stubby 
tail and coy spotlights played hide-and-seek with the cast, but the familiar 
story worked its charm and the bubbly national touring production of "The 
Wizard of Oz" was a major crowd-pleaser at Haugh Performing Arts Center in 
Glendora on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The show moves to the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts today and 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 This recreation of the MGM film classic, with (limited) Flying by Foy and 
added material that was cut from the movie, is the Royal Shakespeare Company 
version that has been touring for several years. But judging from the vocal 
enthusiasm of Thursday's audience, its appeal for young and old is 
undiminished. 
</P>
<P>
 And, although the professional cast, directed by Richard Ericson and headed by 
Kim Smith as Dorothy, won't make you forget the originals, the actors do a 
respectable job with both the Harold Arlen/E.Y. Harburg movie score and John 
Dietrich's stage choreography, particularly in the riotous "Jitterbug" number, 
not seen in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 The spare bus-and-truck look of Kent Homchick's sets is made up for by 
designer John Carver Sullivan's lavish, colorful costumes and the rib-tickling 
puppets and creatures created by Big Nazo Studio, including assorted comic 
Munchkins and the great Oz himself, a giant head with rolling eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrific ensemble numbers and the small but spirited orchestra, led by 
conductor Kelsey Halbert, add excitement and depth. The elaborate lighting 
design by Tom Sturge would too, if not for Thursday's frequent glitches, one of 
which made the liquidation of the Wicked Witch (Ellen Martin) decidedly 
anticlimactic. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Smith and Martin, the cast includes Matthew MacDougall as the 
Scarecrow, Brad Wills as the Tin Man and scene-stealer Lennie Watts as the 
comic Cowardly Lion. Alezander M. Oleksij is the fraudulent but kindly Wizard 
and Debora J. Rascoe doubles as Aunt Em and a somewhat raffish Glinda. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Wizard of Oz," Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, 12700 Center 
Court Drive, today 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7 p.m. $16-$30; (310) 916-8500. 
Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes.

JAZZ REVIEWS; ELLINGTON WORK CAPS UNEVEN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, heard Thursday at the Wadsworth Theater, is 
essentially a repertory ensemble devoted to the works of Duke Ellington and 
other early giants, with only occasional bows to the present in the form of new 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 If the musicians paid attention to conductor Robert Sadin's odd gestures, they 
showed no evidence of it.In fact, the most effective conducting of the evening 
was seen when he yielded to trumpeter Jon Faddis, whose leading and playing on 
Dizzy Gillespie's "Things to Come" was one of the evening's few highlights.  
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra, though tightly unified, had difficulty at times in capturing 
the spirit of Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus and the other pioneers -- several 
of whom, incidentally, were not basically big-band figures.  
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble's music director, pianist Marcus Roberts, hammered away at an 
overlong original, later offering a less-than-inspired "Where or When." If his 
solos were the nadir of the evening, its zenith was reached with the closing 
Ellington piece, "Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue." This magnificent work was 
interpreted superbly, with Joshua Redman in the tenor sax solo made famous by 
Paul Gonsalves. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been claimed that jazz repertory groups are needed to perform for young 
audiences some of the great works they never heard played by the originators. 
It should be borne in mind, though, that the Ellington Orchestra is still 
around, as is the admirable Basie Band. Credit the Lincoln Center Jazz 
Orchestra with good intentions that are not too often realized. LEONARD FEATHER

JAZZ REVIEWS; CLASSY PLAYING FROM BURRELL AND FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You want a classic example of be-bop-based, straight-ahead jazz? Just listen 
to Kenny Burrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrell, one of the reigning monarchs of the guitar along with artists such as 
Jim Hall and Joe Pass, played with customary class in opening a three-night 
stand Thursday at the Jazz Bakery.He exhibited a gorgeous tone that was 
simultaneously dusky and gleaming, a sure-fingered rhythmic agility that found 
him always landing in the right place, and a sense for phrases that both rang 
sweetly in the ear, and gave the music a forward thrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed with panache by Dwight Dickerson (piano), Andy Simpkins (bass) and 
Sherman Ferguson (drums), Burrell mixed it up. There was Kirk Lightsey's 
"Habiba," which danced between Afro-Latin and Brazilian stances, and Blue 
Mitchell's "Funji Mama" -- underscored by a pulsating Caribbean beat. The 
rarely heard "No More" was delivered during a Billie Holiday medley, and 
Burrell played the acoustic guitar on J.J. Johnson's "Lament." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama" offered a typical Burrell improvisation, as he played cleanly picked 
notes followed by juicy bursts where the tones seemed to run together. His 
ideas always seemed to climax with a rhythmic pop. On "Lament," he played an 
acoustic instrument and portrayed sadness within stunning, subtle textures. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickerson's solos included bluesy fragments and speedy swirls and Ferguson 
used his hands, not sticks, to highlight one improvisation. ZAN STEWART

HEALING L.A. ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to Christopher Knight for his commentary "The Question Should 
Be: Can L.A. Help Heal the Arts?" (Jan. 27). 
</P>
<P>
 As an immigrant artist living and working in Los Angeles since 1981, I have 
grown used not only to the neglect the arts have always suffered but 
particularly to the realization that the dominant classes truly don't want to 
acknowledge the crucial importance of our contribution to cultural life here. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, little by little, artists of color, working artists, immigrant artists 
started appearing in the rosters of cultural programs and initiatives. But we 
got another layer of authoritarian directives, rather than a true partnership 
with an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting artists to follow institutional directives reduces them to bureaucrats 
performing a job, rather than truly creative individuals following their 
feelings and imaginative powers. It reduces artists to children, incapable of 
self-determination. It silences us. It forces us into painful compromises from 
which we'll hardly be able to extricate ourselves. 
</P>

<P>
 The current economic and social desperation has turned many politicians and 
community administrators into arts boosters. It's true that some of the art 
they solicit can seem wan in face of the impossible social conditions it 
addresses. But few realistically expect art to achieve or present any kind of 
final solution. However, that's no reason it should remain out of the social or 
cultural discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 A troubling insinuation in Knight's article is that artists are making this 
art only because they are trying to stay afloat in these troubled economic 
waters. Artists have been engaged in art making with political and social 
agendas for ages, and the dogma that art must be useless and aesthetically pure 
went out with Modernism. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism surrounding community-based social and political art must 
knowingly address its objectives, structure and audience to define its 
significance. This kind of art needs and deserves real critical attention by 
Knight, not a blanket condemnation.

to us and time for us to reassert the inherent value of the arts.

TV'S COVERAGE ON DAY THE EARTH SHOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We were lucky -- the 6.6 earthquake didn't really make it to south Orange 
County, but kudos to our local TV stations for their outstanding coverage of 
the earthquake stories! I spent the entire day and evening glued to their 
broadcasts. They even outdid their wonderful job on the recent fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks again, L.A. commercial TV stations!

 The recent earthquake in Northridge was a true tragedy, but there was another 
tragedy that day: the television news coverage. Hour after hour of continuous 
news coverage after the first three hours was ridiculous. Especially since it 
was all the same information. This in itself was bad enough, but when on 
Channel 7 the newscaster started listing the victims of the quake and what they 
had died of, that was too much. Wasn't it bad enough that these people died?  
</P>
<P>
 I do think that updates during the day would have sufficed. I would like to 
applaud Channel 13. In the early evening they finally returned to regular 
programs. Enough is enough.

 I wish to express my gratefulness to Huell Howser for his positive programming 
after the earthquake! 
</P>
<P>
 While the different newscasters were interviewing angry, complaining, 
discouraged earthquake victims, Howser was interviewing hearty, courageous, 
optimistic victims who were not planning to move nor were giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 Three cheers to Huell, who continually brings uplifting coverage of L.A.

 At about 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 21, I was watching television and trying to relax. 
Like most of my fellow Angelenos, my nerves were so sensitive that I heard my 
neighbor, five houses down, sneeze. 
</P>
<P>
 During a commercial break, Harold Greene of KABC News came on the air to do a 
promo for the 11 p.m. news. His words were: "Is your water safe to drink? Tune 
in at 11 and find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Am I the only one who feels abused by this? Is this promo the same as being 
charged $3 for a $1 bottle of water? Why shouldn't I get such relevant and 
important news when it becomes available? Why must we be tortured for the sake 
of the news show's ratings? This type of promo has always bothered me, but I 
found it particularly abusive that night.

THE SHOW WENT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hurrah for the Music Center Opera Company on Jan. 23 for presenting an 
enjoyable and "moving" presentation of "El Gato Montes." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Hailey suggested in the pre-performance lecture that perhaps after 
experiencing the physical forces and trauma of nature we were ready to run the 
gamut of human emotions.This proved to be only partially correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the performance from first-row balcony seats was both physically and 
emotionally "moving." The balcony gently swayed, the crystal chandeliers 
tinkled, the audience audibly gasped, but the orchestra and performers never 
missed a beat. Judging from their reactions, one would never know that sizable 
earthquake aftershocks had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 MARILYN HOWLETT 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The decision made by the Los Angeles Music Center Opera to proceed with the 
performance of "El Gato Montes" on Jan. 19, two days after the earthquake, was 
unconscionable! 
</P>
<P>
 Bodies were being uncovered in the rubble, hundreds of people were sleeping in 
parks, utilities interrupted, freeways damaged -- there was general havoc in 
Los Angeles. Common sense and responsibility of any citizen would be to stay 
out of Los Angeles! 
</P>
<P>
 I chose not to attend, but, because the show was presented as scheduled, I 
will not receive a refund. I feel the Music Center was not using good judgment.

PLANETS IN THE EVENT HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was disappointed to see that Chris Pasles' review of the Pacific Symphony's 
recent concert ("Universal Language of 'Planets' Enhances Pictures," Jan. 7) 
did not note the blatant errors in the visual portion of the presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 For each Holst piece of "The Planets," a title screen was represented. What 
was shown for Venus was actually a Voyager picture of Neptune, and in the case 
of Uranus, a polar ice-capped Mars was featured. Perhaps director Marc Jacobs 
thought he could get away with "artistic license," but in this scientific age, 
with the true images of the planets well known, I find it inexcusable. 
</P>
<P>
 JULIE E. BIXBY 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Jacobs responds: I am sorry that Ms. Bixby's enjoyment of "The Planets" 
was impaired by the two inaccuracies she cited. The substitution of other 
images for Venus and Uranus were not arbitrary on my part but made for 
aesthetic reasons.  
</P>
<P>
 The pictures that were available to me of Venus did not present the planet as 
it is imagined by Holst ("Venus, the Bringer of Peace"). The image that I used 
under that title, a soft blue orb, would have fit the way that planet was 
pictured in Holst's day, when it was known as "the Blue Star."  
</P>
<P>
 The picture I needed for Uranus had to express the mystery inherent in the 
title "Uranus, the Magician." None of the shots I found of Uranus matched the 
picture I finally used of what appeared to be a planet shrouded in smoke.  
</P>
<P>
 I must stress that my version of "The Planets" was never intended to be an 
astronomy lesson, but an accompaniment to and interpretation of Holst's music, 
which, as I see it, explores the astrological effects of the planets on our 
lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Holst's view of the universe was not the photographic one we now enjoy in this 
scientific age. It was my intent to visualize his work, and, as a director, I 
did make use of "artistic license" in these two cases, in which I felt I had to 
go with the images I felt best reflected his music.

TWO MORE 'SHADOWS'

<TEXT>
<P>
 In reference to your article ("Putting the Shadow in His Place," Jan. 6), 
reader Zita Carno was correct in stating that Orson Welles was "The Shadow" in 
1937-38 ("Welles' 'Shadow,' " Saturday Letters, Jan. 15).However, it is very 
important to acknowledge the two "Shadows" who followed Welles. Bill Johnstone 
played the lead from the 1939 to the 1945 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Morrison, probably the actor most of us remember as "The Shadow," 
followed Johnstone until the series ended in 1954.

TV REVIEWS; GARNER, WOODWARD IN SWEET 'LESSONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Breathing Lessons," Anne Tyler's 1988 Pulitzer-winning novel spanning a 
single day in the life of a middle-aged couple, has been warmly brought to the 
screen by James Garner and Joanne Woodward for "Hallmark Hall of Fame" (9 p.m. 
Sunday on CBS, Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward's irrepressible homemaker Maggie Moran is a relentless dreamer and 
incorrigible optimist who constantly blurs the line between meddling and 
caring. Garner's husband, Ira, who runs a picture-frame shop, wryly maintains 
an embarrassed distance from his wife's scheming while quietly cherishing her 
big, blundering heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-stars appear so at home in these roles that they bring to Tyler's 
characteristically offbeat protagonists a warm, humorous luster that's 
refreshingly devoid of sentimentality. Like a quirky variation on Henry Fonda 
and Katharine Hepburn in the movie "On Golden Pond," or like a younger Hume 
Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in almost anything they do together, Garner and 
Woodward have merely to hold hands to cast the easy glow of happily married 
people reaffirming their love. 
</P>
<P>
 That dramatic conflict can indeed spring from such non-contentious, eccentric 
material is one of novelist Tyler's literary hallmarks. But bringing this off 
on the screen is another matter. Besides Garner's and Woodward's natural 
blending of opposites, the movie's primary achievement begins with the 
adaptation by producer-director John Erman and screenwriter Robert W. Lenski. 
</P>
<P>
 Anchored by the couple's larky car journey into the bucolic countryside to 
attend the homespun funeral of a family friend, the production (shot in 
Pittsburgh) segues from picturesque encounters with roadside characters (Paul 
Winfield's erratic driver who lives out of the trunk of his car, Joyce Van 
Patten's flamboyant widow, Eileen Heckert's waitress) to a subplot involving 
the couple's disaffected offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 The bittersweet ending, following Woodward's efforts to reunite her 
floundering, biker son (Tim Guinee) and jaded ex-daughter-in-law (Kathryn 
Erbe), is the perfect non-ending for a deceptively ordinary day that makes our 
couple's whole 29-year marriage seem eventful. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEWS; 'CISCO KID' IS BACK WITH JIMMY SMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cisco Kid, that dashing caballero and Robin Hood of the Old West who 
filled kids' imaginations for half a century, is back. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-eight years after the popular television series with Duncan Renaldo and 
Leo Carrillo ceased production, "The Cisco Kid" has risen from the dust bin of 
grinning heroes to come riding into your screen (Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m. on 
TNT cable). 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Smits, with an easy swagger and light romantic panache, proves a stylish 
match for the legion of Cisco predecessors, who include Warner Baxter, Cesar 
Romero, Gilbert Roland and Renaldo -- an enduring legacy that began with silent 
one-reelers inspired by a character created by O. Henry in a short story called 
"The Caballero's Way," published in the collection "Hearts of the West" (1904). 
Cheech Marin portrays Cisco's sidekick and comic foil, Pancho. 
</P>
<P>
 Without detracting too much from Cisco movie lore, this new "Kid" on the block 
shows true signs of the '90s. Director and co-writer Luis Valdez ("Zoot Suit," 
"La Bamba") has eliminated the bandido stereotype entirely. Like Batman, Cisco 
is independently wealthy and doesn't have to steal from anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, in this movie, set in 1867 in Mexico, he helps peasants defeat the 
racist French occupation forces and preserve the provisional government under 
Mexican national hero Benito Juarez (whom Valdez himself plays). 
</P>
<P>
 The plot bogs down toward the end; it is, after all, a "Perils of 
Pauline"-like cartoon. But here, in a rare instance, is a TV movie for Latino 
families that Latino children can warm up to. And not only them. After all, it 
was white audiences that made the Cisco Kid at least as popular as the Lone 
Ranger, Hopalong Cassidy, Gene Autry and Roy Rogers. There's that devilish, 
rakish streak that distinguishes Cisco from the white bread. It's not for 
nothing that his mount is named Diablo. RAY LOYND

 Most people agree that the nation's educational system is in a shambles, but 
as with any generality, that's not the whole story. Meet four teachers who make 
you wish you could go back to school in "Campbell's Portrait of a Teacher," at 
10 tonight and 2 p.m. Sunday on the Lifetime cable channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Rugged-looking Montana horseman Karl Wolf is an unlikely kindergarten teacher 
in a field dominated by women. In his playful classroom, Wolf provides a strong 
male role model whose warmth and creative style of "managed chaos" respects the 
individuality of his young charges and nurtures their natural eagerness to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iowa City, fourth through sixth graders have learned both practical and 
life lessons by interviewing community members about how they dealt with loss, 
disability and illness. Under the guidance of teacher Sharon Thomas, the 
students put the material into a photo exhibition, a videotape and an 80-page 
book. The less tangible results? Compassion and community connectedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Former civil rights leader Bob Moses' efforts to foster math literacy among 
minority students extend across the country. His innovative Algebra Project has 
given more than 9,000 at-risk children in urban areas the tools to pursue 
educational and career opportunities they might never have considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, Zoe Richards inspires responsibility and leadership in gifted 11th 
graders who meet physical and mental challenges living away from home, studying 
the natural world and operating a working farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Tune in for a glimpse at what education could be with widespread individual 
commitment and community support. LYNNE HEFFLEY

INTERIOR DECORATOR JOHN GARCIA OF SANTA ANA HAS ADDED ANOTHER GENERATION OF 
ROOMS AND KIDS TO THE MEXICAN-CONTEMPORARY HOUSE HIS FATHER BUILT IN '61. AFTER 
A FIVE-YEAR RENOVATION, THE FAMILY'S IN . . .; THE HOME STRETCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Garcia is never far from his roots: The Santa Ana home he lives in today 
is the one his parents moved into in 1961, when John was 18 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 The home was built by his father at a time when houses had yards -- and room 
to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 And, while some things have remained constant, much has also changed. Garcia, 
33, is married with a family of his own; he is well into a career as an 
interior designer; and, yes, the house grew and the yard got smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia has reshaped the home in which he grew up into a contemporary, 
multipurpose structure that speaks of his Mexican heritage and of a future 
where home and workplace are one. 
</P>
<P>
 The home includes living areas for Garcia and his wife, LeAnn; their two 
children, Alex, 4, and Adam, 18 months; a separate apartment for Garcia's 
mother, Lucille; an office for Garcia's design business and space for the 
preschool that LeAnn operates. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior of the home is very open, with one room visible from another and 
many windows inviting in the outdoor light and landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's father, Michael, was a custom home builder and built the home in the 
post-and-beam style that modern architects were working with in the early '60s. 
The original home had 3,000 square feet of living space and an attached garage. 
In the redesign, 2,000 square feet of space was added and a new garage built. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was a builder, so he designed this house with the post-and-beam look 
with lots of glass. The basic structure was very strong in the living room, so 
I kept to that. My dad had always said this was a Mexican-contemporary house, 
but when LeAnn and I decided to remodel we had to decide if we wanted to keep 
it a temple to the '60s with the little mosaic tiles and the redwood slating or 
(whether we wanted) to create something for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 They decided to do some of both -- build something different but keep the 
original concrete blocks, expanses of windows and suspended hearth that is a 
focal point of the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 The remodeling project, which took five years, was done in stages for physical 
and financial reasons. Throughout the remodel, the family lived in the home, 
working around the various projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through and gutted everything, redoing all the flooring, electrical, 
plumbing and ceilings," Garcia said. To increase energy efficiency, the windows 
were double-glazed and extra insulation was added to the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia took advantage of the house's location on a gently sloping hill by 
having the house spread over three levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the tone is a free-standing white stucco wall that appears to be the 
front of the house. At the center of the wall are two old wooden doors from 
Chile that open, not to the house, but to an entry stairway and garden area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the gates at the front to be like a Mexican wall to the street, but 
I didn't want it to feel fortress-like. There are lots of opportunities to look 
in and look out," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall's tall, contemporary lines are softened by the wooden doors, plants 
and the large pine tree around which Garcia built the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the wooden gates, a dozen steps lead down to the main house, and a view 
of the house unfolds. The entrance to the house is through 10-foot-high glass 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a grand entry here before, so these doors became really 
important to the overall feeling of the house. Plus, I like the idea that when 
you enter at street level, you look down through the glass doors and through 
the whole house," Garcia said. "I don't pretend to be an architect, but I do 
know something about form and space, and I am very influenced by the 
contemporary Mexican architects Luis Barragan and Ricardo Legoretta." 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that excites me most about this house is that it's very home- and 
hearth- and family-oriented. You walk in the house and see the kitchen. I think 
that's important. The kids are everywhere. That's a given. We have nice things. 
We have things the kids need. That's why I built the playroom as part of the 
house and next to the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican pavers were used throughout the main floor of the house, except in the 
family room and Garcia's office. They make for easy maintenance and allow the 
kids to ride their bikes in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 In the living room, Garcia kept the look spare, with reproduction Mexican 
chairs that he had upholstered in Pierre Deux fabric depicting Columbus 
arriving in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of the contemporary nature of the house and the Mexican 
colonial furnishings is that in Mexico itself there are so many different 
cultures living together. The Europeans brought the textiles because they could 
transport them easily, but they had the natives carve the actual furniture in 
the European style." 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed on a shelf near the fireplace in the living room are three wood 
carvings of monks by the Mexican artist Pinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those carvings have been there my entire life," Garcia said, recalling the 
day when he was about 8 and he asked his dad about them. His father took them 
down and showed him they were praying monks, not the carvings of the letter S, 
as Garcia had thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the living room is the dining room, which contains a mahogany table Garcia 
found at a used-furniture store. With leaves added, the table can extend to 10 
feet. Although the table came with eight chairs, the Garcias chose to pair it 
with six chairs they already had. The extra chairs are used elsewhere in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 On the west side of the dining room is the open kitchen. Originally, it was 
L-shaped, with dark woods. Garcia changed it to white laminated cabinetry 
that's easy to care for and added Mexican tiles with colorful fruit and 
vegetable designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids' playroom adjoins the kitchen and acts almost like a solarium, with 
60-inch high windows that open out. There is a separate sink and counter and 
storage space for toys. Garcia added indoor umbrellas because the room often is 
too sunny in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The family room and front lawn are in the space occupied originally by the 
garage and driveway. Garcia's office and a bathroom adjoin the family room in 
this area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I'd do differently is make my office larger," he said. "I 
didn't realize how much I would like working at home and how much clients would 
like to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the back of the house are the children's bedrooms and bath and a small TV 
room -- the room that was Garcia's bedroom as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the back of house are his mother's apartment and the space for LeAnn's 
preschool, both of which have separate entrances off a side street. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last big pushes in the remodel was the addition of another story, 
which became the master bedroom and bathroom. From the new floor there are 
views over the hills and, on really clear days, of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "LeAnn and I both work at home, and my mother lives here, but we're on 
different levels, so it works. We all try to help each other as much as we can, 
and only occasionally do we have really crazy days -- like when the kids are 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of work on the project, the dust has settled, and a new generation 
of Garcias has made the house their home.  
</P>
<P>
 "For LeAnn and me, the house is special because it gives a nod to the old 
while still encompassing the new," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior decorator John Garcia of Santa Ana has added another generation of 
rooms and kids to the Mexican-contemporary house his father built in '61. After 
a five-year renovation, the dust has settled.

FINISHES; NATURAL OR SYNTHETIC? SOME HARD, CLEAR FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At one time, the term varnish was used for any coating applied as a liquid 
that dried to a solid film. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, varnish is still a catchall term, but it is usually restricted to 
finishes that contain oil and natural or synthetic resins or, lately, latex and 
hardeners, such as polyurethane.  
</P>
<P>
 The new water-base latex varnishes go on white and dry clear, unlike the older 
formulations, which had a tendency to turn yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Polyurethane resins are found in just about everything -- they are hard and 
resistant to scratches, abrasions, heat and moisture, and hardly anything will 
stick to them. For high-traffic surfaces, such as tabletops and floors, it's 
hard to beat its durability. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, polyurethane has trouble holding its grip on raw wood, and spot 
repairs are difficult because an old coat won't accept a new coat. That's 
because polyurethane is so good a repellent that it will repel an additional 
coat of polyurethane once it has cured. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil finishes come next on the list of popular coatings. In the past, furniture 
was finished with linseed oil. Linseed oil, however, will not ever really dry 
hard. For that reason, most woodworkers prefer tung oil, Danish oils or other 
so-called penetrating oils. 
</P>
<P>
 Several coats of tung oil, which is usually sold thinned and fortified with 
drying agents, provide a low-luster satin finish that remains flexible and will 
resist moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Because tung oil dulls fairly quickly and does not resist scratches well, it's 
not the best finish for dining tables or other high-use surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Penetrating oils may contain tung or linseed oil, but they also are made with 
resins that harden in the wood. These finishes are actually thin varnishes, 
therefore. They offer the subtle appearance of an oil finish, yet are generally 
harder and more resistant to scuffs, abrasions and scratches. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellac is an old standby that has found new favor, although it has some 
drawbacks. It is available in dry form, but most woodworkers today buy it 
premixed with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a limited shelf life, though, does not cure well on damp days, and puts 
up a poor barrier for standing liquids. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not tougher than polyurethane, shellac will provide a hard 
finish that often will cling to wood better than a synthetic resin. It brushes 
on easily and dries with great speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacquer is probably the finishing product most popular with professionals 
because it yields a durable protective coating that dries fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacquer is usually applied with a spray gun (and it's highly flammable). 
Brushing lacquers are available to get you around the spray-equipment problem, 
but these are flammable too. New water-based substitutes are available for 
spray application. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that wax polishes come in spray cans, it's easy to forget that wax was 
originally a finish, not a finish dressing. The wax we're referring to here is 
paste wax, which is a blend of beeswax and carnauba wax. 
</P>
<P>
 Although paste wax can be applied over raw wood, the fact that it offers poor 
resistance to water means that you should apply a preliminary finish first.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: GLOSSY FINISH CAN BE SUBDUED WITHOUT STRIPPING 
THE WOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: I have a coffee table and a dining room table that have a very 
high-gloss finish. What can I do to the wood to give them a less shiny, more 
hand-waxed finish? 
</P>
<P>
 J.K.U. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "This can be done without stripping, but unless you're experienced 
working with wood, you may not want to tackle the job yourself," says Bob 
Espeland of Espeland Antique and Furniture Repair in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, you clean the table of any leftover waxes or polishes. A flattening 
should then be added to a satin finish before it's sprayed onto the tabletop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could also try taking fine steel wool and some paint thinner and try to 
rub out some of the finish, but you have to be careful. You might want to try 
it on an inconspicuous area first to see how it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We recently landscaped our front yard and used old railroad ties to create 
planters. We love the look. However, our son climbs on them and gets oil from 
the ties on his clothes. Is there any way to get the oil out of the ties? 
</P>
<P>
 J.R. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Railroad ties are soaked in oil to preserve them," says Steve Sink of 
Angelus Quarries in Santa Ana. "That's why they last so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really nothing you can use to pull the oil out because it's pretty 
much soaked through. Over time and weathering, you'll probably notice less of a 
problem with it. Until then you could attach some kind of plastic sheeting to 
them to protect clothing, or just monitor your son and keep him away from the 
ties." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'd like to install a 5/16-inch wood-plank floor over my original wood 
floor, which is far beyond refinishing. I'd also like to extend the floor into 
the kitchen, which has vinyl tile over linoleum over plywood. The top of the 
tile is level with the old wooden floor. Is there any kind of special 
preparation I need to do to make sure the planks attach to both surfaces? 
</P>
<P>
 J.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 A: "There's not a problem in installing a wood-plank floor over an existing 
floor, but you have to remember to lay it out in the opposite direction," says 
Cal Chamberlain of Chamberlain Floors in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is because the planks tend to expand and contract sideways, and laying 
the new floor out in the same direction may cause it to separate over time. You 
may want to put 1/4-inch plywood over the entire surface before laying your new 
floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'm convinced that the reason my bathtub sink has been clogging recently is 
because the cheap soaps my husband buys have melted down the drain and have 
created a buildup. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this happen and what gets rid of it? 
</P>
<P>
 W.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A: "Your problem's probably not caused by soap alone," says plumber Ed Grane 
of Anaheim. "Hot water tends to dissolve soap. Most bathtub-stopping problems 
are caused by hair that collects and plugs the drain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't get any results from using a plunger, you may have to try a 
manual or electric snake to get in there and push it through." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Growing up years ago, my father used to tell me that you should never paint 
while it's raining. Is that true? What kind of problems will I have if I paint 
on a rainy day? 
</P>
<P>
 E.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A: "That isn't true, unless, of course, you're painting your exterior," says 
house painter Roger Sanchez of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humidity affects drying time, and if it's raining, the room you just painted 
will take longer to dry because the humidity is so high. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, don't think you have to postpone your job. Just be aware that the 
walls will be wet longer than normal."

DECOR; 'MASCULINE' FURNISHINGS GAINING APPEAL 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mainstay home furnishings are taking on motifs traditionally considered 
men-only looks: trophies being displayed as sculptures, sheriff's badges added 
as accent pieces, beds finished in plaids. 
</P>
<P>
 "The collections are not billed as for men only, but they have a very 
masculine feeling," says Anne Buley of Wallcoverings Windows & Interior Fashion 
magazine, a trade publication in Stamford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there's the new Western Frontier collection by Seabrook 
Wallcoverings of Memphis, Tenn. It includes wallpapers with textures that 
imitate denim, khaki and barn wood and borders of red bandannas, a main street 
of the Old West and a melange of cowboy boots and sheriff's badges. 
</P>
<P>
 The wallpaper was created to complement the rustic look that is popular now, 
according to Jim Seabrook, president. His company also markets golf, tennis and 
fishing patterns in its "Gentlemen's Club" collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Ash, a Seabrook spokeswoman, says she recently attended a wallpaper 
hanging clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost half the people there were male professionals who wanted to learn how 
to hang their own wallpaper," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Masculine bedroom accessories, not just those by Ralph Lauren, are 
increasingly bought by both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cowboy themes, plaids and paisleys now are so popular that they've gone 
beyond a men-only look," says Rose Gerace, director of public relations for 
Westpoint Stevens Home Fashions, the bath and bedding people in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, what was once a byway in the world of antiques has become a 
better-traveled road as pieces with a decidedly masculine appeal become more 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 An antiques show of men's collectibles is set for April 15-17 at the 
Metropolitan Antiques Pavillion in New York, where about 50 dealers are 
expected to offer old sports trophies, desk accessories and writing 
instruments, scientific instruments, canes, men's jewelry such as watches and 
cuff links, cameras, bar items and smokers' accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men are taking a more active role in decorating the home, and they are among 
the most aggressive collectors," Cory Margolis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis, an antiques dealer in New York, originated the idea for the April 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's tons of stuff out there, a lot of it still in drawers," he says. "I 
find it at mall shows, outdoor flea markets and on house calls all around the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 From her vantage point of 25 years as co-owner of Man-tiques in New York, 
Elinor Zellin says the biggest change is that so-called men's collectibles and 
antiques are now used as decorative accents all over the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decorators are buying nautical items, bronze busts of historical figures, 
sporting prints and plates with images of historical figures and buildings," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She credits Ralph Lauren with promoting the masculine look. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made people aware that trophies are art objects," she says, "and he 
popularized the English country house look." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lauren introduced his home fashions in 1983, two of the four looks in his 
collection were masculine. His new home collection includes a comforter made 
from suiting fabric, as well as striped bed and bath linens and leather-covered 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, collections have included tartan plaid and chino bedding, 
Shetland wool and Harris tweed throws, fabrics with fishing motifs and almost 
anything equine.

DESIGN; NEW YORKER CAN BE THANKED FOR PUEBLO REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was only by chance that John Gaw Meem, a New York City 
engineer-turned-banker, chose Santa Fe as the site where he would recuperate 
from tuberculosis in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 After his doctor prescribed a sanatorium visit, Meem was walking by an 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway office when a window display featuring the 
picturesque landscape and adobe buildings of New Mexico caught his eye. He was 
persuaded to seek restored health in the desert Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 No one, including the mild-mannered Meem, could have guessed the changes he 
would undergo during recovery. He became so enamored with the region's 
indigenous building style that he trained himself as an architect and became 
the leading proponent of the design called Pueblo Revival. 
</P>
<P>
 That this Pueblo Revival style remains so recognizable is due in large part to 
Meem's efforts. When he first saw Santa Fe in the 1920s, it was already in 
danger of losing its signature Southwest architectural appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the 1880s, rail transport had made an unlimited supply of lumber 
and other building materials available. The town went Victorian. By the time 
Meem arrived, citizen groups were just beginning to worry that their heritage 
of Indian-Hispanic buildings was being wiped out by the influx of Eastern 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1924, Meem, by then an architect, became prolific at designing buildings 
that reflected Southwest traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Meem also emerged as a leader of the movement to protect Santa Fe's historic 
structures, and he helped write the Santa Fe Preservation Ordinance of 1958. In 
the city where he found healing, Meem helped ensure the future health of the 
Pueblo Revival style. 
</P>
<P>
 This style is identified as much by the materials from which the structures 
are made as by its design elements. It is adobe made from New Mexico's 
abundance of dry clay soil that has allowed these squat, thick, smooth 
structures to become the region's defining style. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of adobe goes deep into the pre-Columbian past, when Native Americans 
erected their communal homes, called pueblos, from hand-shaped layers of 
clay-rich soil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1600s, Spanish colonists refined the process by making sun-dried adobe 
bricks from the mud. Brick-wall exteriors were protected by a thin coat of 
smooth mud that had to be renewed each year. American settlers added kiln-fired 
bricks at the top of the walls. These baked-mud bricks were harder and more 
resistant to pounding rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Architecturally, Pueblo Revival homes have nearly flat roofs with parapets, 
roof-supporting timbers extending through exterior walls and dense, earthy 
walls. The style is a mixture of influences from both flat-roofed Spanish 
colonial buildings and Native American pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
 When the style is adapted today, an adobe appearance often is mimicked by 
coating 12-inch frame walls with a layer of earth-tone stucco. In the best 
examples, the stucco is applied so that corners and roof parapets are rounded 
and a bit irregular, giving the walls the traditional, handmade look of adobe.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; PREPARATION WILL ENSURE PAINTING GOES SMOOTHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you take time to prepare walls before painting them, they'll not only look 
better, but the paint will last longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemble Your Materials 
</P>
<P>
 For easy cleanup, you'll need plastic dropcloths, newspapers, large plastic 
trash bags and a roll of masking tape. For access, bring in ladders and boards 
for scaffolding. For repairs, have on hand spackling compound, plaster patch, 
wood filler, a heat gun or chemical paint remover, sander and sandpaper, tack 
cloth, vacuum cleaner and a spray can of primer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clear the Walls 
</P>
<P>
 Take down pictures and curtains. Remove picture hooks. Look for cracks, holes 
and peeling paint on walls and ceiling. Check the woodwork for loose paint, 
nicks, popped nails and separations at corners or at wall junctures. If there 
is wallpaper, you may want to strip it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove Furniture and Rugs 
</P>
<P>
 The more space you have to work in, the easier patching and painting will be. 
Move lightweight furniture to another room. Cluster heavy pieces in the center 
of the room. (Make sure you can reach the ceiling above the clustered pieces 
with a roller on a pole.) Cover them with a plastic dropcloth, and tie rope 
around the bottom to keep the cloth in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismantle Hardware 
</P>
<P>
 Remove knobs, latches and locks on doors and window frames. (To save removing 
a doorknob and all its hardware, loosen the escutcheon or plate behind the knob 
and tie a small plastic sandwich bag over it and the knob.) Take down curtain 
rods and brackets. Unscrew plates from electric switches and outlets. (To keep 
track of small pieces of hardware, tape them to the object with which they are 
used; for example, tape screws to the switch plate they normally hold in 
place.) If you have a ceiling fixture, disconnect it and take it down or loosen 
its plate and enclose it -- plate and all -- in a large plastic bag secured at 
the top with tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Masking 
</P>
<P>
 Mask windowpanes with tape or with liquid glass coating -- up to 1/8-inch from 
the muntin, the strips separating panes of glass in a sash. It's important to 
leave an unbroken film of paint adhering to the panes to protect wood muntins 
from condensation. Cover permanent installations such as built-ins and standing 
radiators with dropcloths. Tape plastic bags over wall sconces and thermostats. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover the entire floor (or carpeting) with plastic dropcloths, but ring the 
outer edges of the room with several layers of newspaper taped below the 
baseboards. Make a path of newspapers from the door into the center of the 
room. Newspaper absorbs wet paint and allows it to dry; plastic doesn't. Paint 
on plastic stays wet, and if you step on it, you're likely to track it into 
other rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Make Repairs 
</P>
<P>
 Fill hairline cracks on walls and ceilings by smoothing on spackling compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Fill larger cracks with patching plaster. To make sure the patch adheres well, 
chisel out a triangular channel in the wall -- narrower on the surface than 
inside -- and fill it with the patching compound. When it's dry, sand the 
surface smooth and prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Wash Down Surfaces 
</P>
<P>
 Use a heavy-duty detergent such as trisodium phosphate or a non-phosphate 
equivalent. Even fingerprints can keep paint from bonding properly. Clean any 
damp or mildewed area with a solution of one part household bleach to three 
parts water. Rinse and let the area dry completely before painting. Glossy 
surfaces may also need sanding, or an application of a commercial deglosser, 
for new paint to adhere properly.

CRAFTS; VERSATILE VINEGAR PAINT MAKES A DECORATIVE TOPCOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you liked dabbling with finger paints in grade school, you'll probably 
enjoy vinegar painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorating items such as furniture, boxes and picture frames with vinegar 
paint first took hold during the 19th Century. The paint was an inexpensive, 
colorful, easy-to-apply finish that people could make themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, interest in vinegar paint waned. Now the old paint has found new 
popularity. That's because of the decorative effects you can achieve with it, 
and because it's so environmentally friendly. You'll find most of the 
ingredients right in your kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the applicators and colors you use, you can create an array of 
colorful patterns that add pizazz to many projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what you need to batch up your own vinegar paints: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 cup white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 * 1 teaspoon white sugar 
</P>
<P>
 * a few drops of liquid dishwashing detergent 
</P>
<P>
 * powdered poster paints (tempera paints available at art-supply stores). 
</P>
<P>
 For supplies, have a measuring cup, measuring spoons, small mixing bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by combining the vinegar, sugar and detergent to make the base solution. 
Then using a separate mixing bowl for each color, stir together four 
tablespoons of powdered poster paint and enough base solution to make a paste. 
Stir in additional base solution until the mixture matches the consistency of 
cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinegar paints are designed to be translucent topcoats, letting an undercoat 
finish show through. In other words, don't try to finish raw wood with them. 
(If you have a raw wood item, it should first be sanded, primed and finished 
with two coats of semi-gloss enamel.)  
</P>
<P>
 Working on one area of your project at a time, brush on a topcoat of vinegar 
paint, being sure to let the undercoat show through. You'll have about 15 
minutes to "pattern" the topcoat before the paint dries. 
</P>
<P>
 Try a variety of applicators such as brushes, sponges, nylon scrub pads, 
wadded paper or plastic wrap. Experiment to see the variety of effects you can 
get with the different applicators. (Don't forget to try using your fingers.) 
</P>
<P>
 You can always wipe off mistakes with a vinegar-dampened cloth and start over. 
When you achieve the effect you want, let the topcoat dry for at least 24 hours 
and then spray on a coat of varnish to protect your artistry.

GARDENING; TIME IS RIPE FOR HEIRLOOM TOMATO COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A funny thing is happening to tomatoes. Taste is back, at least in some 
varieties destined for growing in home gardens.Apparently people insisted, and 
seed suppliers listened. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, most people under the age of 50 won't understand why. They've 
eaten only the bland offerings found in supermarket produce departments. Now 
Brandywines and other heirloom types are making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds have always been available from specialty firms such as Tomato Growers 
Supply Co. Heirloom-preservation groups, such as Seed Savers Exchange, also had 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the inherent problem of Brandywine and similar heirloom types -- they just 
can't be transported any distance -- kept them out of the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast that to this report on Brandywine from the 1994 catalogue of Johnny's 
Seeds, a major distributor: "Is this Amish heirloom the best-tasting tomato? We 
have not tasted better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson Jr., chairman of Johnny's, says Brandywine is one of seven 
heirlooms being carried for the first time, in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that all of us working on tomato development at Johnny's had been 
too rigid and conventional in our standards -- that the ideal tomato was firm, 
globe-shaped, red and grew on a compact plant. Look at all we had been 
missing!" 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson says he became convinced that consumers were being shortchanged 
"because the need of produce handlers for durability tends to contradict good 
taste features." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes Seeds, another major supplier, was even firmer: "Taste has still been 
completely forgotten by most plant breeders in the 1990s. . . . During the 
1930s, all tomatoes tasted great because most tomatoes were picked field-ripe 
and not shipped a long distance to market." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' offerings include heirloom-type Vendor tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Johnny's and Stokes offer free catalogues. Sources for Tomato Seeds

NEWS ANALYSIS; PEACE DIVIDENDS GUIDE POSTWAR RELATIONS; VIETNAM: RAPPROCHEMENT 
MAY HAVE BEEN SO LONG IN COMING BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF ANY POTENTIAL 
REWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In taking the first step this week toward normal relations with Vietnam, 
President Clinton has struggled with a dilemma as old as war itself: how to 
reconcile with a former battlefield enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 For combatants at any point in human history, the path from the end of war to 
the beginning of peace has rarely been smooth. And yet nations repeatedly have 
made the journey -- sometimes reluctantly, often ambivalently, almost always in 
pursuit of a newly defined national goal, like the economic opportunities 
Vietnam now presents to U.S. business. 
</P>
<P>
 History records exceptions, of course: Rome settled the third Punic War in 146 
BC by razing the city of Carthage, enslaving all 50,000 of its residents and 
sowing the earth with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 But more typically, even nations that have bled each other dry in wartime -- 
France and Germany in both World Wars, China and Japan in World War II -- 
eventually find ways to put the past behind them and resume active relations 
with the former foe, more often sooner than later. Less than five years after 
Adolf Hitler's army was driven from Paris in August, 1944, France and Germany 
were sworn to each other's defense as charter members of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 By those historic standards, many analysts consider the 19 years it has taken 
the United States and Vietnam to resume even commercial relations excessive. 
"The probability is that this (delay) will be seen as a very unusual event in 
the history of diplomatic relations," said Yale University historian Paul M. 
Kennedy, author of "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers." 
</P>
<P>
 History suggests that the most difficult wars to move past are those that 
divided a nation at home. Consider the case of the reconciliation-minded group 
of Confederate veterans who sought to raise funds for a statue of Ulysses S. 
Grant, the Union general who later served as President, in Richmond 37 years 
after the Civil War's end. "The fund," writes historian Michael Kammen, 
"fizzled at $16."  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the closest parallel to America's lingering agonies over 
Vietnam may be France's efforts to come to terms with its former colony in 
Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 100 years of colonial control, an uprising by Algerian 
nationalists beginning in 1954 sparked a bloody war that bitterly divided 
France and eventually forced Charles de Gaulle to negotiate independence for 
Algeria in 1962. Although the result was -- like the Vietnam War for America -- 
a tremendous blow to national esteem, the French government immediately 
recognized its former colony and made it the largest recipient of French 
foreign aid.  
</P>
<P>
 "De Gaulle was absolutely determined to make Franco-Algerian cooperation a 
model for post-colonial connections," said Stanley Hoffmann, chairman of the 
Center for European Studies at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, though, has been more ambiguous. At the government level, while 
never suffering the "deep freeze" that has characterized U.S.-Vietnamese 
relations, France and Algeria have frequently squabbled over issues such as oil 
and immigration, Hoffmann said. Today, France appears torn over how to respond 
to a violent insurrection by Islamic militants against Algeria's 
military-backed junta. 
</P>
<P>
 At the social level, relationships between the two countries "didn't exist," 
said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International 
Relations in Paris. "That has been a very difficult reconciliation process, 
because the French are not entirely reconciled with their own history in 
Algeria. The process is not only reconciliation with the other but yourself. 
The French have still not come to terms with what we did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 That psychological struggle may be the point at which the French experience in 
Algeria most precisely illuminates the American anguish over Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one constant to this process of peace-making in modern times, it 
is that nations have moved quickly to repair relations when they had a 
compelling reason to do so and let animosities fester when they did not. In 
determining the pace of reconciliation, assessments of future gains 
consistently seem to exert more influence than resentments over past losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, it is not the ferocity of the war but the potential benefits 
of the peace that guides how quickly nations bury their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The natural impulse," said Robert Dallek, a diplomatic historian at UCLA, "is 
to consult your interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Seen through this lens, many believe that a principal reason for the long gap 
in relations with Vietnam may have been the absence, until recently, of an 
irresistible reason to move faster -- especially given the fear among officials 
that moving to a normal relationship would provoke recriminations from 
Americans still angry over the issues that made the war so bitterly divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there was no overriding imperative to do this and there were all 
these other negative factors, there was perceived to be no reason to push it," 
said Asia scholar Alan Romberg, director of research at the U.S. Institute for 
Peace, an independent federal institution. 
</P>
<P>
 This hard-headed assessment of costs and benefits fits the tradition of 
postwar rapprochement in modern times.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the 20th Century, the major European powers displayed a bifurcated 
approach to reconciliation, said Paul Kennedy, who has studied the evolution of 
great power relations. Generally, the major European powers -- among them 
Britain, France, Prussia and Russia -- believed that cultural, racial and 
religious differences precluded lasting reconciliation after war with nations 
such as the Ottoman Empire that were outside "the concert of Europe," Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their dealings with each other during that period, the great powers 
changed partners from war to war as casually as dancers at a ball. "There was 
the assumption that national interest prevailed and you shouldn't have the 
hang-up of worrying about who you fought with in the last war," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1848, British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) Lord Palmerston 
turned this sentiment into an enduring epigram: "We have no eternal allies and 
we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and 
these interests it is our duty to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20th Century, the divide in attitudes toward reconciliation with 
Western and non-Western powers has not held as firmly. But Palmerston's compass 
continued to guide the process of making peace with old enemies, with states 
again placing primary weight on calculations of national self-interest rather 
than revenge or contrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, after World War I, fear of a renascent Germany led the French to pursue 
peace terms aimed at crippling its rival. But the United States and eventually 
Great Britain saw Germany as a potential bulwark against rising Soviet power 
and ultimately sought to bolster the defeated Germans by lightening the load of 
reparations. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, a different calculation of national interest dictated an 
even swifter American reconciliation with Germany and Japan, even though U.S. 
losses were far greater than in World War I and the barbarism exhibited by the 
defeated nations had been as savage as any in recorded history. Moreover, 
almost 80,000 U.S. soldiers remained missing in action at the end of World War 
II, compared to about 2,300 in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, with the Cold War looming, those natural resentments were chaff in 
the search for allies against the Communist states. "At that time, we in the 
United States thought it was to our interest to have Germany and Japan on our 
side rather than leaving them to the Russian side," said veteran U.S. diplomat 
Paul H. Nitze. "There was just a perfectly obvious competition for both sides 
to pick up the pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan behaved no differently after its defeat. Through the 1960s, Japan 
bristled at the U.S. refusal to allow it to resume relations with China and 
eagerly pursued closer economic ties with its giant neighbor. But at the same 
time, it took enormous American pressure on Japan and South Korea -- nations 
with less lucrative stakes in reconciliation -- to compel them to resume formal 
relations in 1965, 20 years after Korea was liberated from Japanese control. 
</P>
<P>
 "With China, the Japanese had a real requirement from their point of view to 
put things on a more normal basis," Romberg said. "Korea does not loom as large 
for Japan, therefore the imperative to move toward (reconciliation) was not as 
great." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, In the case of the United States and Vietnam, the absence of great 
strategic or economic interest in reconciliation -- at least until recently -- 
has clearly slowed the process. But, as with the French in Algeria, other 
factors were also in play. 
</P>
<P>
 But to most analysts, tangible concerns have influenced relations between the 
two nations less than the war's psychological legacy. Although Americans 
actually have expressed relatively little lingering animosity toward the 
Vietnamese -- even in the movie "Rambo," the Vietnamese still holding U.S. 
servicemen are only fronts for the Soviets -- the divisions within America 
about the war remain lacerating after two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, many believe that one critical reason the United States has deferred the 
question of how to deal with Vietnam is reluctance to reopen the debate over 
what went wrong there in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, that reluctance to disturb old wounds appears to have been swept 
away primarily by a modern reinterpretation of Palmerston's rule: the fear of 
losing Vietnam as a potential ally, not in a military sense but rather in 
global economic competition. Ethnic tensions, like those on bloody display in 
the former Yugoslav federation, appear immune to that calculus. But, for most 
nations, the sort of division that long separated the United States and Vietnam 
may be rendered increasingly anachronistic by the economic forces that finally 
forced them together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Countries have more immediate impact on each other than they used to, 
particularly as the economic barriers come down," Romberg said. "The changes in 
the way nations and people interact are pushing people in the direction of 
(quicker) reconciliation."

 Electronic keys that unlock scrambled telephone and computer signals are being 
placed in the hands of two federal agencies, the government announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision allows law enforcement officials to maintain wiretaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said the keys to the technology -- known as Key Escrow 
Encryption -- will be held by the Commerce Department's National Institute of

 The system uses a state-of-the-art microcircuit created by government 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is a voluntary system, available to people who need to encode 
messages, the high security of the system is expected to attract customers. The 
scrambling technology would be included in phones and computers by their 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Procedures for scrambling this material are so sophisticated that, without a 
key system like that being instituted, the government would be unable to break 
the codes and read or hear these messages -- a problem causing great concern 
among crime-fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno stressed that the keys will be used only for lawfully authorized wiretaps 
and that strict procedures are being set up to guard the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 The encryption system was formerly known as the Clipper Chip. 
</P>
<P>
 Each device will have two unique numbers, or "keys," that would be needed by 
authorized government agencies to decode the transmissions. The keys are 80-bit 
codes unique to each device. Both keys are needed to decode the message. 
</P>
<P>
 When a wiretap is required, written requests will have to be sent to both 
agencies certifying that the wiretap has been legally approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The two components for that particular encryption device would then be 
provided to permit the messages to be decoded. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from the White House noted that the rules will allow export of 
devices containing the new chip to most countries. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted expressions of disappointment from the computer industry, 
however, which also had sought approval to export equipment with other 
encryption devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Software buyers in other countries are demanding programs with encryption 
features and the inability to sell such items will hinder U.S. sales overseas, 
the Business Software Alliance warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Key encryption systems developed by the government are unlikely to be 
acceptable to many customers, the alliance said. And it expressed concern that 
the new system might be made mandatory in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House statement released Friday, however, said that "if encryption 
technology is made freely available worldwide it would no doubt be used 
extensively by terrorists, drug dealers and other criminals to harm Americans 
both in the U.S. and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore export of the most sophisticated encryption technology will remain 
restricted, the statement said.

FIRST LADY DEFENDS HEALTH PLAN, BRANDS INSURERS 'REAL ENEMY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to put the Administration's health care plan 
back on track Friday, naming insurance companies and the status quo as the 
"real enemy" and making no mention of a rival plan gaining steam in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's health care system is rigged against families and small businesses -- 
the insurance companies are in charge. They pick and choose whom they cover at 
what cost and for how long," Mrs. Clinton said during a question-and-answer 
session moderated by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton's strong defense came at the end of a week in which big business 
made strong objections to the President's plan and amid increasing interest in 
a less-sweeping proposal offered by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.). 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers and other entrenched interests that prosper under the current health 
care system are "raking that money off at everybody else's expense," Mrs. 
Clinton told the Civic Center audience of medical professionals, students and 
civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The status quo is our real enemy," she said. "The very large businesses will 
continue to make their best deals and everybody else will pick up the costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton spoke at a forum at Children's Hospital that is part of a series 
of discussions Koop is moderating. The former surgeon general is staying 
neutral in the health care debate, but he has praised the First Lady's work on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses object to Clinton's intention to require all businesses to pay 
80% of average insurance premiums for their workers. Cooper would try to make 
insurance more affordable without requiring employers to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies, with an expensive national advertising campaign, contend 
that the Clinton plan would create a huge new bureaucracy and limit consumers' 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton made no direct reference to the criticism from business, but 
urged her audience to "cut through the smoke screens, let's cut through the 
expensive television advertising campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Roundtable, representing 200 corporate CEOs, this week endorsed 
Cooper's plan as the basis for future negotiations. The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce rejected Clinton's plan as even a "starting point" for further talks.

GAS TURNED BACK ON AFTER BLAST AT SKI RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gas company workers went door to door Friday putting homes and businesses back 
on line after a natural gas explosion and fire shut down the heart of this ski 
resort community. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools and the Routt County Courthouse were closed, and many businesses 
opened late. 
</P>
<P>
 While Greeley Gas Co. worked to restore gas service to more than 600 
residences, investigators tried to find out what happened. The explosion 
Thursday tore through the Good News Building, which housed two restaurants and 
several small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people remained hospitalized Friday after suffering injuries in the 
explosion or from jumping out of windows. Twenty-four people were hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 David Adams, district manager for the gas company, said there apparently was a 
problem in its distribution system. "We have a high probability that we have 
found the leak," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people in the community of 5,700 were without natural gas 
service overnight.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CALTRANS TRIES TO SOFTEN EFFECT OF REPAIR NOISE 
ON RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Caltrans workers rush to reconstruct three damaged Southland freeways, 
working around the clock at some sites with pile-drivers, pickup trucks and 
other noisy equipment, those in the surrounding neighborhoods are feeling 
another round of temblors, this time man-made. 
</P>
<P>
 "An earthquake starts and then stops and doesn't make much noise but this 
shaking goes on all night and, believe me, it's loud," said Ida Miller, 72, a 
retiree who lives near the Santa Monica Freeway construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, aware that it is making a racket, has been reaching out to residents 
affected by the late-night noise with offers of compensation money and free 
hotel stays. But after going door to door in some neighborhoods with promises, 
Caltrans officials began backing away from the compensation on Friday, having 
determined that their initial offer went a bit too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to get it done, we're probably going to need to work around the 
clock, seven days a week," said Caltrans regional director Jerry Baxter. "But 
we realize that it's not fair for those people near the freeway to have to put 
up with all the noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, some residents near the construction were given two choices by 
Caltrans field representatives -- move to a nearby hotel and submit the 
receipts to Caltrans for reimbursement, or stay put and accept $75 for every 
night that crews are making excessive noise. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, Lisa Parker, was already planning how she would spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baxter said he discontinued the $75-a-day compensation on Friday when he 
discovered that his staffers were making such cash offers. The hotel offer 
still stands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is to reimburse those who are suffering because of the noise for 
hotel stays," Baxter said. "We've never paid people for sitting there and not 
doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Also up in the air is exactly how far the Caltrans offer will extend from the 
actual construction sites. Caltrans staffers had told residents that the 
compensation would go to those living so close that noise levels would reach 86 
decibels, equivalent to the noise level of some older airplanes on takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 That threshold seems too high, Baxter said, but he did not have an 
alternative. He said he was not sure how many residents are entitled to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckled freeways lie near several residential areas, and Caltrans says it has 
extended the offers of compensation to residents living adjacent to all the 
damaged sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the affected residents live along the Santa Monica Freeway at Fairfax 
and La Cienega boulevards. Other bridges or overpasses collapsed at the 
interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways near Sylmar, on 
the Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon and on the Simi Valley Freeway at San 
Fernando Mission Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Santa Monica Freeway, residents vary widely in their reaction to the 
noise, which was severe during the demolition of the damaged overpasses and 
will get bad again when construction begins in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be noise," said Councilman Nate Holden, who has recommended 
a complete lifting of city noise restrictions for the Caltrans crews. "The 
residents I've talked to understand that this is a state of emergency and that 
they have to bite the bullet on this." 
</P>
<P>
 If the problem grows severe, Holden said, he will call for the construction of 
makeshift sound walls to buffer the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, unaware that the $75-per-day compensation offer had been 
withdrawn, said that for that kind of money, which is comparable to a 
$27,000-per-year salary, they could live with the noise. At least one resident 
refused the money and the hotel stay, saying accepting it seemed wrong in a 
time of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Most seem to be suffering through the racket of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The noise is so bad I'm having trouble sleeping and am getting headaches," 
said Chung Il Cho, who can see workers from his front yard. "The best thing 
they can do is fix it fast."

CHILDREN TO BE SHOWN PHOTOS OF 160 MOLESTER CASE SUSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police Friday began showing alleged victims of the Valley molester 
photographs of 160 suspects in the case, in an attempt to determine the 
identity of the man or men who molested or tried to grope at least 32 children. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three months of expanding their inquiry and interviewing 
several hundred suspects, police have winnowed their list to the 160, ranked in 
a descending order of suspicion, said Deputy Police Chief Martin H. Pomeroy, 
who commands all San Fernando Valley police divisions. Investigators want to 
zero in on prime suspects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to have a positive identification from a number of victims," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy and the four detectives working the case -- down from 23 after a rash 
of more than a dozen attacks in November and December -- also said that showing 
the photos to the victims may help police determine if one man is responsible 
for all the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed Friday what they had only hinted at before: As many as six 
assaults may have been the work of a copycat, with a different modus operandi 
and getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also said most of the 160 suspects have either been charged with 
or suspected of sex crimes, particularly those at the top of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives compiled the collection of 160 photographs from booking mug shots, 
driver's license photos and images voluntarily turned over by suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a copycat is responsible for several assaults, police believe most 
incidents are the work of one African American male. The victims described him 
as 35 to 45 years old, about 6 feet tall, weighing from 185 to 210 pounds, with 
close-cropped hair and perhaps a few days' growth of beard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pretty confident he is among the 160," Detective Craig Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators cautioned that even if several victims identify someone, they 
will need more than that to charge or convict him because many of the victims 
are children who did not get a clear look at their assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Police resorted to displaying the photographs because they did not have "any 
real solid direction to go in," said Rhudy, who heads a task force set up three 
months ago to find the molester -- who police say raped a 9-year-old girl in 
November and has groped or attempted to grope young girls and a few boys near 
schools across the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reiterated Friday that as school routines get back to normal after the 
earthquake, parents should remain vigilant by walking their children to school 
or sending them in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the molester has halted activities because he has been interviewed by 
police -- as some authorities suspect -- there are other sexual predators to 
worry about, Rhudy said. He said another man is suspected of at least two 
attempts to get children into his car in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a guy is interested in young children, that is a common method, getting 
them on their way to school," Rhudy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe a copycat may be at work in the Valley molester case 
because six of the more recent cases involved an African American driving a 
burgundy sedan who sometimes struck in the afternoon. In the earlier cases, the 
suspect struck in the mornings and drove a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, police said they considered all the cases the work of one man. 
But on Friday, Rhudy said: "We think there is a possibility there are two. The 
M.O. changed, and so did the vehicle used."

'CATS' CRACK DOWN ON TRUCK HIJACKERS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF'S CARGO THEFT 
UNIT TRIES TO CURB CRIMINALS WHO STEAL HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN MERCHANDISE 
ANNUALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA and JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At high noon on a hazy day last fall, Sheriff's Department Detective Larry 
Thompson pulled his unmarked car onto a freeway on-ramp in Long Beach and ran 
into a cop's bad dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ahead of him, a big-rig truck was stopped. As Thompson started to pass, a 
man with a semiautomatic pistol sprang from behind the truck's fender, bolted 
to the cab and aimed the pistol at the driver's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I stop, jump out of the car and draw down on the guy? Or run him down?" 
Thompson thought.  
</P>
<P>
 Deciding to play it smart, he radioed for help. By then the gunman and an 
accomplice had forced their way into the cab, and the big-rig was heading into 
traffic. As the deputy followed, broadcasting his location, a pickup with three 
accomplices pulled alongside. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably thought I was some John Doe citizen calling the police and they 
tried to run me off the freeway," said Thompson, who was running an errand when 
he happened upon the brazen hijacking. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Thompson and the backup deputies managed to corner the truck at an 
off-ramp and arrest the hijackers, who later confessed that they had planned to 
park the rig somewhere and peddle its contents -- $116,000 worth of camcorders 
and compact disc players. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the scene resembled something out of a movie, it was cold reality. 
And, ironically, no one knew that better than Thompson and the deputies who 
joined the chase: They are members of a specialized, multi-agency team created 
to crack down on truck hijackings, a crime that has reached epidemic 
proportions in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really the cargo theft capital of the world," said Sheriff's Sgt. 
Dewayne Shackelford, one of a dozen members of the Cargo Criminal Apprehension 
Team. "There are so many, we can't keep track. There are weekends when we come 
back to work (and) get reports that we have had 20 trailers stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the so-called Cargo CATs estimate that thieves in Southern 
California are raking in more than $1 million in merchandise every night -- 
half a billion dollars annually -- by commandeering trucks at gunpoint, by 
stealing them off streets and from storage yards and by bribing truckers to 
give up their loads. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that cargo thefts are becoming increasingly violent, leading to the 
death of at least two people last year. In October, a truck driver was shot to 
death during an attempted hijacking at a freeway on-ramp in Carson. A month 
earlier, a security guard was shot in the head, execution-style, during the 
robbery of a La Mirada storage yard from which two truckloads of clothing and 
other merchandise were taken. There have been numerous abductions and at least 
one rape connected with cargo thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that the Los Angeles area has become a hijacker's paradise, 
authorities say, is simple: The pickings are plentiful. More freight moves 
through the Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors than anywhere in the nation, an 
estimated $83 billion worth each year. What's more, a conviction for stealing a 
load of televisions from a storage yard may not bring a stiffer penalty than 
stealing a single TV from a store. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the thieves do not seem to be overly discriminating, ripping off a 
mind-numbing variety of goods, including computers, frozen pastries, 
motorcycles, hay, fax machines, dog food, light bulbs, prune juice, in-line 
skates, frozen shrimp, hair spray and anything else that can be moved on the 
street or sold in volume at cut-rate prices to independent stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But then there are choosy hijackers such as Jiles Byron Gray, who owned two 
Mercedeses, three new vans and a $500,000 house in the hills above Pomona 
before he was arrested by the special team and sentenced to 21 years in federal 
prison in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Gray and his gang would don ski masks, tie up security guards at truck storage 
yards, cut the locks off big-rig trailers with bolt cutters and place a sample 
of merchandise behind each one. Gray would make his selections, and the thieves 
would steal the trucks, leaving the rest of the big-rigs behind with the 
samples on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the growing severity of the problem, the Legislature passed a bill, 
which took effect last month, authorizing the California Public Utilities 
Commission to pay $3 million a year for cargo security and truck driver safety 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, because of the regional nature of the crime, Cargo CATs was 
formed, combining officers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
the Los Angeles and Vernon police departments, California Highway Patrol, Los 
Angeles Port Police and the FBI. Created in 1990, the team made 367 arrests and 
recovered nearly $52 million in stolen property during its first two years. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the team was instrumental in the indictments of 31 people and 
the recovery of nearly $14 million in stolen goods in a sting operation that 
lasted for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's efforts are directed not only at the thieves -- who steal trucks at 
gunpoint or plunder them in storage yards -- but also the so-called brokers. 
Like drug kingpins, the brokers keep themselves isolated and above the fray, 
setting up deals to store and sell stolen goods to independent retailers or 
ship them to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, Cargo CATs set its sights on a veteran broker named 
Jose Oliberio Garcia, 37. Like most brokers, Oliberio let flunkies do the 
stealing. He frequently provided warehouse space for cargo thieves and, if they 
were unable to find a buyer for their loot and pay a storage fee during a 
specified period, he would take possession of the goods, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating in much the same way as undercover narcotics officers, members of 
the team used one informant to introduce Oliberio to a second informant, who 
posed as the owner of a warehouse in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Using hidden audio devices and cameras, the team recorded hours of 
conversations between the warehouse "owner" and Oliberio, who agreed to rent 
the building for $2,000 a week per truckload of stored merchandise. During the 
tape-recorded conversations, the savvy Oliberio avoided using such 
incriminating words as "stolen goods." 
</P>
<P>
 What unfolded next was testimony to the magnitude of the cargo theft problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson warehouse that Oliberio rented from the undercover operatives 
started filling up, beginning with toilet paper, clothing, food and Christmas 
ornaments. As more stolen goods arrived, the hijackers began quarreling among 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of thievery between thieves," sheriff's Detective John Langley 
said. "They were taking each other's samples and running off to find buyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the warehouse was out of control. "They were trying to bring in 
more stuff," Langley said. "We couldn't handle it. We were on overload." 
</P>
<P>
 Obtaining the incriminating information they needed, the officers arrested 
Oliberio, who pleaded guilty to grand theft and receiving stolen property. He 
was sentenced to three years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Many brokers, however, treat prison time not as a deterrent but as a price of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Pokey Eddie White, for one, has been in and out of custody for 25 years, 
several times for receiving stolen property. Police describe White, 44, as one 
of the biggest brokers in Southern California and allege that he uses members 
of the Crips gang to pull jobs for his well-organized theft ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an example of how he and his cohorts did business. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on Aug. 20, 1992, two long-distance truckers backed a $250,000 load of 
CDs up to the platform of a Chatsworth warehouse. The exhausted truckers 
settled down in the cab to sleep, but about 5:30 a.m., two gunmen rousted them, 
locked them in a trailer and drove away with their rig. 
</P>
<P>
 What the thieves did not know was that the truck had been equipped by the 
freight company with a "satellite responder," enabling authorities to track its 
general location. Later that morning, LAPD investigators using a helicopter saw 
the truck in a warehouse storage yard at 87th Place and Mettler Street in Los 
Angeles. Police found the load of stolen CDs stacked in the warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the building told officers that White had rented the warehouse. 
The two long-distance truckers identified Gary Villand Harris as one of the men 
who robbed them. White, Harris and a third man, Willie Lee Beamon, were charged 
with receiving stolen property. Harris also was charged with armed robbery. But 
White was soon out on $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, two cargo thefts occurred in the South Bay -- a trailer 
load of computers was taken from the Unisys Corp. storage yard in Compton and a 
truckload of Sony compact disc players was hijacked at gunpoint in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Augustin Enriquez was hauling the load of CD players. It is a night he will 
never forget. After leaving the Sony warehouse, he pulled to a stop at a 
traffic light at an on-ramp of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's normally the place to get hijacked if you're pulling a Sony load," 
Thompson said. "We have frequent thefts there." 
</P>
<P>
 As Enriquez waited for the light to change, the door to his cab flew open and 
a man in a black ski mask shoved a gun in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roll over," the gunman said as another hijacker climbed in the passenger 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hijackers threatened to kill the terrified trucker if he did not tell them 
what he was hauling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I didn't know," Enriquez said. "I was sweating and my heart was 
beating so fast I thought it was going to fly out of my chest." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the gunmen pulled a ski cap over Enriquez's eyes, drove the truck to 
Santa Fe Street in Carson, dumped him out and drove off with the CD players. 
</P>
<P>
 A month or so after the Thanksgiving weekend thefts, computer dealer William 
Narkunas was asked by a stranger if he wanted to buy several hundred Unisys 
computer monitors. The price was reasonable enough, but Narkunas got suspicious 
when the seller insisted on being paid in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alarm went off when he said he wanted to be paid in dead Presidents," 
said Narkunas, who called the sheriff's office. "Five minutes later I got a 
call from Cargo CATs. They asked me if I would participate and we set up a buy 
for cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, a jittery Narkunas was standing in the rain, waiting to meet the 
thieves in a parking lot in an unfamiliar neighborhood of Los Angeles. He had 
$30,000 in cash provided by police stuffed in his pockets and second thoughts 
running through his head. An undercover CHP officer was with Narkunas and had 
brought along a truck for the thieves to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, two strangers showed up and took the truck. The deal was that the 
thieves would return it with computer monitors and collect the $30,000. The 
team followed the suspects to a cellular phone business in Los Angeles. At an 
apartment house garage in Norwalk, they began loading the truck with Unisys 
monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The team swooped in and put three men under arrest. A search warrant was 
issued for the cellular phone business, which turned out to be operated by none 
other than White, who was out on bail. Inside, officers discovered 171 computer 
monitors stolen from the Unisys yard and nine Sony CD players taken from 
Enriquez's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 White insisted that the merchandise had been left at his business by a son who 
went to the East Coast, and a Superior Court judge dismissed the charges of 
receiving stolen property, infuriating the team.  
</P>
<P>
 "He takes the word of a crook," Thompson said of the judge, "instead of 
letting us testify." 
</P>
<P>
 But White did not escape prison. He was convicted in September of receiving 
stolen property in connection with the load of CDs hijacked from truckers in 
Chatsworth. White was sentenced to four years in prison. With good behavior, he 
will be out in two.

VIRTUAL VOLLEYBALL; TECHNOLOGY: ATHLETES TRY SIMULATION OF THE GAME WITHOUT THE 
BEACH, SAND OR EVEN A BALL. IT'S PART OF A NEW MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY 
EXHIBIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There were no slams into the net or head-first dives into the sand when two 
beach volleyball stars squared off against each other in the most unusual game 
ever played in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because there was no net and no sand as top-ranked players Kent Steffes 
and Kevin Waterbury competed near Downtown. No ball, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were playing "virtual reality" volleyball. Instead of a 60-foot 
rectangle traced on a sunny Malibu beach, their court was created by a 
computerized camera and a wall-size screen in a darkened corner of the 
California Museum of Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Steffes and Waterbury were smack in the middle of the biggest arcade game 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no primitive Pong match where players have to poke buttons to 
send an electronic blip across a tiny video display. The computer was creating 
full-size images of the athletes hitting a simulated ball over a simulated net. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech volleyball is part of a $2 1/2-million display of lasers, 
holograms and computer imagery that opens a three-month exhibition today at the 
museum in Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Liquid Vision" exhibit manipulates light and sound to do things such as 
make a banana split sundae disappear and turn the most tone-deaf visitor into a 
rock 'n' roll star. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a laser shooting gallery where bull's-eyes are rewarded with 
spectacular electronic fireworks displays. One demonstration turns onlookers 
into a green-eyed wolf through a digital "morphing" technique. Another uses 
helmet-mounted video screens and motion-sensing handsets to create a 
three-dimensional illusion of flying through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The volleyball game is the most spectacular illusion, however. Even the 
professionals there for a preview were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no ball here. But there's a ball on the screen, and it 
knows where your hands are," said Steffes, 25, a Pacific Palisades resident who 
earned $410,000 playing volleyball professionally in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterbury, 22, of Santa Monica, said: "In a few years virtual reality will 
probably have sand and sun, too. Then we can just practice at home without even 
going to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is being loaned to Los Angeles by Ohio's Center of Science and 
Industry. It will travel to museums around the country for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials acknowledged that computer-savvy children will probably take 
to "Liquid Vision" faster than parents. But grown-ups will easily relate to a 
neighboring exhibition -- the one across the aisle from the lasers and digital 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the earthquake exhibit. And a seismograph there is instantaneously 
displaying squiggles from the continuing aftershocks from the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the kind of virtual reality everybody understands.

GRAND JURY TO CONVENE IN JACKSON CASE; LAW: SOURCES CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION 
SAY A PANEL IN SANTA BARBARA WILL HEAR TESTIMONY NEXT WEEK ABOUT ALLEGED 
MOLESTATION OF BOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Barbara County Grand Jury will convene next week to begin hearing 
testimony about whether Michael Jackson sexually molested a boy over a period 
of several months last year, sources close to the investigation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Subpoenas already have been delivered to a number of witnesses, the sources 
said. They added, however, that neither Jackson nor his young accuser so far 
has been asked to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's actions do not necessarily signal that an indictment is on 
the horizon. Grand juries often are used to gather evidence, not just to 
consider indictments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision to convene the grand jury sends the strongest signal yet that 
the criminal investigations of the entertainer are continuing despite last 
month's settlement of a civil case brought against him by his alleged victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Jackson and the alleged victim, a 14-year-old boy who filed a 
lawsuit against the singer last year, announced on Jan. 25 that they had 
settled the boy's case. Although terms of that settlement were not disclosed, 
sources familiar with the negotiations said Jackson agreed to pay between $15 
million and $24 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution of the suit prompted many observers to speculate that the 
progress of the criminal case might be severely hampered. Legal analysts say 
that would be true particularly if the boy decided that it was not in his best 
interests to testify in the criminal case now that the civil matter is 
concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 California law prohibits authorities from punishing sex-abuse victims if they 
refuse to testify. The boy's testimony in the Jackson case is considered 
essential for prosecutors to win a conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy has not said whether he would agree to take the stand, but authorities 
clearly are concerned that he might decide against it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti announced that his 
office is sponsoring legislation that would force any sex-abuse victim who 
filed suit or accepted money as part of a civil settlement to testify in a 
related criminal proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case would have application in the Michael Jackson investigation should 
we decide that prosecution is warranted," Garcetti said Thursday. "I want to 
emphasize we are not at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry R. Feldman, the boy's lawyer, has not said whether his client would be 
willing to testify in a criminal case. Although he has said that "nobody bought 
anybody's silence" with the civil settlement, he also repeatedly has stressed 
that psychologists believe the best thing for the boy would be to get on with 
his life rather than to keep dealing with the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 As the criminal investigations move forward, sources familiar with the case 
say prosecutors in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara are warily eyeing each other's 
moves. Garcetti's office has lost several major recent trials, and sources say 
the district attorney is reluctant to take on another high-profile case unless 
he believes he has a good chance of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Garcetti could be left in an embarrassing predicament if he 
passes up a criminal prosecution only to have his Santa Barbara counterpart, 
Thomas Sneddon Jr., review the same facts and conclude that prosecution is 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, according to sources, is a difficult political problem for both of 
the elected prosecutors: Neither wants to bring a case and lose, but neither 
wants to pass up the chance of prosecuting and have his counterpart win. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Davis, a Los Angeles lawyer who handles child-molestation cases and 
consults on high-profile cases throughout the state, predicted Friday that 
Garcetti will not prosecute Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garcetti will never file," said Davis, who successfully represented 
defendants in the McMartin Preschool child-molestation case, which helped bring 
about the political downfall of Garcetti's predecessor, former Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner. "(Garcetti) will stall, rationalize, then pass." 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis said he believes the Santa Barbara district attorney might be more 
willing to risk prosecuting Jackson. Many legal experts have said that a Santa 
Barbara jury could be more inclined to convict Jackson, and they note that 
Sneddon is considered an aggressive, hands-on litigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's possible that Sneddon will pursue this case," Davis said. "He 
will not care about Garcetti's reticence."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 2 GET LIFE 
WITHOUT PAROLE IN HOUSE FIRE THAT KILLED 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were sentenced Friday to life in prison without the possibility of 
parole for setting a fire that killed five members of a family that suffered 
the wrath of drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles Horan followed a jury's recommendation in sending 
Victor Spencer, 39, and Harold Mangram, 48, to state prison for the rest of 
their lives.Jurors rejected the prosecution's argument that the defendants 
deserved to die for their crime.  
</P>
<P>
 The men were convicted in December of five counts of murder with the special 
circumstance allegations of multiple murder and murder by arson for the Sept. 
7, 1991, blaze. Spencer and Mangram poured gasoline through a mail slot in the 
door of an apartment at the Jordan Downs housing project in Watts. Seventeen 
members of a family were sleeping there at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence in the trial centered on the testimony of two witnesses, including 
Frank Villareal, who initially was charged in the crime but pleaded guilty to 
five counts of manslaughter in exchange for his testimony.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LEGAL 
OPINION ON COLISEUM MANAGER'S LIABILITY SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs on Friday asked City Atty. James Hahn 
to prepare a legal opinion on whether Spectacor Management Group, managers of 
the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, is liable for damages for failing to give 
the Coliseum Commission a 1991 structural engineer's report saying the stadium 
could be damaged in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With the report in hand three years ago, "the commission might have decided to 
pay to retrofit the structure," Wachs said, and the millions of dollars in 
damage the Coliseum sustained in the Jan. 17 earthquake might have been 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure by Spectacor to notify the Coliseum Commission of potential damage is 
inexcusable," the councilman added. "The City Council should pursue all legal 
and equitable remedies in the event that the city attorney determines that 
Spectacor was either negligent in its duties or may have otherwise acted in a 
manner which could result in liability." 
</P>
<P>
 The report was turned over to the Coliseum Commission this week.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; TESTS ORDERED 
FOR OFFICER WHO STOLE FROM MOTORISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Friday ordered an ex-Compton police officer convicted of stealing 
from motorists to state prison for nearly 90 days of diagnostic testing.  
</P>
<P>
 Charmagne Drew, 27, wiped tears from her face as Superior Court Judge Michael 
Tynan denied her lawyer's request for probation."There's no doubt in my mind 
that -- to her dying day -- she will say she never did anything . . . (and) in 
the face of overwhelming evidence," Tynan said at the end of the sentencing 
hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Drew was convicted in December on three of five counts of grand theft for 
stealing a total of $300 from motorists she had pulled over. 
</P>
<P>
 During her testimony, Drew accused four of her victims of lying. She was 
caught when officers set up a sting, and faces up to four years in prison.

TITLE OF CAR THEFT CAPITAL HAS COMMERCE BOILING OVER; CRIME: SURVEY RANKS CITY 
NO. 1 -- AGAIN. OFFICIALS SAY THE LARGE NUMBER OF COMMUTING WORKERS DISTORTS 
THE DATA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The tiny industrial City of Commerce feels like someone has climbed inside, 
hot-wired it and driven off with its reputation. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive year the city has been crowned the stolen car 
capital of the United States -- even though police say the theft problem for 
residents is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The dubious car theft crown has been bestowed by the Illinois-based National 
Insurance Crime Bureau. It reported this week that City of Commerce led the 
country with a theft rate of 5,053 vehicles stolen per 100,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that City of Commerce's 12,500 population swells to nearly 
75,000 during the day when outsiders pour into the city's manufacturing plants 
and office buildings and its large Commerce Shopping Center on Whittier 
Boulevard. The insurance bureau's statistics do not factor in the commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Rowe, the city's public safety manager, said it has learned to shrug 
off the bureau's annual ranking. Crime in general is on the decline in her 
six-square-mile city, she said. So are auto thefts. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of car thefts take place at the shopping center, about half a 
dozen miles southeast of Downtown Los Angeles, said Los Angeles County 
sheriff's Detective Boyd Zumwalt, an auto theft specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a numbers game," Zumwalt said. "It makes it look like car thefts are 
going out of sight when they aren't."  
</P>
<P>
 Insurance bureau analyst Gregory Tanski, who compiled the newest statistics 
using 1992 crime figures and census reports, agreed that the figures can be 
misleading. But he said there is no way to account for commuters when compiling 
the annual list. 
</P>
<P>
 After City of Commerce, the second-worst place, statistically, to park a car 
is Newark, N.J., which had 5,019 thefts per 100,000 people. The best place of 
the 2,100 cities surveyed was Clayton, N.Y., where not a single car 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can let the people in Commerce know their auto theft rate has dropped 13% 
in the past few years. So they must be doing something right," Tanski said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "And tell them they're lucky they're not Fresno. It's jumped 75% in the last 
three years."

JUDGE BARS ETHICS CHIEF FROM CASE; COURTS: JURIST RULES THAT COMMISSION 
DIRECTOR SHOWED A BIAS AGAINST THE SUBJECTS OF A MONEY-LAUNDERING INQUIRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a setback for one of a series of local campaign money-laundering 
investigations, a Superior Court judge on Friday barred Los Angeles Ethics 
Commission Executive Director Ben Bycel from participating in a pending case, 
saying he had shown a bias toward the subjects of the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne, ruling in a lawsuit filed by three people involved in the 
investigation, found that in a related money-laundering probe Bycel had made 
"abusive and threatening" comments to attorneys and sought to dissuade a 
witness from testifying on behalf one of those under investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Such conduct clearly represents actual bias and irrefutably suggests that Mr. 
Bycel is not an impartial adjudicator in the matter herein," the judge's order 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel, who declined to comment, has denied the accusations in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission President Dennis Curtis, a USC law professor, said the judge 
"was wrong on the law." He defended Bycel as the "right person for the job," 
and "a natural target for anybody who wishes to downgrade the (commission's) 
efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Deputy Director Rebecca Avila said the decision is disappointing. 
She added that the agency "will continue to press forward with these important 
political corruption investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Tony Alperin said city officials have not decided whether 
to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the ruling precludes Bycel from presiding over a pending 
internal hearing involving three parties, including two relatives of former Los 
Angeles Councilman Arthur Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is part of a series of Southern California money-laundering 
investigations being conducted jointly by the Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. Several inquiries have involved relatives 
and associates of Snyder, now a prominent City Hall lobbyist and political 
fund-raiser, although the former Eastside councilman has not been accused of 
any campaign violations and denies any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations have produced the largest penalty on record for campaign 
law violations, an $895,000 payment by a shipping firm that was managed locally 
by Snyder's brother-in-law.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ruling involved a lawsuit brought by Snyder's sister-in-law Blanche 
Wu, her husband, Ricky Poon, and an associate, Dominic Ching. Court papers show 
that they are "subjects of an enforcement proceeding" by the Ethics Commission. 
Their attorney, Mark Geragos, who also represents Snyder, has said Wu, Poon and 
Ching have violated no laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Geragos characterized Wayne's decision as a victory. "This substantiates what 
we've said all along. This investigation was driven by a personal vendetta by 
Ben Bycel. We have judicial confirmation now of what we've alleged all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it completely stops them in their tracks," Geragos said of the 
investigations, including any that might involve Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alperin, the Ethics Commission attorney, said: "We don't think it does 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling applies only to the Wu, Poon and Ching cases, he said, and the 
ethics agency has three types of enforcement remedies available -- criminal 
prosecution, filing a civil lawsuit to seek penalties or proceeding 
administratively. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling only deals with the administrative penalty procedures," Alperin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wu, Poon and Ching alleged that Bycel had said to an attorney in a related 
case that he was "going to get" her clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, USC professor and campaign finance expert Herb Alexander alleged in a 
court declaration that Bycel had telephoned him "very agitated" because 
Alexander planned to testify as an expert witness in that case. Alexander said 
Bycel told him he "should not testify," became angry and hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 In his affidavit, Bycel said statements attributed to him were not true. He 
said he merely inquired of Alexander, a professional associate of several 
years, whether he would be testifying as an expert witness. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied hanging up on Alexander, saying his car telephone "blacked out" 
as it often does and "I saw no reason to redial his number."

FROM MAKING LAW TO LAYING DOWN THE LAW; COURTS: EVEN TOP OFFICIALS GET CALLED 
TO JURY DUTY. SUPERVISOR GLORIA MOLINA IS AN ALTERNATE IN A MURDER TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade of passing laws as an assemblywoman, City Council 
member and county supervisor, Gloria Molina may soon be asked to pass judgment 
-- as a member of a criminal trial jury.  
</P>
<P>
 After answering the call for jury duty several times in the past, but never 
being selected to serve on a panel, Molina said she was delighted earlier this 
week when she made it on a murder trial jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm only an alternate, so I don't get to deliberate or vote, but it is 
fascinating," she said while hurrying back to the Hall of Administration on her 
lunch break with a telltale red juror's badge dangling from her coat. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw me and said, 'What? You couldn't get out of jury duty?' " Molina 
said while acknowledging the occasional wave or stare of people who recognized 
her in the hallway of the Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone should do this," she continued as she angled for a spot on 
the crowded elevators.  
</P>
<P>
 But it can be especially rewarding for an elected official, said Molina, who 
often charges that her colleagues are out of touch with street-level realities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like anything else, it's better to see it up front. It gives you an 
opportunity to get a sense of what really goes on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves a 1992 double homicide that occurred in Molina's district. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor was informed of the incident at the time, but defense attorney 
Frank Duncan said Molina did not recall the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan and Deputy Dist. Atty. James Falco said it did not bother them to have 
a top county official on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a right like any other person to perform her civic obligation," Falco 
said. "It never occurred to me to excuse her."

RAIN BRINGS SOME RELIEF BUT ADDS TO MISERY FOR OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A chilly storm blew through Southern California on Friday, dropping rain and 
snow that brought cheer to some people and consternation to others. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, the precipitation was a welcome change in what has been 
shaping up as one of the driest winters on record. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost an inch of rain fell in some of the Southland's residential and 
agricultural areas, which was good news for gardeners and farmers. State water 
officials said the up to 13 inches of snow in the mountains was a gratifying 
addition to the pack that contributes to the area's household water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 On the negative side, the cold rain tangled traffic slowed by earthquake 
detours, added to the miseries of earthquake refugees who are still camping in 
some of the city's parks and threatened to set loose mudslides on slopes 
denuded during last fall's disastrous brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said that except for a few minor slips here and there, the 
burned slopes appeared to be holding pretty well, but concerns arose about 
further landslides on an oceanfront bluff in Pacific Palisades that began to 
give way during the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the bluff toppled onto Pacific Coast Highway on Jan. 17, carrying with 
it the bedroom wing of a mansion that once belonged to actor Charles Laughton 
and undermining several other houses. On Friday, police closed part of 
Chautauqua Boulevard for fear that more of the former Laughton home might slide 
down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol said the rain contributed to a crash on 
Interstate 15 in Barstow that killed two people and closed the northbound lanes 
for much of the day, and heavy snow closed the Golden State Freeway at Gorman 
for almost nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow continued throughout the day in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino 
mountains, delighting ski resort operators who had been relying largely on 
man-made snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely incredible. It's all soft and fluffy," said Libby Coleman, a 
spokeswoman at the Bear Mountain Ski Resort at Big Bear. "This is what we've 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard rescued seven fishermen early Friday after heavy seas and 
winds gusting up to 55 m.p.h. drove two boats aground and disabled a third off 
Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the fishermen, who were identified as Wayne Chapman and Randall Brown, 
were taken to Goleta Hospital in Santa Barbara for treatment of hypothermia. 
None of the others required treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said a powerful HH-60 helicopter had to be flown in from San 
Francisco to assist in the rescues when a smaller helicopter and a cutter were 
hampered by the severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said there is a chance of 
rain again late Sunday. He said rain is also likely Monday and could continue 
into Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there might be high pressure building in behind that," he said, "with 
more dry weather for the rest of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 During December and January, normally two of the wettest months of the year, 
only 1.11 inches of rain fell on Los Angeles, compared to a normal total for 
the two months of 4.95 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The 0.59 of an inch that had fallen in Los Angeles by 3 p.m. Friday raised the 
total for the season to 2.62 inches, compared to a normal season's total for 
the date of 8.28 inches. Last year at this time, the season's total was 17.23 
inches. Rainfall seasons are measured from July 1 through June 30.

SPIRITUAL RECONSTRUCTION; JUDSON STUDIOS WILL BE BUSY HELPING CHURCHES RESTORE 
QUAKE-SHATTERED STAINED-GLASS WINDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HEIMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last 100 years, the Judson family has designed stained-glass windows 
for churches, synagogues, banks, shopping centers and restaurants from coast to 
coast. The historic stained-glass center has also seen its share of damage 
caused by earthquakes, including the Long Beach quake in 1933 and the Sierra 
Madre quake in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But the magnitude 6.6 Northridge earthquake Jan. 17 has caused more damage to 
stained-glass windows than any disaster before it, said Bill Judson, 28, who 
works with his father and a dozen artisans inside a mansion-like studio in 
Highland Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Business, he said, could be backed up for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a thrust earthquake, which caused the windows to pop out more than a 
slip earthquake," said Bill's father, Walter W. Judson, 52, whose 
great-grandfather William Lees Judson founded Judson Studios in 1897. 
"Stained-glass people will be busy for awhile."  
</P>
<P>
 Judson Studios, whose family logo -- a griffin -- adorns scores of colored 
glass panes on buildings across the country, is one of the few studios in 
California capable of large-scale repairs. And for the dozens of damaged 
buildings across Southern California, the road back could be a long one -- 
insurance companies will be processing claims for weeks or even months, and 
some churches and businesses might not have the money to replace damaged 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing stained-glass can be complicated and costly. The process -- which 
includes taking the window apart, researching the original art and finding 
matching glass -- can cost $150 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Peters Armenian Church in Van Nuys was heavily damaged in the recent 
temblor. In the church dome, six of 12 stained-glass windows -- each of an 
apostle -- were shattered, and the other six were damaged. Just removing the 
damaged sections and covering the holes with plastic will cost the church 
$8,500, said Father Shnork Demirjian. He said he is not sure what it will cost 
to replace the windows. The church has no insurance and cannot rely on help 
from parishioners, many of whom were also hit hard during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, repairing the windows is the church's first priority, Demirjian said. 
"Although stained glass is originally a Western (means of expression), the 
icons are important for us, and the windows create the atmosphere for worship 
in the church," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Church of the Lighted Window in La Canada Flintridge, the window for 
which the church was named lost a large chunk of glass. Although the church 
does not yet know how much fixing the broken window will cost, it wants to 
repair and reinforce it, senior minister Philip Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We appreciate the aesthetics of the stained-glass windows, which are clearly 
a part of our worship life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Judson Studio workers begin the repair process by making sure that the 
building is stabilized so the windows can be safely removed. Then they take a 
rough drawing or rubbing of the existing lead (the strips that surround the 
glass and hold the design together), take the windows apart and bring the 
pieces back to the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical for people not to go through and sweep up and throw everything 
away," said Walter Judson, who is also co-owner of an interior design business 
for religious institutions. Workers try to preserve as much of the original 
glass as possible in reconstruction.  
</P>
<P>
 Judson said it's important for churches to collect good photographs of the 
windows before they are damaged so workers can accurately re-create the design. 
It is also important to know when the windows were made and by whom, and to 
save old sketches or drawings because each window is unique in style, color and 
type of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want to have a shot at replacing it, we should know how it looked 
before, and how it was made," Judson said. "It's like being a detective, going 
back and finding old evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Faceted glass, which is thick glass held together with epoxy rather than lead, 
is generally easier to repair than leaded glass, Judson said, because it 
usually has simpler patterns. But leaded glass is stronger and better absorbs 
the shock of an earthquake. Repairing faceted glass involves replacing the 
glass and re-creating the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson encourages regular inspection of windows to prevent damage. The sash, 
or frame of the glass, should be in good shape. After this earthquake, Judson 
said, he will recommend steel sashes rather than aluminum sashes because steel, 
though more expensive, is sturdier. 
</P>
<P>
 Making and repaired stained-glass art is "spiritually satisfying," Judson 
said. "You're not decorating a building, you're creating a space. The windows 
help create a sense of spirituality in the church, and more importantly, help 
create a sense of community."

FIRMS FEAR CURBS ON RELIGION ON THE JOB; WORSHIP: THE EEOC IS FORMULATING 
GUIDELINES ON WHEN A COMPANY'S VALUES OR MOTTO WOULD CONSTITUTE HARASSMENT. THE 
ACLU SAYS IT KNOWS OF FEW IF ANY COMPLAINTS BY EMPLOYEES.

 As a religious man, Herrick Garnsey says he operates his business on "godly, 
biblical principles." The stated mission of his family-owned Ford dealership in 
Greeley, Colo., is to "glorify God by the process and results of providing 
quality products and services which meet and exceed our customers' 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Garnsey worries that the federal government wants to turn his workplace 
into a religion-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Garnsey 
voiced his concerns about emerging EEOC rules on what may be the sleeper issue 
of employment law in the U.S. workplace: religious harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the EEOC proposed new guidelines for dealing with workplace 
harassment based on race, color, national origin, age, disability or religion. 
The commission had previously issued separate guidelines for dealing with 
sexual harassment, which produces by far the largest number of harassment 
complaints the agency receives. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is trying to make policies covering other forms of harassment conform 
to help make it easier for employers and employees to understand the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, an employer has a duty to protect an employee from what a 
reasonable person would deem an intimidating, hostile or offensive work 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the comments filed so far with the EEOC, dealing with the 
constitutional rights of free speech and freedom of religious expression may 
not prove easy for most employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana B. Johnston, assistant legal counsel for the EEOC, said the agency was 
aware of the potential constitutional questions its proposed guidelines raise. 
At the moment, she said, the commission is still discussing things at the staff 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 The worries of some companies about the rules are typified by ACX 
Technologies, another Colorado-based company, which expressed concern that 
under the proposed guidelines the company's "value statement" may no longer be 
legal. The first item on the list of 10 stated values is "honoring God and each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the EEOC, the company said that "although our values are not 
religious, they are based on biblical principles and Judeo-Christian 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Any finding that the value statement amounts to religious harassment, ACX 
officials wrote, "would be highly detrimental to our company" and would amount 
to a suppression of religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 MetaWare, a self-described "Christian-centered company" in Santa Cruz, Calif., 
warned the EEOC that adopting the proposed guidelines would effectively ban 
managers from espousing Christian principles in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the tests of whether a reasonable person would consider a particular 
form of behavior religious harassment, Franklin L. DeRemar, MetaWare's chief 
executive, wrote: "A Christian employer must ask, "Would a 'reasonable atheist' 
or a 'reasonable Muslim' or a 'reasonable New Age practitioner' (all of whom 
fall in the definition of religion for the purpose of discrimination) find it 
'intimidating' or 'offensive' to be in a workplace where Christian or biblical 
principles are espoused by management?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the concerns people expressed to the EEOC about the proposed 
guidelines came from such employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy E. Crosson, a law professor at the University of Indiana, said she was 
concerned that the proposed guidelines overstep some boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing to the commission on behalf of Feminists for Free Expression, Crosson 
said: "We feel the proposed guidelines go too far and threaten to have a 
wide-ranging adverse impact on protected speech in workplaces where most 
American adults spend most of their active hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Crosson said her group was troubled by the reach of these 
guidelines, extending to negative stereotyping and to any written or graphic 
material that demonstrates or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual 
group on a prohibited basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, according to Crosson, would be a standard so broad "as to include 
classically protected, and not particularly discriminatory, speech such as a 
satirical feminist poster attributing social ills to white men." 
</P>
<P>
 She, too, said she feared that the result would be a decision by employers to 
ban any and all controversial expression in the workplace to avoid potential 
legal liability under the religious harassment guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, according to officials at both the EEOC and the American Civil 
Liberties Union, religious harassment has not been a major problem in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bob Peck of the ACLU office in Washington said he was hard-pressed to 
find any cases involving religious harassment in a quick canvassing of ACLU 
offices. Peck said the potential minefields in the proposed guidelines "are the 
ones you always have -- people being punished for exercising free speech 
rights."

PANELIST: HARDING'S RIGHTS ARE FIRST; FIGURE SKATING: MEMBER OF GROUP MEETING 
TO DETERMINE HER FATE FOR LILLEHAMMER SAYS VOTE WILL COME TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A member of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. panel that might ultimately decide 
Tonya Harding's fate said Friday that individual rights should take precedence 
over Olympic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after five hours of deliberations at El Pomar Center, near the USFSA 
offices, panel member Sharon Watson said the group was doing everything 
possible to protect Harding's rights. Harding has not been charged with a 
crime, so maintaining that philosophy could improve her chances of skating in 
the Olympics. A vote will be taken this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at the rights of the skaters before you look at anything as 
abstract as the sport's image," Watson told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, a member of the USFSA board of directors and chairwoman of the 
Sanctions and Eligibility Committee, is a clinical psychologist who is 
executive director of the L.A. County Children's Planning Council. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her colleagues -- William Hybl, Col. Ken Schweitzer, Nancy Piro and 
Jim Cygan -- are expected to offer a recommendation today on whether there are 
reasonable grounds for a disciplinary hearing to consider suspending Harding 
from the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, which is weighing evidence of Harding's involvement in the Jan. 6 
attack on rival Olympian Nancy Kerrigan, can make a recommendation with a 
simple majority. Today's decision is expected to be a turning point for 
Harding, who is trying to remain on the U.S. team for the Lillehammer Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding and her attorneys will be informed of the decision before it is 
announced. The panel will send its recommendations to USFSA President Claire 
Ferguson, who could call for a disciplinary hearing or pass the recommendation 
to USOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lillehammer, Richard Pound, a member of the International Olympic Committee 
board, said that he doesn't think there is cause to remove Harding from the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you have got compelling evidence, such as a confession or a 
conviction, you don't have a basis on which to overturn the results," Pound 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois Carrard, IOC director general, said that Harding's position on the 
team should be decided by U.S. groups. On Thursday, an IOC official told The 
Times that the group does not plan to get involved in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the USFSA panel members sifted through affidavits, FBI reports and 
information provided by a Portland sheriff's detective and attorney, they must 
conclude whether Harding violated the figure skating association's code of 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision could come down to a how the panel compares an individual's 
rights to the concept of fair play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nation has been focusing on the criminal aspect," Harvey Schiller, 
executive director of the USOC, told reporters in Lillehammer. "(But) we are 
required to subscribe to the IOC Charter, which stresses that athletes act in a 
fair and sportsmanlike manner. If one athlete trips another going to the finish 
line, that is not fair play." 
</P>
<P>
 Reminded that, unlike a conspiracy, everyone in the stadium would see the 
tripping, Schiller said: "The fact is that a prospective member of the Olympic 
team was injured and unable to compete, and the perpetrators have said that the 
purpose was to leave her out of the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The USFSA panel, which is the first step in a process that could remove 
Harding from the team, reviewed mounds of documents from the case, which is 
still being investigated by Portland authorities. They were guided by James 
McNelly, a Portland detective, and James Bennett, a Portland lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The group examined some information that has not been made public, Watson 
said. She refused to say what that new information was. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a couple pieces of evidence that are reaching pivotal importance 
for our decision," Watson said. "It has helped point us in a certain 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Other panel members said Friday after the meeting that they were pleased with 
their progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel requested Harding's presence Friday, but she and her attorneys 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been in touch with the figure skating people and . . . decided that 
Tonya will not be there," Harding's attorney, Robert Weaver, said. "She needs 
to focus on training. . . . We have visited with them frequently over the 
telephone." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the panel decides today, it will not be the end of Harding's 
saga because possible criminal charges in Portland await. 
</P>
<P>
 If a disciplinary hearing is recommended by the USFSA, Harding would have 30 
days to respond. If she is found to have committed an ethics violation, 
Ferguson, the USFSA president, could revoke Harding's membership in the 
association. Harding would then be barred from skating in the World 
Championships in Japan on March 22-27. 
</P>
<P>
 But by then, the Winter Games would be only a memory. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding is to be barred from the Olympics, it appears the USOC will have to 
intervene, presumably after a USFSA hearing recommendation. But it is unclear 
whether the USOC appeals process can handle the case on such short notice.

ROOKIE LYNCH PLAYING LIKE AN ALL-STAR NOW; LAKERS: HE CONTINUES SURGE WITH 
CAREER-HIGH 26 POINTS AND FOUR STEALS IN VICTORY OVER MAVERICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 His bonus money from the shoe deal and the trading card company and the NBA 
for making the rookie all-star game won't be coming, because George Lynch 
wasn't picked to play in Minneapolis a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
 His time, however, has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it meant the extended loss of a talented teammate, Lynch continues to 
make Doug Christie's sprained ankle look like one of the best things to happen 
to the Lakers all season. When Christie went out, Lynch went in, triggering a 
turn of events that reached new heights Friday night, when he scored a 
game-high 26 points and made four steals in a 95-87 victory over the Dallas 
Mavericks at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie who a month ago had trouble getting into the game has played at 
least 41 minutes the last five outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie who once struggled as an undersized power forward has 18 and 12 
rebounds within the last four outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The rookie who was taken for defense and rebounding has scored 20 points or 
more in two of the last four outings. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this probably would have happened had the Lakers not been forced into 
starting Lynch when Christie suffered the ankle injury that has kept him out 
the last 10 games and probably will for several more. But since it has 
happened. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "George Lynch, my goodness," Coach Randy Pfund said. "Every night, he seems to 
be doing more." 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Mavericks, he did more than enough. The 26 points were a season 
high. He made 10 of 19 shots. He had only six rebounds, the fewest since 
becoming a starter, but five of those came on the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch has everything going for him except recognition. Because selections for 
the inaugural rookie all-star game were made several weeks ago, he wasn't even 
in contention to join teammate Nick Van Exel in Minnesota. And because he 
barely played early on, the former North Carolina standout doesn't come close 
to having the minimum qualifying standards to rank among the league leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, he's at a respectable eight points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.28 steals, 55% 
shooting and 17.7 minutes. Going off his numbers as a starter, though, he 
rates: 16.2 points, 9.7 rebounds, 3.1 steals, 36.3 minutes and 54.5% shooting. 
Only 10 games, but the steals would put him first in the league heading into 
Friday's games, the shooting 10th and the rebounds tied for 16th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure if I play, whether at the end of the season or the middle, that if I 
keep doing what I'm doing, I'm going to get the credit," Lynch said. "I hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch had a key defensive play in the closing minutes as the Lakers held of a 
Dallas charge from a 13-point third-quarter deficit, stealing the ball from 
Jamal Mashburn. If Mashburn had scored on his slice through the lane, the lead 
would have been down to three, but the strip and subsequent driving layup by 
Sedale Threatt made it a four-point turnaround. That put the Lakers safely 
ahead again, 94-87, with 1:57 to go and the Mavericks a step closer to their 
41st loss in 45 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell had 19 points and 11 rebounds for the Lakers, who ended a 
five-game road losing streak. Vlade Divac had 15 points, 19 rebounds, seven 
assists and a near fight. That happened with 7:10 left in the third quarter, 
when he and Randy White tussled over a rebound after the whistle had blown. 
White shoved Divac, then took a swing that didn't connect, still enough to earn 
an ejection and certain suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac didn't retaliate with a counterpunch, saving him from getting kicked 
out, too. But that didn't save him from playing the villain the rest of the 
night, getting booed every time he touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good," Divac said later, smiling. "I'm used to it. Laker 
fans boo me at home."

FRENCH-BRED KOTASHAAN IS HORSE OF THE YEAR FOR '93 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kotashaan, who led one of the strongest grass divisions in years by winning 
six stakes in California, was named thoroughbred racing's horse of the year for 
1993 Friday night, becoming the first French-bred to win the award since the 
filly All Along in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, at the Eclipse Awards dinner in New Orleans, was not 
unexpected. Two weeks ago it was announced that Kotashaan had defeated Lure by 
43 votes in balloting for best male turf horse. Kotashaan's margin for horse of 
the year was thinner, however. He topped Lure, 116-101, and actually won by a 
split vote under the Eclipse Awards' voting system. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing a plurality from two of the three voting groups, Kotashaan was a 65-53 
winner among the turf writers and his edge over Lure was 13-7 from the track 
racing secretaries. The Daily Racing Form favored Lure, 41-38. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Kotashaan won the title with less than 44% of the total of 266 votes. 
Ten other horses received votes, with Bertrando, the year's best older horse on 
dirt, finishing third with 20 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotashaan began his career in France, where he won three races in 1990-91 for 
trainer Criquette Head. Alec Head, the trainer's father, recommended that the 
horse be sent to California trainer Richard Mandella in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Early that year, Kotashaan won one of three starts, then was sidelined for 5 
1/2 months because of a minor fracture in a rear leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Kotashaan finished fourth and second in his first two races at 
Santa Anita, then reeled off four consecutive victories, including the San Luis 
Rey and San Juan Capistrano at Santa Anita and the Eddie Read at Del Mar. After 
losing by a nose to Luazur in the Del Mar Invitational, Kotashaan finished 1993 
with victories in the Oak Tree Invitational and the Breeders' Cup Turf at Santa 
Anita, and a second-place finish in the Japan Cup in Tokyo, where his jockey, 
Kent Desormeaux, misjudged the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "That minor injury was the best thing that happened to him," Mandella said. 
"While he recovered, he filled out into a mature horse, and he had his mind on 
running by the time he came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Bred by his owners, brothers Jacques and Gerard Wertheimer of the Chanel 
perfume family, and ridden by Desormeaux in all of his victories, Kotashaan had 
six firsts and three seconds in his 10 starts last year, earning $2.6 million. 
He never faced Lure, who won six of eight starts, including the Breeders' Cup 
Mile, and earned $1.2 million. Another grass standout, Star Of Cozzene, earned 
$1.7 million and won six races, beating Kotashaan and Lure twice each, but he 
didn't run in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Kotashaan is a 5-year-old son of French Derby winner Darshaan and Haute 
Autorite, an Elocutionist mare who won only two races and earned $23,964. The 
Wertheimers have sold Kotashaan for an estimated $4.5 million to a syndicate 
that will stand him at stud in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The last grass runner to be voted horse of the year was John Henry in 1984.

MORNING BRIEFING: IN THE EYE OF A TIGER, HITTING IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Phillips, a utility player for the hitting-rich Detroit Tigers, wasn't 
pleased with rumors that the Tigers would trade Mickey Tettleton for a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Tettleton hit 32 home runs and knocked in 110 runs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the heck does anybody expect one pitcher to pick up that kind of slack?" 
Phillips said. "Everybody hops on pitching. Well, isn't that nice! All a 
big-name pitcher means is that you've got a big-name pitcher. Nine times out of 
10, it doesn't work out. Most of them flop with their new club. Just because 
you sign a top-notch pitcher, it doesn't mean you're going to reap the 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for highest free-throw percentage in a 
regular season? 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, the song: The Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan figure skating saga has 
inspired several Portland area composers to record skating scandal songs that 
take different sides on Harding's role. Ron Allen and Steve Asplund, calling 
themselves the Zambonis, concocted the biting satire, "If You Can't Beat 'Em, 
Beat 'Em (Tonya's Song)."It goes: 
</P>
<P>
 "If Nancy looks too good, you just break her knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you can kick her butt like you said on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, flip side: Greg and Linda Lewis of Vancouver, Wash., composed a song 
that is a little more supportive, "It's Tonya's Turn." The lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 "To us you represent the dreams that we all hold. 
</P>
<P>
 "That no matter who you are, you can have the pot of gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Last of his kind? Bob Richards, who won Olympic gold medals in the pole vault 
in 1952 and '56, called meet promoter Al Franken to enter his son, Brandon, in 
the Sunkist Invitational at the Sports Arena on Feb. 19. While they were 
talking, Richards told Franken he had vaulted 12 feet 6 inches the other day. 
Franken asked: "What's the record for someone in your age bracket?" Richards 
replied: "I don't think there are any other 68-year-old pole vaulters." 
</P>
<P>
 Quite an honor: Before Kevin McHale's No. 32 was retired Sunday at Boston 
Garden, a roast was held at Brandeis University, with McHale the target of 
jokes by former teammates and Boston celebrities. The producers of "Cheers," 
which featured McHale in two episodes, placed an ad in the roast program. It 
read: "You are without a doubt the finest actor over 6-10 we ever had on our 
show. (Kareem turned us down)." 
</P>
<P>
 Should have left like McHale: Six NBA stars that stayed one year too long: Bob 
Cousy, who averaged 0.7 points per game in his final season; Bill Walton, 2.8; 
Dolph Schayes, 5.6; Neil Johnston, 6.3; Elvin Hayes, 5.0, and Walt Frazier, 
3.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Familiar pattern: In five of the last six seasons, the Sacramento Kings have 
had a 12-29 record midway through the season. That's where they were Tuesday 
night before beating Portland, 102-97, to raise their record to 13-29. "It's 
amazing," Coach Garry St. Jean said. "It's a very strange happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a fact: Five countries will be participating in their first Winter 
Olympics this month at Lillehammer, Norway: Israel, South Africa, Central 
Africa, Thailand and Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Calvin Murphy of Houston, 95.8% in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Dallas Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson, when his relationship with owner 
Jerry Jones was likened to that of the one between George Steinbrenner and

DRAG RACING / WINTERNATIONALS AT POMONA; CARS RETURN WITH AS MUCH FUN AS EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few years ago, when Kenny Bernstein, Don Prudhomme and Ed McCulloch deserted 
funny cars to drive top fuel dragsters, it was widely predicted that interest 
in the funnies was waning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein and Prudhomme had each won four National Hot Rod Assn. 
championships. McCulloch had won the prestigious U.S. Nationals six times. 
</P>
<P>
 The end seemed at hand when 1989 champion Bruce Larson disbanded his team and 
Roland Leong parked the first 290-m.p.h. funny car for lack of sponsorship. The 
perception was that maybe interest in funny cars -- short-wheelbased, 
nitro-burning dragsters camouflaged with fiberglass bodies to make them appear, 
sort of, like the family car -- was a passing fad. 
</P>
<P>
 Left to prop up the ailing class were John Force of Yorba Linda, who has 32 
national-event victories; and young Cruz Pedregon of Moorpark, who switched 
from top fuel to win the 1992 championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny cars had started in Southern California, and it seemed they might end 
here in a regional shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a funny thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers who had been racing on the fringe of the sport, carefully choosing 
their spots without contesting for the points championship, began showing up on 
a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Etchells, 39, an engraver from Putnam, Conn., became the first to run 
the quarter-mile in less than five seconds when he was clocked in 4.987 seconds 
last Oct. 1 at Topeka, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Epler, 36, a computer company owner from Wilsonville, Ore., became the 
first funny car driver to break the 300-m.p.h. barrier with a 300.40 effort two 
days later in the first round at Topeka. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Hofmann, 46, a former building contractor from Umatilla, Fla., won the 
Winston Invitational at Rockingham, N.C., drag racing's version of an all-star 
game, for the second time. And this year, he has something he never had -- 
financial support to do the testing and development necessary to challenge for 
the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been going up and down the road to drag strips every year since 1979, 
driving the truck, changing the engines, buying the parts, doing all the 
mechanical work and then driving," Hofmann said while watching his crew prepare 
the red-and-white Dodge Daytona for Sunday's Chief Auto Parts Winternationals 
at the Pomona Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take that back. Until 1987, I did it all. Then it was Helen and I, until 
Tom Anderson joined us last year as crew chief. Now, with sponsorship from 
Western Auto and Slick 50, we have Anderson and a crew to do all the work, 
although Helen still does the clutch system." 
</P>
<P>
 Al met the woman who is now Helen Hofmann in January 1987 in Australia, where 
he was barnstorming with a funny car. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got back to the States, Helen was my crew -- she had been a mechanic 
and could do anything a race car needed," Hofmann said. "We were going to pick 
up the season in Phoenix." 
</P>
<P>
 The honeymoon and Hofmann's life almost ended there. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann was racing Force when a block exploded at the finish line and the 
fiberglass body on Hofmann's car caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was so intense it burned the chute off, cooked the brake fluid and 
scorched the tires," Hofmann said. "I had about a car length on Force, and the 
fire singed his chute. I went all the way through the runoff area and out into 
the desert before I could stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw the tumbleweeds coming at me. They looked like redwood trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was on fire a minute and 30 seconds before I could get out. I was so 
disoriented, I couldn't find the harness belts, and once I did and tried to 
lift myself out, the sides of the car collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that saved me was (my) nine-layer fire suit," Hofmann said. 
"That, and the safety crew that seemed like it was right beside me the instant 
I stopped, kept me alive. I went to the hospital with burned lungs, and every 
time I coughed, my throat felt like a chimney. The car was an $80,000 wipeout." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Helen Hofmann's introduction to NHRA racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It put us in a big hole in a heartbeat," she said. "We had no sponsor back 
then. That was a pretty rugged way to start." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1994 season starts at Pomona, the Hofmanns have a new lifestyle. They 
arrived in the family van -- Al, Helen and Deoge (pronounced D-O-G) Shar-Pei, 
whom Hofmann calls without reservation, "the most important thing in our life." 
</P>
<P>
 The two 1994 Dodge Daytonas, a McKinney chassis and a 500-cubic inch Keith 
Black aluminum Hemi engine were in the garage when they arrived, trucked in by 
a 53-foot truck-trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Daytona is the slipperiest car out here," Hofmann said as the cars were 
unloaded. "I'm looking for a 5-flat run or better here. I can't tell you in 
words how much better it feels to arrive knowing we've tested the car to make 
it right before the season starts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Pomona owes me one, and I hope to get even this week." 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann reached the championship round of the Winston Finals last Oct. 31 at 
Pomona, but lost to Epler when the clutch locked and Hofmann could not make it 
to the starting line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were ready to run a 5.05 in the finals, but we never got the 
chance to find out," Hofmann said. Epler won with an uncontested elapsed time 
of 5.105 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona is Epler's favorite track, but he said he doesn't expect to challenge 
300 m.p.h. again soon, adding: "That first 300 was tremendously satisfying, but 
now that it's in the record books, we plan to concentrate on our elapsed times 
because that's what wins races." 
</P>
<P>
 After Epler's 300-m.p.h. run eliminated Gordon Mineo in the first round at 
Topeka, the engine in his Olds Cutlass blew up in the second round, causing a 
fire that destroyed the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what the 300 did for us," Epler said. "It opened a lot of doors. 
It's made a big difference. We've been able to market it with apparel and 
souvenirs. And Rug Doctor has substantially increased its support so that we 
can make a run for the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Etchells followed his historic "first in the fours" run during qualifying for 
the Craftsman Nationals into his second victory of the season -- his first 
running the full 18-event schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the greatest weekend of my life," said Etchells, who maintains a 
full-time position as president of Union Engravers in Connecticut along with 
his racing schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the '91 season, I was really ready to pack it in because we had no 
sponsor and I couldn't continue," Etchells said. "But then Superwinch and 
Kendall Oil came to the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Etchells responded with three NHRA victories and a fifth place in the 1992 
standings, despite missing three of 18 races. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann's preseason analysis: "I don't see Force or anyone else having a year 
like he had last year. He won 11 races, but he was beatable. Now that some of 
us have enough backing to race John and Cruz (Pedregon), I don't think any 
driver will win more than three races, and the championship will go down to the 
Winston Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Funny cars are back, big time." Winternationals Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kalitta, driving his family's top fuel dragster, reached 302.10 m.p.h. 
Friday, but his elapsed time of 4.802 seconds did not knock Jimmy Nix out of 
the No. 1 qualifying position. Nix ran 4.781 Thursday. . . . Intermittent 
showers washed most of the rubber off the racing surface, causing times and 
speeds for the Chief Auto Parts Winternationals to be generally slower than on 
Thursday. Qualifying for Sunday's eliminations will continue today.

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE: MAIER'S DEATH REKINDLES OLD DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It can only be hoped that Austrian Ulrike Maier's violent death last Saturday 
on the downhill course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, will raise the 
decibels on what has been a lopsided debate between racers and the 
International Ski Federation (FIS) over skier rights. 
</P>
<P>
 To mostly deaf ears, World Cup racers have been complaining about their lack 
of involvement in course design and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As it stands, FIS, the sport's heavy-handed governing body, basically lays 
down the law: If it determines that a race course is safe, skiers are obliged 
to hurl their bodies down hills, sometimes to their death. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether the course on which Maier -- a two-time world 
champion and mother of a 4-year-old daughter -- met her fate was in any way 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Course officials at Garmisch maintain that Maier crashed on one of the safest 
portions of the downhill. Rain earlier in the week froze the course and made it 
extremely fast. Typically, downhill racers prefer a hard, fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier crashed, it appeared, when her right ski stuck in a patch of softer snow 
and caused her to lose balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skiers had a different definition of safe . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like sheer ice, like trying to survive your way down," Krista 
Schmidinger of the United States said in a statement released afterward. 
Schmidinger was the next skier down the hill after Maier. 
</P>
<P>
 American Picabo Street objected to the use of PTX3, a chemical spread on the 
course earlier in the week to keep the snow from melting. Street said it made 
the surface uneven, slick in some spots and sticky in others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really getting out of hand," said Hilary Lindh, winner of Wednesday's 
downhill at Sierra Nevada, Spain. "The (FIS) are so desperate to get races off, 
for the money involved and the TV coverage, and sponsors, they're almost 
putting that in front of everything else. I hope the point has been made." 
</P>
<P>
 FIS officials have suggested slowing courses down, a plan that skiers would 
reject. They want the courses safer, not slower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downhill is supposed to be fast," Lindh said. "If not, it's got to be called 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the best conditions, downhill racing at 60 m.p.h. is a crap shoot. It's 
a risk all skiers accept. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dangerous sport," Bob Beattie, TV analyst and former U.S. ski team 
coach, said this week from Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 No one argues the point. Given ever-changing weather, creating a race course 
to satisfy everyone would be next to impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 But shouldn't the skiers at least have some voice in the matter? 
</P>
<P>
 If a large chunk of pavement came loose from the oval at the Indianapolis 500, 
but organizers said go ahead and drive around it, would drivers object? 
</P>
<P>
 The question begs, How would skiers handle more rights? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard, because we're not objective sometimes," Lindh said. "At the same 
time, we're the ones going down the hill; we should have a little input." 
</P>
<P>
 All skiers want is some consistency, a standard by which courses are measured. 
</P>
<P>
 What they get is a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two faces of FIS: Last Saturday's race continued even after Maier's tragic 
fall. Earlier this month, at Altenmarkt, Austria, FIS officials waited until 26 
of 32 racers crashed near the finish area before halting the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, last year, a downhill race at Aspen, in which American AJ Kitt was 
leading, was abruptly canceled because of a small but fixable hole, according 
to skiers, that developed on the course -- a course designed not by skiers but 
by organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the generally poor snow conditions throughout Europe this winter, 
getting a course in shape is admittedly no easy chore. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite almost perfect early-season racing conditions in America, the FIS 
plods on through Europe on sheets of ice and bedrock. 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie, who helped found the World Cup, said the FIS generally does a good 
job in preparing World Cup courses. But is good good enough? 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, when Beattie formed his own professional ski tour, he handed all 
responsibility for safety and course concerns to the racers. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting early-season races to North America would also solve a lot of 
problems, but one must never forget that the World Cup is a circuit operated by 
and for Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough," Beattie said of racing overseas. "(The elevation) just isn't 
high enough. They don't have as good man-made snow (as in this country), and 
often it's not cold enough to make snow. People who ski at Mammoth would have a 
hell of a time skiing in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Beattie said conditions in Europe typically get better in February and March. 
</P>
<P>
 So, naturally, after the Olympics, the World Cup will move to North America 
for events that include women's races at Mammoth Mountain and the World Cup 
Finals at Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Ulli Maier will only further galvanize skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, a group of the top women's skiers boycotted training runs on the 
Olympic downhill course at Hafjell, Norway, claiming the course was too easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest led to a change of venue. The women's downhill will now be run at 
Kvitfjell, site of the men's race. 
</P>
<P>
 It is perhaps too harsh to hang the death of Maier on course officials. Death, 
sadly, is part of the skiing game. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, giving skiers a stake in the decision making would, if nothing 
else, provide some peace of mind when the gates open. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Ulli Maier knows a different peace now. Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's storm has made for the best ski conditions of the season in the local 
mountains. The Big Bear resorts and Mountain High in Wrightwood, operating most 
of the winter on the strength of man-made snow, have received up to a foot of 
fresh powder. . . . Mt. Baldy reported eight to 12 inches of new snow, allowing 
it to open one advanced run from the top on Chair No. 3, with other runs due to 
follow. . . . Big Air Green Valley, the snowboard-only area in Running Springs, 
resumed operation last weekend and reports 90% of its runs are open, the 
exception being the Half-pipe, which could open soon. . . . Ski Sunrise in 
Wrightwood has also reopened and is operating beginner and intermediate runs 
while offering a discounted lift-ticket of $20 this weekend. . . . Mt. Waterman 
and Kratka Ridge, both in the Angeles National Forest, report that they are 
close to opening but need a few more inches of snow. . . . Chains were required 
Friday on most mountain roads at the 4,000-foot elevation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris T. Dropps, the USA Pro Moguls Champion, will compete today at Snow 
Summit in Big Bear, this week's stop on the Budweiser Mogul Series. The event 
will be televised by ESPN at 10:30 a.m., PST, on Feb. 13. . . . Wrightwood will 
stage its Winter Carnival next Saturday. The schedule of activities -- ski and 
snowboard races, ice sculptures, sled races and more -- will take place at 
Wrightwood Village locations and at Mountain High and Ski Sunrise. . . . For 
the first time in four seasons, two Americans met in a Women's Pro Ski Tour 
final last weekend at Keystone, Colo. Lynda McGehee of Boulder, Colo., defeated 
rookie Sally Knight of Waitsfield, Vt., to win the slalom of the $30,000 event.

 How big is cross-country skiing in Norway? An estimated 70,000 lined the 
trails of a recent World Cup race in that nation. The first Olympic event to 
sell out was not figure skating, but the men's 4x10-kilometer relay. It is 
estimated that thousands of fans will sleep in the woods to secure spots along 
the Olympic cross-country trails . . . But don't expect the Norwegian Alpine 
team to be a flop, either. Last weekend, Kjetil Andre Aamodt won his first 
World Cup downhill at Chamonix, France, while Norway took the top three spots 
in the combined, with Aamodt winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Olympic Alpine team will be named Sunday. Paul Major, U.S. Alpine 
director, will make the announcement from Oslo. The most notable racer on the 
U.S. bubble is 1992 Olympic giant slalom silver medalist Diann 
Roffe-Steinrotter, who is fighting for a spot in super-G and GS. A maximum of 
22 U.S. skiers will be chosen, with no more than 14 of one gender. . . . Hilary 
Lindh's downhill victory Wednesday at Sierra Nevada, Spain, was the first for 
an American woman on the World Cup circuit since 1986, when Pam Fletcher won at 
Vail.

 Nancy Kerrigan pronounced herself ready for the Winter Olympics on Friday 
night after performing flawlessly during an exhibition that attracted Olympic 
champions, her family and more than 4,500 supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to go.I can't wait to get there," Kerrigan told the crowd at 
night's end. "Thank you all for coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's Olympic hopes were uncertain when an attacker clubbed her just 
above her right knee Jan. 6 after one of her practice sessions for the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. championships in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, she landed every move that tested her rejuvenated right leg, from 
an opening triple jump to several sit spins. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's back," the arena announcer said over the crowd's applause, as Kerrigan 
ended the two-minute program she will perform at the Lillehammer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan is scheduled to fly to Norway next weekend and train until the 
women's competition begins Feb. 23 in the village of Hamar.

 Outfielder Juan Gonzalez, who at times complained about his $525,000 salary 
last season, moved into the top 10 on baseball's money list Friday when he 
agreed to a $30.7-million, five-year contract with the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's package could be worth as much as $45.45 million over seven years 
if the Rangers exercise options for 1999 and 2000.

 "This kid is going to be in the Hall of Fame, and if anybody is worthy of it, 
he is," club President Tom Schieffer said.

 Gonzalez, 24, who hit 46 home runs last season, will get a $2-million signing 
bonus, salaries of $3 million this year, $5 million in 1995, $6.7 million in 
'96 and $7 million in the '97 and '98 seasons. The club options call for $7.25 
million in '99 and $7.5 million in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the options are exercised, the deal would surpass Barry Bonds' 
$43.75-million, six-year contract with the San Francisco Giants, currently the 
largest package in baseball.

EMPIRE LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ESPERANZA WINS BACK-AND-FORTH BATTLE WITH KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't until the final buzzer sounded Friday that visiting Esperanza could 
breathe a sigh of relief after its 60-57 victory over Katella in an Empire 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Greer's layup with less than 30 seconds remaining gave Esperanza the lead 
for good, marking the 11th lead change of the night. The score was tied 12 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both teams played really hard tonight," Esperanza Coach Mark Hill said. "I'm 
proud we came back after being down a few points late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 With five minutes left in the fourth quarter, Katella (13-8, 4-4) went ahead, 
51-47, its biggest lead of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mike Thimgan and Mike Lawson each hit short jump shots, tying the 
score again. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory clinched a playoff spot for Esperanza (16-7, 6-2). Katella's hopes 
depend on its final two league games. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson and Thimgan each carried the Aztecs at certain points of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson scored 13 points in the first half and seven in the fourth quarter, 
finishing with 20. Thimgan scored 10 of his 20 points in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Lawson had a great first half and really kept us in the game," Hill 
said. "Then, Mike Thimgan picked us up in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza also hit on all 12 of its free throws, with Thimgan extending the 
school record for consecutive free throws made to 42, converting on seven 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess those proved to be the difference," Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella's Mike Pahl finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Carlos Romero 
scored nine points in the second half, including five late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Loara 59, Cypress 57 (OT) -- Scott Davis hit an 18-foot jumper with three 
seconds left in overtime to win it for host Loara (12-11, 5-6). His was the 
only basket in the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis led Loara with 25 points. Derek Mitchell scored 15 points for Cypress 
(12-11, 3-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 78, El Dorado 62 -- Ryan Staniec scored 30 points and Tim Lin 
added 12 and 11 assists for host Los Alamitos (20-3, 8-0). Dante Spencer scored

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE ROUNDUP; TRABUCO HILLS PUTS IT IN HIGHER GEAR TO DEFEAT 
ESTANCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills played it fast and loose, then even looser, Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs proved they were a little better at not playing defense with a 
90-81 victory over Estancia, which kept them in a first-place tie with Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Players on both sides gave the semblance of defense, even staying within a few 
feet of the man assigned them. It was merely an illusion. The idea was to get 
the ball, run and shoot it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was enough to make Rainer Wulf's heart soar. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Trabuco Hills' basketball," Wulf said. "We don't want to concentrate 
on our opponent, we want to get the ball up the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither side seemed to have any problems with that strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a back-and-forth, get-it-and-go game. Leads evaporated quickly 
and without much notice. Estancia was up by seven at halftime. Trabuco Hills 
led by nine after three quarters. The Eagles get within four with five minutes 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (19-5, 7-1) finally put it away with a 12-2 run that gave them a 
85-73 lead with 1 minute 26 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to create turnovers, push the ball and try to put together runs," 
Wulf said. "It's our style." 
</P>
<P>
 The style and personnel fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Warnick scored 24 points, including seven in the fourth quarter. Ryan 
Karnoff scored 23 points, 15 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But both needed a map to find the players they were guarding. Estancia had 
seven layups in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to put a man deep in the second half," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was usually Derek Uhl, who on one play flattened Estancia's Clay Frenz. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhl, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound center, also scored 13 points, more than he had had 
all season. It was only his third game back from a knee injury. He was 
particularly effective in taking out Chris Candlish, Estancia's 6-5, 250-pound 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Candlish had 19 points and 12 rebounds in the first game against Trabuco 
Hills. He fouled out Friday with five points and one rebound. Three Estancia 
players fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derek fouled out their entire front line," Wulf said. 
</P>
<P>
 On one possession, Uhl was hit on the arm as he shot. It went straight up, 
approximately 25 feet, and straight through the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were three shots Uhl took that I would have bet a dollar weren't going 
to go in," Estancia Coach Tim Parsel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uhl wasn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone was letting them fly. Frenz scored 19 points and Mark Pierson 15 for 
Estancia (14-9, 5-3). 
</P>
<P>
 It was a pace the Eagles liked, but the Mustangs loved. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wulf: "When Trabuco Hills scores 80 points, Trabuco Hills usually wins." 
</P>
<P>
 In another league game: 
</P>
<P>
 Century 67, Laguna Beach 39 -- Senior center Thomas Harmon scored a game-high 
23 points for sixth-ranked Century (21-3, 7-1).

SUNSET LEAGUE ROUNDUP; OCEAN VIEW ISN'T ABLE TO SLOW OILERS ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ocean View slowed down Huntington Beach's offense, but the Oilers scored 
enough to post a 46-38 victory over the Seahawks in a Sunset League boys' 
basketball game Friday at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest and littlest Oilers did the most damage, with 6-foot-6, 230-pound 
center Tony Gonzalez tallying 18 points and nine rebounds and 5-8 point guard 
Vasili Hatziris finishing with 12 points and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (15-9, 9-3 in league), ranked ninth in Orange County, 
remained in second place and the Seahawks (12-12, 7-5) are scrambling for a 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game was so big for us," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller said. 
"Especially against a rival like this, we didn't want to lose three times to 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View beat Huntington Beach, 51-47, during the first round of league 
play, and the Seahawks won their meeting during the Tournament of Champions in 
December, 50-47. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Ocean View controlled the tempo and the Seahawks' defense held the 
Oilers under 50 points again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't score tonight," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. "I told the 
kids that I wasn't mad at them. They're playing their tails off and it has to 
be frustrating for them. We're really struggling offensively right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View out-rebounded Huntington Beach, 34-27, and committed 11 turnovers 
to Huntington Beach's 13. The result was nine more shots for the Seahawks but 
they made only 26% (11 of 43) from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange game," Miller said. "Ocean View was really patient on 
offense, to the point where it might have taken more out of them when they kept 
working the ball around and working it around, but they couldn't score." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Carney, who had 10 points, made a fallaway jumper to give the Seahawks 
their last lead at 9-8, two minutes into the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers answered with Hatziris scoring four points on two layups to 
highlight an 8-0 run as Huntington Beach took control before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Holland had 10 points and five rebounds for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Walsh had nine points and Aaron Hatch had eight points and nine rebounds 
for the Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League games: 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 70, Santa Ana 54 -- Eric Endsley scored 25 points to lead Marina 
(10-14, 4-8), which led, 24-12, after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 63, Westminster 42 -- Kieran Betts scored 22 points and Kristian 
Vallas added 16 for visiting Servite (16-7, 9-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Edison-Fountain Valley postponed -- Baron Coach Gordon Billingsley said 
Friday's game was postponed because a transformer at Fountain Valley High 
failed and the gymnasium's lights didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 The game will be played at a date to be determined.

 The Detroit Pistons traded Sean Elliott to the Houston Rockets on Friday for

games for the Pistons, averaging 13 points, 4.4 rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have been hard here," Elliott said before the trade. "I wish things 
were better. I'm not really happy about my situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, who has been slowed lately by pneumonia, has had only one 20-point 
game since mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-10 Horry, who played college ball at Alabama, was Houston's top 
draft choice in 1992. He has averaged 28.3 minutes per game this season, 
scoring 8.6 points and grabbing 5.3 rebounds. He has complained recently about 
a lack of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-10 Bullard, who was used by the Rockets as a three-point threat, is 
averaging 3.9 points and 1.3 rebounds. Bullard was included in the deal so it 
can work under the NBA salary cap.

SANTA ANITA; HOLLYWOOD WILDCAT RETURNS AGAINST SMALL LA CANADA FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat hasn't lost a race since arriving in California last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners Irving and Marjorie Cowan's homebred has won five consecutive stakes 
victories for trainer Neil Drysdale, the biggest when she beat Paseana by a 
nose in the Breeders' Cup Distaff last Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of Kris S. hasn't run since then and might be ripe for an upset 
in the $211,500 La Canada Stakes today at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Drysdale admittedly hasn't trained her rigorously, and there are more 
important races in 1994 for last year's Eclipse Award winner as the nation's 
top 3-year-old filly. 
</P>
<P>
 The filly who appeared to have the best chance of surprising 4-5 favorite 
Hollywood Wildcat in the 1 1/8-mile race probably won't start. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensational Eyes, the 3-1 second choice, has been bothered by an abscess in 
her foot, and trainer Gary Jones said he will decide this morning whether she 
will run in the Grade II event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not real optimistic," Jones said. "There's really nothing you can do to 
protect it and it is still (tender). If she's not perfect, she won't run, and 
I'm not sure if she'd be ready for (the Santa Maria Handicap next Saturday)" 
</P>
<P>
 A California-bred daughter of Roman Majesty, Sensational Eyes popped the 
abscess after finishing second to longshot Supah Gem in the El Encino Stakes 
three weeks ago. After opening up two lengths into the stretch, Sensational 
Eyes was overtaken and beaten by a length. Jones says the problem cost her the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three other horses were entered in the La Canada -- Stalcreek, Golden 
Klair and Alyshena. 
</P>
<P>
 Third in the El Encino, Stalcreek has proven she can handle an off track. The 
Stalwart filly won an allowance race by 3 1/2 lengths on a muddy surface at 
Santa Anita on Jan. 9, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Klair finished sixth in the El Encino after an 11-1 upset of the 
now-retired Pacific Squall in the Silver Belles, but the anticipated moderate 
pace doesn't figure to help her. 
</P>
<P>
 Alyshena was well beaten in the El Encino and deserves to be the longest shot 
in the field. However, her trainer, Jack Van Berg, has won the La Canada two of 
the last three years with longshots. Fit to Scout scored at 9-1 in 1991, and 
Alysbelle was 15-1 when she defeated Pacific Squall last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There will probably be a shorter price on the program today than Hollywood 
Wildcat. 
</P>
<P>
 Trishyde could be 1-5 in the $75,000 Las Potrancas Handicap, which is 
scheduled at 1 1/4 miles on the turf two races before the La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Inclement weather could cause the Las Potrancas to be switched to the main 
track, but trainer George Vogel said Trishyde will go no matter the surface. 
All 13 of her races have been on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plans are to run regardless," he said. "We've anticipated running on the 
main track anyway (at some point). She's doing as well as a horse can do right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 A 5-year-old Nureyev mare, Trishyde won by 4 1/2 lengths over four allowance 
rivals on Dec. 30 in her first race in nearly nine months after suffering a 
stress fracture to a cannon bone. She will race five opponents today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve 4-year-olds were entered Friday morning for the $500,000 Strub Stakes 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Tango, third in the San Fernando Stakes last month, is the probable 
favorite for the 1 1/4-mile Grade I stake. He drew post No. 2, and Eddie 
Delahoussaye will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Zignew, upset winner of the San Fernando, and Nonproductiveasset, who finished 
second, are back for the Strub, along with also-rans Stuka, Diazo, Goldigger's 
Dream and Bat Eclat. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers to the field are Kissin Kris, Dinand, Tinners Way, Fight for 
Love and Justtofit. 
</P>
<P>
 With no more rain expected until Sunday night, the track could be fast for the 
Strub, and Jones, who trains Stuka, says his colt could be a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Allen Paulson, who also has Diazo, Stuka finished sixth in the San 
Fernando in a better-than-it-looked effort. Seemingly unwilling to run inside 
of horses, the son of Jade Hunter dropped back to 10th at one point, then 
finished well once jockey Chris Antley got him to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trained well since (the San Fernando), and I don't think you've seen the 
best of him," Jones said. "But I don't know if he'll like the (mud) or not, if 
it comes up that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a wide-open race. I think any one of five horses could win it. 
We didn't see the real Diazo the other day, and Kissin Kris is a very nice 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere, who missed making his first start of the year in the Hutcheson Stakes 
last Sunday because of a mild case of colic, will run in the first race at 
Gulfstream Park today. 
</P>
<P>
 Idle since he was blitzed by Brocco in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, Dehere will 
have four opponents in the 1 1/16 mile allowance race. Mike Smith will ride the 
Eclipse Award winner.

EIGHT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR CONTRERAS, CS NORTHRIDGE; COLLEGE BASEBALL: MATADORS 
STAKE VETERAN PITCHER TO 4-2 LEAD BUT HE LETS IT GET AWAY DURING A FIVE-RUN 
SIXTH THAT HELPS CAL POLY SLO TO 9-8 OPENING VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Instant replay, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Contreras didn't allow an earned run during the month of February during 
the 1993 Cal State Northridge baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's season opener, he didn't escape the first inning without getting 
dinged for a run. Nowhere to go but up, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it was over, Contreras was charged with eight earned runs as Northridge 
fell to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in a wild nonconference game, 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, a senior right-hander who expected to fare considerably better, 
spoke to the team afterward and apologized for his disappointing effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Write this down," said Contreras, who went the distance. "I'll never give up 
nine runs again." 
</P>
<P>
 In a complete 180-degree turn, it was the pitching that struggled and the 
offense that almost carried the day. The Matadors, expected to scratch and claw 
for run production, came up with 11 hits -- including five for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was encouraged by the way we swung the bats," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen 
said. "And I was encouraged by the feel of the overall effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge almost felt what it's like to steal a victory in the final at-bat. 
Trailing, 9-5, entering the ninth, the Matadors made it uncomfortable for San 
Luis Obispo, which will be joining Northridge in the Western Athletic 
Conference West Division next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Arnold started the ninth with a walk and consecutive doubles by Jonathan 
Campbell and Keyaan Cook brought Northridge to within 9-7. Cook, a senior 
second baseman, had three hits and four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Cook scored on a groundout by freshman catcher Eric Gillespie, 
(two hits, two RBIs) which emptied the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one instant replay to come, though. Third baseman Tyler Nelson sent 
a ringing double to the gap visited moments earlier by Campbell and Cook to 
keep the rally alive. 
</P>
<P>
 However, side-arming right-hander Kevin Hannigan, who entered the game to face 
Cook, retired outfielder Josh Smaler on a pop fly to second and recorded the 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras, after attempting to explain what happened on the mound, dished out 
more than a few attaboys to the regulars, who definitely held up their end of 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the team not to change anything," Contreras said. "I said, 'Don't try 
to do anything more. You did a helluva job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras' self-analysis was not as laudatory. In particular, he could not 
explain his travails in the sixth inning, when he had little success recording 
the last out. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge staked Contreras to a 4-2 lead entering the bottom of the sixth, 
and the way the pitcher was rolling, it appeared the margin would hold up. 
Contreras had retired 10 batters in a row when he issued a two-out walk to 
former Westlake High standout Rob Neal -- on four pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 It only got worse, and fast. The next six batters also reached base -- two 
more on walks -- and Contreras looked like a man who had lost his car keys. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing being driven home were lots of San Luis Obispo runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was brutal," he said. "Two outs, nobody on, and I walked (Neal)? That 
won't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Priess, a freshman catcher from Brea, capped the inning with a two-run 
double down the line in left. San Luis Obispo sent 10 batters to the plate and 
took a 7-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen didn't exactly pull his punches when he spoke to Contreras afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole effort of the team went out the window because (Contreras) let his 
guard down with two out and nobody on," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The third out isn't the least important out of the inning, it's the most 
important."

NORTHRIDGE OUTCLASSED BY TROJANS; COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL: MATADORS PUT UP A FIGHT 
IN CONFERENCE OPENER, BUT CAN'T STAY WITH USC IN THE LONG RUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighteen days after having its world literally turned upside down by the Jan. 
17 earthquake, the Cal State Northridge men's volleyball team took a step to 
regaining some form of normalcy Friday night when it played USC in a Mountain 
Pacific Sports Federation match. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 8-ranked Matadors lost to the second-ranked Trojans for the 26th time 
in 28 matches, but Coach John Price saw plenty of positives in the Trojans' 
15-5, 11-15, 15-11, 15-7 victory at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good about our team," Price said. "SC's a great team and I felt 
like we played with them. I feel like the scores are not indicative of how 
close the match was." 
</P>
<P>
 The match, which was Northridge's first since finishing ninth in the UC Santa 
Barbara tournament Jan. 15, also served as the debut of Oliver Heitmann, a 
6-foot-7 middle blocker from Germany, who was cleared to play for the Matadors 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann had team-high totals of 20 kills and 13 digs for Northridge (0-1, 0-1 
in conference play), despite the fact that he is still hesitant to run certain 
plays in the Northridge offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not bad for my first match," Heitmann said. "(Northridge setter Gary 
Reznick) and I have only been practicing with each other for a few days. We 
don't know each other that well." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick, a senior from Taft High, liked what he saw in Heitmann. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting a player like Oliver is really going to help this team," Reznick 
said. "He is going to bring the caliber of play on this team up a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting an anemic .069 in the first game, Northridge bounced back to win 
the second behind the hitting and blocking of Heitmann and Gene Urcan (12 
kills). 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 11-9, Northridge extended its advantage to 12-9 when Heitmann and 
Urcan teamed up on a block of Chris Underwood (28 kills). 
</P>
<P>
 USC (4-0, 3-0) narrowed its deficit to 12-11, but Northridge took a 13-11 lead 
when the Trojans' Jason Muholland (26 kills) hit long and Heitmann gave the 
Matadors a 14-11 advantage with a service ace. Northridge closed the game out 
when USC was called for a net violation. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had too much firepower for the Matadors in the final two games, as 
Underwood and Muholland powered the Trojans to hitting percentages of .434 and 
.392 compared to Northridge's .269 and .089. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a great offensive team," Price said. "We couldn't stop them and I 
didn't anticipate stopping them. I was just hoping we could side out with them 
and catch a run here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 Reznick was particularly impressed with Muholland, a 6-7, 235-pound middle

 "It's really hard to stop a player like that," Reznick said. "He's going to 
get his kills during the course of a match. It's like playing against Michael 
Jordan. He's going to get his points."

SPUTTERING HART FINDS VICTORY WITHIN ITS GASP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Hart High's boys' basketball team, the smoothest running machine in the 
region, nearly broke down Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It coughed, it shimmied, it groaned. It nearly died with a clunk after shots 
by its perimeter players repeatedly went clank. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indians (20-1) stayed unbeaten in eight Foothill League games with a 
come-from-behind victory, 35-34, against Saugus at The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has been the Valley's No. 1-ranked team much of the season, because its 
precision half-court offense has hummed. But Friday the Indians appeared rusty, 
and rightly so. They were playing only their second game in 20 days since the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, which shot only 27% from the field, relied on defense and the inside 
scoring of 6-foot-8 center Cody Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson scored 18 points, most coming against double-teams under the basket 
or on layups after wrestling for offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus (10-10, 3-5 in league play) shot 67% from the field in the first half 
and 52% for the game, but Hart held the Centurions to six points in the second 
half -- two in the decisive fourth quarter, when they lost a nine-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, whose turnaround jumper turned out to be the winning basket, was 
happy to have a chance to play a game and forget about the earthquake, if only 
for 32 minutes. His family is moving into a rental this weekend because its 
home suffered major damage in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot's been going on," he said, "and there's only so many days in a row you 
can practice and keep your intensity up. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for me, when I saw (Saugus) start to turn the ball over, I knew they were 
as mentally unstable as we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus, which lost to Hart, 34-28, earlier in the season, might have beaten 
the Indians had it not committed 12 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played extremely well on defense, and we ran our game plan 
exactly how we wanted," Saugus Coach Eric Olsson said. "We just turned it over 
way too many times." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus was playing without starting guard Jeff Rogers, who was hospitalized 
with an undiagnosed illness. Rogers' backup, Marquez Johnson, was out with a 
thigh bruise, forcing Olsson to use junior varsity players Toby Nigh (six 
points) and Dusty Bowman (two). 
</P>
<P>
 John Dell led Saugus with nine points, all in the first half.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; RANCHO ALAMITOS STILL IN HUNT WITH VICTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos, trying to win its fourth consecutive Garden Grove League 
championship, kept its hopes alive Friday by defeating Kennedy, 63-49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get my first league championship this year," Rancho Alamitos 
Coach Peter Pyle said."And some of the girls on the team will be winning their 
fourth." 
</P>
<P>
 Those are lofty expectations for the Vaqueros, who need to beat first-place La 
Quinta (12-0 in league) Tuesday at La Quinta and then Santiago on Thursday. If 
they succeed, they still need La Quinta to lose its final game against Kennedy 
for an outright title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to beat (La Quinta)," Pyle said. "We have nothing to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros started slowly in their victory over Kennedy (15-9, 8-4), leading 
27-26 at halftime. But behind the play of Akilah Rodgers and Sally Vasquez, 
Rancho Alamitos (17-6, 11-1) went on a 14-2 run in the third quarter, giving 
the Vaqueros a 45-31 lead. Rodgers finished the game with 17 points, 19 
rebounds and six blocked shots. Vasquez added 16 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Karin Kitagawa led Kennedy with 19 points and Erryn Gutjahr had 11. MELANIE

SEA VIEW LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; WOODBRIDGE CLINCHES SHARE OF TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two unbeaten girls' basketball teams in Orange County -- Brea-Olinda 
and the team that plays in its shadow: Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors won for the 23rd time this season, clinched a share of their 
ninth league title in 10 years, and virtually assured themselves of the No. 1 
seeding when the Southern Section Division II-AA playoffs are announced Feb. 
14, barring an upset next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Woodbridge did so by scoring a 59-52 Sea View League victory 
over eighth-ranked Newport Harbor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The host Warriors (23-0, 12-0) shot 56% from the field, offsetting 23 
turnovers. They got 15 points and 19 rebounds from Angela Burgess, and 25 
points and five steals from Jamie Oenning. They also got a close game for the 
first time in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we hung tough and showed the poise we need to be a champion," 
Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said. "We needed a game like this. We had been 
breezing, but this is the kind of game we'll see down the road. For a young 
team, we kept our poise." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the only senior starter, Oenning, who clearly stepped up. She was 
10 of 17 from the field and scored 11 of Woodbridge's 16 fourth-quarter points 
as the Warriors nursed a five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this team," Oenning said. "(We) refuse to lose. When the chips are 
down, the calls aren't going our way and the crowd is into it, we're going to 
be right there, coming at you." 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Newport Harbor led, 11-4. At 18-18, Oenning scored six consecutive points 
and the Warriors held a 26-20 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Newport Harbor (17-6, 10-2) pulled to 26-24 on a basket by Genevieve Evarts 
(23 points), but sophomore Melanie Pearson scored twice in the paint and 
Oenning's layup followed sophomore Tami Weaver's steal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At 50-47 with 3:46 left, Oenning found Burgess under the basket, and then 
Oenning added a 15-footer before burying four consecutive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Oenning addressed playing in Brea-Olinda's shadow: "They're proven 
-- they've done it in Orange County and out. That's the next step we need to 
take. We need to extend our boundaries outside of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Playoffs begin Feb. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 55, Corona del Mar 42 -- Sarah Davis had 11 points, 21 rebounds and six 
assists for visiting Tustin (16-8, 8-4). Lindsay Warmington scored 17 for 
Corona del Mar (9-11, 4-8). 
</P>
<P>
 University 59, Saddleback 36 -- Jennifer Stanley had 28 points and nine 
rebounds to lead University (12-8, 6-6). Nicole Wiora scored 10 for Saddleback 
(4-16, 0-12). 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita 47, Irvine 44 -- Shannon Noonan scored 22 points and Kelley 
Moohr added 13 to lead Santa Margarita (6-14, 4-8). Shawnee Stevens scored 15 
points for Irvine (10-11, 4-8).

KEEPING BURE QUIET KEY TO DUCK VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mighty Duck Coach Ron Wilson was too busy ripping Vancouver Canuck bumper 
stickers off his car to formulate a brilliant plan for Friday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal. If Wilson didn't know what to expect, he and the Ducks were in 
serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the word out wasn't difficult, either. Wilson, a Vancouver assistant 
for three seasons, had former Canuck forward Garry Valk around in case any of 
the Ducks needed reminding. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line was this: Slow Pavel Bure and the Ducks had a chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they picked up Bure beyond the red line, forced him wide, toward the 
boards and away from the center of the ice where he could inflict the most 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked without a hitch and the Ducks shut out Vancouver, 3-0, at Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Bure, who had 35 points in his last 25 games and 17 goals in 18 games, was 
held to one harmless shot on goal. There were no heart-stopping rushes from 
Bure. No blistering slap shots at Duck goalie Guy Hebert. Hardly a peep, in 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Pavel was out there, I wanted Garry with him because he's so familiar 
with him," said Wilson, whose car was plastered Friday with bumper stickers by 
members of the Vancouver coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did have enough time to put together a Bure highlight film in order to 
remind the rest of the Ducks of the right wing's scoring ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to pay special attention to his one-on-one moves," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Ducks took Bure out of the picture. It was often difficult to 
notice Bure when he was on the ice. His one and only shot came in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the Ducks led, 2-0, and had crawled into a defensive shell. 
</P>
<P>
 They added a third-period goal by Valk's linemate, Bob Corkum, with less than 
4 minutes left in the game and held Vancouver to three final-period shots on 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 And all the while, they kept a watchful eye on Bure, knowing he could break 
free at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely their biggest offensive spark," said Valk, who assisted on 
Corkum's goal. "He's the guy they go to in clutch situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. When Bure isn't effective, the Canucks struggle. They went 3-5 when 
Bure was sidelined for eight games with a groin injury from Oct. 27 to Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before suffering the injury, Bure recorded his 100th NHL goal in 
only his 154th game, becoming the sixth-fastest player in league history to 
score 100. He trailed Mike Bossy (129), Teemu Selanne (130), Maurice Richard 
(134), Joe Nieuwendyk (144) and Wayne Gretzky (145). 
</P>
<P>
 In three previous games against the Ducks, Bure had made his usual impact, 
scoring two goals and firing off 14 shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not going to give him the puck with open ice," Valk said. "We had to 
keep him to the outside of the ice. We were able to slow him down by doing 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson sensed Vancouver's frustration with the Ducks' defensive style late in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like they said, 'Why don't you guys stop and let us play hockey for 
five minutes,' " Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take a genius to know that would have been a bad move for the Ducks.

FED HIKES INTEREST RATE; STOCKS SLIDE; ECONOMY: CENTRAL BANK BOOSTS FEDERAL 
FUNDS CEILING FROM 3% TO 3.25%. ANTI-INFLATION MEASURE JOLTS WALL STREET, BUT 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SIGNAL SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, concerned that the economic recovery may fuel 
inflation, raised a key interest rate Friday for the first time in nearly five 
years, signaling an end to an era of declining loan costs and sending a shiver 
through Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank's action in raising the benchmark interest rate for federal 
funds from 3% to 3.25% sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling by nearly 
100 points. By the end of the day at least one bank had reacted by raising its 
prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, however, generally supported the maneuver by 
the Federal Reserve, whose actions are independent of government control. The 
federal funds rate is the interest banks pay on overnight loans to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is unlikely to exert much pressure on interest rates paid by 
consumers, at least in the short run, economists said. And if the Federal 
Reserve succeeds in holding down inflation, longer-term interest rates paid by 
consumers for home mortgages, auto loans and other borrowing also will rise 
only slightly, some economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increase is still a shot across the economic bow: Nearly five years 
after the Federal Reserve began lowering rates to combat recessionary trends, 
the central bank believes that the recovery is solid enough that it can return 
its attention to preventing inflation by raising the cost of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increase spawned forecasts of more rises to come. Economist Lawrence 
Kudlow of Bear, Stearns Inc. predicted that the Clinton Administration is in 
for "a much bumpier economic ride than they think." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor, said that the central bank 
most likely will undertake "a series of tightening moves to raise interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking a gradual course," he said. "This is the beginning. We will 
have to look forward to increases every six to eight weeks in short-term 
interest rates until the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a course, Gramley said, would "avoid inflation and in the process ensure 
a longer recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, made it clear 
in testimony to Congress on Monday that rates would be raised, the bank 
surprised officials with its method of disclosing the increase. Rather than 
simply adjusting the rate, as is customary, the bank issued a formal statement 
explaining its intention to use tighter money to fight inflation and keep the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetary 
policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion," the Fed said in 
a written statement disclosing the plans of the Federal Open Markets Committee, 
the bank's key rate-setting panel, which had cast a 10-0 vote in favor of the 
higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement continued: 
</P>
<P>
 "Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid 
any misunderstanding of the committee's purposes, given the fact that this is 
the first firming of reserve market conditions by the committee since early 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan and others have expressed concern that the strengthening national 
economic recovery -- which is far from evident in Southern California -- would 
lead the nation into a new round of inflation. Because inflation is more 
difficult to turn around once it has set in, they have said, an effective 
preemptive strike would be to limit the money supply by making borrowing more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation in 1993 was 2.7%, the lowest rate since 1965, with the exception of 
a 1.3% rate in 1986, but such a low rate is not expected to hold. Another 
measure of economic health, the 30-year mortgage rate average, has begun to 
creep up, from a 25-year low of 6.74% in October, to the current average rate 
of 6.97%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration expressed support for a rate increase earlier in 
the week. President Clinton signaled Monday that he had no objection to a small 
increase in short-term rates, as long as the longer-term rates, which have a 
more direct effect on consumers, could be held down. And on Friday, the 
Administration said that it had included slightly higher interest rates as a 
factor in preparing its economic forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still think the economy will grow at 3% this year," Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said Friday. "Inflation appears to be well-contained at the 
present time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Reserve is an independent central bank, and we respect its 
independence," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers, 
said that the move is "consistent with the continuation of a solid and 
sustained economic expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, Bentsen, and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich were dispatched to the 
White House press briefing room to publicize the Administration's cautionary 
message that the rise in the short-term interest rate and new unemployment 
figures should not be read as signs of looming economic turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the financial markets greeted the announcement with a selling 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials 
fell 96.24, or 2.43%, to 3,871.42. It was the greatest point loss since Nov. 
15, 1991, when the industrial average fell 120.31 points. Declining issues 
outnumbered advances by nearly 7 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with just 
314 up, 2,037 down and 402 unchanged. Bond prices fell as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Harris Trust & Savings Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of 
Montreal, raised its prime lending rate to 5.75%, from 5.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 While decisions made by the Federal Reserve can have a direct impact on some 
loans, the greatest effects ripple through the economy indirectly, with 
commercial banks following the central bank's lead and money managers reading 
the tea leaves of the central bank's actions and reacting accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers feel the impact in rates they pay for borrowing on auto loans, 
mortgages and other long-term purchases as well as on such short-term debt as 
credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Friday's decision stalls inflation before it occurs is a matter of 
debate among economists. 
</P>
<P>
 It may turn out to be counterproductive because fears of higher rates to come 
could spur consumers to make big purchases, further fueling an economy that the 
rate increase is meant to cool, Kudlow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will create expectations that interest rates have bottomed out and 
future rates will be higher," he said. "Therefore consumers and businesses will 
accelerate purchasing decisions to beat higher future costs." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said such a reaction would most likely last no more than three to six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed last raised the federal funds rate on Feb. 23, 1989, pushing it up to 
9.75%. In repeated attempts to stimulate the economy, the bank then cut the 
rate 23 consecutive times, eventually bringing it down to 3%, the lowest figure 
in three decades, on Sept. 4, 1992. A Turning Point

<P>
 Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, uses interest rate increases as a 
tool to keep inflation pressures in check. While inflation is low now, recent 
signs of economic strength have raised fears that inflation could accelerate. 
Higher rates tend to cool inflation pressures by making it more expensive for 
individuals and businesses to borrow money. The stock market plunged in 
reaction to the Fed's decision. While many strategists don't consider the stock 
rally over, the sharp reaction could mean investors are in for an unpredictable 
ride after a three-year bull run.

RELOCATION IS BAD NEWS FOR SOME, GOOD FOR OTHERS; RECOVERY: QUAKE VOUCHERS CAN 
MEAN BETTER HOUSING. BUT VACANCIES MAY DRY UP AS THEY FLOOD THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As thousands of displaced earthquake victims move on to the second phase of 
recovery -- resettling in new apartments or rental homes -- they are finding a 
shifting, uncertain housing market and the windfalls and frustrations of a 
flood of government largess. 
</P>
<P>
 On the front lines of the unparalleled rehousing effort, federal and local 
authorities take pride in the roughly $100 million in emergency housing cash 
grants and vouchers they have distributed in less than three weeks to about 
30,000 quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outpouring of emergency rent monies, coupled with a huge, 
unprecedented distribution of low-income housing vouchers, is sweeping lives 
and market forces in unpredictable directions, interviews with quake victims, 
landlords and relief workers show. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims say they are having a difficult time finding new housing in their 
old neighborhoods and are settling for less attractive units elsewhere. "Places 
have been filling up," said Cal State Northridge sophomore Dionne Barnes, 19, 
who made about 50 calls for apartments listed in newspaper classified ads 
before finding a suitable vacancy and a landlord willing to accept a federal 
housing voucher. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, who lived across the street from the campus before the quake, ended up 
about five miles east in an apartment in Panorama City. "It was my last choice 
of city, but it's a beautiful complex," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other victims say that hunting down new housing has been a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Olguin, 37, whose east Hollywood apartment was rendered unlivable when 
the foundation snapped, said his main priority was finding another unit in the 
same neighborhood so his two children would not have to switch schools. "I 
found one half a block from the school. You can't beat that. I consider myself 
very lucky," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some say that the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department's 
18-month low-income subsidy program -- never before made immediately available 
to disaster victims -- has improved their conditions and financial standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Olguin has gone from a $500-a-month unit to a $750 one. But because he is 
disabled and his wife earns relatively small wages as a housecleaner, his 
family's share of the monthly rent for the next 18 months will be $220 with his 
HUD subsidy. Olguin said he plans to hold on to the $280 that he saves each 
month to put toward the higher rent when the subsidy expires next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I see it, the earthquake turned from negative to positive," said the 
longtime Los Angeles resident, adding that he has been surprised at the 
government's generous response. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cases are even more striking. 
</P>
<P>
 A middle-aged woman who had moved here from San Francisco six weeks before the 
earthquake said she was certified for a HUD voucher because the $75-a-week 
Hollywood Boulevard hotel she had been living in was declared unsafe. The 
woman, an office temporary worker who declined to disclose her name, said she 
had located a $570-a-month, one-room apartment in Marina del Rey which -- when 
her HUD subsidy is factored in -- will cost her $120 a month for the next 18 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest break I've had in a long time," said the woman as she 
waited in line with her completed paperwork at the earthquake disaster 
assistance center in Hollywood. "It's almost too good to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they do say this is the land of opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The new dynamics of the marketplace are being driven by the large number of 
damaged units, and the influx of money from two major programs. The Federal 
Emergency Management Agency is providing cash grants, averaging about $3,100, 
to renters and homeowners whose homes were severely damaged. There are no 
income guidelines for these grants and recipients are free to spend the money 
wherever they can find housing or to repair their residences. About 29,000 
grants have been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The new 18-month HUD program is reserved for those with low incomes, and can 
pay up to 90% or more of the rent. Recipients pay 30% of their income and the 
government pays the rest. The subsidies may only be used at rentals that meet 
stringent inspection standards and where landlords agree to a host of program 
requirements. About 550 of those rental agreements had been finalized as of 
Friday afternoon and thousands more are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, especially in the San Fernando Valley, vacancy rates were 
relatively high before the quake and many apartment owners are eager to get 
tenants, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 But quake victims also could find increasing competition for available, 
desirable units in some areas, as well as rising rents, they add. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are some places in the Valley with zero vacancies," said Joe 
Shuldiner, assistant secretary of HUD. And, he said, some people in 
rent-controlled Santa Monica "may have to look elsewhere" because of a tight 
rental market and thousands of lost units. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are pockets of neighborhoods with very low vacancy rates where it will 
be difficult, but overall people should be able to find something in the L.A. 
area," Shuldiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 21,800 dwelling units, the overwhelming majority of them apartments, 
have been vacated in the city of Los Angeles as a result of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an extraordinary blip to have 20,000 people looking for housing" at the 
same time, said Barbara Zeidman, assistant general manager of the city's 
Housing Preservation and Production Department. "What is not at all clear to us 
is the match between available units, in terms of rent level and size, and 
those lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Also unclear, authorities and apartment industry sources said, is how many 
apartment owners will accept the special 18-month HUD vouchers being issued to 
more than 12,000 low-income quake victims.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's the unknown," Shuldiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Hagar, manager of member services for the Apartment Owners Assn. of 
Greater Los Angeles, said landlords are weighing the benefits and risks of the 
vouchers. "(They) will (decide) if they want to go through the (government) and 
be in business with them," he said. "In a sense it's positive: You can get the 
rent guaranteed for 18 months. But the negative is that you're dealing with 
another bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Some landlords said they are leery of the 18-month vouchers. "I have to know 
they have the income to pay after 18 months," said one apartment owner who has 
been inundated with inquiries about her units in the Pico-Fairfax area. "If 
they can't afford the rent, I'll have a hard time getting them out (later). 
</P>
<P>
 "And how can I all of a sudden ask them for last month's rent, when they don't 
have it? It's kind of putting us in a difficult position." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding housing with landlords willing to accept the unusual vouchers may 
prove more difficult in some areas of the city than others, officials said. 
Some fear a crunch could come in areas such as heavily damaged Hollywood, where 
older, still-intact, but somewhat run-down apartment buildings may not meet 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be hard, even with a certificate in hand, to find (eligible) housing," 
said Gary Squier, a top city housing official. 
</P>
<P>
 At least for now, fieldworkers say problems have not been significant. 
Earthquake victims seem to be "finding places down the street or a couple 
blocks away" from their damaged apartments, said city housing inspector Hubert 
Taylor, who has been working out of the Hollywood disaster assistance center. 
"People are being displaced by blocks rather than miles." 
</P>
<P>
 But a bigger squeeze is expected in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than 12,200 low-income victims have qualified for HUD's housing 
subsidy, only about 10% of them have located new apartments so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the voucher holders can resettle, personal inspections of the new units 
must be conducted by government housing inspectors to ensure that the units are 
in good shape. Contracts must then be signed between landlords and city housing 
authorities, who are administering the program for HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottleneck, if one develops, will be because of the number of 
inspections," said Marshall Kandell, spokesman for the Los Angeles City Housing 
Authority, which is administering the bulk of the low-income housing vouchers. 
"Some of it, you can only expedite to a certain extent. (But) you still have to 
sit down and do the deal with the landlord and do the paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the onslaught of paperwork, inspectors are working up to 12 hours 
a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional inspectors on loan from local government housing authorities from 
Calexico to Alameda County have also been pressed into service. Officials hope 
the increased staffing can handle the inspection and negotiation load, and that 
quake victims will return requesting rental contracts at a fairly even, steady 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, officials have been able to complete most of the inspection work 
within several days of a quake victim locating a unit and returning the initial 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 91-unit Hayvenhurst Family Apartments in Van Nuys, manager Hector 
Rodriguez on Friday was preparing his first four units for inspection under the 
quake voucher program. Having experienced minor damage in many units and losing 
a number of tenants after the quake -- his vacancy rate soared from 11% to 29% 
-- Rodriguez was glad to see the process moving quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I haven't seen any problems," he said. "But it's still a little 
early."  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the FEMA housing assistance, no on-site inspections of new 
housing are made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly encourage people to find as suitable a residence as they can 
with the funds we provide," said FEMA spokesman Brett Hansard. "There's (also) 
homes that might still be habitable, so the (owners) can use the funds to make 
their homes safe, sanitary or secure."  
</P>
<P>
 In previous disasters, FEMA emergency housing checks were distributed only 
after an inspector had verified that an applicant's home had been heavily 
damaged or destroyed. But bottlenecks arose, particularly after Hurricane 
Andrew in 1992 when thousands in South Florida were left homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 To prevent such hitches after the Northridge quake, FEMA decided to release 
housing checks to some victims even before the inspection process was 
completed, using city housing charts and maps that suggested areas of greatest 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 So thorough was the effort that some residents unexpectedly received checks 
they had not asked for. FEMA on Thursday said it was phasing out that "fast 
track" program and hoped to have 1,500 inspectors in the field next week to 
keep the aid flowing.

 Many housing assistance programs are available to quake victims. Applications 
can be made over the phone or in person at one of 20 disaster application 
centers in the Los Angeles area. To begin the process, individuals can call 
(800) 462-9029, 24 hours a day to register. FEMA has also set up a help line 
for information on submitted applications or for general information, (800) 
525-0321, open 6 a.m. to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the housing aid programs: 
</P>
<P>
 * FEMA Disaster Housing Assistance Program 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency grant to provide immediate, temporary aid for housing-related costs, 
regardless of income, for up to 18 months. Assists people who are unable to 
live in their homes.  
</P>
<P>
 * FEMA Disaster Mortgage and Rental Assistance Program 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency grant designed to address longer-term problems. Covers mortgage or 
rental payments for up to 18 months, regardless of income. Helps people who, as 
a result of the disaster, have lost their job or business or face foreclosure 
or eviction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small Business Administration Disaster Loans 
</P>
<P>
 Low-interest loans for up to 30 years for individuals who lost their homes or 
sustained damages up to $200,000; personal property losses up to $40,000 for 
homeowners and renters. Loan amounts are based on the type and extent of 
disaster-related losses not covered by insurance. Eligibility is based on 
ability to repay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Department of Housing and Urban Development Housing Assistance 
</P>
<P>
 Housing subsidies, rental assistance provided for up to 18 months. HUD has 
made available Section 8 housing subsidies for low-income individuals whose 
residences have been deemed unsafe. This program is specifically for quake 
victims, administered through local agencies and is separate from the standard 
Section 8 housing program offered through HUD. Housing must be located by the 
applicant and must meet HUD guidelines. Agencies do not have designated units 
for this program. Applicants must have certification from FEMA that they are 
displaced by the quake and must meet income requirements of $16,900 for one 
person to $31,900 for a family of eight or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles City/HUD Assistance 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency low-interest loans to displaced tenants and residential property 
owners, authorized by the City Council from federal housing funds. Tenants who 
apply for help at FEMA assistance centers may be given $500 vouchers 
immediately and up to $2,000 for first and last months' rent and security 
deposits. These must be repaid. Housing rehabilitation loans, normally 
available only to low- and moderate-income owners, are available regardless of 
income as long as the total encumbrances on the property, including the new 
loan, do not exceed the appraised value. Administered through the Los Angeles 
City Housing Department. HUD has expedited delivery of the funds for 
disaster-related uses. 
</P>
<P>
 * California Department of Housing and Community Development, Natural Disaster 
Assistance Program 
</P>
<P>
 Low-interest, deferred payment loans for homeowners and rental property 
owners, up to $50,000. Provided for repair or reconstruction of real property 
damaged or destroyed. Applicants must first exhaust insurance and all other 
state and federal disaster assistance in order to qualify.

DOW'S 96-POINT PLUNGE RAISES SELLOFF FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investors reacted with surprising dismay to the Federal Reserve's 
interest-rate increase on Friday, dumping stocks and bonds in a flurry of 
anxious trading that led to the biggest decline in the Dow Jones industrial 
average in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The widely watched Dow average plummeted 96.24 points to close at 3,871.42, 
the eighth-biggest one-day point loss ever. Declining stocks outnumbered 
advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange by nearly a 7-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts expressed fear that the Fed's move will dramatically depress 
what has been an upbeat mood among investors, possibly leading to further 
selloffs. Others, however, suggested that stocks -- which have risen to record 
heights in recent days -- were ripe for a temporary pullback, and that demand 
for stocks will resume as long as interest rates don't rise much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Wall Street analysts were stunned by the selloff, because the Fed 
has virtually been telegraphing the inevitability of a rate increase for 
months. It was believed that most investors had expected a small boost in the 
cost of credit as a natural side effect of a growing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, sellers took early control of the stock market Friday, and relatively 
few buyers materialized as prices slid. The Dow, down 50 points near midday, 
continued to drop steadily all afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 By the market close, experts were looking warily toward Monday's trading, 
wondering how the huge wave of novice investors who purchased stocks and stock 
mutual funds in 1992 and 1993 will respond to Friday's tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is likely to dent confidence a bit," warned Alan Ackerman, analyst at 
the investment firm of Reich & Co. in New York. "I think this is going to cause 
investors to want to take some chips off the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts, however, noted that the market appeared ripe for a pullback 
even before the Fed move, given stocks' surge in January. Indeed, the Dow had 
rocketed 6% in January, or 224 points, and reached a record high of 3,978.36 on 
Monday amid burgeoning optimism about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, stocks may have been victimized by their own recent success, 
experts said, as the urge to jump into the market in January quickly became an 
urge to exit on Friday with a fast profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market was ahead of itself," said Allen Sinai, economist at the Boston 
Co. in Boston. The Fed's rate hike "was just an excuse for a correction (in 
stock prices), for a market that was looking for any excuse to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentally, Sinai and others said, the Fed's rate hike should have 
comparatively little effect on the economy's advance or on rising corporate 
earnings, which have underpinned the latest phase of the three-year-old bull 
market's advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Fed officials painted this slight tightening of credit as a move aimed 
at prolonging the current economic expansion -- and, by proxy, the bull market. 
By ensuring that business activity doesn't overheat, the Fed hopes to dampen 
inflationary pressures that could ultimately be a far bigger concern for stock 
and bond investors than a small rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of nascent inflation have been apparent recently in rising prices of key 
commodities, including gold, silver, lumber and sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some investors may fear that the Fed is acting too quickly to curb 
brisk economic growth, a preemptive strike "is better than the old game of 
fighting inflation once it starts," Sinai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, analysts admit that this first official interest-rate hike since 
1989, however logical, may not play that way with investors in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear is that the Fed's move will dramatically change the psychology on 
Wall Street, where for the last three years investors have been conditioned to 
believe that interest rates only went in one direction: down. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economy sputtered in 1992 and 1993, the decline in short-term rates to 
their lowest level in 30 years encouraged millions of Americans to pull money 
from bank savings accounts and invest it in stocks and bonds, in search of 
higher returns. And stocks generally have increased steadily during the last 
two years, with few major selloffs; Friday's fall was the biggest for the Dow 
average since it dropped 120 points on Nov. 15, 1991, when disappointment over 
biotechnology stocks triggered a broader decline. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Fed's rate boost on Friday, short-term Treasury bill yields rose to 
3.28% from 3.0% a week ago. Most economists believe that short-term rates now 
are likely to hold at current levels, because the Fed isn't expected to make 
another move unless it sees new signs that the economy is picking up 
substantial steam. 
</P>
<P>
 For the stock market, however, the worry is that many small investors will 
curtail their stock and bond investing and instead begin to favor money-market 
accounts and other short-term investments again, expecting further Fed rate 
hikes to boost money-market returns as the year wears on. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the bull market has depended so heavily on individuals' dollars in 
recent years, especially via mutual funds, any drop-off in investment -- or a 
rise in redemptions of fund shares by nervous investors -- could lead to a 
sharp decline in stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of how this plays out will depend on how the individual investor 
reacts," concedes Jay Mueller, manager of the Strong Investment mutual fund in 
Milwaukee. "It all comes down to market psychology: Are we at an inflection 
point?" 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bullish analysts scoff at the idea that most investors will see 
disaster in Friday's rate rise or in the Dow's big drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, with the economy booming and short-term interest rates still 
historically low, many Wall Streeters suggest that investors will respond the 
way they have continually in recent years: by buying on any slump in stock 
prices. That strategy has worked every time since the 1987 market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the public has been conditioned to buy on dips, and that goes for 
professionals too," noted Ralph Wanger, who heads the $4-billion Acorn Funds 
investment company in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, major mutual fund companies reported relatively little activity 
from small investors, indicating that most of the day's selling was the work of 
professionals and speculators, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fund companies said they were preparing for a deluge of calls over the 
weekend to their toll-free information lines, as many Americans discuss the Fed 
rate increase and the market's plunge, and decide whether to act on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether more individuals will be buyers, or sellers, come Monday is the 
question likely to keep Wall Street pros awake for the next 48 hours. "The 
worrywarts will be working overtime this weekend," said analyst Ackerman.

U.N. VOTE CUTS SIZE, POWERS OF PEACEKEEPERS IN SOMALIA; AFRICA: U.S. TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL INFLUENCES DECISION. REMAINING FORCE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO DISARM 
WARLORDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Left little choice by the impending withdrawal of U.S. troops and the exodus 
of others, the Security Council voted unanimously Friday to scale down the U.N. 
peacekeeping operation in Somalia in both size and powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorized strength of the mission was cut down from a maximum of 29,000 
to a maximum of 22,000, and, even more important, the peacekeepers were shorn 
of their authority to disarm the Somali warlords and factions by force. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this authority that led to the disastrous hunt for Gen. Mohammed Farah 
Aidid that ended with the deaths of 18 American soldiers Oct. 3. The public 
furor in the United States over the deaths and the desecration of one of the 
dead Americans in the streets of Mogadishu persuaded President Clinton to order 
all American forces to leave by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, who helped draft the resolution, told the 
other ambassadors that it "states clearly what many of us have been saying for 
months: The people of Somalia must bear the responsibility for national 
reconciliation and the reconstruction of their country." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Somalis wish to take advantage of the interest in the international 
community to assist in Somalia's rehabilitation," she went on, "then they 
should rigorously and genuinely pursue all opportunities to resolve their 
differences peacefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Albright also insisted that relief efforts would now depend on Somali efforts 
to maintain security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somalis cannot expect assistance to continue where relief workers and 
logistic facilities are attacked and relief supplies are looted," she said. 
"The United Nations forces will do their part to protect this humanitarian 
effort, but it is up to the Somalis to assure enough security for humanitarian 
assistance to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 British Ambassador to the United Nations David Hannay, deriding those who 
looked on the operation in Somalia as a U.N. defeat, described the resolution 
as an attempt "to seek to consolidate the achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the sweeping language of past resolutions about enforcing security 
and disarmament in Somalia, the latest resolution authorizes the U.N. 
peacekeepers to do no more than assist Somalis "in their cooperative efforts to 
achieve disarmament." 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeepers are also assigned the duty of protecting relief workers and 
U.N. officials and of guarding ports, airports and roads that are part of the 
system for distributing humanitarian relief. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main, the Security Council resolution follows the recommendation of 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary general, infuriated by the American withdrawal but frustrated by 
the paucity of responses to his appeals for more troops from other countries, 
had asked for a force of 16,000. But the ambassadors on the council, hopeful 
that he could do better, raised that figure by 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the new force will largely be a Third World operation with 
limited firepower and armor, dominated by the troops of countries such as 
India, Pakistan and Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-January, the dwindling U.N. contingent numbered 25,500 troops, with an 
additional 8,000 American troops, both offshore and on land, outside the U.N. 
command. 
</P>
<P>
 European governments had been considering a withdrawal even before the October 
tragedy. The American decision to go melted any lingering European resolve 
about staying, and practically none of the Europeans will be left by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council resolution raises a fear that is haunting U.N. officials: 
a reversion to the banditry and factional killing that created the starvation 
and malnutrition that first prompted President George Bush to dispatch Marines 
to Somalia in December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution expressed "serious concern at reports that Somali factions are 
rearming and that a troop buildup is taking place in some regions of Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Security Council gave the peacekeepers no authority to deal with this. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council, using a kind of carrot-but-no-stick approach, promised 
that funds and supplies for reconstructions will go first to those Somali 
regions "where security is being re-established."

FRAUD BY COUNTY QUAKE AID WORKERS PROBED; FOOD STAMPS: AT LEAST 19 ARE UNDER 
INVESTIGATION BY TASK FORCE ON CHARGES THAT THEY FILED FALSE APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal authorities are investigating allegations of food stamp fraud among 
Los Angeles County welfare workers who process applications for 
earthquake-related benefits, with at least 19 employees already under scrutiny 
for possible criminal prosecution or administrative discipline by the county, 
The Times has learned.  
</P>
<P>
 Several anonymous tips to a federal abuse hot line have alleged that a 
substantial number of county Department of Public Social Services employees -- 
including case workers -- have filed fraudulent food stamp applications in 
their names or those of relatives, or have helped others obtain food stamps 
illegally, federal authorities said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities said it was too early to know exactly how many employees 
may have been involved, they said the allegations deal with four welfare 
offices, including a large processing center set up at Dodger Stadium. A large 
number of employees allegedly participated, and some individuals are named. 
</P>
<P>
 If all the allegations are substantiated, federal officials said, the number 
of implicated employees could reach into the hundreds, but they cautioned that 
they were only beginning the investigation and had no evidence of such 
widespread abuse. More than 1,600 county employees have been assigned to the 
emergency food stamp program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about a very serious crime," said David F. Dickson, regional 
inspector general for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who leads 
investigations of food stamp fraud. "You cannot allow your own employees to 
steal from the program or it undermines public confidence. If there are 
allegations that people in the program are ripping off the system, it sends the 
message to the street: Why shouldn't we rip it off too?" 
</P>
<P>
 County officials declined to comment on the possible scope of the 
investigation. But they said they had cleared 22 of the 41 employees referred 
to them by federal authorities, who said they were tipped off by the hot-line 
calls and a county employee. Tony Vargas, chief of the fraud division of the 
county Department of Public Social Services, said the 22 cleared employees had 
applied for emergency food vouchers but simply did not meet income eligibility 
requirements, and had not filed fraudulent information on their applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The others we are looking at and opening an investigation," Vargas said. "It 
is a very sensitive situation. . . . At this point we know very little." 
</P>
<P>
 A special team of federal auditors arrived in Los Angeles on Friday to help 
the county department review applications that may have been filed fraudulently 
by the employees, Dickson said. The auditors will help make computer 
cross-checks of addresses, Social Security numbers and other information that 
might point to multiple or fictitious filings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Internal fraud is a No. 1 priority any time you are dealing with it," said 
Dickson, who expects to receive more tips on the (800) 424-9121 hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, people got the idea that the government was going to allow 
people to come in and scam this program." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations against county workers are the latest blow to the emergency 
food stamp program. The program was overwhelmed with applications -- many 
believed to be fraudulent -- after officials lifted standard screening 
procedures to help accelerate the distribution of benefits shortly after the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the procedures have since been reimposed, but the flow of applications 
continues: As of Thursday, 173,165 applications had been received for emergency 
food stamps, with $42.1 million in food vouchers distributed. In the last week, 
authorities have arrested at least 15 people on charges of buying and reselling 
food stamps on the street. Three of those arrested were sentenced Friday to 
90-day jail terms after pleading no contest to illegally dealing in food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal statistics released Friday show the enormity of temptation for fraud 
in the multimillion-dollar quake relief effort. Nearly $818.5 million in 
assistance has been allocated since the Jan. 17 temblor, or an average of $51.2 
million a day. By comparison, the average daily allocation for previous 
national disasters was $2 million over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to clamp down on fraud and corruption in the relief effort, 
federal authorities said Friday that they have formed a task force that will 
monitor all agencies providing assistance to quake victims and aggressively 
pursue cheaters. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, eight federal agencies have joined the task force, and they will 
combine criminal investigators and other resources. A special team of federal 
prosecutors will decide if the U.S. attorney's office or state or county 
prosecutors should handle specific cases, said Assistant U.S. Atty. George B. 
Newhouse Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse said the task force is made up of officials from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, the FBI, the Postal Service, the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Agriculture, the Small 
Business Administration, the Army's Criminal Investigation Division and the 
U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "With any government program designed to assist the needy, there are those 
individuals, driven by greed, who rush in to take advantage of benefits 
intended for the truly needy," U.S. Atty. Nora Manella said in a statement. "We 
intend, by forming this task force, to aggressively prosecute those who seek to 
profit from relief efforts, and thus stem the flow of fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the county welfare caseworkers, Newhouse said some workers have 
been accused of filing false claims in their names as well as those of 
relatives. He would not comment on the cases because of the ongoing 
investigation, but said he expected criminal prosecutions, either by his office 
or the Los Angeles County district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are most interested in people who are doing this on a repeated basis," 
Newhouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, fraudulent claims of more than $400 are a felony and could 
bring a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Fraud less 
than $400 carries a penalty of up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. If 
cases are prosecuted under federal law, the penalties are as great as five 
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

MAGNITUDE OF QUAKE MAY BE RAISED TO 6.8 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo., expects to 
upgrade the magnitude of the Northridge earthquake next week from 6.6, probably 
to 6.8, based on higher readings from European seismographic stations, a 
spokesman for the center said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 This would indicate that the deadly earthquake may have been about 1 1/2 times 
stronger than scientists first thought, said Jim Mori, who is in charge of the 
Pasadena field station of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnitude figures often change as more distant stations report, said 
geophysicist John Minsch, duty officer at the national center, which is 
operated by the Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 He said magnitudes represent an average of all authorized readings worldwide, 
and a European measurement has as much validity as a local measurement. 
</P>
<P>
 Minsch said a Caltech report that at least one station, in Sweden, has put the 
quake's magnitude as high as 7.2 coincided with information the center had 
received. Mori, however, said that 7.2 is unreasonably high. 
</P>
<P>
 Different stations often get different readings depending on how earthquake 
waves travel from the epicenter to the station. Sometimes, the final averaging 
is not made for weeks or months. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how distant a seismographic station is, it reads the waves by the 
same method. Tiny earthquakes are not detectable at great distances, but all 
sizable quakes trigger the movement of seismographic needles, just as they do 
at facilities close to the epicenter.  
</P>
<P>
 Mori said an earthquake radiates energy preferentially in certain directions. 
Because scientists get different readings in different directions, it is 
important to take a global average. 
</P>
<P>
 Because violent shaking locally can push a needle completely off the 
seismographic scale -- as happened at Caltech with one of its instruments on 
the morning of Jan. 17 -- scientists may need more distant readings to help 
them reach as accurate a magnitude figure as possible, Mori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of an impending higher magnitude began to circulate after release of a 
preliminary report on the Northridge earthquake by a team of UC Berkeley 
scientists who contended that the quake was stronger, possibly longer in 
duration and on a different fault than had been initially concluded by 
scientists from Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Romanowicz, director of the UC Berkeley Seismographic Laboratory, said 
its instruments measured the magnitude at 6.7, rather than the Caltech and 
Geological Survey figure of 6.6. The new report also said the initial shaking 
lasted 25 to 30 seconds, somewhat longer than reported by others. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary difference between the Berkeley team and the others is that the 
Berkeley group continues to hold that the earthquake occurred on an easterly 
extension of the Oak Ridge Fault system, a belief Caltech scientists espoused 
and then abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent Caltech and Geological Survey statements have suggested that the 
Northridge earthquake was on an unnamed fault related to the Elysian Park 
thrust fault system that sweeps from the San Gabriel Valley through Downtown 
Los Angeles, the Hollywood Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 But Egill Hauksson of Caltech said Friday that it is "still a matter of 
research how this particular fault (that caused the Northridge earthquake) 
relates to other faults. Not enough is known at this time to reach a firm 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Romanowicz said: "I would agree with Hauksson that this is still to be 
concluded. When we do more mapping perhaps this will be settled, but it will 
take some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Williams, a geologist at the Lawrence-Berkeley Laboratory, said the 
Berkeley scientists reject involvement of the Elysian Park Fault because it is 
on a northerly dipping plane, while the Northridge earthquake occurred on a 
southerly dipping plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Earthquake Information Center is charged with assembling all the 
data, averaging the magnitudes and determining the official numbers for all 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 A change in magnitude could also have economic aftershocks. A spokesman for 
Caltech said earlier Friday that he had heard from an insurance industry 
representative seeking information about an upgrade. The spokesman, Max 
Benavidez, said the industry representative told him that some insurance 
payouts would be affected if the magnitude was higher.

CLINTON BUDGET KILLS 115 PROGRAMS, SLASHES OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton will ask Congress on Monday to kill 115 federal programs -- 
and make sharp cuts in hundreds more -- as part of an austere 1995 budget that 
would reduce total federal spending by as much as $30 billion, Administration 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior White House officials projected that the elimination of programs would 
save more than $3 billion -- a relatively small part of the $30-billion decline 
in overall federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs the Clinton Administration hopes to eliminate are scattered 
throughout the federal government and include the Education Department's 
school-dropout prevention program, mining programs at the Interior Department, 
the Agriculture Department's export subsidies for certain crops, and major 
weapons systems such as the Air Force's F-16 fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings from the elimination of nine programs at the Pentagon would account 
for nearly half of the $3-billion reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the programs have strong constituencies in private industry and in 
Congress, where the battle over the proposed budget cuts is certain to be 
fierce this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 As is usually the case, the mix of cuts and spending reductions ultimately 
approved by Congress may be far different than the one the Administration 
proposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the programs are perennially cited as obsolete by critics of 
government spending and were targeted for elimination by the Administration's 
"reinventing government" task force last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to find programs that seemed to have lived out their usefulness," 
said one senior White House official. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet most of the targeted programs, including the F-16 -- which at $299.5 
million is the largest project slated for elimination -- have survived efforts 
by previous administrations to do away with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the last five budgets, for example, Republican and Democratic 
administrations have proposed eliminating the $5-million Clean Lakes Program at 
the Environmental Protection Agency. But Congress restored the funding for the 
program each time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has also targeted a range of public works projects, each of 
which has strong local backing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 
for example, the White House has proposed eliminating $10.3 million for 
Columbia River fish hatcheries in the Northwest, cutting $400,000 for buoys in 
Chesapeake Bay and $500,000 for a fisheries center in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Such proposals almost always run into roadblocks in the powerful 
appropriations committees in the House and Senate, where the local interests of 
key lawmakers often outweigh White House influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in Congress approaches this as Clinton's budget proposals -- a 
starting point -- and then we go from there," said Pat Collins, a spokesman for 
the House Budget Committee. "But this is going to be a year of very hard 
choices, and Congress is going to have to recognize we are going to have to 
have real cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is proposing the steep cuts to avoid repeating its mistakes 
of last year. Last spring, the White House did not take seriously congressional 
demands for deep spending cuts and proposed spending more money than Congress 
would allow under spending caps approved during the George Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, White House officials carefully scoured the entire government to 
pick and choose which programs to kill and which to save so that the budget 
would be in compliance with the terms of the five-year, $500-billion 
deficit-reduction agreement passed by Congress last August.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's goal is to reduce spending by 10% across-the-board in 
low-priority programs in order that some money would be left over to finance 
Clinton's top priorities -- such as health care reform, job training and the 
Head Start program for disadvantaged children -- and still reduce the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 When he unveils the Administration's $1.5-trillion budget Monday, Leon E. 
Panetta, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, is 
expected to say that the spending cuts will help reduce the federal budget 
deficit dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1995, the Administration expects to predict that the deficit will fall 
below $180 billion. The Congressional Budget Office has already issued a 
slightly more upbeat prediction that calls for the deficit to fall to $171 
billion next year, down $84 billion from the 1993 level of $255 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not all of the new cuts will go directly to deficit reduction, 
Administration officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House will propose cutting $30 billion from existing spending, 
it plans to increase funding for Clinton's top domestic priorities -- his 
so-called investment agenda -- by as much as $16 billion, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Job training, public health programs, education reform, children's programs 
and other initiatives will receive an average funding increase of 18% over last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the cuts actually will be absorbed by increases in other programs 
within the same agencies. Cuts totaling $640 million at the Education 
Department, for example, will help make it possible for the Administration to 
increase funding for its education reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Cabinet departments were able to keep money saved through program 
eliminations, there was less interagency bickering over the budget cuts, senior 
Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exceptions were in the area of national security, where money cut from the 
Pentagon and the State Department's foreign aid budgets would help fund 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over the Pentagon's budget was particularly fierce; then-Defense 
Secretary Les Aspin battled Panetta over how to pay for military pay raises and 
whether to increase the budget to account for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta won the war, forcing the military to scramble to find $21 billion in 
additional savings over the next five years.

COLUMN ONE; FEUD FLARES OVER 'CLUB MEDITATION'; GURU OSHO RAJNEESH SPARKS 
CONTROVERSY EVEN IN DEATH. A FIGHT HAS EMERGED OVER CONTROL OF HIS EMPIRE, 
INCLUDING A GIANT COMMUNE IN INDIA THAT CATERS TO BOTH VACATIONERS AND 
PILGRIMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twilight is falling. More than 3,000 barefoot, mostly Western and 30-something 
followers of Osho Rajneesh have padded into a lofty tent christened "Buddha 
Hall" to again hear the master's words. 
</P>
<P>
 The guru's white armchair, complete with a cushion to ease his chronic back 
pain, is reverently borne in and placed on a marble platform. A screen lowers 
to the amplified twang of a sitar. The projector lights up and purrs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten feet high, there reappears the wispy-bearded countenance of the iconoclast 
who once called himself the Baghwan (God), shocked much of the world by owning 
no fewer than 93 Rolls-Royces and lashed out at organized religion. 
(Christianity, he said, is "the deadliest poison.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The worshiper is the worshiped, you don't have to worship anyone else," 
Rajneesh proclaims from the screen, his bulging, guppy-like eyes shaded by 
aviator sunglasses. "Existence is irrational. The moment you ask why, you have 
missed the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the marble floor in their pristine white robes, the disciples 
reflect silently on the evening's sermon. As the session ends and their 
playfully smiling teacher vanishes, they rise and joyously and deafeningly 
shout "Osho!" 
</P>
<P>
 The outrageously provocative, Zen-inspired thinker -- born Mohan Chandra 
Rajneesh and dubbed the "sex guru" by a scandalized press -- seems to be 
enjoying the last laugh in death. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, with the commune his followers founded in Oregon convulsed by 
a power struggle, he was arrested on immigration fraud charges in the United 
States and expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 19, 1990, at age 58, the man known to his latter-day followers as Osho 
died here of massive coronary thrombosis, or "left the body," as disciples say. 
</P>
<P>
 Strewn with petals, Osho's corpse was carried to a riverside pyre from the 
religious teaching center, or ashram, that he founded 20 years ago in this 
inland city southeast of Bombay and incinerated that very evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to magnetic tape, inspired marketing and the spiritual hunger and 
curiosity of thousands of Westerners, the guru lives on -- though another power 
struggle may be on, this time for mastery of his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the ashram, Osho Commune International, has become, in its own words, 
"the biggest spiritual health club in the world," doubling in size in three 
years and attracting more pilgrims and enlightenment- and sun-starved holiday 
makers than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a unique place, a buddhafield," proclaims a notice at the gate, where 
guards, Osho's hirsute brother among them, verify that visitors have passed a 
mandatory AIDS test and bought a daily pass that costs about 66 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the fenced-in oasis of 31 acres, the paying guest can meditate, 
take a class in Zen archery or get a massage at a "Multiversity" -- or just 
play a set of what is jocularly called "Zennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who seek succor in Rajneesh's eclectic blend of Asian mysticism and 
Western pop psychology and materialism find contentment and enrichment -- and 
confirmation that Osho was much more than a spiritual con artist. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 3 1/2 years, ruddy-faced Burt Eggan, 62, a former Manhattan Beach 
stockbroker and restaurateur, has lived in a one-bedroom servant's house in 
Pune. 
</P>
<P>
 A dropout from the high-pressure world of finance, Eggan is one of the scores 
who perform volunteer work at the ashram, checking off visitor's meal cards, 
selling them towels and booking tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a fairly neurotic alcoholic suburban businessman," said the man now 
known as Swami Anand Burt, clad in the ankle-length maroon robe of an Osho 
disciple. "Beneath the exterior, I was desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 He read one of Rajneesh's books and left his wife and two children to follow 
his guru. 
</P>
<P>
 Summarizing the thoughts of a man whose transcribed teachings fill an entire 
commune bookstore and have sold a purported 15 million volumes worldwide is not 
easy. Perhaps the kernel is Osho's notion that the perfect human being combines 
the earthy zest of Zorba the Greek and the transcendental spirituality of 
Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Buddha that cannot dance is not much of a Buddha," he once sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Osho called himself a guru for the rich, for people who already have a fast 
car but are seeking inner wealth. He held that poverty was a consequence of 
humanity's idiocy. He spoke of Hitler and Gandhi as being violent men. 
</P>
<P>
 He told tasteless jokes about Nancy Reagan in his sermons and said meditation 
and sex were both valid techniques to penetrate the inner self. 
</P>
<P>
 He counseled followers to wear latex gloves during foreplay and appears to 
have been obsessed about the risk of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Osho, the eldest son of a central Indian cloth merchant, enraged many at home 
and in the West because there had never been anyone who more brashly proclaimed 
his belief in both the divine and the crassly material. 
</P>
<P>
 "Osho was a man who was dead set against priests and politicians, against 
religion," Swami Krishna Aroop, a New Delhi merchant who has been a follower 
for 13 years, explained in his sari shop as he sipped milky coffee one 
afternoon. "Osho wanted to create new men." 
</P>
<P>
 And therein, perhaps, lies the joke that the passing of time in turn has 
played on the guru. 
</P>
<P>
 Aroop and some other disaffected Indian followers of Osho say that the 
buddhafield in Pune is actually becoming a battlefield as Osho's successors, 
home-grown and foreign, vie for mastery of his legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The ashram, Aroop said sadly, "has been taken over by new priests and 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 He and some other longstanding Indian disciples of Osho point a finger at a 
coterie of Westerners who they claim have money, and not metaphysics, on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their sole concern is to become bigger and bigger, and more powerful," 
charged Swami Suraj Prakash Manchanda, a Bombay trucking company owner who once 
hosted Osho for five months in his home. For speaking out, Manchanda said, he 
has been banned from the ashram. 
</P>
<P>
 The real genius behind the commune's transformation into "Club Meditation," as 
it calls itself, appears to be an elusive Canadian real estate investor, 
Michael William O'Byrne, 45, now known as Swami Jayesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayesh -- the affable, polite and smooth-mannered son of a provincial judge 
from Edmonton, Canada -- was raised in a large Roman Catholic family. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayesh lived in a Palm Springs condo around a decade ago, locals recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came down here, he had some money, he played a little polo. He was a very, 
very nice man," said Susan Stovall, director of polo at the El Dorado Polo Club 
in Indio. "He was a gentleman, always a gentleman, very kind to his horses and 
the people who worked for him (grooms)." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Byrne swung a mallet for a year to a year and a half, Stovall said, then 
"rode off into the sunset with the Baghwan." 
</P>
<P>
 The lanky, curly-haired Canadian became head of financial services for the 
Rajneesh Investment Corp. in the Oregon commune days, and was with the guru 
when he was arrested in Charlotte, N.C., when it seemed that he might be trying 
to flee the United States in a private jet for Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajneesh pleaded guilty to two counts of a federal grand jury indictment in 
Portland, Ore., including charges that he had arranged sham marriages so his 
foreign followers could settle at the commune. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 33 counts were dropped. He was given a 10-year suspended prison 
sentence, fined $400,000 and ordered to leave the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 On his death bed, claiming that he had been covertly fed thalium, a common 
ingredient in rat poison, and exposed to radiation during his 17 days in jail 
in the United States, Rajneesh looked into Jayesh's eyes and said, "I leave you 
my dream," it was later announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Commune officials flatly denied The Times' request to speak to Jayesh. 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, he keeps an extraordinarily low profile. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of the dispute that divides some of Osho's most senior followers 
arise from the decision the ailing Osho made in April, 1989, to appoint a 
21-member Inner Council to deal with "mundane matters" of running the commune 
after he had gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayesh was named chairman. The vice chairman's job went to Swami Prem Amrito, 
or Dr. George Meredith, 49, a handsome fellow of the British Royal College of 
Physicians who was Osho's personal doctor. He lived with 5,000 other devotees 
in the Oregon commune and was the one who placed the urn containing Osho's 
ashes in his tomb. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissatisfied Indians paint a picture of intrigue on the Inner Council that 
has led to 11 of its original members leaving or being forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 For Aroop, the sari merchant, the last straw came when the leadership, citing 
exclusive knowledge of "Osho guidance," or the guru's final wishes, ruled that 
meditation camps organized by him and other Osho followers across India could 
not exceed three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "When did Osho ever say that, I ask you?" Aroop asked gently. "What they are 
truthfully concerned about is that, if people meditate in Delhi, they will no 
longer come to Pune. They have turned the man who was against all churches into 
a church, with its commandments and rules!" 
</P>
<P>
 The church also has a hot tub now. Under Inner Council guidance, the ashram 
has been transformed, and boasts a lagoon-shaped pool, volleyball court, studio 
for painting and pottery, a tatami-equipped gym for martial arts, a 
Multiversity that includes an Institute for Love and Consciousness, four 
vegetarian eating areas, a sauna and the "zennis courts." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of Osho's faithful, it is the most perfect place on Earth they know. 
</P>
<P>
 "You basically have to choose: It's the world or this," said Mike Mogul, 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a writer of the suggestive questions asked by women on "The Dating Game," 
Mogul has become the black-robed Swami Krishna Prem, instructor of meditation 
and "zennis." 
</P>
<P>
 Osho taught that asking "why" about things was absurd, and commune leaders 
acknowledge that its finances and organization may seem that way to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commune is kind of self-organizing. Sannyasins (Osho's followers, 
literally "those who have renounced the world") are not people who like being 
told what to do," Amrito answered when asked who, precisely, is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us gets a salary," he said. "Basically every single bit of money that 
comes in here is spent on here, on his work." 
</P>
<P>
 Amrito contended that nobody really knows how much money flows into the 
buddhafield, where everything from large $1 photos of Osho to meal tickets and 
videos of the guru's teachings are on sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one here is going to sit down and give you an annual report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Indian journalist who has looked into commune affairs estimates from 2,000 
to 8,000 robed disciples visit daily, and that they spend at least $40,000 a 
day -- meaning an annual take of no less than $7.3 million. But he emphasizes 
that is only an informed guess. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no easier to learn where royalties from impressive worldwide publishing 
operations end up. 
</P>
<P>
 The commune says 236 books are in production and 79 in translation. Last year 
alone, Rebel Publishing House of Cologne, Germany, Osho's major 
English-language publisher, distributed an estimated 250,000 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 More books and tapes are in the pipeline. Osho videotaped 1,700 hours of 
lectures and question-and-answer sessions and audiotaped 3,500 hours. That's 
enough to show a tape every night for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting sannyasins stay for the most part in rental apartments or, like Swami 
Anand Burt, in servant's quarters on the grounds of wealthy Indians' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clad in the wine-colored robes that make up their day wear, they buzz to the 
commune on scooters or motorized rickshaws, infuriating neighbors with the 
noise and the peddlers they draw. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pune ashram was once notorious for orgies so energetic they left some 
sannyasins with broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, new arrivals are told that if they want to demonstrate their 
affection, they should wait until they are inside commune walls and away from 
the shocked eyes of India's prudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sannyasins there unabashedly kiss and nuzzle one another, but no more than at 
any holiday resort. 
</P>
<P>
 For the cost of the daily pass, sannyasins can attend several public 
meditation sessions, including the dusk conclave when they change attire and 
become the Osho White Robe Brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiversity Chancellor Swami Satya Vedant, who says he supervised courses 
taken by an average of 50,000 visitors a year, is one Indian who expresses 
bliss at the workings of Osho Commune International. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete fallacy that foreigners are in charge," said Vedant, who once 
taught Indian culture and religion at UC Berkeley. "The Inner Circle is 25% 
Indian. That's the largest national group." 
</P>
<P>
 But another Indian sannyasin who has performed his own investigation said he 
has seen the forms filed by the religious trusts that constitute the commune's 
owners of record, and that the purported trustees are Indian office clerks or 
other low-level commune employees. 
</P>
<P>
 That maneuver, the disciple said, would allow circumvention of laws that 
restrict non-Indians' right to own property. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the naming of the multi-member Inner Council was meant to prevent 
a repeat of the power struggle that had rocked Rajneeshpuram. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the guru's steel-fisted former chief of staff, Ma Sheela, took control 
after Rajneesh took a vow of silence. She later fled with her staff, and 
Rajneesh accused her of trying to poison Amrito and Oregon government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged by the decisions of the Inner Council, Swami Chaitanya Bharati, one 
of Osho's most trusted disciples, has now organized his own dissident 
meditation camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Indians charge Osho's foreign heirs are racist to the point of excluding 
dark-skinned sannyasin from publicity photographs and tourist brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who believe in the commune say it is perhaps the only spot on the 
planet where people from so many countries come together in friendship and 
fellowship in search of the higher truth revealed by Osho. Everything else, 
they say, is unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you come to this place and look at it logically, you won't understand 
anything," explained Prem Leela, a South African who directs the Multiversity's 
Meditation Academy.

LATIN AMERICA; SCANDALS ECLIPSE ISSUES IN COSTA RICAN ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Maria Figueres has one of the best assets possible -- and one of the 
worst liabilities imaginable -- as he campaigns to become the next president of 
Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueres, running neck-and-neck against businessman Miguel Angel Rodriguez, is 
the son of the national hero who is credited with founding modern Costa Rica, 
an army-less state with a strong history of democratic rule in marked contrast 
to the rest of Central America. 
</P>
<P>
 But Figueres also was forced to spend much of the campaign season embroiled in 
a trial over his alleged participation in the death-squad murder of a drug 
dealer 21 years ago. That kind of skeleton in a candidate's closet would be 
enough to destroy many a political career. Yet Figueres has been able to 
capitalize on his family's name, plus rely on the powerful machinery of his 
National Liberation Party, to stay at the head of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Ricans vote for president and all 57 members of the Legislative Assembly 
on Sunday in elections that are expected to be peaceful and free of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign, on the other hand, has been the dirtiest in recent memory, 
according to analysts here, with the trading of insults and the airing of 
scandals far outweighing any serious discussion of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Any major differences between the two candidates' centrist platforms have been 
obscured by the fray. Figueres, echoing his father, Jose (Don Pepe) Figueres, 
favors a stronger state role in Costa Rica's legendary welfare programs and 
opposes privatization of government businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who represents the ruling Social Christian Unity Party, is an 
unabashed advocate of neo-liberal, free-market reforms implemented by outgoing 
President Rafael Angel Calderon, and has pledged to deepen those measures by 
loosening state regulatory practices and lowering tariffs to promote trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics argue that the government's austerity measures, while reviving 
economic growth, have hurt the poor and weakened the very social programs that 
form the elder Figueres' legacy. Don Pepe Figueres, who abolished the army, 
gave women the vote and built universal education and health care, came to 
power after leading Costa Rica's 1948 revolution against populist President 
Rafael Calderon Guardia -- father of today's outgoing president. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the scandals that seem to have dominated the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueres, 39, a former agriculture minister trained at Harvard and West Point, 
last year sued the authors of a book that claimed he participated in the 
execution of a small-time marijuana dealer in 1973. The libel trial, which 
riveted Costa Ricans for weeks, ended with the acquittal of the book's authors. 
But a former police captain who said he witnessed the murder and was quoted in 
the book was convicted of slander. Figueres all along denied a role in the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, questions of character raised by the trial are believed to have eroded 
Figueres' onetime substantial lead. Polls now show Figueres and Rodriguez in a 
statistical tie, with 13% of Costa Rica's 1.7 million registered voters 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 54, an economist with a degree from Berkeley, was implicated in the 
export of tainted meat to the United States in the 1980s. Charges filed in a 
U.S. federal court were eventually dropped, but Rodriguez's meat company was 
fined. 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate has sought to exploit his opponent's troubles. Rodriguez ran 
advertisements that questioned Figueres' trustworthiness and emphasized his 
lack of experience. Figueres accused Rodriguez of stooping to threats and 
intimidation to get votes.

CENTRAL ASIA; TAJIK REFUGEES: PRISONERS OF FEAR IN A FOREIGN LAND; ABOUT HALF 
OF THOSE WHO FLED TO AFGHANISTAN TO ESCAPE CIVIL WAR HAVE RETURNED. BUT 
THOUSANDS ARE DAUNTED BY TALES OF DEATH.

 The tent is swept clean and the bedding neatly folded against the wall. 
Kalander Mahmadnazar sits cross-legged while his wife and daughters kneel 
behind a low table, covering their faces from the strangers at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to live here in the winter," says Mahmadnazar, a refugee from 
Tajikistan. "But the Communists burned our houses. We escaped because they 
tried to kill us. They accused us of being Muslim extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago he got a letter from home, about the new farmhouse he had built 
just before leaving. The letter said the roof had been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a year since Mahmadnazar fled with his 13 children from the civil 
war in his former Soviet republic, joining an exodus of about 70,000 to 
Afghanistan. War has since given way to occasional skirmishes; about half the 
refugees have returned under a U.N. repatriation program. The rest are still in 
Afghanistan, held back by their leaders-in-exile or their own fears. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20,000 people died in the fighting in 1992 and early 1993, when the 
Communist elite that ruled Tajikistan in Soviet days defeated an insurgency led 
by Islamic and democratic parties. Opposition leaders were imprisoned, killed 
or driven into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 After regaining control, the Russian-backed regime began repatriating refugees 
last April, hoping to dry up the pool of anti-government guerrillas and take 
the economically shattered country off a war footing. At least 18 returning 
refugees were killed in reprisals in the early stages. But U.N. officials now 
say security is good. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees here, however, have been told little about the repatriation option. 
Asked about their plans, most mention the killings as an obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is security, everyone will go," one old man in the Kunduz camp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go back when Tajikistan is free," said Abdul Karim, a young man drawing 
water from a well, who came here with his wife and 4-year-old son a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the original 70,000 refugees in Afghanistan, 36,000 have returned to 
Tajikistan, 18,000 remain in a camp near Mazar-i-Sharif, 15,000 in Kunduz and 
1,000 in Talokan, U.N. officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Their life is harsh here in Kunduz -- no electricity, telephones and other 
amenities they took for granted in Tajikistan. They subsist on dry bread that 
townspeople use for animal fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations stopped giving food aid to refugees here after an attack on 
one of its officials a year ago. "We were told in various ways that we were not 
welcome," another U.N. official said. When Tajik opposition leaders refused to 
let the United Nations distribute the food, its mission left. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the dispute, U.N. officials say, is an effort by opposition leaders to 
block repatriation, which threatens to undermine their political base. These 
leaders maintain publicly that there are 80,000 refugees in the camps and that 
"only a few" have returned to Tajikistan. "We could have repatriated the lot if 
it hadn't been for constant harassment," the U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition leaders are especially resistant because the Tajik government 
refuses to negotiate with them. As long as it is in power, they might never be 
allowed to return.  
</P>
<P>
 In the leafy town of Talokan sits one such leader, Sayed Abdullah Nuri, in an 
office furnished in the spare Afghan style. He claims that 5,000 armed fighters 
are under his leadership and that they control most of the Pamir mountain 
region of eastern Tajikistan. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Tajik government claims it is fighting a holy war against Islamic 
militants, there is little evidence in the refugee camps of fundamentalist 
fervor or significant military aid from Afghan moujahedeen or Arab Islamic 
groups. In any case, Tajik guerrillas cross clandestinely into their country 
from Afghanistan, skirmishing with 25,000 Tajik border troops and 15,000 
Russian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our struggle is for a united Tajikistan," Nuri says, looking out at the 
distant snowcapped peaks of his homeland. "We want to free people from the 
hands of a cruel government. If it can be settled by negotiations, I'm in favor 
of this."

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN SCHOOLS ENDORSED BY SENATE RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling a sentiment to bring some form of prayer back to public schools, the 
Senate on Friday encouraged educators to allow students a brief period of 
silence each day for contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 78-8 vote on a "sense of the Senate" resolution followed agreement a day 
earlier to deny federal funds to state or local agencies that bar 
constitutionally protected prayer in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) said that by approving the non-binding 
resolution the Senate merely would be making a statement "that it is a good 
thing to have a brief period of silence." 
</P>
<P>
 It would enable students to reflect on their religion, their values and "how 
they want to be good citizens of that school or what they want to accomplish 
during that day in school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came during debate on the Goals 2000 education bill, which would 
write into law the national education goals agreed to by the nation's governors 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) had sought Thursday to deny federal funds to school 
districts that prohibit voluntary prayer. But lacking the needed support, he 
added the words "constitutionally protected" to describe prayer, thus limiting 
the impact of the proposal to what has been allowed by the Supreme Court. The 
watered down amendment was approved, 75-22. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruled last year that religious groups must be allowed to conduct 
prayer meetings in public schools before or after school hours if non-religious 
groups also are allowed to meet there.

 Eleven Tibetan Buddhist nuns have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from 
two to seven years, apparently for attempting a protest, Amnesty International 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The international human rights group said the nuns, arrested June 14, were 
taken to Drapchi prison outside Lhasa, which holds Tibet's most serious 
political prisoners.

CHINA RELEASES 3 PRO-DEMOCRACY POLITICAL PRISONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to deflect human rights pressure from the United States, China 
has released three political prisoners jailed for their involvement in the 1989 
pro-democracy movement, a U.S. human rights activist said here Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't draw too many conclusions from individual releases, nor should 
we overstate their significance. . . . There are still certainly hundreds, if 
not thousands, of imprisoned dissidents" in China, said John Kamm, a Hong 
Kong-based businessman who has become a prominent campaigner for an easing of 
repression in China. 
</P>
<P>
 The releases came in the last week amid growing concern in Washington that 
China is not living up to international human rights standards, which may 
jeopardize the renewal of Beijing's low-tariff access to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights, delivered to 
Congress on Tuesday, gave China some credit for making a few strides in 1993 
and cited the release of some political prisoners. But the overall tone of the 
report was critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the men released was Xiao Bin, a worker from the northern city of Dalian 
who was sentenced to 10 years for giving interviews after the 1989 military 
crackdown in Tian An Men Square, in which he described large-scale loss of life 
in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two dissidents released were Ding Junze, an assistant professor of 
philosophy at Shanxi University, who was sentenced to a 12-year term for 
participating in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, and Liao Yiwu, a leading poet 
from Sichuan province who received a four-year sentence for his role in the 
same protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the best of my knowledge, this is the first time that the Chinese have 
released any prisoner who was sentenced to at least 10 years for their 
involvement in the '89 democracy protests," Kamm said. "That's a significant 
sign, and hopefully it's a harbinger of other releases." 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing has been under heavy pressure from the West on human rights issues 
since the army crushed the 1989 demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kamm said it was not unusual for the Chinese government to release some 
prisoners before the Chinese New Year, which is a time for settling accounts 
and reuniting families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese New Year doesn't begin until Thursday . . . so I think that some 
prisoners in Beijing will be eligible for a New Year's release as well," Kamm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What these cases show again is that even for dissidents who have been jailed 
for long periods, it's possible to intervene," he said. "So even though China 
continues to arrest people, at least we can take heart in the fact that . . . 
occasionally it's possible to secure their release."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PEACE DIVIDENDS GUIDE POSTWAR RELATIONS; VIETNAM: RAPPROCHEMENT 
MAY HAVE BEEN SO LONG IN COMING BECAUSE OF THE ABSENCE OF ANY POTENTIAL 
REWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In taking the first step this week toward normal relations with Vietnam, 
President Clinton has struggled with a dilemma as old as war itself: how to 
reconcile with a former battlefield enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 For combatants at any point in human history, the path from the end of war to 
the beginning of peace has rarely been smooth. And yet nations repeatedly have 
made the journey -- sometimes reluctantly, often ambivalently, almost always in 
pursuit of a newly defined national goal, like the economic opportunities 
Vietnam now presents to U.S. business. 
</P>
<P>
 History records exceptions, of course: Rome settled the third Punic War in 146 
BC by razing the city of Carthage, enslaving all 50,000 of its residents and 
sowing the earth with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 But more typically, even nations that have bled each other dry in wartime -- 
France and Germany in both World Wars, China and Japan in World War II -- 
eventually find ways to put the past behind them and resume active relations 
with the former foe, more often sooner than later. Less than five years after 
Adolf Hitler's army was driven from Paris in August, 1944, France and Germany 
were sworn to each other's defense as charter members of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 By those historic standards, many analysts consider the 19 years it has taken 
the United States and Vietnam to resume even commercial relations excessive. 
"The probability is that this (delay) will be seen as a very unusual event in 
the history of diplomatic relations," said Yale University historian Paul M. 
Kennedy, author of "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers." 
</P>
<P>
 History suggests that the most difficult wars to move past are those that 
divided a nation at home. Consider the case of the reconciliation-minded group 
of Confederate veterans who sought to raise funds for a statue of Ulysses S. 
Grant, the Union general who later served as President, in Richmond 37 years 
after the Civil War's end. "The fund," writes historian Michael Kammen, 
"fizzled at $16."  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the closest parallel to America's lingering agonies over 
Vietnam may be France's efforts to come to terms with its former colony in 
Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 100 years of colonial control, an uprising by Algerian 
nationalists beginning in 1954 sparked a bloody war that bitterly divided 
France and eventually forced Charles de Gaulle to negotiate independence for 
Algeria in 1962. Although the result was -- like the Vietnam War for America -- 
a tremendous blow to national esteem, the French government immediately 
recognized its former colony and made it the largest recipient of French 
foreign aid.  
</P>
<P>
 "De Gaulle was absolutely determined to make Franco-Algerian cooperation a 
model for post-colonial connections," said Stanley Hoffmann, chairman of the 
Center for European Studies at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, though, has been more ambiguous. At the government level, while 
never suffering the "deep freeze" that has characterized U.S.-Vietnamese 
relations, France and Algeria have frequently squabbled over issues such as oil 
and immigration, Hoffmann said. Today, France appears torn over how to respond 
to a violent insurrection by Islamic militants against Algeria's 
military-backed junta. 
</P>
<P>
 At the social level, relationships between the two countries "didn't exist," 
said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International 
Relations in Paris. "That has been a very difficult reconciliation process, 
because the French are not entirely reconciled with their own history in 
Algeria. The process is not only reconciliation with the other but yourself. 
The French have still not come to terms with what we did wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 That psychological struggle may be the point at which the French experience in 
Algeria most precisely illuminates the American anguish over Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is one constant to this process of peace-making in modern times, it 
is that nations have moved quickly to repair relations when they had a 
compelling reason to do so and let animosities fester when they did not. In 
determining the pace of reconciliation, assessments of future gains 
consistently seem to exert more influence than resentments over past losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Put another way, it is not the ferocity of the war but the potential benefits 
of the peace that guides how quickly nations bury their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen through this lens, many believe that a principal reason for the long gap 
in relations with Vietnam may have been the absence, until recently, of an 
irresistible reason to move faster -- especially given the fear among officials 
that moving to a normal relationship would provoke recriminations from 
Americans still angry over the issues that made the war so bitterly divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there was no overriding imperative to do this and there were all 
these other negative factors, there was perceived to be no reason to push it," 
said Asia scholar Alan Romberg, director of research at the U.S. Institute for 
Peace, an independent federal institution. 
</P>
<P>
 This hard-headed assessment of costs and benefits fits the tradition of 
postwar rapprochement in modern times.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the 20th Century, the major European powers displayed a bifurcated 
approach to reconciliation, said Paul Kennedy, who has studied the evolution of 
great power relations. Generally, the major European powers -- among them 
Britain, France, Prussia and Russia -- believed that cultural, racial and 
religious differences precluded lasting reconciliation after war with nations 
such as the Ottoman Empire that were outside "the concert of Europe," Kennedy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in their dealings with each other during that period, the great powers 
changed partners from war to war as casually as dancers at a ball. "There was 
the assumption that national interest prevailed and you shouldn't have the 
hang-up of worrying about who you fought with in the last war," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1848, British Foreign Secretary (and later Prime Minister) Lord Palmerston 
turned this sentiment into an enduring epigram: "We have no eternal allies and 
we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and 
these interests it is our duty to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20th Century, the divide in attitudes toward reconciliation with 
Western and non-Western powers has not held as firmly. But Palmerston's compass 
continued to guide the process of making peace with old enemies, with states 
again placing primary weight on calculations of national self-interest rather 
than revenge or contrition. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, after World War I, fear of a renascent Germany led the French to pursue 
peace terms aimed at crippling its rival. But the United States and eventually 
Great Britain saw Germany as a potential bulwark against rising Soviet power 
and ultimately sought to bolster the defeated Germans by lightening the load of 
reparations. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, a different calculation of national interest dictated an 
even swifter American reconciliation with Germany and Japan, even though U.S. 
losses were far greater than in World War I and the barbarism exhibited by the 
defeated nations had been as savage as any in recorded history. Moreover, 
almost 80,000 U.S. soldiers remained missing in action at the end of World War 
II, compared to about 2,300 in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, with the Cold War looming, those natural resentments were chaff in 
the search for allies against the Communist states. "At that time, we in the 
United States thought it was to our interest to have Germany and Japan on our 
side rather than leaving them to the Russian side," said veteran U.S. diplomat 
Paul H. Nitze. "There was just a perfectly obvious competition for both sides 
to pick up the pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the United States and Vietnam, the absence of great strategic 
or economic interest in reconciliation -- at least until recently -- has slowed 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 But to most analysts, tangible concerns have influenced relations between the 
two nations less than the war's psychological legacy. Although Americans 
actually have expressed relatively little lingering animosity toward the 
Vietnamese -- even in the movie "Rambo," the Vietnamese still holding U.S. 
servicemen are only fronts for the Soviets -- the divisions within America 
about the war remain lacerating after two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, many believe that one critical reason the United States has deferred the 
question of how to deal with Vietnam is reluctance to reopen the debate over 
what went wrong there in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, that reluctance to disturb old wounds appears to have been swept 
away primarily by a modern reinterpretation of Palmerston's rule: the fear of 
losing Vietnam as a potential ally, not in a military sense but rather in 
global economic competition.

61 HURT AS FRENCH FISHERMEN BATTLE POLICE IN FIGHT TO PROTECT INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of fishermen battled riot police Friday during a visit by Prime 
Minister Edouard Balladur, prompting government promises to protect the ailing 
fishing industry from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said 61 people -- 25 police officers and 36 protesters and 
bystanders -- were treated for injuries they suffered in daylong clashes in 
Rennes.The city is the capital of Brittany, the region at the center of a 
violent campaign by fishermen across France. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 riot officers and paramilitary police repeatedly used tear gas, 
and occasionally clubs, to combat protesters armed with baseball bats, cudgels 
and paving stones ripped from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters arrived in Rennes by train and bus, some from distant ports. 
The crowd was estimated at 4,000 to 5,000, including fishermen, their wives and 
other supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen continued to block ports into the night, all but paralyzing traffic 
between France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to end the violence, Balladur pledged that his conservative government 
would act on its own to protect the French fishing industry if the 12-nation 
European Union did not move swiftly to prop up fish prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade bloc later announced that at France's request it was setting minimum 
prices for Atlantic salmon and certain types of imported white fish, meeting 
one of the protesters' key demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread violence by fishermen this week has resembled protests by French 
farmers who pressured the government to demand, and eventually win, concessions 
on farm subsidies in the recently completed world trade accord.

NEWS ANALYSIS; JAPAN REFORM: RIGHT MOVE, OR A MOVE TO THE RIGHT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's new landmark political reform package will bring on many changes -- 
but not the purported one of ferreting out entrenched corruption among 
politicians, bureaucrats and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the most likely effect of changes to the election system and 
political donation rules will be a further concentration of power in the hands 
of party bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the growing consensus among many political analysts, as the initial 
flush of victory has given way to a more sober reckoning of what, exactly, the 
Parliament passed late last week and what effect it will have on politics here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the general public thinks that passage of these bills will 
bring a rosy picture," said Kojiro Shiraishi, an editorial writer specializing 
in politics for the Yomiuri newspaper. "No way. They know the reality of the 
Japanese political world, which is money-tainted and controlled by bosses." 
</P>
<P>
 A close look at the legislative package, an eleventh-hour compromise between 
Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Liberal Democratic Party President Yohei 
Kono, shows that it contains few of the safeguards commonly used against 
political corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The package was passed without an implementation date; that date and details 
agreed to in the compromise are expected to be approved in the current 
parliamentary session. 
</P>
<P>
 Most importantly, there is no broad public disclosure of campaign 
contributions and spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the threshold for reporting donations was lowered from $14,018 to 
$4,672, a donor may still easily split a gift exceeding that amount into 
smaller sums to escape reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 Full disclosure of all contributions and greater restrictions on campaign 
spending are critical to ferret out the shady deals between politicians and 
industry that have given rise to more than 15 major scandals in the last three 
decades, many analysts acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said Japanese do not demand public disclosure by their officials to 
the same extent as Americans because the "right to know" is not as established 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, in a recent ruling that barely caused a ripple, Japan's Supreme 
Court decided that a governor was not required to publicly disclose how he 
spent his public expense money. 
</P>
<P>
 His right to privacy overrode the public's right to know, the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said such attitudes stem from Japan's legacy of centuries of 
feudalistic rule, which instilled a "government is god" attitude among the 
populace, and what Yomiuri research fellow Tatou Takahama called a social 
predilection to see, hear and speak no evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Another glaring omission in the reform package, critics said, is the absence 
of a special enforcement body, akin to the Federal Election Commission or the 
California Fair Political Practices Commission, to monitor campaign 
contributions and investigate suspect deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors here take on the more spectacular cases, such as the 
wide-ranging bribery investigation into the construction industry, the vast 
majority of campaign reports are simply rubber-stamped by Japan's election 
commission, said Shigeru Arisue, political secretary to Hiroyuki Arai, an LDP 
legislator who voted for the reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is really needed is a much more aggressive election commission, with the 
same power as prosecutors and police -- but I'm afraid that might lead to 
fascism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa's decision to seek compromise by dropping the ban on contributions 
from corporations and labor unions and allowing individual politicians to 
accept up to $4,672 from each donor came in for particular criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Treachery," the Nihon Keizai business newspaper called it, while the Mainichi 
newspaper declared that Hosokawa's "unprincipled compromise is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Socialists, meanwhile, were outraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa countered that the corporate donation concession would expire after 
five years and that contributions could be funneled to politicians through just 
one supporter's group, instead of the unlimited number now allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan's media had a field day describing ways to circumvent the 
restrictions: funneling money to individual politicians through the party, 
which may accept unlimited donations, or by giving services and items, such as 
office space or cars, which are not restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the package will make politicians take responsibility for violations 
committed by their staff -- previously a giant loophole allowing them to shift 
the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Penalties have also been beefed up, although they would not take effect as 
long as a case is pending; cases can take years to resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 And changing the electoral system to have 300 districts represented by one 
instead of multiple legislators will eliminate the common practice of members 
of the same party running against each other, theoretically decreasing the need 
for campaign money and avenues for corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, do analysts see as the real agenda behind the reform package, if 
not to clean up corruption? Brute power politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War, a generational changing of the political guard and 
the downfall of political kingpin Shin Kanemaru has kicked off a fierce 
scramble to realign alliances here. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the grittiest street fighters is Ichiro Ozawa, chief of the Japan 
Renewal Party who left the LDP when Kanemaru, his mentor, was arrested for tax 
evasion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He is aiming to reshape Japan into a strong nation capable of taking decisive 
action internationally, including military ventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts see the political reform as an Ozawa victory, because changing 
the election system is expected to help usher in a two-party system weighted 
toward conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 That would further smash the Socialists, who have acted as a brake on the kind 
of military forays Ozawa favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Limiting contributions to individual politicians but not parties will 
strengthen the power of party bosses to dole out money in exchange for policy 
compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, law professor Shigeo Hagiwara said, will be a "very dangerous 
centralization of political power" that will allow party leaders to take 
quicker, but less democratic, action. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalmers Johnson, a University of California professor and trenchant observer 
of Japanese politics, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan has taken a major lurch to the right," he said, adding that Americans 
must see beyond the illusions of reform and analyze whether the trend is in the 
United States' national interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the shadowy world of Japanese politics, nothing is ever certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observers said the reform package was a defeat for Ozawa, who was said 
to be aiming to enact it without LDP participation to force a splintering of 
that party between reformers and the old guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors are mounting that the LDP's Kono decided to compromise to foil Ozawa 
and may eventually join Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Masayoshi Takemura's New 
Party Harbinger, along with a group of LDP reformers, to form a new coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the various scenarios have very little to do with rooting out 
corruption -- a conclusion the long-suffering Japanese public seems to have 
already made. 
</P>
<P>
 In a poll published Tuesday by the Asahi newspaper, only 23% of those surveyed 
said the reform package will improve Japanese politics; 63% said it will not 
change; 57% disagreed with the decision to allow corporate donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, two-thirds said they valued it despite the problems and considered the 
package "one step forward."

10 KILLED IN SARAJEVO'S BLOODIEST DAY IN A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three shells sprayed shrapnel through a crowd waiting for food handouts on a 
playground Friday, killing eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did I do wrong to them?" asked 10-year-old Sabahudin Ljusan, one of the 
wounded, who was taken to Kosevo Hospital.He was referring to Bosnian Serb 
fighters, who have surrounded the city for nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy winced in pain with every breath as he lay on his side in a hospital 
bed. Shrapnel pierced his chest, just missing his spine, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of about 24 people wounded on the playground. Hospital officials 
reported two more dead and 16 injured in other explosions Friday. The death 
toll was the highest for one day in the besieged Bosnian capital since 15 
people were killed Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortar shells fell after NATO fighter jets thundered over Sarajevo at 
unusually low levels for an hour, an apparent effort to reinforce Western 
threats to the Bosnian Serbs.  
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. ballistics crew examined the craters and concluded they were caused by 
three 120-millimeter mortar shells, launched from the Serbian side, said Maj. 
Jose Labandeira, a U.N. spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslim-led government also blamed the shelling on the Serbs. A 
Bosnian Serb leader denied the besieging force had anything to do with it.

CULT OF VIOLENCE RISES IN TERRITORIES AS HOPES FOR PEACE GROW DIM; MIDEAST: A 
CYCLE OF BLOODLETTING GRIPS AREAS TARGETED FOR PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE. AS TALKS 
DRAG ON, SUPPORT FOR ACCORD WANES. 
</P>

<P>
 Ala Juabeh stood Friday beside the mound of dirt where he buried the bloodied 
clothes of his elder brother, pointing with pride as he described the 
phenomenon now known throughout the Israeli-occupied territories as the 
"miracle of Hebron." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is here that the glow comes every night," said the 18-year-old 
Palestinian, as neighbors gathered in the back-yard grape arbor where Ala 
buried his brother's remains the night he was killed last month. "We are told 
by the holy ones that this light is the essence of the martyr. And herds of 
people have come to see it every night since Farid's martyrdom -- many from 
towns far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, we are under curfew today, under the siege of the Israelis, and 
even tonight people will come to this place, just to stand in my brother's 
glow." 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the symbols that are fueling a cult of violence in these lands where 
there are few signs of a promised peace. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, Farid Juabeh's death at the hands of the Israel Defense 
Forces along with the deaths of three other fundamentalist Palestinian 
guerrillas -- all of them shot, rocketed or burned to death in a fiery 12-hour 
siege Jan. 14 -- that triggered another surge of violence this week in the West 
Bank. Three Israeli settlers and a Palestinian were seriously wounded in 
revenge attacks that left the city of Hebron under the continuing army curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 The cycle of bloodletting is mirrored in the Gaza Strip, where in the past 
three days Israeli soldiers have shot and seriously injured an 11-year-old 
Palestinian girl and a 13-year-old boy who were pelting them with stones, and 
an undercover police squad dressed as Arab women shot and killed an armed 
supporter of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and his peace-seeking Fatah faction. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are but a handful of the casualties here in the months when Arafat and 
Israeli negotiators have been struggling at bargaining tables far away to reach 
a final agreement on terms of a promised Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the 
West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five months since Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook 
hands on the White House lawn, enshrining a deal to introduce Palestinian 
autonomy in the occupied territories, 59 Palestinians and 20 Israelis have been 
stabbed or shot to death in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Ala Juabeh's back-yard memorial to his dead brother symbolizes more than the 
violence behind that mounting toll. 
</P>
<P>
 It also illustrates how support for Arafat, his Fatah wing and the peace 
agreement with Israel is fast eroding in the places the agreement affects most. 
Leaders of Arafat's own armed PLO unit on Friday were publicly vowing to defy 
their leader's cease-fire order, announcing "a decision of the street" to 
continue their armed attacks on Israeli forces after the death of their 
comrade, underground fighter Salim Muwafi, on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 And as advisers to Rabin and Arafat issued conflicting signals on the next 
wrangling session -- tentatively scheduled in Cairo next week -- the "miracle 
of Hebron" also testified to the ultimate beneficiary of what Arafat's own 
representatives concede is their waning influence in the territories: the 
Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday afternoon, while Rabin conferred with his top generals on their 
concerns for the security of Jewish settlers after the troop withdrawal, and 
Arafat consulted with his advisers in Tunis, Tunisia, Ala Juabeh and his 
neighbors spent their Muslim Sabbath singing praises to Allah and to Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you Fatah or Hamas?" Rafi Qudsi, Juabeh's next-door neighbor, asked his 
4-year-old son Fahdi as the entire neighborhood broke curfew to gather by Farid 
Juabeh's shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like Hamas," the small boy replied without a moment's hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Qudsi, a dry-goods merchant in this city of 90,000, smiled. "You see, almost 
no one supports Arafat here anymore," he told two American journalists who had 
come to see the shrine. "How can we support someone who can talk about peace 
with a group that is killing our brothers with rockets?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ala Juabeh and his neighbors then described in detail how the Israeli military 
killed Farid and the others, escaped prisoners who had been active fighters 
with Hamas' armed underground faction, the Izzadine al Qassim Brigade. 
</P>
<P>
 In an account confirmed by the Israel Defense Forces, they graphically 
described how the army fired barrage after barrage of antitank missiles, 
grenades and machine-gun rounds into a nearby house where Juabeh and the others 
had holed up after attacking an Israeli patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after a bit of reflection, Qudsi added, "It's not that we have anything 
against Fatah. Our only problem with them is they are giving all these 
concessions without coming back to ask the people." Besides, he said, so far 
there has been only the talk of peace; the entire neighborhood agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 This sentiment, Palestinian analysts said, goes far beyond Hebron, a hotbed of 
Palestinian resistance that was never a bastion of support for Arafat's 
moderate faction. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent, random survey of 1,622 Arabs, the independent Jerusalem Media and 
Communications Center, in cooperation with two American television networks, 
found that support for last September's peace plan in general -- and Arafat, in 
particular -- has slipped throughout the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 45% said they supported the peace accord, down from 68% at the time it 
was signed. About 40% expressed support for Arafat's Fatah wing, although 
Hamas, which gained only slightly in support, was a distant second with 14%. 
But a full 44% said they felt Arafat was doing a poor job of negotiating with 
the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most loyal of Arafat's local leaders confirmed the findings to a 
large degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a drop in the support of Palestinian people for the peace process," 
said Zakaria Agha, the most senior Fatah official in Gaza. "If the conditions 
continue like this, and the frustration increases, you will hardly be 
controlling the people." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to blunt the frustration, Arafat and Rabin both have expressed 
strong, though vague, optimism that they will agree to a final withdrawal plan 
in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin predicted only this week that it would take "a miracle" to bring a 
final withdrawal agreement in the immediate future. It is the other "miracles," 
such as the light in Juabeh's back yard, and the bloodshed they represent that 
are filling the vacuum of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the people of Hebron have informally renamed the street that runs 
past Juabeh's home to "Street of the Martyr Farid Juabeh." 
</P>
<P>
 And the neighbors offered a free color postcard memorializing the four slain 
men, a collage that they said now adorns most Hebron homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It bears the photographs of all four and the Koranic words: "Of the believers, 
there were men who were truthful to the oath they gave to God. Some have passed 
away, and others still wait. But they never budge from their oath."

MANY DRUG CRIMINALS IN FEDERAL PRISONS FOUND NOT TO BE VIOLENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than one in five federal prisoners are low-level drug criminals with no 
record of violence and no involvement in sophisticated criminal activity, 
according to a Justice Department study released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was ordered by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to see if the growing use of 
mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes was wasting space in overcrowded 
federal prisons that she felt could be better used for violent, repeat 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that 16,316 prisoners, or 21.5% of federal inmates, have no 
current or prior violence on their records, no involvement in sophisticated 
criminal activity and no previous prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, produced by the office of Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann, the 
Bureau of Prisons and selected U.S. attorneys, offered no recommendations. But 
it noted that it costs $20,000 a year to house a federal inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some might argue that these resources could be used more efficiently to 
promote other criminal justice needs, such as providing more money for 
additional police in our communities," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It offered these findings about the petty offenders: 
</P>
<P>
 * Their average sentences are 2 1/2 times longer than before sentencing 
guidelines and the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act imposed mandatory minimum sentences 
for drug and weapons crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two out of three received mandatory minimum sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 * A total of 42.3% were couriers or played peripheral roles in drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Length of prison time had no effect on whether they returned to crime. "At 
least for the low-level defendants, a short prison sentence is just as likely 
to deter them from future offending as a long prison sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 The report noted that long sentences "do serve important criminal justice 
goals, such as retribution and incapacitation" and may promote general 
deterrence. On the other hand, it said, they "may diminish the value of long 
sentences for crimes considered more serious, such as those involving 
violence," and undermine the deterrent value of long sentences for violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are proposals in Congress to provide a "safety valve" to give judges a 
way around mandatory minimums in certain cases where they appear too severe. 
The Clinton Administration has offered modest support for this concept.

ADMINISTRATION UNVEILS PROGRAM TO FIGHT CRIME IN PUBLIC HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore and several Cabinet members Friday announced an 
initiative to fight violent crime in public housing and to curb corruption in 
administering federally assisted low-income housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said the program, called Operation Safe Home, displayed "absolutely 
extraordinary, I believe unprecedented" cooperation among agencies whose 
relations, particularly in law enforcement, frequently are marked by friction 
and mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry G. Cisneros, secretary of the Housing and Urban Development Department, 
said his department will use $5 million in rent subsidies for public housing 
tenants who testify in trials and need to be relocated through the Justice 
Department's Witness Protection Program. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that HUD plans to support gun buyouts and to prohibit gun dealers 
from doing business in public housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms will step up efforts to trace guns used in crimes committed in housing 
projects, and will ask the Secret Service to serve as security adviser for 
local housing authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said that the Justice Department would work with HUD's 
inspector general and local law enforcement officials to curb "white-collar 
crime" at federally assisted housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said that HUD was allocating $800 million to the initiative by 
redirecting existing funds or through new money that will be requested in 
President Clinton's fiscal 1995 budget to be announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said that the budget proposal also had "made room" for spending proposed 
in the anti-crime bill pending in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not right that we ask poor people to live in public housing so 
dangerous that the police will not even patrol there," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said that the initiative will apply to about 3,400 public housing 
authorities. In addition, law enforcement will monitor private, HUD-assisted 
projects to check for bribery, fraud and "equity skimming" by landlords who 
illegally divert resources from projects.

EX-DEFENSE CHIEF ASPIN RETURNS TO PRIVATE LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Defense Secretary Les Aspin returned to private life Friday, praising 
his successor and the country's military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that as I leave this job, America's security is in great hands," the 
former Wisconsin congressman said at a ceremony in his honor at Ft. Myer. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin, who chaired the House Armed Services Committee before President Clinton 
nominated him as defense secretary, resigned two months ago. William J. Perry, 
who had held the No. 2 job at the Pentagon, was confirmed by the Senate and 
sworn in Thursday to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said Aspin set the Pentagon on "a new, confident course" as the Cold War 
ended. Aspin also had to deal with the emotionally charged issues of gays in 
the military and women in combat.

SEN. HUTCHISON'S MISCONDUCT TRIAL TO BEGIN; POLITICS: FRESHMAN LAWMAKER FROM 
TEXAS SAYS PROSECUTOR IS PLAYING A PARTISAN GAME. CASE MAY HINGE ON TESTIMONY 
OF ONE OR TWO FORMER AIDES.

 In a criminal case saturated with politics, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) 
will go on trial Monday in Ft. Worth on felony charges of official misconduct 
and tampering with government records while she was Texas state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison, only the 10th U.S. senator ever indicted, has complained that she 
is the innocent victim of a partisan Democratic prosecutor who is trying to 
derail her bid for reelection this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Travis County Dist. Atty. Ronnie Earle, acknowledged that he 
tried to get Democratic Gov. Ann Richards to appoint him to the same Senate 
seat when a vacancy occurred in 1991, but he rejected allegations that the 
trial is politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a criminal case," Earle told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram. "Politics is 
something that has been injected into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers agreed that the outcome of the trial is crucial for the 
50-year-old Hutchison. A conviction could end her promising public career while 
an acquittal might give her strong momentum for the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of all charges, she could be sentenced to a maximum of 51 years 
in prison and fined up to $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial certainly will focus increased national attention on Hutchison, a 
political phenomenon who has been criticized for a country-club image and lack 
of substance, although her election campaigns have been so scrappy that Texas 
columnist Molly Ivins calls her "saccharine and steel." 
</P>
<P>
 Hutchison was under investigation even before her election last year by a 
stunning 2-1 margin. A series of procedural disputes that included dismissal of 
the original indictments have marked her short tenure in the Senate. She was 
re-indicted on Jan. 7 on three felony charges of misusing state employees and 
equipment for political purposes and tampering with records to cover up the 
evidence. She pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The original trial judge had to withdraw from the case because he contributed 
$300 to Hutchison's Democratic opponent in the special election last year. In a 
victory for the defense, the trial was transferred from the state capital of 
Austin, regarded as a hotbed of liberalism, to more conservative Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Republican allies of the first woman Texas has sent to the U.S. 
Senate were fanning claims that Gov. Richards also has been involved in record 
tampering. Top aides to Richards have acknowledged destroying telephone logs 
last year that dated back more than two years but contended that they acted to 
streamline bulging files and not to cover up questionable activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in the trial are high for Texas Republicans, who see Hutchison as a 
rising star whose landslide victory over appointed Democratic Sen. Robert 
Krueger gave the Texas GOP two U.S. senators for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats, a conviction would greatly improve their chances of recapturing 
the seat long held by Lloyd Bentsen before he resigned to become secretary of 
the Treasury in the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 An important question at the trial will be whether one or two former top aides 
to Hutchison in the state treasurer's post who face similar record-tampering 
charges will testify against her. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, David Criss, already has indicated that he is ready to cooperate 
with the prosecution. He told reporters in October: "I won't be the scapegoat 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Criss was paid $52,000 a year as planning director for the state Treasury 
Department. He quit after admitting that he did political work for Hutchison on 
government time. He claimed that Hutchison was lying when she denied knowledge 
of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Another aide, Michael Barron, former deputy treasurer under Hutchison, has 
been accused of three felonies, including official misconduct as well as 
tampering with records and official evidence. It is not known whether he will 
testify at her trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are waiting to see what the two aides are going to do," said Neil 
McCabe, a professor of criminal law at South Texas College of Law in Houston. 
"If one or both of them testify against her, it could be bad. On the other 
hand, the governor is under attack for what appears to be the same thing. If 
the defense can bring in evidence of similar practices by others, it would 
destroy the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers in Texas said that public interest in the trial is 
lukewarm but would heat up when a verdict is announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her conviction would not be a fatal blow but a near-fatal one," said Robert 
Stein, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston. "Her 
acquittal would make her extremely hard to beat." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a three-way race among Democrats for the right to face Hutchison in 
November, with former Texas Atty. Gen. Jim Mattox regarded as the leading 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hutchison had demanded an early trial, her lawyers objected to the 
first and second grand jury indictments, forcing a third indictment and a delay 
until the start of this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's eager to get it over with," said an aide to Hutchison. "It's expensive 
as hell, and she's had to divert attention from campaign fund raising and 
instead put money into her legal defense fund." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hutchison expects to miss two or three weeks of Senate sessions, 
possibly including a vote on a constitutional amendment to require a balanced 
budget, because she must be at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will be conducted by a respected jurist, former presiding Judge John 
F. Onion of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. He was elected to the bench as 
a Democrat, though prosecutors and defense lawyers alike praise his intellect 
and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nine other U.S. senators indicted on criminal charges, three were 
convicted while six were acquitted or had convictions overturned on appeal.

CHILDREN FOUND LIVING IN FILTH MAY BE GIVEN BACK TO FAMILIES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen children found living in a filth-strewn apartment may be returned to 
their parents, an official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a felony to live in a filthy apartment.Reports that the children had 
been mistreated were incorrect," Cook County State's Atty. Jack O'Malley said. 
"They were just living in filth." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, however, said one of the 19 children had been mistreated, and 
O'Malley said that while he believes the children should be taken from their 
families, it probably will not happen. Prosecutors have no plans to drop the 
charges filed in the case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six adults -- four mothers who all are sisters, a father and an uncle -- have 
been charged with misdemeanor child neglect. One woman, Denise Turner, 20, was 
charged with felony child endangerment. Prosecutors said Turner's 4-year-old, 
who has cerebral palsy, was malnourished, bitten and burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered the squalid scene late Tuesday while investigating a report 
that drugs were being sold there. Wind whistled through broken windows and food 
was rotted in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen children were in foster homes Friday, said Scott Hamilton, an 
Illinois Department of Children and Family Services spokesman. The 4-year-old 
was in fair condition at a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Jim Edgar blamed a caseworker who was suspended Thursday for not helping 
the children earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that person had followed the department's policy this would not have 
happened," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The caseworker made two visits but was denied entry. Under department 
guidelines, workers should call police if they are denied entry, and if that 
fails the department and the police can ask a judge for a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy said the families involved were 
receiving more than $4,000 a month in food stamps and government aid.

PEROT CALLS FOR FIGHT AGAINST HEALTH PLAN; POLITICS: TEXAS BILLIONAIRE TELLS 
SUPPORTERS THAT CLINTON PROPOSAL WILL HURT NATION. HE ALSO DECRIES U.S. MORAL 
DECAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Perot on Friday called for a massive grass-roots effort in support of a 
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution as a way to block spending for 
President Clinton's health care reform plan, which he claimed would worsen the 
national condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to members of United We Stand, America, Inc., the political 
organization he founded, Perot depicted an America ridden by debt and weakened 
by moral decay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is being programmed day after day to believe that government is 
going to give you free candy," Perot said. "There is no free candy. Somebody 
has to pay for it." 
</P>
<P>
 He ridiculed claims by supporters of Clinton's agenda that new spending for 
the health care plan would be offset by cost cuts in Medicare and Medicaid as 
well as other savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dumb, but we're not stupid," Perot said.  
</P>
<P>
 After saying that the federal budget deficit has grown faster in the past 12 
years than in the nation's first 155 years in existence, Perot added: "The 
health care program has to be squarely on budget. (Spending on health) is 14% 
of our whole domestic product, and if we mismanage it, we will dig an even 
deeper hole for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot also argued that the federal government's past record in health care 
provides reasons for misgivings about its ability to reform the present system. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs "a disgrace 
to the people who served in the armed forces" and said the cost of Medicare and 
Medicaid has exceeded initial estimates by tens of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far I haven't seen any evidence that the government really knows how to 
run health care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot said it would be better to test various reform models before launching a 
nationwide overhaul of the health care system. "A health care plan for a small 
rural community must be different from a plan for New York City," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Health care reform will also be a major item on the agenda today when the 
United We Stand group hears from Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), author of an 
alternative to Clinton's plan. The Cooper plan, which calls for a smaller 
government role, was endorsed earlier this week by the Business Roundtable, an 
influential group of corporate executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In his hourlong talk Friday, the Texas billionaire and 1992 independent 
presidential candidate decried the damage that he said excessive dependence on 
the federal government had done to the nation's moral fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington will not give us a strong moral and ethical base," he said, 
calling for Americans to accept responsibility for their own actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look after people who cannot look after themselves," he said, but "history 
tells us that the least effective way to do that is to send your money to 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot criticized the current standards for young people, saying: "You can 
teach alternative lifestyles (in public schools.) You can teach safe sex. But 
you can't teach abstinence." 
</P>
<P>
 Perot, who has been in the forefront of the effort to pressure Vietnam to 
provide more information about missing U.S. soldiers, did not comment directly 
on Clinton's decision Thursday to lift the U.S. trade embargo against the Hanoi 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 But after his talk, he was asked if he thought lifting the embargo would help 
gain more information about the men who were not accounted for after the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time will tell," he said. "It would be wonderful if it did. But obviously I 
would be concerned after watching it for 20 years and understanding the people 
involved."

DROPOUT FOUND GUILTY IN DEATHS OF 3 BOYS; CRIME: JESSIE LLOYD MISSKELLEY JR., 
18, IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON FOR THE BRUTAL SLAYINGS. TWO OTHER 
DEFENDANTS AWAIT TRIAL IN ARKANSAS.

<P>
 An 18-year-old high school dropout was found guilty Friday in the brutal 
murders of three 8-year-old boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't change anything for my son, who was tortured and murdered!" 
Melissa Byers shouted after Jessie Lloyd Misskelley Jr. was found guilty of one 
count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. "He 
(Misskelley) deserves to be tortured! He murdered three 8-year-old babies!" 
</P>
<P>
 Misskelley was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-graders Steve Branch, Chris Byers and Michael Moore disappeared May 5, 
1993, while riding their bikes in their West Memphis, Ark., neighborhood. Their 
nude, battered and hogtied bodies were found the next day in a drainage ditch 
less than a mile from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to medical examiners, Branch and Moore drowned after suffering 
fractured skulls. Byers, who was castrated during the attack, bled to death. 
</P>
<P>
 During seven days of often graphic and emotional testimony, the boys' parents 
sat in the one-story county courthouse as the prosecution showed more than 40 
gruesome photographs taken at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses, some choking back tears, described how the boys' skulls were 
shattered and how their bodies were sexually mutilated. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the bodies grabbed headlines and set into motion a massive 
police hunt that ended with Misskelley's confession last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Misskelley -- who did not testify at his trial -- had told police that he 
watched as two other defendants, Charles Jason Baldwin, 16, and Damien Wayne 
Echols, 19, killed the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the publicity surrounding the case, the trial was moved about 120 
miles north of West Memphis to the small town of Corning. 
</P>
<P>
 West Memphis police Detective Bryn Ridge testified that before Misskelley 
confessed to being present at the murders, he had talked about belonging to a 
cult. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Inspector Gary Gitchell testified that Misskelley confessed after 
police played him a tape-recorded message in which an unidentified young boy 
said: "Nobody knows what happened but me." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense charged that the tape was one of many measures used by the police 
to coerce Misskelley's confession. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorneys, Daniel Spidham and Gregory Crow, also argued that Misskelley 
wasn't at the scene of the crime. Several of his friends testified that he had 
been at a wrestling match the night the boys died. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no physical evidence linking little Jessie Misskelley to the crime 
scene, not even a little bit," Spidham said in closing arguments Thursday as 
his client sat with his head down, nervously swaying back and forth. "No 
fingerprints, footprints, no hairs, nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution's most powerful weapons were Misskelley's own words. 
During the confession, he gave details about the injuries inflicted on the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 And most damning was his admission that he helped capture Moore as the 
second-grader tried to escape. "If this defendant didn't chase down Michael 
Moore, he would have gotten to go home and be with his parents," prosecutor 
Brent Davis told the jury in his closing statement Thursday. "Jessie Misskelley 
Jr. didn't let Michael Moore get away. He chased him down like an animal." 
</P>
<P>
 "A guilty verdict for one is a start," Chris Byers' father, John, said Friday 
as he hugged his crying wife. "There are still two more to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin and Echols face trial later this month.

THE ART OF IMPROVISATION; CLASSES ARE BEING HELD IN HOMES, THEME PARK AS 
CALARTS COPES WITH QUAKE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By coincidence, the Bach chorale that woodwind impresario Allan Vogel taught 
his California Institute of Arts class on musical skills this week was titled 
"Ebeben." 
</P>
<P>
 That is German for shudder, shake, quiver or quake. And the text -- "My tongue 
is sticking to the roof of my mouth because my heart is so completely 
frightened" -- seemed particularly ironic because of what Vogel and his CalArts 
students have gone through since the earth shook Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students were comforted by the music," said Vogel, lead oboist with the Los 
Angeles Chamber Orchestra and a CalArts instructor for 23 years. "Bach is 
healing music. It calms you down." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the well-connected, avant-garde arts college in Valencia with 
1,000 students can use all the healing and calm it can get. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's magnitude 6.6 temblor dealt a severe blow to the secluded campus, 
causing an estimated $12 million to $15 million damage to the school's main 
building, school officials say. Although it appears to be structurally sound, 
the building will remain off-limits for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also forced the evacuation of 21 students and left another 520 
without heat or hot water in the two campus dormitories. Many have moved in 
with classmates or made it through the cold nights by piling up blankets. 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, the damage and disruption at CalArts pales in comparison to 
larger institutions such as Cal State Northridge. But CalArts officials, who 
are scrambling to reinstate classes, say their problems are far worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Programs that were once under one roof -- part of the CalArts philosophy that 
bringing different kinds of artists together breeds inspiration -- now must be 
farmed out to at least nine locations, ranging from the Six Flags Magic 
Mountain amusement park to a chain of Pasadena dance studios. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators need places where students can build theater sets, 
practice stage lighting, perform special aerobic jumping exercises, perform on 
Indonesian instruments and have access to sophisticated film editing equipment. 
On Thursday, dozens of students, bundled against the cold, went through 
meditative tai chi exercises on a tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a matter of finding a classroom where you lecture to 25 
students," CalArts President Steven D. Lavine said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stopgap measure, at least 10 out of the school's 180 instructors have 
held classes in their homes. Part-time voice teacher Christine DeMoore said 
she's had up to nine theater students singing in the studio of her North 
Hollywood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel said he has been conducting choral music and other subjects in his 
Newhall home for about four hours a day, despite the fact that his foundation 
was probably damaged during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "CalArts has always had the feeling of freedom and improvisation," Vogel said. 
"And now we're really going to have to improvise. . . . We'll come through 
this. Musicians always have to roll with the punches." 
</P>
<P>
 But some students, who pay $13,875 a year to attend CalArts, have found the 
rolling rough. Jackie Ross, who is about to complete her master's degree in 
experimental animation, said she and other students have been told to show up 
for meetings and classes that never materialized or were canceled at the last 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the uncertainty, she said, anxious students have been prevented from 
re-entering the CalArts building to check on long-term film projects or their 
exotic musical instruments. "It's really frustrating for us because we get 
different information every day and every hour," Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Shaw, who is also majoring in experimental animation, said he had to 
move into Ross' house because his dorm room had no heat or hot water. Shaw said 
when he complained, the campus housing director told him to "just think about 
it as one big camping trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said: "I'm paying $13,000 and I'm not here to camp." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said 36 students have dropped out since the quake, and others 
have until Feb. 11 to decide whether they want their money back. Ross and Shaw 
say they will stick it out, and Lavine estimated that 80% of the student body 
will do likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 CalArts has some influential friends to lend a hand. The institute was created 
and is still heavily supported by the Walt Disney Co., Disney family members 
and corporate officers. Board members include Michael D. Eisner, chairman and 
chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Co.; Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of 
the Walt Disney Co. and nephew of its founder; Barry Diller, chairman of QVC 
Network and former boss of Paramount Pictures; super-talent agent Michael S. 
Ovitz, and television producer Michael Pressman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner mobilized a Disney real estate team that helped the school find nearly 
150,000 square feet in an abandoned Lockheed office and laboratory complex six 
miles north of campus beside the Golden State Freeway, Lavine said. Lockheed 
agreed to donate the space, and school officials moved equipment into the 
unheated three-building complex, which once housed the defense company's 
weapons systems simulation center. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspecting the rooms, Dick Hebdige, dean of CalArts' critical studies 
division, noted wryly that artists had inherited the "remains of the defense 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 "The building is haunted by the ghosts of efficiency, bureaucracy, corporate 
strategy, defense, paranoia, war," he said. "The students will exorcise it, on 
one level cleaning it out. And on another level, they will be playing back with 
those ghosts." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavine said others offering help include trumpeter Herb Alpert and Motown 
President and school trustee Jheryl Busby. Disney, Warner Bros. and other 
studios are trying to free up film editing, sound stage and other high-tech 
equipment during off-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Mountain has offered its "Magic Moments" theater for students studying 
set design and lighting, he said. The local Congregation Beth Shalom is 
allowing music students to use its synagogue rooms. Newhall Land & Farming Co. 
has offered two office spaces, and a Pasadena dance studio franchise has taken 
in the dance classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Korman, an undergraduate in music performance, said he's thinking about 
leaving school for a semester, but then there are other harsh realities to 
contend with. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main things that would keep me around is I don't want to look for 
work," he said wearily. "It's a pain."

FREEWAY TRAFFIC FLOW SHOWS SIGNS OF REVIVAL; TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS SAY 
STREETS ARE CARRYING FAR MORE VEHICLES THAN USUAL. CONTRACT IS AWARDED FOR WORK 
ON THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While some Los Angeles streets are carrying thousands more cars than normal, 
traffic flow has improved on the region's crippled freeways -- a sign that 
motorists are adjusting to post-earthquake commutes, Caltrans officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rain slowed traffic Friday, delays at the region's two major choke 
points -- the Golden State and Santa Monica freeways -- have eased 
dramatically. Delays on the Golden State into the Santa Clarita Valley, which 
had been 122 minutes, are down to 21 minutes, while detours on the Santa Monica 
average 17 minutes, said Jerry Baxter, director of the Caltrans district 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continuing to see fluctuations in travel time but it's beginning to 
settle down," Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Northridge earthquake, traffic volume is gradually returning to 
normal on the Golden State Freeway, which handled about 90% of its pre-quake 
volume this week. The Santa Monica and Simi Valley freeways are carrying about 
40% of their normal loads -- a result of numerous alternative routes along 
those two thoroughfares, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic experts say that commuters will continue to experiment in their quest 
for the ideal route but noted that the improved flow of traffic means that many 
are coping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commuters are adaptable," said David Rizzo, author of a book on alternative 
routes. For about half, "it's hard to get them to change their route; the other 
50% are very ingenious at finding paths of their own on the surface streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Caltrans officials pressed ahead in their efforts to reconstruct 
shattered freeways. On Friday, a $15-million contract was awarded to C.C. Myers 
Inc. to rebuild the Santa Monica Freeway -- a project that is expected to be 
completed within 140 days. Caltrans estimated the project would cost $21 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to ensure that the work is done promptly, the company can be 
fined $200,000 for each day past the deadline. As an incentive for finishing 
early, Caltrans offered a bonus of $200,000 for each day ahead of schedule that 
work is completed. Baxter said he expects the Rancho Cordova-based firm -- 
which built the double-deck structure on the Harbor Freeway -- to finish early. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Caltrans officials awarded a $3.8-million contract that would 
allow traffic to be diverted to a westbound portion of the Simi Valley Freeway 
as workers rebuild the broken eastbound side. That work should be finished in 
two weeks, Baxter said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Caltrans has allocated nearly $41 million in federal funds for 
reconstructing bridges and $22 million for road repairs, Baxter said. Federal 
Highway Administrator Rodney Slater said that the agency is coming close to 
using up its initial emergency appropriation of $100 million -- a sum that he 
said could be increased next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The shattered freeways have pushed thousands of cars onto city streets in 
several areas. Motorists avoid the battered portion of the Simi Valley Freeway 
by taking Reseda Boulevard and Devonshire Street. Reseda is carrying 158% more 
cars than usual; Devonshire has 151% more. Across town on the crippled Santa 
Monica Freeway, drivers are taking several east-west routes, including Pico 
Boulevard, which is carrying 69% more cars than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city streets are holding up very well but it's reached capacity," said 
Tom Connor, assistant general manager of the city's Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridership on Metrolink trains continued to drop throughout the week. On the 
Santa Clarita line, which had been the most heavily used since the quake, 
ridership dipped more than 50% Thursday. At its peak, ridership on the commuter 
trains increased to 31,276 daily passengers, with more than two-thirds boarding 
the Santa Clarita line. On Thursday, 19,000 passengers boarded systemwide and 
9,800 rode the Santa Clarita trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not unexpected," said Richard Stanger, executive director of 
Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the diminished ridership, Metrolink officials will open a Santa 
Clarita/Princessa station Monday. Stations in Northridge and Camarillo are 
expected to open Feb. 14. Cutting the Wait

the evening rush hour on Interstate 5 into the Santa Clarita Valley. 02,09,33

BIG RIGS' RETURN FUELS A RECOVERY IN CASTAIC; ECONOMY: EASIER TRAVEL FOR 
TRUCKERS ALONG INTERSTATE 5 IS GOOD NEWS FOR A TOWN DEPENDENT ON THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anyone was skeptical that truckers are the lifeblood of Castaic, that doubt 
has gone the way of cheap diesel fuel and mirrored sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 After the collapse of a freeway overpass during the Northridge earthquake, the 
major north-south route of Interstate 5 was closed to trucks for two weeks, 
crippling this town of 13,000 about 40 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually bustling restaurants closed or cut back staff to a handful of 
employees. The local bar depended on locals for a change. The Giant Truck Stop, 
which usually fuels hundreds of big rigs daily, saw its business running on 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a world of hurt," said John Dunne, manager of the truck stop 
famous among drivers from San Diego to Seattle, and where a sign reminds all 
that "Fueling Truckers Shower First." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beginning about 4:35 a.m. the day of the quake, business dropped by about 80% 
-- and it stayed that way for the better part of two weeks," Dunne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were not much better a few blocks down the street in a restaurant where 
hungry drivers are accustomed to devouring road fare favorites such as the 
beefy bean burrito. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place was just dead," said Nicole Davis, who had been laid off as a 
cashier at Cafe Mike for a week during the closure. "But every day, it's 
getting a little better."  
</P>
<P>
 Turning to one trucker as she punched his dinner tab on the antiquated cash 
register and handed him his change, Davis said: "If it wasn't for you guys, 
this town would be a ghost town." 
</P>
<P>
 As more roads reopen, the truckers are slowly coming back. But there are still 
rough spots. Only two northbound lanes of the I-5 are open for trucks. Caltrans 
and the California Highway Patrol are still advising truckers to avoid the road 
and have issued a list of alternates.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tough to get over here since the quake . . . too much traffic and 
all," said Turloch produce hauler Gene Lee, digging into a hefty platter of 
rice and beans. "But this has been a hangout of mine for 27 years. I'm not 
about to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Waitress Kim Cimino said although she was relieved to see Lee and other 
truckers return, things were not back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually write 100 (food) checks a nights," she said thumbing through the 
scant stack she had accumulated. "Tonight I'll write 60 . . . maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 Business this week at the truck stop was back to about 80% of pre-quake 
levels, Dunne said. He added that two of his 30 employees had quit to look for 
other work because they could not survive on the 20-hour workweek offered 
during the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 He said business bounced back so quickly thanks largely to a loyal clientele, 
such as Dennis Kates, who had stopped to refuel his rig while hauling a load of 
telephone poles from Portland to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually run straight up 5," the lanky trucker said, as two men in overalls 
washed the windshield of his 18-wheeler. "I've been coming here twice a week 
for the past two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street at the Country Girl bar, sales were also approaching normal 
for the first time since the temblor, said bartender Brenda Galusha. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at about 75% or so," Galusha said, passing a frosty bottle of beer over 
the bar. "But if they would have kept this freeway closed for six months . . . 
this place would have gone out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of the Castaic economy that was not hammered by the quake was the 
hotel industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole town is booked. We haven't had a room since the day of the quake," 
said Kim Csernay, general manager of the Comfort Inn, which has become home to 
quake victims and relief workers.  
</P>
<P>
 Csernay said occupancy this time of year normally runs about 70%.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not taking any reservations for the month of February and we're turning 
away at least 50 people a day," she said. "I'd like to be this busy under 
different circumstances."

JULIA THOMAS; TIMES WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Julia Hayward Thomas, named a Los Angeles Times Woman of the Year in 1956 for 
her lifetime charitable and philanthropic work, has died. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Thomas, born and raised in the first residence built on Wilshire 
Boulevard, died Jan. 26 in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1955, Mrs. Thomas christened the aircraft carrier Saratoga, launched when 
her late husband, Charles Sparks Thomas, was secretary of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 During her husband's term as secretary from 1954 to 1957, Mrs. Thomas 
accompanied him around the world inspecting military conditions, and traveled 
the nation campaigning for President Dwight D. Eisenhower and other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Mrs. Thomas served as president of the Junior League, St. 
Margaret's Guild of St. James Episcopal Church and St. James Women's Auxiliary. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven years she was president of Los Angeles' Florence Crittenton Home, 
part of a national network of homes for unwed mothers. Mrs. Thomas was a member 
of the organization's national board of directors. After moving to Newport 
Beach in the mid-1950s, she served as president of the Orange County Florence 
Crittenton Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, she was elected the first president of Orange County's Angelitas de 
Oro, a women's auxiliary to benefit Big Brothers. She was one of the first 
women to serve on the Big Brothers board. 
</P>
<P>
 She also served on the national board of the Woman's Medical College of 
Pennsylvania and the board of the Hillside House school in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Thomas is survived by two sons, Hayward and Roger, a daughter, Julia 
Alexander, nine grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that memorial donations be made to Hillside House, 1235 
Veronica Springs Road, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93103.

FEMA USES NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM TO SPEED QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NIESON HIMMEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 200,000 residents whose homes were damaged during the earthquake 
will have their federal aid applications processed and could receive checks 
within a month -- rather than the usual six months -- because inspectors are 
aided by a new computer system, officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before individuals are eligible for long-term rental or mortgage assistance, 
federal inspectors must examine their residences. This used to be a 
time-consuming process in which inspectors filed reports and other paperwork, 
which was then typed into agency computers, said Morrie Goodman, a spokesman 
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Loma Prieta earthquake and Hurricane Andrew, people waited up to 
six months for the process to be completed, he said. But with the new computer 
system, which was field-tested during the Midwest floods last summer, the 
process will be much quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors are provided book-size keyboards so they can file reports directly 
to a FEMA computer in Northern California. With a new crew of inspectors 
starting work Monday, the field officers expect to be able to complete 15,000 
inspections each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time this system has been used during a large-scale 
disaster," Goodman said. "Checks will be going out faster to the people who 
need them and it will cut the cost of inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 The residences being inspected are those of homeowners who are eligible for 
repair grants of up to $12,200 or mortgage assistance of up to $10,000, and of 
renters who are eligible for up to 18 months of rental assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 240,000 structures to be inspected, and by Friday federal 
inspectors say they will have examined half of them. The rest will be completed 
in about two weeks, Goodman said. Residents whose applications are approved 
will receive federal checks three to seven days after the inspections, Goodman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's central computer coordinates aid from all state and federal disaster 
agencies to check for abnormalities or duplications in applications for housing 
assistance or personal property loss.

ASSEMBLYMAN NOLAN TO RUN AGAIN DESPITE INDICTMENT; CAMPAIGN: GLENDALE 
REPUBLICAN PREDICTS HE WILL BE ACQUITTED OF FEDERAL CORRUPTION CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Predicting that he will be acquitted of federal corruption charges before 
Election Day, Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale) announced Friday that he will 
seek reelection to the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, this will be a tougher election for me than previous ones," Nolan 
told a group of supporters at a $10-a-plate breakfast in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is unfair that the federal government has dragged this case out for 
almost six years, at least I'll be able to clear my name before the election," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indicted Nolan last April on six counts of racketeering, 
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering for using his office to solicit 
campaign contributions. The charges stem from a 1988 sting operation in which 
Nolan and Sen. Frank Hill of Whittier were captured on videotape accepting 
checks from an undercover FBI agent. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents posed as businessmen attempting to win support for legislation that 
would enable them to set up a shrimp processing plant in Sacramento. The 
assemblyman allegedly accepted two undated checks for $5,000 from the agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan has pleaded not guilty. His trial is scheduled to begin March 21 and is 
expected to last six to 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 At his campaign kickoff Friday, Nolan said his campaign would focus on matters 
important to his constituents, not his own legal troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trial will be behind me," Nolan said. "I'll be cleared and I'll be able 
to talk about the issues that people care about, which are violent crime, 
attracting jobs to the state and improving our educational system." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the indictment, Nolan's supporters have charged that his prosecution is 
politically motivated and have questioned the lengthy delay in filing charges. 
Although the sting was disclosed in 1988, Nolan was not indicted for nearly 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 His contributors apparently have not been daunted by the charges. During the 
second half of 1993, Nolan collected $203,236 in campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But political consultant Marc Litchman, whose clients are usually Democrats, 
said the indictment and the subsequent political fallout have made Nolan 
vulnerable and could hurt his chances for reelection -- regardless of the 
outcome of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's in a lot of trouble," Litchman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Voters "have had enough of this greaseball stuff in Sacramento where people 
are taking large contributions and doing things for special interest groups," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Nolan's actions are not found to be criminal, "the voters may pass a 
further judgment, which is that it's improper." 
</P>
<P>
 But in this decidedly conservative district, Nolan is the hometown favorite -- 
a factor that may influence voters more than the indictment, said corporate 
political consultant Paul Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
 "His presence has been felt everywhere in the district for the past 15 years," 
Clarke said. "He was a kid who grew up there, went to high school there, and he 
went to college locally. Pat really never left that neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan was first elected in 1978 and is serving his eighth term in office. 
Because of term limits he is eligible to serve only one additional term.

WESTLAKE STUDENT HELD IN BRAWL IN WHICH THREE WERE SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED and BRENDA DAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's detectives arrested a Westlake High School student on 
assault charges Friday in an after-school brawl that led to the shooting of 
three classmates who were waiting to see a one-on-one fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old youth from Westlake Village, one of the prospective combatants 
in the fistfight, was held for several hours before he was booked into the 
Ventura County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of assault for attacking another 
teen-ager during Thursday's melee, said Sgt. David Paige. The youth's name was 
withheld because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige stopped short of saying it was a racial or gang-motivated attack. But 
Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp confirmed witnesses' reports that the assailants 
piled out of three cars and announced, "We're the Asian Mafia," before wading 
into the crowd of mostly white students. They wielded lumber and baseball bats 
and possessed at least one .25-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy arrested Friday is an Asian American, deputies said. He allegedly had 
been about to fight a white student before the melee erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, detectives broadened their search into Los Angeles County for 
the assailants, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can safely say from preliminary information that these (youths) were not 
from Ventura County," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two students were hospitalized with bullet wounds and a third student was 
grazed. One of those hospitalized was released from Westlake Medical Center 
after being treated for a bullet wound in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 But one classmate remained in the hospital in stable condition, the base of 
his skull fractured by a bullet. He is expected to fully recover and be 
released within a day or two, said his father, who called the boy's survival "a 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids out here are probably pretty naive," the father said. "They still think 
they can have it out with their fists and it's settled, but it just isn't that 
way anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 He said youngsters and community leaders must wake up to the reality of 
youthful violence in Thousand Oaks, which is consistently ranked among the 
three safest U.S. cities of its size. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's here," he said. "Anybody who thinks that we live on an island is 
deluding themselves."

STATE LEGISLATIVE INFORMATION IS NOW ON COMPUTER NETWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Detailed information on the day-to-day workings of the California Legislature 
is available on a nationwide computer network under a new law authored by 
Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey). 
</P>
<P>
 Computer users with access to Internet can view the data at no additional 
charge to their access costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The information includes the text of all pending Assembly and Senate bills, 
the status, history and staff analyses of current measures, along with daily 
files, floor and committee voting records, and gubernatorial bill signings and 
vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmed at taxpayers' expense, the service permits computer users to track 
any bill as it moves through the Legislature -- or is sidetracked along the 
way. The files are the same as those used by state legislators and their 
staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first step to demystifying what goes on in Sacramento," Bowen 
said. "Thomas Jefferson once said that an informed citizenry was the best 
guarantee of a responsible government." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the service is free of any state charges to the user, Bowen said: 
"Californians already pay $50 million a year to create, operate and manage this 
information. They shouldn't have to pay a second fee to see what they've 
already paid to create." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was unanimously approved in 1993 and signed into law by Gov. 
Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen's bill drew support from such varied groups as Apple Computer, the 
software industry, the League of Women Voters, Sierra Club and California 
Common Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 For details on how to access the data, Bowen said computer users should 
contact their Assembly member or state senator and request a user's guide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet on-line system is widely available in colleges and universities 
and in some government agencies and businesses. Individuals also can have 
access through various commercial on-line services that provide links to 
Internet. Costs for commercial services vary, as does the telephone time used 
while a person is on the system, depending on whether it requires a local or 
long-distance call. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of books explaining Internet and how to use it have been published in 
the last year because it is seen as the beginning of the much-talked-about 
information superhighway.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILL WOULD REQUIRE PISTOLS TO INDICATE THEY ARE LOADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Assembly has narrowly passed legislation to prohibit the sale of new 
semiautomatic pistols unless they are equipped with devices known as loaded 
chamber indicators. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-35 vote, the bare majority required for approval, sent the bill (AB 1818) 
by Assemblyman Mike Gotch (D-San Diego) to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 A loaded chamber indicator is a red button, metal flag or other warning device 
attached to a firearm that indicates there is a round in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a minor design change costing about $2 that could prevent the deaths 
of many innocent children who are killed by accidental shootings involving 
so-called empty guns," Gotch told his Assembly colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) said the measure is unnecessary. 
"Every gun is always loaded, and you should always treat them that way," 
Mountjoy said.

BECKWITH'S FATE NOW IN HANDS OF 3RD JURY; TRIAL: DELIBERATIONS BEGIN IN 1963 
MURDER OF CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER. DEFENDANT, AN AVOWED RACIST, WAS TRIED TWICE IN 
1964 BUT NOT CONVICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The fate of 73-year-old Byron De La Beckwith was handed over Friday to a jury 
of eight blacks and four whites to decide whether the avowed racist is guilty 
of the 1963 murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated for almost five hours before Circuit Court Judge L. 
Breland Hilburn called a recess. Deliberations will resume at 9 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we ask you for is to give the Evers family and the state of Mississippi 
some justice," said Dist. Atty. Ed Peters in his closing statement. "We want a 
murderer who has been walking around 30 years bragging about back-shooting to 
be stripped of that badge of honor and to have a murder conviction hung around 
his neck like he deserves."  
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith, who prosecutors say repeatedly advocated violence against civil 
rights leaders, stood trial twice in 1964 for the murder before all-white 
juries. Both times the juries failed to reach a verdict.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they had new evidence, primarily the testimony of people who 
said they had heard him brag about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Jim Kitchens urged jurors to take into account the 31 
years separating the crime and this trial. And he reminded the jury of two 
policemen who said they saw Beckwith 90 miles away in Greenwood, Miss., near 
the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney dismissed the alibi witnesses as lying, racist cops 
whose sympathies in 1963 lay with the accused murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 James Holley, the only one of the three who testified in person at the current 
trial, admitted that he had strong segregationist beliefs in 1963 but said he 
now lives in an integrated neighborhood and gets along with black people. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens urged jurors to remember the times. "Just about every white person in 
the state was for segregation in 1963," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Evers, the field secretary for the NAACP, was shot in the midst of campaigns 
to register black voters and to end segregation.  
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Bobby DeLaughter said Evers was shot because "he had the 
gall, the uppitiness, to want for his people . . . to be called by name instead 
of 'boy' and 'girl,' to be able to go into a restaurant, to go in a department 
store, to vote and for your child to get a decent education in a decent 
school."  
</P>
<P>
 Listing the evidence against Beckwith, DeLaughter said: "His gun, his scope, 
his fingerprint, his car and lastly but certainly not least, his mouth. When he 
thought he had beat the system 30 years ago, he couldn't keep his mouth shut 
with people he thought would be impressed by him." 
</P>
<P>
 Six witnesses, including two Ku Klux Klan members who became FBI informers, 
testified they heard Beckwith brag about the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys called for a mistrial Friday, charging that the prosecution 
withheld information about Martha Jean O'Brien, who testified in 1964 that she 
saw a car similar to Beckwith's parked near the Evers' home. Portions of her 
testimony were read to the jury because prosecutors had said they were unable 
to locate her to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens said a woman claiming to be O'Brien called him Thursday night. He 
contends prosecutors deliberately chose not to call O'Brien to the stand 
because they didn't want her cross-examined. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilburn said he would rule on the mistrial motion after jury deliberations.

REP. FRANK SAYS NEW RULES PROTECT GAY FEDERAL WORKERS FROM BIAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has taken action to protect homosexual federal 
employees from discrimination, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank released a letter from James King, director of the federal Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM), setting out grievance procedures that gay federal 
employees can use if they feel they have been victims of discrimination.OPM 
sets federal employment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank also said the Administration has made it clear that sexual orientation 
will no longer be an issue in granting or denying security clearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question won't be asked," said Frank, who is openly gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank said there previously was no clear-cut grievance policy for gay federal 
employees who believed they suffered discrimination at work except to bring a 
suit in federal court. "There is no reason to treat people differently because 
of sexual orientation," Frank said.

FBI, NSA WIN FIGHT FOR HIGH-TECH EAVESDROPPING; COMMUNICATIONS: WHITE HOUSE 
RULING GIVES AGENCIES CONTINUED ACCESS TO CODED PHONE, COMPUTER MESSAGES. 
EXPORT LIMITS ON ENCRYPTION DEVICES REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MINTZ and JOHN SCHWARTZ, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Friday rejected the arguments of the computer 
industry and civil libertarians and sided with national security agencies that 
sought to guarantee their ability to intercept and decode messages sent over 
computer and telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House had agreed to review initiatives begun during the George Bush 
Administration -- and pursued under President Clinton -- that favored the FBI 
and the National Security Agency in their efforts to ensure that the agencies 
can continue to read and listen to communications despite rapidly evolving 
encryption technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department announced Friday that a nine-month review of the issue 
-- which has set off impassioned disputes between high-technology industries 
and the government -- had resulted in a decision to make no major policy 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the Administration will continue longstanding restrictions on 
exports of powerful encryption devices that the NSA cannot crack, and continue 
to encourage use of NSA-developed encryption gear, called the "Clipper Chip," 
by all U.S. firms. The Clipper Chip makes it relatively easy for the government 
to eavesdrop on encrypted communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the "keys" to unlock messages would be held 
by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Treasury 
Department. Police agencies obtaining court authority to wiretap will go to 
those agencies to acquire the two-part key. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the actions are seen by computer and software companies as a 
government attempt to keep powerful encryption technology out of both foreign 
and domestic markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, government officials said, the Administration is expected in a few 
weeks to endorse an FBI proposal that U.S. telecommunications firms be required 
to guarantee that law enforcement agencies will have the ability to tap phone 
and computer lines regardless of where the technology goes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of these high-tech disputes lies a fundamental conflict between 
Americans' cherished privacy rights and the government's investigative needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers have long known that most of their business transactions are 
recorded in corporate and government databases that are already shuttled around 
the country on communications lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of an information superhighway that puts even more transactions 
on-line -- from medical records to pay-per-view movie selections -- raises the 
ante. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just trust legal protections," said Jerry Berman, chairman of a 
coalition of business executives and civil libertarians fighting the 
Administration plan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, James K. Kallstrom, the FBI's technology chief, said that without 
wiretapping capabilities, "you're building a sanctuary for criminality to go 
unfettered." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. high-tech executives say the Administration's position will prove to be 
in vain because terrorists and criminals can already buy powerful encryption 
technologies worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Business Software Alliance, which represents firms such as Microsoft 
Corp., Novell Inc. and Apple Computer Inc., on Friday expressed "deep 
disappointment and regret" about the Administration's stance.

THE ECONOMY: JITTERS AMID OPTIMISM; MARKET PLUNGE BATTERS WIDE ARRAY OF STOCKS; 
DOLLAR SURGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The market's stunningly negative reaction Friday to the Federal Reserve 
Board's interest rate hike was across-the-board, battering a wide array of 
stocks and pushing long-term bond yields higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, however, gained on the news, because higher interest rates are 
likely to draw foreign capital to the United States. The greenback surged to a 
2 1/2-year high against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow industrials plunged 96.24 points to 3,871.42, the 
biggest one-day point loss since the index fell 120.91 points on Nov. 15, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Dow's point loss was dramatic, analysts noted that 100 points is a 
much smaller percentage change these days, given the Dow's lofty levels. 
Friday's drop was 2.4%, compared to a 3.9% loss in the November, 1991, plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, no one was making light of Friday's selloff, which hammered smaller 
stocks as well as blue chips. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller 
stocks tumbled 20.51 points, or 2.6%, to 777.28. Losers beat winners by about 3 
to 1 on Nasdaq and by nearly 7 to 1 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume, however, wasn't excessive, compared to recent market history. 
NYSE volume totaled 378.4 million shares, approaching levels last seen early in 
January, when the market was rocketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the day, the government's report of an unexpectedly low 62,000 rise 
in January non-farm payrolls seemed to ease worries that the Fed would move 
quickly to tighten credit, even though Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan had warned 
Monday that a rate hike was inevitable as the economy grows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise, however, the Fed publicly announced Friday morning its decision 
to boost short-term rates by a quarter of a point. At that point, sellers took 
control of the stock market and didn't let go. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dow was off more than 50 points around 2:30 p.m. EST, it triggered 
NYSE measures adopted after the October, 1987, crash aimed at curbing 
volatility. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant curb: Certain so-called program traders, who trade 
baskets of stocks via computers, lose their access to NYSE computers when the 
Dow is down 50 points. That makes it difficult for them to trade quickly, thus 
lowering the possibility of a cascading effect in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while the program traders were collared Friday, the NYSE cannot 
restrict sellers who simply want to sell individual stocks for whatever reason. 
And there were plenty of them Friday, pulling the market steadily lower all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, many analysts called Friday's plunge simply a knee-jerk reaction to 
the rate hike and not the end of the bull market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take more increases in rates to kill off this bull market," said A.C. 
Moore, money manager at SBCM/ARGUS in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the Fed's decision to boost short-term rates will confirm some 
investors' confidence in the vigor of the economy. Money managers interpret 
that as encouraging news for corporate profits, which ultimately drive stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks, whose earnings are considered vulnerable to rising 
interest rates, were hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Among banks, Citicorp fell 2 1/4 to 40 1/4, Wells Fargo tumbled 6 5/8 to 128 
7/8, First Interstate sank 3 3/8 to 64 5/8 and First Chicago sold off 2 1/2 to 
45 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the brokerage sector, Merrill Lynch dropped 2 7/8 to 41 3/8, Paine Webber 
lost 7/8 to 27 and Morgan Stanley gave up 3 5/8 to 74 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many industrial stocks, the market's leaders in January, dropped sharply. 
Alcoa fell 2 1/8 to 76 1/8, GE tumbled 3 1/4 to 106 1/2, DuPont lost 2 to 53 
5/8 and Caterpillar was off 2 7/8 to 102 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech area, IBM plummeted 3 1/2 to 52, Intel lost 1 1/2 to 61 3/4, 
Compaq dropped 3 1/4 to 85 1/4, Microsoft sank 3 1/4 to 81 1/4, Motorola 
plunged 4 to 95 1/4 and Newbridge Networks fell 3 7/8 to 62 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets, most of which were closed before the Dow's trouble began, 
were mixed. London's FTSE-100 index lost 16.1 points to 3,475.4; Tokyo's Nikkei 
index added 126.61 points to 20,301.43. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City market ignored U.S. stocks' plunge. The Bolsa index inched up 
0.47 point to a record 2,822.98. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The yield on three-month T-bills zoomed to 3.28% after the Fed made its rate 
hike official, up from 3.22% on Thursday. The yield had been moving up all 
week, after the Fed hinted Monday of tighter credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields also rose Friday. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year 
bond closed at 6.35%, up from 6.31% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were disheartened to see long yields rise with short-term yields. In 
theory, the Fed is raising short rates now to combat inflation, which should be 
a positive for long-term yields later. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors pushed virtually all Treasury yields higher Friday, apparently 
in a shoot-first, ask-questions-later response. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar benefited from the Fed action and hit its highest level against 
the German mark in 2 1/2 years. It also rose against other major foreign 
currencies.  
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar closed at 1.760 German marks and at 109.25 Japanese 
yen, up from 1.749 marks and 108.15 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Precious metal futures prices weakened. On the New York Comex, gold closed 
at $386.60 an ounce, off 70 cents, while silver ended at $5.42, off 4.8 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 *

THE ECONOMY: JITTERS AMID OPTIMISM; EMPLOYMENT PICTURE BRIGHTENS; APPARENT RISE 
IN JOBLESSNESS REFLECTS NEW SURVEY METHOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's unemployment rate rose to 6.7% during January as federal 
officials began using a new, more accurate survey of job seekers, the Labor 
Department reported Friday. However, Clinton Administration officials and 
private economists emphasized that the employment picture is actually 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. jobless rate was up from the 6.4% level previously reported for 
December, when officials were still relying on decades-old polling techniques 
that underestimated the number of unemployed workers, particularly women, in 
the labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 If the old method of calculating jobless rates had been used for both months, 
the jobless rate would have fallen to 6.3% in January, government officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 California's unemployment level jumped to 10.1% in January, compared to 8.8% 
in December, while Los Angeles County's volatile rate leaped to 11% from 8.9%. 
But economists also attributed those increases largely to the government's new 
survey of U.S. households rather than to a worsening of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a separate monthly employment study that was not affected by the 
government's data-gathering revisions showed recession-battered California 
gaining a modest 6,300 jobs in January. The improvement in the government's 
so-called payroll survey, based on figures supplied by more than 370,000 
employers across the country, came mainly from an increase in retailing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 All the government surveys were taken during the week before the Northridge 
earthquake and do not reflect the massive economic and personal disruption 
linked to the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the payroll survey showed a disappointing gain of 62,000 jobs, 
down from an increase of 183,000 in December, but the slowdown in employment 
growth was blamed on frigid weather in the East and Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bad weather kept people indoors and away from the stores, and it also 
hurt construction activity," said Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist for Wells 
Fargo Bank in San Francisco. "But there's no question America is on a roll 
right now. Don't let the weather fool you." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful of negative headlines that could spring from the jump in the national 
unemployment rate, the White House offered a barrage of explanatory and 
optimistic comments Friday from three of the Administration's heavyweights: 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Labor Secretary Robert Reich and the head of 
the Council of Economic Advisers, Laura D'Andrea Tyson.  
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen emphasized that the number of Americans at work increased by 1.9 
million in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get stuck on the level," Bentsen said, trying to steer the focus away 
from the 6.7% rate. "Look at the trends." 
</P>
<P>
 The government's chief job numbers expert, Commissioner of Labor Statistics 
Katherine G. Abraham, backed Bentsen's argument that conditions are improving. 
The January report shows there have been "continued underlying improvements in 
the job market," she told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The "healthy payroll employment growth that we have seen in recent months 
appears to have been restrained by unusually poor weather in January, but many 
of the industries that are less affected by weather conditions continue to 
expand," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate, at 10.1%, was by far the highest among the 11 big 
states whose unemployment figures were released Friday. It was followed by 
Florida and Michigan, which posted jobless rates of 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina was the state with the best unemployment figure, 4%, followed 
by Pennsylvania and Texas, each at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 California's rate was its highest since June, 1983, when it stood at 10.3%. 
The county's jobless rate, at 11%, was its highest since February, when it 
stood at 11.2%. But experts cautioned against making such comparisons because 
of the new calculating techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new method asks men and women similar and more precise questions 
-- and thus is less gender-biased -- it is less likely to undercount women in 
the labor force and the percentage of women unemployed, economists say.

PARAMOUNT'S BOARD STANDS FIRM IN FAVOR OF VIACOM BID; ENTERTAINMENT: BUT 
SHAREHOLDERS APPEAR EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN THE SUITOR AND ITS RIVAL, QVC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of Paramount Communications Inc. on Friday reiterated its 
endorsement of a takeover bid from Viacom Inc., leaving rival suitor QVC 
Network Inc. with few options in the face of a Feb. 14 deadline when the 
competing tender offers expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the board action, which was expected, Wall Street analysts said 
Paramount shareholders still appear split nearly down the middle about whether 
to accept Viacom's offer or the QVC bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer-term investors, which include institutional holders such as pension and 
stock funds, apparently favor the QVC bid, while shorter-term holders such as 
stock arbitragers and hedge funds back the Viacom offer because it is offering 
a higher upfront cash payment. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, both Viacom and QVC submitted revised, final bids for Paramount. 
QVC is offering $104 per share for 50.1% of Paramount, compared to Viacom's 
offer of $107 per share. But Wall Street puts a greater value on QVC's package 
of securities for the remaining 49%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're heading to a standoff here," said Lisbeth R. Barron, an analyst with 
S.G. Warburg Securities. "It's up to (QVC Chairman Barry) Diller over the next 
week to convince shorter-term holders that his stock can hold up at above $40. 
If he can do that, he has a good chance." 
</P>
<P>
 One possible tactic mentioned is that BellSouth Corp., which will invest $2 
billion in QVC if it is successful in acquiring Paramount, would commit to buy 
QVC shares after the merger to help prop up QVC's stock price, which, like 
Viacom's, is expected to fall upon consummation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one knowledgeable source said the strategy, while considered, was not 
satisfactory to the arbitragers because regulatory hurdles would delay any such 
tactic. There may also be concern that such a move would provoke a lawsuit from 
Viacom, one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, QVC's strategy appeared to be to discredit Viacom's bid and its 
proposed merger with Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. in a campaign to enlist 
Wall Street support for its offer. QVC's advisers were playing up the notion 
that only Diller has the skills to turn Paramount around and that one of 
Viacom's key cash-generating assets, MTV, faces costly competition from a new 
music video channel to be launched by Time Warner, Sony, PolyGram and 
Thorn-EMI. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Viacom on Friday had the edge over QVC as shareholders were drawn to 
the higher immediate returns contained in its offer. "At this point, the market 
says it's Viacom," said one major Paramount shareholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Chief Executive Martin S. Davis urged bidders in a statement to "end 
the auction process" even if neither QVC nor Viacom wins 50.1% of Paramount's 
shares by the Feb. 14 deadline, because the five-month takeover battle is now 
posing "material risks" to the studio and publishing company and will have an 
"adverse impact" on Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount stock fell $1.625 to $76.50, its lowest level in 10 weeks. Shares of 
QVC stock dropped $2 to $43.875. Viacom Class A stock dropped 62.5 cents to 
$37.875 and its Class B stock fell $1.125 to $32.875. BellSouth stock dropped 
$1.875 to $56.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Paramount board's endorsement came the same day that the 
Delaware Supreme Court released its full, 51-page decision detailing why it 
backed a lower court's ruling that forced Paramount to the bargaining table 
with QVC. In that decision, the court ruled that Paramount could not ignore 
QVC's bid because its friendly deal with Viacom represented a change in control 
of the company.

STORES WON'T STOCK MILK OF COWS TREATED WITH HORMONE; AGRICULTURE: SEVERAL 
MAJOR GROCERY CHAINS SAY THEY WILL WAIT AND GAUGE CONSUMER SENTIMENT. 
PROCESSORS SAY THE DRUG IS SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Several of the state's major supermarket chains said Friday that for now they 
will not carry products from cows treated with a genetically engineered hormone 
that makes the animals give more milk. 
</P>
<P>
 The grocers say they have not taken a stance on the synthetic bovine 
somatotropin, or BST, but that their suppliers -- dairy cooperatives, 
creameries and processors -- have told them they will not handle milk coming 
from dairy farms where BST will be used. Many say they are adopting a 
wait-and-see attitude and will take their guidance from consumer reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. began selling its version of BST for the first 
time Friday, under the brand name Posilac. The company said first-day sales 
exceeded its optimistic projections, but opponents of the drug seem to be 
succeeding in staving off its use by many dairy farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two groups are heading the campaign against Posilac. One, the Pure Food 
Campaign, is an offshoot of the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington 
organization led by Jeremy Rifkin, a longtime opponent of biotechnology and 
genetic engineering techniques. The other is Consumers Union, an activist arm 
of the organization that publishes Consumer Reports magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The two groups say they believe the drug is harmful to human health. Other 
opponents say they fear it will put small, family-operated dairy farms at an 
even greater disadvantage against larger, more efficient operations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many retailers and processors say they believe the drug is safe and 
the milk from cows treated with it perfectly harmless. Scientific tests have 
shown there is no discernible difference between milk from treated and 
untreated cows.  
</P>
<P>
 California grocery chains Albertson's, Lucky, Ralphs, Stater Bros. and Vons 
said they will not at this time carry products from cows treated with BST. The 
nation's largest grocery chain, Cincinnati-based Kroger Co., has also asked its 
suppliers to provide milk that isn't produced with the hormone. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the opponents are more active in the northern part of the 
state, where creameries and cooperatives report being deluged with calls from 
worried consumers. In the southern part of the state, farmers, creameries and 
grocery stores report few or no calls from consumers on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Joaquin Valley Dairymen cooperative, Richard Cotta said, "From our 
perspective, it's a product that has the approval and blessing of everybody in 
the country who understands (it) and knows what's going on, and we just don't 
understand what's the big to-do about it." BST Briefing 
</P>
<P>
 Facts about the BST hormone that stimulates milk production in cows: 
</P>
<P>
 * BST stands for bovine somatotropin, a protein hormone created by the 
pituitary gland of cows. Traces of the hormone occur naturally in milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monsanto Co. of St. Louis has created a copy of this hormone by taking a 
gene from a cow, implanting it in a bacterium and growing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * The hormone must be injected in cows because it is destroyed when ingested. 
Increased production begins within a day or two and reaches its peak after six 
to eight weeks. Cows must be injected every two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * An average cow produces about 1,800 gallons of milk a year. By one estimate, 
BST will increase that figure by about 209 gallons annually. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates drugs for people and 
animals, has found BST safe for both, although some increase in udder 
infections was associated with the higher milk production. Monsanto, working 
with the FDA, will conduct a post-approval monitoring program to check for any 
unusual increase in infections and antibiotic treatment.

Q&A; CONSUMERS WILL FEEL A BUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision Friday by the Federal Reserve Board to raise the federal funds 
rate to 3.25% from 3% is expected to have a small but broad impact on consumers 
and investors in the near future. While this rate increase is small, further 
hikes may be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are answers to some commonly asked questions about what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the federal funds rate? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge each other for 
overnight loans. Banks regularly borrow from each other to make sure they have 
the cash needed to meet federal regulatory standards. When their borrowing 
costs go up, banks usually pass those costs on to consumers by charging higher 
interest on everything from credit cards to mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does raising the federal funds rate fight inflation? Doesn't it simply 
make borrowing money more expensive for banks and consumers alike? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Initially, yes. But when the government raises interest rates, borrowing 
becomes more expensive and less attractive. As a result, companies borrow less 
and consumers usually spend less -- which eventually slows down the economy and 
eases long-term inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then how will Friday's increase affect my investments in the stock market? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The rate hike triggered a broad selloff in stocks and bonds Friday, and the 
Dow Jones industrial average dropped nearly 100 points. But some Wall Street 
analysts said many of those sellers were simply nervous about the Dow being at 
record levels and essentially used the Fed's action as an excuse to take some 
of their profits. The market could recover much of those gains next week after 
the dust settles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if you've made some hefty profits from the market's long bull run, 
financial planners say, you might want to sell at least some of your stocks now 
and put the proceeds into a money market fund until the direction of interest 
rates comes into sharper focus. Long-term, the Fed's action could actually 
prolong the rally in the stock market if it keeps rates from soaring later. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about bonds? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Bonds have been some of the market's best performers as interest rates have 
steadily dropped since 1989, but they generally don't do well when rates are 
rising. However, if the Fed is successful in keeping inflation in check, the 
bond rally could eventually resume as long-term interest rates fall, even if 
short-term rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the Fed expected to implement more rate hikes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most analysts expect regulators to raise the fed funds rate at least one or 
two more times over the next several months. With further rate increases 
apparently on the way, it's probably wise to lock in a fixed rate if you're 
planning additional borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since interest rates are going up, can I expect to earn more on my 
certificate of deposit? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Experts are divided on an answer. Some said Friday that rates on CDs, 
savings accounts and interest-bearing checking accounts will probably move up a 
bit because lenders will want to continue attracting deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said CD rates will remain unchanged because most financial 
institutions are already awash with cash and don't need to raise their rates to 
lure additional deposits. Even if rates rise a little, it should not add much 
to your interest earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does the Fed's move mean for borrowers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People with variable-rate credit cards will probably feel the pinch first, 
because their cards are tied to short-term rates and their payments can rise 
quickly. Auto loan rates could also jump soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What has the Fed's rate hike done to mortgages? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most lenders started to raise their rates on 30-year mortgages about a week 
ago, as fears spread that the Fed would act soon. Calabasas-based ARCS 
Mortgage, one of Southern California's biggest lenders, is representative of 
many financial institutions: It was charging 7.25% and one upfront point on its 
30-year, fixed loans Friday, up a quarter of a point from a week earlier. The 
increase would add $25 to the monthly cost of a $150,000 mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 People who have adjustable-rate mortgages tied to short-term indexes, such as 
the one-year Treasury bill, could see their payments rise soon. Some lenders 
also raised their prime rate Friday, and borrowers with mortgages and home 
equity credit lines linked to the prime will also suffer if more lenders follow 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most California ARM borrowers have their loans tied to the 11th 
District cost of funds index, a composite index that reacts to interest rate 
swings very slowly.

THE ECONOMY: JITTERS AMID OPTIMISM; DOW'S PLUNGE SPURRED BY WIDE SELLOFF AFTER 
FED MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The market's stunningly negative reaction Friday to the Federal Reserve 
Board's interest rate hike was across-the-board, with a wide array of stocks 
being battered as investors dumped banking and other financial stocks 
vulnerable to rising interest rates -- as well as the recently favored 
economically sensitive, or cyclical, issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff intensified in the afternoon, triggering New York Stock Exchange 
measures that were adopted after the October, 1987, crash to handle excessive 
volatility and preserve the public's faith in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed the day down 96.24 points, or 2.43%, 
its biggest one-day drop in more than two years. The decline left the average 
at 3,871.42. 
</P>
<P>
 Market veterans noted that although dramatic, the drop in the Dow industrials 
merely returned the popular blue-chip performance gauge to where it stood in 
mid-January. For the week, the average retreated 74.01 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's announcement that it was raising short-term interest rates also sent 
shock waves through bond and currency markets, sending yields sharply higher in 
volatile trading and the dollar surging to a 2 1/2-year high against the German 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declines swamped advances by more than 6 to 1 on the 
NYSE, where trading was brisk. Volume amounted to 378.38 million shares on the 
Big Board, up from 318.35 million on Thursday, making it the busiest session so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market had the most violent reaction to word that the nation's 
central bank decided to nudge up the cost of borrowing for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other market indicators mirrored the Dow's setback. The NYSE composite index 
shed 5.97 points to 261.21 and lost 4.21 points for the week, while the 
Standard & Poor's 500 fell 10.90 points to 469.81 and lost 8.89 points on the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other exchanges suffering losses, the Nasdaq composite plunged 20.51 
points to 777.28, a 2.57% loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Stock Exchange index lost 8.89 points to close at 478.29, a 1.82% 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking and other stocks particularly vulnerable to rising interest rates were 
hit hard but cyclical issues also took a beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemical Bank ended down 1 1/8 to 36 3/4, Citicorp retreated 2 1/4 to 40 
1/4, Bankers Trust slipped 1 1/2 to 82 and Kemper lost 1/2 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Three auto makers also gave back some of their recent gains. Ford 
fell 1 3/8 to 68, General Motors shed 1 3/8 to 61 5/8 and Chrysler ended off 1 
to 61 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tobacco dealer Universal fell 3 1/8 to 22 after it reported quarterly 
earnings below analysts' estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Electric Power fell 1 1/8 to 34 1/8 in response to the Fed's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stone Container dropped 3/8 to 15 1/4 on heavy volume. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer closed unchanged at 33 1/2, Novell fell 7/8 to 21 5/8 and 
Amgen dropped 1 5/8 at 41 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel lost 1 1/2 to 61 3/4 and Ivax fell 1/8 to 32. 
</P>
<P>
 * Renaissance Communications closed at 20 1/4, above its debut price of 19. 
Credit 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasury securities' yields soared and long-term bonds posted 
smaller gains after the Fed announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The main 30-year bond yield rose to 6.35% from from 6.31% on Thursday. Its 
price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 5/8 point, or $6.25 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The move jolted the market for government securities and sent interest rates 
skyrocketing on Treasury bills, the shortest-term maturities and those most 
directly affected by changes in the federal funds rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasuries fell 1/4 point to 13/32 point, while 
intermediate maturities dropped 17/32 point to 25/32 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose 0.08 percentage point to 
3.21%. Six-month yields jumped to 3.47% as the discount rose 0.11 point to 
3.37%. One-year yields shot up to 3.81% as the discount rose 0.07 point to 
3.66%. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar benefited from the Fed action and hit its highest level against the 
German mark in 2 1/2 years. It also rose against other major foreign 
currencies. Higher interest rates usually strengthen the dollar, since 
investors earn more on dollar deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar initially softened Friday morning after the Labor Department 
released its employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Fed announced its monetary policy tightening, the dollar shot 
back up. Traders said the rise against the Japanese yen was restrained by 
continuing tension over bilateral trade talks, as well as by dollar selling by 
Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the greenback closed at 1.760 German marks and at 109.25 Japanese 
yen, up from 1.749 marks and 108.15 yen Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, precious metal futures prices weakened after the Fed announcement. 
On the New York Comex, gold closed at $386.60 an ounce, off 70 cents from 
Thursday, while silver ended at $5.417 an ounce, off 4.8 cents.

OFF THE TICKER: COURTLY DISCORD OVER A MUSICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As British prosecutors are preparing their case against two sons of the late 
Robert Maxwell, a West End show called "Maxwell: The Musical" is about to open. 
The Office of Serious Fraud is not entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's attorney general wants to block the opening of the show, which is 
based on the life of the flamboyant publisher who died at sea in November, 
1991. The show puts new lyrics to 14 Gilbert and Sullivan tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor told the High Court the musical might prejudice his case 
against Kevin and Ian Maxwell. And the two apparently think it could hurt their 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 With a hearing scheduled Monday, backers of the operetta are still posting 
billboards throughout the subway. One promotional poster shows a photo of 
Robert Maxwell saying, "It ain't over till the fat fraudster sings."

 Sega and MCA Reportedly in Partnership: Video game giant Sega Enterprises Ltd. 
and MCA Inc. are planning to build a new theme park attraction as part of MCA's 
Universal Studios complex in Universal City, according to a published 
report.The alliance would be Sega's most ambitious effort to expand its video 
arcade game and cartridge business into the growing U.S. market for high-tech 
"location-based" entertainment attractions, and it might incorporate themes 
from MCA's movies and television shows. Construction could begin as early as 
this year, the Wall Street Journal reported. The cost of the new complex was 
reported as about $20 million.

DELAY ELECTRIC AUTO MANDATE, GM CHIEF SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California should delay its electric-vehicle mandate from 1998 until the year 
2000, when new batteries to lower the cost and extend the range of 
zero-emission cars may be available, the chief executive of General Motors 
Corp. said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments from John F. Smith mark the first time since the industry began 
seeking a rollback of California's rule last year that a Big Three executive 
has estimated the time it would take to deliver attractive, affordable electric 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there is some way to tie the development (of electric vehicles) to the 
timing of a second generation of batteries being ready," Smith said after 
giving a speech at the Chicago Auto Show. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Air Resources Board has mandated that by 1998, 2% of vehicles sold 
in California be zero-emission models. The mandate increases to 5% in 2001 and 
10% by 2003. Only electric vehicles now qualify as emission-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Board spokesman Jerry Martin said the agency sees no reason to back away from 
the 1998 deadline. "We intend to stay the course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech, Smith reiterated the auto industry's belief that practical 
electric vehicles cannot be produced by 1998. The main problem is that today's 
batteries hold only a fraction of the energy contained in a tank of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three, the federal government and the electric utility industry are 
jointly working on a $260-million program to develop advanced batteries. The 
hope is that improved batteries -- those that are cheaper, last longer and can 
greatly extend range -- can be ready by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Several years of focused development will be required for mid-term batteries 
to be commercially viable," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no guarantees that the technology will be available even by 
2000. And there is a credibility gap between the industry and regulators and 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credibility is a problem," acknowledged Smith. "Some of it we deserve." The 
industry has opposed emissions and safety advances on technological grounds in 
the past, only to be proven wrong.

PUBLIC OFFERING FOR PIECE OF MCA EXPLORED; ENTERTAINMENT: WITH THE BIDDING HOT 
FOR PARAMOUNT, MATSUSHITA MAY BE READY TO SELL OFF A MINORITY STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. is exploring the possibility of a U.S. 
public offering for a minority stake in MCA Inc., which owns Universal Pictures 
and Universal Studios theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 With entertainment company values surging amid the Paramount Communications 
Inc. takeover battle, sources said Matsushita could use the sale proceeds to 
recoup some of the $6.1 billion it paid for MCA in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese manufacturing giant has discussed several possible spinoff 
scenarios, sources said, including one in which MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman 
and President Sidney J. Sheinberg would acquire a combined 15% stake. Sources 
do not expect Matsushita to sell more than 20% to the public because of its 
desire to maintain control of MCA and because of potential tax consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wasserman and Sheinberg are said to strongly favor such a move, sources 
stressed that Matsushita remains undecided and that many details would have to 
be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA declined to comment on the discussions Friday. In Osaka, Japan, where the 
weekend had already begun, Matsushita executives could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the timing is right for an offering, given Wall Street's current 
fervor for entertainment company stocks. Paramount, which has fewer assets than 
MCA, has been bid up around $10 billion in the five-month battle between Viacom 
Inc. and QVC Network Inc. Analysts expect other deals to follow as the 
information superhighway creates new demand for programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the perfect time for an (offering) and the best thing (Matsushita) 
could do, because you won't see multiples this high for several years to come," 
says Lisbeth R. Barron, an analyst with New York-based S.G. Warburg. "These 
stocks are trading at 14 to 15 times cash flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Barron said she could not estimate what MCA is worth today because Matsushita 
does not break out separate asset values. However, one MCA insider recently 
valued the company at about $12 billion based on what Paramount is fetching. 
</P>
<P>
 After initially drawing criticism for their Hollywood forays, Matsushita and 
Sony Corp. are now credited with having made savvy investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony, which owns Sony Pictures Entertainment, has openly expressed interest 
recently in selling a piece of its studio to an outside investor, such as a 
cable or telephone company, as a way to capitalize on its holding. It has also 
considered a public offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Time Warner has already sold a 25.5% interest in its entertainment 
operations to US West for $2.5 billion, and a 12.5% interest to Japanese firms 
Toshiba and Itochu for $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A Universal source suggested that while top management at MCA would like 
nothing better than to be spun off and is all for being part of a publicly 
traded company again, Matsushita "won't do anything unless Sony sells first." 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, rumors surfaced that Matsushita might sell part of MCA to 
cable titan John Malone of Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But that rumor subsided after TCI signed a $33-billion merger agreement with 
Bell Atlantic Corp. Matsushita also discussed selling a large piece of MCA to 
AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron said a stock offering would be more likely for Matsushita because "they 
don't want to have to deal with a partner in terms of decision making." 
</P>
<P>
 With worldwide electronics sales in a slump, a public offering for MCA could 
be especially enticing for Matsushita. The entertainment giant is coming off a 
banner year in which it released "Jurassic Park," which has grossed nearly $900 
million internationally. It's also behind "Schindler's List," considered the 
front-runner for best picture at the upcoming Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita reported a 32% drop in operating profit and a 10% drop in net sales 
for the second quarter ended Sept. 30, reflecting a general downturn in sales.

 Chrysler Recalls All New Neons: The auto maker said it is recalling every Neon 
and is closing the plant that builds them for at least a week while it corrects 
a problem that could cause the engine to stall.It also told Dodge and Plymouth 
dealers to quit delivering the new cars until the problem is fixed. The recall, 
announced only a day after Chrysler Corp. marketers outlined their plans to 
capture up to 15% of the subcompact car market in its first year, involves all 
1,300 Neons sold since the car went on the market Jan. 2. This is the second 
recall in recent weeks affecting Chrysler's new lines.

 Warner Bros.' International Sales Chief Leaves: In a surprise announcement, 
the company said Michael J. Solomon, president of Warner Bros.International TV 
Distribution, will leave effective April 1. Solomon, 55, joined Warner Bros. in 
1989 when the studio acquired the independent TV producer and distributor 
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp. Solomon was one of the founding principals of 
Telepictures before it merged with Lorimar in 1985. Solomon said he will form 
his own international telecommunications company. Warner Bros. did not announce 
a successor, but sources indicated it is likely to be Jeffrey R. Schlesinger, 
the division's senior vice president.

MUSIC REVIEW; MUSICA ANGELICA: NOT QUITE HEAVENLY; IMPERFECT SINGING IS THE 
MAIN PROBLEM IN THIS PRESENTATION, THOUGH THERE ARE BRIGHT SPOTS. THE ENSEMBLE 
PERFORMS TONIGHT IN IRVINE.

 Some music demands to be performed perfectly, or not at all. The angelic vocal 
music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque, polyphonic in structure, pure 
in sound, is a good example. 
</P>
<P>
 Musica Angelica -- an ensemble that offered a program of the vocal music of 
Dowland, Purcell, Monteverdi and Gesualdo at Westwood United Methodist Church 
last weekend -- didn't quite reach the requisite celestial heights, however, 
and its concert became a kind of listener's purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 This was very much attributable to the imperfect quality of the singing. 
Though director and lutenist Michael Eagan has brought together nine talented 
singers for the group, they do not yet present a coalesced sound, the precision 
of ensemble and poignancy of communication necessary to make this music bloom. 
Mostly, they just got along, solidly but a bit inelegantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Musica Angelica's countertenor was ill certainly couldn't have 
helped matters, as Eagan juggled his singers variously to cover the demanding 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical highlights there were, however, including John Dowland's chattery "Can 
she excuse," with its exuberant confusion of words; Antonio Lotti's 
"Crucifixis," with its chains of suspensions like an audible crown of thorns; 
and Monteverdi's "Come dolce hoggi l'auretta," the sole surviving fragment from 
his opera "Proserpina rapita," gracefully warbled by Samela Aird Beasom, Susan 
Judy and Christen Herman. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagan inserted some of his own early-music-inspired compositions into the 
program as well. These ranged from the bright harmonies and slippery chromatics 
of "To my dear and loving husband," for three sopranos and lute, to the atonal 
"Love's Farewell," for countertenor, tenor and baritone: brief, well crafted 
and strikingly textured works. 
</P>
<P>
 * Musica Angelica performs selections by Monteverdi, Dowland, Purcell, 
Gesualdo and Lotti at 8 p.m. today at the First Christian Church, Alton Parkway 
and Creek Road, Irvine. $5 to $50. (310) 839-9784.

LITTLE SAIGON PROTESTS MUTED BY INNER FEUDS; EMBARGO: SUPPORT FOR CLINTON'S 
DECISION BY SOME O.C. VIETNAMESE MUFFLES ANTI-COMMUNIST HARD-LINERS' VOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It seemed inevitable, within hours of President Clinton's Thursday 
announcement ending the trade embargo with Vietnam, that local political 
activists would begin talking about staging a demonstration in Westminster's 
Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuyen Nguyen, 45, a supervisor for an aircraft parts manufacturer in Garden 
Grove, would once again pull from his car his yellow and red-striped flag of 
the fallen Republic of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Phong Tran, 67, would take a break from the Orange County courtroom where he 
works as a part-time interpreter to consider when and where to protest. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tran Minh Cong, a 54-year-old Orange County government employee, would 
quickly fire off a letter to a New York Republican congressman. 
</P>
<P>
 So many times before, Vietnamese immigrant activists had been quick to take to 
the streets of Little Saigon, waving placards and shouting through bullhorns to 
protest U.S. policies, celebrities or politicians whom they felt betrayed their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Clinton handing them a major setback, it was time to rally their 
comrades and show their flag again. But this time, the usually noisy protests 
were muted. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the exiles wanted their voices to be heard and their influence 
felt by U.S. policy-makers, they were distracted by their own internal feuding 
-- epitomized by two rival demonstrations scheduled for today, just blocks 
apart in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 Their continued bickering over the outcome of last month's election for a new 
president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California organization, 
coupled with support for Clinton's decision among moderate Vietnamese and the 
business community, had jeopardized their ability to mount a united front 
against a policy that would comfort their Communist enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one, not even their moderate political foes and members of the business 
community, expects them to give up without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter memories of these angry hard-liners, as with many other Vietnamese 
expatriates, were permanently seared by a bloody conflict that cost them their 
homeland, and forced them to abandon family, friends and, in some cases, 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the war is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 And the blow they felt with the lifting of the embargo, they predict, will 
revive their fervor to press for democratic reforms and the release of 
political prisoners in their country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing that happened to us was on April 30, 1975 -- the collapse of 
South Vietnam. What can be worse than that?" remarked Phong Tran. "So we lost 
this fight (with the Clinton Administration). That does not mean we lost the 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 Ban Binh Bui, scheduled to be sworn in today as the new president of the 
Vietnamese Community of Southern California, was aware on Friday that his 
political rivals had scheduled a demonstration close by to protest the trade 
issue that might upstage his inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 But he predicted that their united opposition to the lifting of the trade 
embargo will allow them to overcome the discord between the rival factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even my opponent, Dr. (Huu Dinh) Vo, has the same position as me against the 
Clinton policy," Bui said. "We have something to (fight) together. We cannot 
trust (Clinton) anymore. We are here. We are power." 
</P>
<P>
 Vo agreed that the lifting of the embargo may well provide a unifying point 
for the Vietnamese community here, prompting its fractious members to work 
together in order to have a greater voice as the United States proceeds toward 
a complete normalization of relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bui won by only 82 out of nearly 5,000 votes, and Vo's supporters have not 
embraced Bui's election, remaining convinced that he won through fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel this election was fair or clean," Vo said. "I have tried to 
point out the problems and irregularities, but it has already been decided. Now 
I don't know where I can go further to protest, or what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vo camp does not plan to attend Bui's ceremony, but it downplays talk of 
dissension within the ranks of those opposed to further steps toward 
normalization of relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Cau Tran, who was on Vo's political slate in the January election, said that 
as far as he is concerned there is only one legitimate Vietnamese gathering 
today -- the demonstration sponsored by the United Front for the Liberation of 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said that Bui had asked through an intermediary that they delay their 11 
a.m. demonstration so that it would not conflict with his swearing-in ceremony 
at 10:30 a.m. But the request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I hear (Bui) will have a demonstration right after his swearing-in 
ceremony," Tran said. "To me it's a joke, but we'll see what happens. We'll see 
where the people will go the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Vo was more conciliatory, claiming that the 11 a.m. protest actually had been 
planned early in the week as one of a number of demonstrations scheduled 
throughout the country in anticipation of the embargo being lifted. He denied 
that it was scheduled to conflict with Bui's ceremony, saying he did not know 
at that point when the swearing-in would be held. By the time he received his 
invitation, it was too late to reschedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he said, "it's good to have many demonstrations. It shows that 
different groups and people have the same reaction to this decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Vietnamese journalists, who have watched the growing dissension among 
the political activists, said privately that they worry whether the radical 
factions will ever settle their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not too long ago, they pointed out, that the announcement of renewed 
trade with Vietnam would have sparked acts of violence against anyone in the 
Vietnamese community who supported Clinton's policy. Yet there have been no 
acts of violence against the many Vietnamese businessmen who publicly endorsed 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is in flux; no one knows where we're going," said one 
journalist. "It's a dangerous time. The militants might want to shoot, but 
don't know where to shoot. So they might shoot wildly, and innocents might get 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about violence are not unfounded. A dozen Vietnamese journalists have 
been either attacked or killed since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims included a Garden Grove publisher who died in an arson fire in 
1987. The following year, the FBI announced an investigation into political 
violence in the Vietnamese exile community, after reports that a series of 
attacks around the nation were politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 in Virginia, a Vietnamese man and his wife were found dead of gunshot 
wounds in the driveway of their home. That same year, Yen Do, editor of the 
Nguoi Viet Daily News, received death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest for leadership among the hard-liners may benefit the moderates who 
once feared the radicals, but have found in Clinton's announcement the strength 
to speak more freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the embargo was lifted, Dr. Co Pham, head of the Vietnamese Chamber of 
Commerce, bought a bulletproof vest after his life was threatened and his 
office picketed. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Pham is basking in the public light. His group is sponsoring a 
fact-finding mission to Vietnam in March or April to draw up guidelines on how 
to do business with the homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 And there have been other recent signs that the fear of violence is subsiding. 
</P>
<P>
 When Vietnamese singer Thanh Lan came to the United States on a three-month 
visa, her local concert scheduled for early January was shut down by 
protesters. But now that she has asked for political asylum, no one is 
threatening her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven and Earth," Oliver Stone's movie based on the life story of avowed 
Communist sympathizer Le Ly Hayslip, was expected to be boycotted in the 
community. Instead, it has drawn record crowds to the Thu Do theater in Little 
Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Scent of Green Papaya," a film made in France by Vietnamese filmmakers 
that could garner an Academy Award for Vietnam, also was expected to be 
targeted by demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's opening tonight and no one is boycotting it," noted one Vietnamese 
journalist. "There's just been a couple of editorials here and there against 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The staunch anti-communists may be finding themselves without the power to 
influence events. What were once staunch anti-communist attitudes among the 
majority may have given way to more moderate political positions. 
</P>
<P>
 And Vietnamese moderates, ready to move on and put the past behind them, want 
to build a better Vietnam instead of letting it rot, according to some who 
privately favor the new trade relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuyen Nguyen readily admits that he and his hard-line allies do not have 
political clout that reaches the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But with their bullhorns, Nguyen said, they do not believe they are voiceless. 
He vows to whip up public opinion, circulate petitions and develop voter 
registration campaigns independent of the Democratic and Republican parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will utilize a bad situation and turn it into a good situation," Nguyen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cong, who will attend Bui's inauguration at the Westminster Civic Center, also 
issued a warning: "Remember that when American companies come in and work in 
Vietnam, a lot of personnel and staff will be Vietnamese Americans. We will be 
fighting them right inside their plants. . . . One way or another, we will 
fight, here or there." 
</P>
<P>
 Yen Do, editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News, said the "noisy style" of the 
hard-liners makes them appear "bigger than they are." And their ability to 
organize demonstrations, telephone-calling and letter-writing campaigns will 
keep them in a position to shape public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they want to gain political clout within the American political system, 
Do suggests that they deal with the new political realities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will become a strong voice when they accept some kind of unity among 
themselves and they can play the politics of true compromise," Do said.

FED HIKES INTEREST RATE; STOCKS SLIDE; ECONOMY: CENTRAL BANK BOOSTS FEDERAL 
FUNDS CEILING FROM 3% TO 3.25%. ANTI-INFLATION MEASURE JOLTS WALL STREET, BUT 
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS SIGNAL SUPPORT.

<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, concerned that the economic recovery may fuel 
inflation, raised interest rates Friday for the first time in nearly five 
years, signaling an end to an era of declining loan costs and sending a shiver 
through Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, where the economy is poised for recovery this year, 
economists said they do not believe the Fed's action will have negative 
repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement that the central bank is raising the benchmark interest rate 
for federal funds from 3% to 3.25% sent the Dow Jones industrial average 
tumbling by nearly 100 points. By the end of the day, at least one bank had 
reacted by raising its prime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, however, generally supported the maneuver by 
the Federal Reserve, whose actions are independent of government control. The 
federal funds rate is the interest banks pay on overnight loans to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is unlikely to exert much pressure on interest rates paid by 
consumers, at least in the short run, economists said. And if the Federal 
Reserve succeeds in holding down inflation, longer-term interest rates paid by 
consumers for home mortgages, auto loans and other borrowing also will rise 
only slightly, some economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been expected," said Anil Puri, dean of the Cal State Fullerton 
economics department. "It probably happened a little sooner than most preople 
thought, but it is consistent with the Fed's long-term policies of low 
inflation and stable growth and I don't believe it will damage the county's 
recovery process." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Hahn, chief economist for the Orange County office of national 
accounting and consulting firm Kenneth Leventhal & Co., said he found the 
interest rate increase a refreshingly keen move. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see the Fed out in front of things for a change," he said. "It's 
usually behind the curve." 
</P>
<P>
 Both economists said that if the increase in the bank borrowing rate 
ultimately causes mortgage interest rates to rise, that probably would also 
have a beneficial impact in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time mortgage interest rates went up a quarter of a point, it spurred 
a home sales increase because people who had been holding off on home purchases 
decided to take the plunge before borrowing for a mortgage got any more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa stockbroker Jeffrey Kilpatrick said he believes the interest rate 
increase inevitably will be seen by investors as a good move that will boost 
output in businesses across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But the increase is still a shot across the economic bow: Nearly five years 
after the Federal Reserve began lowering rates to combat recessionary trends, 
the central bank believes that the national recovery is solid enough that it 
can return its attention to preventing inflation by raising the cost of 
borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increase spawned forecasts of more rises to come. Economist Lawrence 
Kudlow of Bear, Stearns Inc. predicted that the Clinton Administration is in 
for "a much bumpier economic ride than they think." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor, said that the central bank 
most likely will undertake "a series of tightening moves to raise interest 
rates." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking a gradual course," he said. "This is the beginning. We will 
have to look forward to increases every six to eight weeks in short-term 
interest rates until the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a course, Gramley said, would "avoid inflation and in the process ensure 
a longer recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, made it clear 
in testimony to Congress on Monday that rates would be raised, the bank 
surprised officials with its method of disclosing the increase. Rather than 
simply adjusting the rate, as is customary, the bank issued a formal statement 
explaining its intention to use tighter money to fight inflation and keep the 
economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision was taken to move toward a less accommodative stance in monetary 
policy in order to sustain and enhance the economic expansion," the Fed said in 
a written statement disclosing the plans of the Federal Open Markets Committee, 
the bank's key rate-setting panel, which had cast a 10-0 vote in favor of the 
higher rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement continued: 
</P>
<P>
 "Chairman Greenspan decided to announce this action immediately so as to avoid 
any misunderstanding of the committee's purposes, given the fact that this is 
the first firming of reserve market conditions by the committee since early 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan and others have expressed concern that the strengthening national 
economic recovery -- which is far from evident in Southern California -- would 
lead the nation into a new round of inflation. Because inflation is more 
difficult to turn around once it has set in, they have said, an effective 
preemptive strike would be to limit the money supply by making borrowing more 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation in 1993 was 2.7%, the lowest rate since 1965, with the exception of 
a 1.3% rate in 1986, but such a low rate is not expected to hold. Another 
measure of economic health, the 30-year mortgage rate average, has begun to 
creep up, from a 25-year low of 6.74% in October, to the current average rate 
of 6.97%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration expressed support for a rate increase earlier in 
the week. President Clinton signaled Monday that he had no objection to a small 
increase in short-term rates, as long as the longer-term rates, which have a 
more direct effect on consumers, could be held down. And on Friday, the 
Administration said that it had included slightly higher interest rates as a 
factor in preparing its economic forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still think the economy will grow at 3% this year," Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen said Friday. "Inflation appears to be well-contained at the 
present time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Reserve is an independent central bank, and we respect its 
independence," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who heads the President's Council of Economic Advisers, 
said that the move is "consistent with the continuation of a solid and 
sustained economic expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, Bentsen, and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich were dispatched to the 
White House press briefing room to publicize the Administration's cautionary 
message that the rise in the short-term interest rate and new unemployment 
figures should not be read as signs of looming economic turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the financial markets greeted the announcement with a selling 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
 According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials 
fell 96.24, or 2.43%, to 3,871.42. It was the greatest point loss since Nov. 
15, 1991, when the industrial average fell 120.31 points. Declining issues 
outnumbered advances by nearly 7 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with just 
314 up, 2,037 down and 402 unchanged. Bond prices fell as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago-based Harris Trust & Savings Bank, a subsidiary of the Bank of 
Montreal, raised its prime lending rate to 5.75%, from 5.5%.

 Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, uses interest rate increases as a 
tool to keep inflation pressures in check. While inflation is low now, recent 
signs of economic strength have raised fears that inflation could accelerate. 
Higher rates tend to cool inflation pressures by making it more expensive for 
individuals and businesses to borrow money. The stock market plunged in 
reaction to the Fed's decision. While many strategists don't consider the stock 
rally over, the sharp reaction could mean investors are in for an unpredictable 
ride after a three-year bull run.

 HEAVEN TO THEM: Despite some criticisms that Oliver Stone's film "Heaven and 
Earth" favors the Viet Cong, it's a huge hit in Little Saigon. Steven Tran, 
manager of Garden Grove's Thu Do Theater, where it plays in Vietnamese, says 
the movie -- set in Vietnam -- is the most popular movie it's ever run. . . . 
Says Tran: "People say they can feel this movie because it brings back so many 
beautiful and painful memories. Some see it two, three and even four times." 
</P>
<P>
 WELCOME BOOST: Does it help sales when they make a hit movie from your book? 
"Schindler's List" by Thomas Keneally, a UC Irvine writing teacher, has enjoyed 
only modest sales the past 10 years. But a reissue of the novel on the heels of 
the highly acclaimed Steven Spielberg movie based on it has reached No. 1 on 
the Publisher's Weekly trade paperback list. . . . Says Keneally: "All writers 
know this is irrational. The book is no better or worse than it was a year 
before its movie-less existence. Nonetheless, it's very welcome."

 SITCOM POTATO: When it came to corn, TV producer Paul Henning could grow it as

Junction." The communications division at Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana 
will pay tribute to Henning tonight (F1). And it's managed to talk 10 stars 
from those shows -- including "Green Acres" lead Eddie Albert, above -- into 
showing up. A real tribute to Henning, who will also be there: They're all 
coming for free.

 JAROCHO PROUD: The Ballet Folklorico "Quetzalli" de Veracruz will present 
traditional Mexican dances Sunday at 4 p.m. at UCI's Bren Events Center -- 
including one rousing number to live jarocho music. "Jarocho" harks back to the 
Spaniards' arrival in Mexico, whose inhabitants were derisively dubbed 
jarochos, meaning dirty or filthy. But troupe manager Stephen Heath explains: 
"The term evolved and is now a source of pride to the Mexicans who don't want 
to lose touch with their heritage."

 SHORT RAIN: We've had fires and earthquakes, but very little rain this season. 
So far, the totals (above) fall sharply below the last two years. From July 1, 
1993, through Jan. 31, the amount of rain in the three Valley communities 
gauged by WeatherData -- Burbank, Woodland Hills and Van Nuys -- stands at only 
about 10% of the rainfall for the same period in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 LOSING WAYS: With all of the school's hoop troubles this season (3-14), there 
was hope the Cal State Northridge Matadors would turn things around on the 
baseball diamond. Not yet, at least. The Matadors lost their season opener 
Friday, 9-8, at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.. . . But there's always the next 
game. "Write this down, I'll never give up nine runs again," said CSUN losing 
pitcher Marco Contreras. (C12)

<P>
 TAX BREAK: The quake hit you pretty hard, but as a member of the middle class, 
you don't qualify for federal relief. What's a taxpayer to do? Pay much less, 
says one politician. . . . U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) will 
introduce legislation Monday to let quake victims deduct all of their disaster 
losses from their federal income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 MOVING MOUNTAIN: Oat Mountain in the Santa Susana range just north of the 
Valley can't quite make up its mind where to settle down. First, the Jan. 17 
temblor moved the 3,618-foot-high mountain 6.2 inches to the north and 5.5 
inches west.. . . Then, after the 5.0 aftershock on Jan. 29, it reversed course 
and moved an inch back to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 STOCK SLIDE: The Fed raised short-term interest rates Friday for the first 
time in five years. That meant trouble for the stocks of many companies, 
including some based in the Valley or which have big local operations here. ITT 
Corp. and Walt Disney each lost about $2 a share; Great Western, a buck.. . . 
The market fell about 96 points, and new rates will affect consumers as well as 
investors. (A1, D1) Stormy Weather

JEWISH GROUPS PRESSURE CLINTON ON NOMINEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Jewish groups are urging President Clinton to withdraw Strobe Talbott as 
his nominee for the No. 2 spot at the State Department, citing what they say 
are his anti-Israel writings when he was a Time magazine reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott will face tough questions on his Mideast views at confirmation 
hearings beginning Tuesday, sources on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott, the State Department's senior adviser on Russia and Clinton's friend 
since they were roommates at Oxford as Rhodes scholars 25 years ago, has 
generally won high marks for his work in shaping the Administration's Russian 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said Clinton's decision in December to 
nominate Talbott as was "an inspired choice." 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed as deputy secretary of state, he would replace Clifton Wharton 
Jr., who resigned after only eight months in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the anti-Israel allegations, there were indications Talbott's 
nomination might not be approved as easily as last spring, when 89 senators 
supported his appointment as ambassador at large to Russia and the other former 
Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment is growing on Capitol Hill that the Russian policy that Talbott 
crafted depends too much on the success of one man, Boris N. Yeltsin, and that 
State Department planners were unprepared for the conservative backlash of last 
December's parliamentary elections in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton A. Klein, president of the Zionist Organization of America, said 
Clinton should withdraw the nomination because "he has, over many years, 
demonstrated a lack of understanding of the threats that Israel faces, and 
tends to view Israel as the prime source of most problems in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein compiled references to Israel in Talbott's writing for Time from 1981 to 
1991, saying Talbott consistently attacked the Jewish state. In 1981, Klein 
found, Talbott wrote that "Israel is well on its way to becoming not just a 
dubious asset but an outright liability to American security interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein also cited an article written after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, titled 
"How Israel Is Like Iraq," in which Talbott compared Israel's claims to the 
occupied West Bank to Saddam Hussein's claims to Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Jewish Coalition, which has ties to the Republican Party, also 
called for Clinton to withdraw Talbott's name, saying his writings are "very, 
very troubling and should be of concern not just to the Jewish community but to 
America as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Talbott nor the State Department press office had any comment on the 
anti-Israel charges. 
</P>
<P>
 American Israel Public Affairs Committee President Steve Grossman said his 
group has "every confidence that Ambassador Talbott will be fully supportive of 
the policies of the Clinton administration that have strengthened the 
U.S.-Israel relationship." But he added that the pro-Israel lobbying group was 
"going to look to the confirmation process for him to publicly articulate his 
views." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pelavin, spokesman for the American Jewish Congress, agreed: "We have no 
reason to doubt that Strobe Talbott would work to uphold the administration's 
policy of strong and consistent support for Israel."

FILLMORE SUMMONS THE BULLDOZERS; REBUILDING: COUNCILMAN'S HOME IS FIRST TO FALL 
AS RAIN SLOWS DEMOLITION. MEANTIME, A TENT TO HOUSE MERCHANTS IS TAKING SHAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Fillmore City Councilman Roger Campbell had the dubious distinction of owning 
the first building in town to be demolished after the earthquake. His house, 
torn down early Friday, was first on a list of 14 buildings scheduled for 
demolition, including a handful of businesses along Central Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had hoped to tear down four other quake-damaged buildings on 
Friday, including the Fillmore Hotel. But a steady rain slowed the effort and, 
by day's end, just two homes had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day is always tough," said Mark Kirkland, who manages the 
Gardena-based demolition team hired by the city to tear down the hotel, 
Campbell's home and other structures. "It's taking us a lot longer than we 
thought it would." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland said the demolition crew will probably tackle the hotel on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland is being paid $11,600 to take down the Fillmore Hotel, city officials 
said, and $2,300 for each of the three homes the city has ordered him to 
demolish. 
</P>
<P>
 As workers began tearing down earthquake-damaged buildings throughout town 
Friday, others spent the day setting up a huge metal-framed dome tent in the 
city's Central Park to house merchants displaced by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to construct a $1.3-million, two-story building for use as an 
interim site for earthquake-damaged businesses, City Manager Roy Payne said. A 
federal grant will pay for construction, with the building expected to be 
completed in about a year, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that after downtown merchants return to permanent quarters, the 
building will be used as a new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at (quake-hit) cities like Santa Cruz, the recovery typically 
took three or four years," Payne said. "We're hoping we can shorten that time, 
but in the interim, we'll have a building ready for them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the shadow of the domed tent, business owners scrambled to salvage items 
from buildings marked for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fillmore Hotel, owner Eric Marsh directed the retrieval of washers and 
dryers from the bottom floor of the crumbling structure. On Thursday, former 
hotel residents were allowed to re-enter the building for the first time to 
retrieve possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents, mostly farm workers, spent their time searching for immigration 
papers and other important items, Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 A block and a half away, members of the Masonic Assn. gathered outside their 
doomed building, which is scheduled to fall to the wrecking ball on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday, association members notified merchants renting storefronts on 
the first floor of the red-brick building that they had one last chance to pull 
out their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have a small safe in there and our computers," said a visibly shaken 
Jerry Atkinson, who with his wife owns Donna Tours. He was worried that 
valuable items would be destroyed before he could retrieve them, but later he 
was able to remove the safe and computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Campbell and his wife Cathy also pulled most of their belongings 
out of their house before it was demolished Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Campbells and their son Mike, 16, watched in a steady rain as the blade of 
a bulldozer bit into the house. When the bulldozer finally was able to push the 
listing wooden structure down an hour later, Cathy Campbell let out a "whoop" 
of approval. But Roger Campbell seemed saddened at the sight of the pile of

RULING BACKS PLAN TO SWITCH ON RADAR TOWER; OJAI: FEDERAL JUDGE DECIDES 
ADEQUATE STUDIES HAVE BEEN DONE ON THE WEATHER SYSTEM TO ENSURE SAFETY. APPEAL 
IS PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A federal judge on Friday refused to prevent the government from turning on a 
microwave radar tower atop Sulphur Mountain next week, ruling that officials 
had performed adequate studies to ensure residents' safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the weather-tracking system, fearful that radiation emissions 
could cause leukemia or other sicknesses, vowed to file an emergency appeal 
with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal as soon as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Larry Hagman, resident David Hedman and a group calling itself the 
Environmental Coalition of Ojai asked the court to grant a preliminary 
injunction to prevent the government from switching on the system until more 
detailed analysis could be done. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. said that no further analysis was 
needed under federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not agree with (the completed reports') findings, but there's nothing I 
can do about that," Hatter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 98-foot tower was erected in a neighborhood atop Sulphur Mountain in early 
December. More than 150 other towers are being constructed across the country 
as part of a $4.5-billion, decade-long government modernization project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sulphur Mountain system will replace an aging National Weather Service 
antenna on top of the federal building in West Los Angeles. The new tower also 
will provide military and Federal Aviation Administration workers with vital 
weather data, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the tower's appearance near Ojai, residents afraid of the 
low-level radiation emitted from the system mobilized to remove the radar 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ruling, however, effectively ends the lawsuit unless the appellate 
court decides to force the government to do a more specific study of the 
Sulphur Mountain site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a setback, but this was only a battle," said attorney Fred M. Blum, who 
likened the effect of the radar system on his clients to that of a chicken 
inside a microwave oven. "It's who wins ultimately that matters." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum said he most likely would file the appeal on Monday or Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Donna J. Everett, pleased but not surprised by Friday's 
ruling, said numerous studies have concluded that the Doppler radar system 
poses no threat to people or wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are absolutely no harmful effects to the people," Everett said. "This 
radar operates at 60,000 times less (radiation) than what it would take to have 
an effect on the environment or human tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are frightened for nothing," she said. "The threat's just not 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 In court Friday morning, Blum told Hatter that the National Weather Service 
should be required to perform an environmental assessment specifically for the 
Sulphur Mountain site. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials prepared a single analysis for the more than 150 towers 
being erected nationwide, issuing a finding that the radar systems cause no 
significant impacts and that specific studies were not needed for each site. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum also argued that the federal government failed to properly notify area 
landowners of its intent to locate the system near their neighborhood, and that 
new information related to the health effects of low-level radiation has been 
uncovered since the renovation project began. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can very easily say there is no significant impact sitting back in their 
offices in Washington or in the U.S. attorney's office," Blum said of the 
government analysts. "They're not going to be the chicken in the microwave." 
</P>
<P>
 The Doppler system will be in a test mode for weeks, until local workers can 
be trained to interpret the new data, said Jerry McDuffie, who runs the 
National Weather Service office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're behind on the testing from all the delays we've had," McDuffie said. 
"Chances are, sometime mid- to late-week we might get to the point where we can 
turn the transmitter on." 
</P>
<P>
 McDuffie said the tower would not be fully operational before September, at 
which time the existing system, in west Los Angeles, can be torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean we're not using the data," he said. "It just means the 
radar itself is not fully commissioned." 
</P>
<P>
 A small contingent of Ojai residents braved a lengthy and rain-slicked commute 
to attend the hearing in Los Angeles. Most were encouraged that Hatter seemed 
to side with them, but felt he was bound by existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge commented from the bench that he doesn't like what the government's 
done," said Dale Givner, an attorney and a member of the coalition. "It's just 
hard to change the law. But that's why we have the system. They (appellate 
judges) do have the power to say this project smells." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the Environmental Coalition of Ojai plan to file an 
appeal with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeal on Monday or Tuesday. The 
appellate judges could order the federal government to complete a specific 
environmental review for the Sulphur Mountain radar tower, which would prevent 
federal officials from turning on the microwave system next week as planned.

TWO YOUTHS ARRESTED IN SHOOTING OF STUDENTS; CRIME: ONE OF THE BOYS IS CHARGED 
WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER IN THE OFF-CAMPUS ATTACK THAT INJURED THREE WESTLAKE HIGH 
CLASSMATES.

<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's detectives arrested two Westlake High School students 
Friday for their roles in an after-school brawl that led to the shooting of 
three classmates the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy, believed to have fired the shots, was charged 
with attempted murder after deputies stopped his car at 3 p.m. because it 
resembled a car seen at the melee near North Ranch Park on Thursday, Sgt. David 
Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 17-year-old Thousand Oaks boy was arrested earlier Friday on suspicion 
of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that boy was one of two youths who were supposed to take part 
in a much-anticipated fistfight that had drawn a crowd of at least 30 Westlake 
High students to the park. But instead of taking part in a fistfight, the boy 
arrived with three carloads of friends, police said. Some, including the boy, 
attacked the crowd with sticks and bats, and at least one youth fired shots, 
investigators and witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they have not ruled out the possibility that there was more 
than one shooter, and they said there may be more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the suspects arrested Friday were booked into Ventura County Juvenile 
Hall. They were not identified because of their age. 
</P>
<P>
 Paige stopped short of labeling the attack, which left one youth hospitalized 
and two others with minor injuries, as racially or gang-motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp confirmed witnesses' reports that the 
assailants piled out of the three cars and announced, "We're the Asian Mafia" 
before attacking the crowd -- made up mostly of white football players and 
their friends -- with lumber, bats and at least one .25-caliber semiautomatic 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys arrested Friday are Asian Americans, Paige said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives broadened their search for the other assailants Friday morning into 
Los Angeles County, Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can safely say from preliminary information that these (youths) were not 
from Ventura County," Kemp said. Twelve to 15 officers are working on the case, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As detectives kept digging and Conejo Valley Unified School District officials 
solidified 3-week-old plans to study rising teen-age crime, one of the victims 
of Thursday's fracas remained hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 David Behling lay in a bed at Westlake Medical Center in stable condition, the 
base of his skull fractured by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He was still groggy from sedation one day after doctors removed the bullet 
from his neck, but he was expected to recover fully and be released within a 
day or two, said the boy's father, Dick Behling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle, it really is," Behling said. "He's very lucky, all things 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Behling said he has not had much time to talk with his son about the shooting, 
but he believes the teen-agers went to the park expecting to see nothing more 
than an old-fashioned, score-settling display of fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids out here are probably pretty naive," Behling said. "They still think 
they can have it out with their fists and it's settled, but it just isn't that 
way anymore. It's a hard lesson to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking only three days after a 14-year-old student was stabbed to death at a 
Simi Valley junior high school, Behling said youths and community leaders alike 
must wake up to the reality of teen-age violence. They should drill 
anti-violence messages into children at a young age, as the popular DARE 
program urges them to resist drug use, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who thinks that we live on an island is deluding themselves," Behling 
said. "Metal detectors and frisking kids isn't going to do it. . . . It might 
help, but it's going to take more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified School District Supt. Jerry Gross said school officials 
are not hiding their heads in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 The last 18 months have seen a rise in graffiti and gang-related attacks, 
though most have been away from school campuses, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not denying that we have an emerging problem with violence and gangs in 
this community," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Thursday's shootings, school officials had begun looking for gaps in 
campus security and drafting a wish list of improvements for the school board 
to consider in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are considering buying video cameras to beef up 
surveillance and cellular telephones to connect campus supervisors with help, 
Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're safe, but there is a feeling that we need to be ever-watchful," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Dolores Didio said community and school leaders must 
work together to establish a "zero tolerance" policy for gangs. She has become 
worried in recent years by the proliferation of graffiti and other signs of 
gang incursion into Thousand Oaks, Didio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustration is not knowing exactly what to do to put the skids on it 
before it becomes a major problem like it has in other communities," Didio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Bill Henry said he hopes school officials will not rush to 
act without having information about the incident. He pointed out that the 
shooting occurred off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that every problem is a school problem," Henry said. "Schools 
are parties to it, but I'm not sure every problem has schools as its 
derivation." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Simmons, the mother of the football player who was to take part in the 
fistfight, said Friday she has persuaded police to beef up patrols near her 
house because she fears retaliation against her son, Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Physically, he'll be fine," she said. "He's pretty upset, pretty scared, and 
he has a lot of guilt feelings. Of course, he feels like his actions hurt his 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the damage and fear arising from Thursday's violence, one of the 
victims said he and his friends will not be deterred from defending themselves 
if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake High junior Scott Smith, 16, treated for a shoulder wound after the 
shooting, said Curtis "was challenged. He'll fight when he's provoked." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two visited David Behling on Friday and were reassured to see him smile 
once or twice at their jokes, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave's a tough guy," Scott said. "He can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 If threatened, Scott said, he would risk his life again. Others were scared, 
"but I'm calm," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I knew I was going to get shot, I'd do it again in a second for my 
friends. So would Curtis," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials should not overreact by using metal detectors to screen for 
weapons, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school is safe, it's a good academic school," Scott said. "So in school, 
you're safe. But out of school, there's nothing much (adults) can do about it. 
If somebody wants to get a gun and start shooting, they'll do it."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI VALLEY; MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN STALKING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The defendant in the county's first felony stalking case entered a surprise 
plea of guilty just as his trial was getting under way, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Owen Edwards, 36, faces up to three years in state prison for stalking 
his former girlfriend of 13 years, an Ojai Valley woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards twice broke into the woman's home, ransacked her bedroom and shredded 
her lingerie, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lela Henke-Dobroth, supervisor of the prosecutor's Family 
Protection Unit, said Edwards still faces two counts of burglary. She said 
those matters will be determined next week in a non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
 His guilty plea came Thursday after the prosecutor handling the case, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Donna K. Gissing, had given her opening remarks and was preparing 
to introduce testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' attorney, Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson, has said his 
client was distraught over the breakup with his longtime girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards remains in the Ventura County Jail pending sentencing. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; UNISYS TO LAY OFF 110, CLOSE DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Unisys Corp. has announced it is laying off 110 employees who work in the 
company's Camarillo facility developing computer software and is shifting the 
division's 15 other employees to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The outgoing employees were given 60-day notices Wednesday in a consolidation 
move that will effectively close the company's Distributed Systems Division in 
Camarillo, said spokesman Joe Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 employees who also work in Camarillo in the company's Government 
Systems Group were not effected by the layoffs and transfers. "That's a 
separate group; that's not being touched," Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is part of an overall downsizing of the defense contractor's 
Camarillo plant that has been occurring over the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole company is undergoing a transformation, as is the whole industry," 
Barrett said. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CITY OKS 11% HIKE IN HOTEL BED TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council has approved an 11% increase in the city's hotel bed 
tax as part of a plan to subsidize the newly formed visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 By increasing the Transient Occupancy Tax from 9% to 10%, Oxnard will match 
the average bed tax charged by 35 Southern California cities, according to a 
survey by city staff.In Ventura County, bed taxes range from 7% in Santa Paula 
to 11.84% in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff this week predicted that the tax increase would boost the city's 
visitor revenues by $148,322, based on last year's revenues of $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The council waived the bed tax for hotel customers on official government 
business and for residents seeking temporary shelter after their homes are 
damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bed tax will revert to 9% in July, 1995, unless the City Council approves 
an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 New revenues are intended to help subsidize the new Greater Oxnard and Harbors 
Tourism Bureau, which the council agreed to assist last month. Since its old 
tourism bureau folded in 1991, the city has lost nearly $300,000 in bed tax 
revenue as the number of visitors to Oxnard has declined. PATRICK McCARTNEY

<P>
 Making his first appearance in adult court, a 16-year-old boy pleaded not 
guilty Friday to a charge that he fatally stabbed a Fillmore man last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Allan Steele set an April 25 trial for Armando Murillo of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo is being held in Juvenile Hall in lieu of $250,000 bail. He is charged 
with murder in the stabbing death of Rodolfo Molina Mora, 27. The victim died 
after an altercation in the 700 block of Blaine Street in Fillmore on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge ruled last month that Murillo should be tried as an adult. Prosecutors 
have argued that Murillo is incapable of being rehabilitated in the state's 
juvenile system. They say he has an extensive juvenile record and they say Mora 
died in a particularly violent way. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN GETS 21 YEARS FOR 4 FELONIES

<P>
 A judge sentenced a longtime county maintenance worker and convicted felon to 
21 years in state prison for, among other crimes, fatally stabbing a patron 
outside an Oxnard bar last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Rodriguez, 46, was given six years for the stabbing death of Raymond 
Caballero, 45, of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Allan L. Steele also gave the defendant five years each for three 
previous felony convictions on his record since the early 1970s -- a robbery, a 
murder and a shooting attack on an inhabited dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 21 years is appropriate," said Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez was originally charged with second-degree murder in the June 18 
stabbing of Caballero. But a Ventura County jury convicted him of the lesser 
charge because the killing occurred during a sudden argument, authorities said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; FLIERS TO BEGIN FILMING NATION FROM A 
GLIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crammed side by side in a 3-foot-wide cockpit, two Portuguese adventurers are 
scheduled to take off from the Santa Paula Airport today on a three-week trip 
to cross and recross America in a motorized glider. 
</P>
<P>
 Their mission is to film and photograph winter in America from the air for 
Portuguese television and one of their country's glossy monthly news magazines. 
They plan on flying over the Rockies and then following the entire length of 
the Mississippi, as well as taking a look at Yosemite and the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a dream come true for us," said Eduardo Albarran, wearing a blue 
jumpsuit decorated with the patches of the sponsors underwriting the trip. 
"We've been planning this since the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Albarran and his partner, Miguel Santana, is flying a newly developed 
motorized glider. The plane can take off without the air of a tow plane and 
regain altitude using the motor when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of a plastic material, the lightweight plane has a 50-foot wingspan and a 
super-efficient motor that runs on unleaded gasoline and burns only three 
gallons of fuel an hour -- when needed. On one recent 50-minute trip from 
Palmdale the team only used the motor for 12 minutes, Albarran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really a 'green' plane," said Albarran, referring to the glider's 
energy efficiency. "It's the plane of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Albarran risked ending the adventure before it began when he flew the glider 
to Santa Paula from Ontario, Canada, where it had been shipped. He took off 
from Canada just as the eastern United States was hit by record cold 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Albarran had to fly into Columbus, Ind., in the middle of a blizzard at night 
without navigational aids. A fuse had blown in the cockpit, so he had to read 
his instruments by match light as he radioed the town's airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy in the tower asked where I was and I didn't know," Albarran said. "I 
was flying about 250 feet above a road and he told me to follow it into town, 
then hang a right at the third stoplight. He got me to the airport OK." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first leg of their trip, the pair will fly first to San Jose to meet 
with Portuguese boosters, then fly across California and the western United 
States on their way to Florida. From Florida, they will fly back across the 
United States and eventually end their trip in Denver. SCOTT HADLY

 Los Robles Regional Medical Center has appointed four new members to its board 
of trustees, hospital officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of trustees is an advisory panel that sets direction for Los Robles, 
examines quality control issues and oversees the credentialing and 
qualifications of the hospital's medical staff, said Carol Freeman, vice 
president of planning and development. 
</P>
<P>
 The new trustees are Westlake City Councilman James Emmons, Los Robles 
neurosurgeon Robert E. Haynie, Los Robles radiologist Roselyn Richman, and D. 
Mark Weinberg, executive vice president for Blue Cross of California Co.'s 
Consumer Services Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are nominated by the hospital's medical staff, other trustees and by 
trustee and Hospital Administrator Robert Quist, who solicits recommendations 
from members of the community, Freeman said. The board then votes from among 
the nominations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are elected to three-year terms, Freeman said. The board has 15 
members, nine of whom are doctors, she said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: STATEWIDE FARMING CONFERENCE BEGINS

<P>
 Don Best, a Sacramento citrus and alfalfa farmer, had never set foot in 
Ventura County before Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 And his first steps on Somis dirt were not exactly auspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring a local compost heap with three dozen other participants in the 
California Farm Conference, Best sank ankle-deep in muck. A half-inch of rain 
had saturated the earth around the compost heap overnight, turning the dirt 
into quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've determined that this soil is a little more clay-based than 
ours," Best said with a grin, pointing at his mud-encrusted shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Joking aside, checking out Ventura County soil was important to several 
participants in the 11th annual conference, which began Friday with tours of 
local lemon groves and vegetable fields, produce stands and insectaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyzing the farming operations in other counties "always gives you new 
perspectives," said Randi Veerkamp, who runs a Christmas tree farm in the city 
of Grass Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 About 550 farmers, researchers and produce marketers from across the state 
converged in Ventura for the conference. They will spend the rest of the 
weekend in workshops on topics ranging from labor laws to agricultural ethics 
to plant nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also listen to a talk by former Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
during tonight's barbecue dinner and country line dance at the Doubletree Hotel 
in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 For many farmers, however, informal exchanges with other participants are more 
important -- and more informative -- than the big keynote speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be able to share ideas and stories with people who are up 
against the same kind of things you are," said Al Courchesne, a Brentwood 
farmer. "Sometimes a tiny piece of information you pick up at the conference 
makes a big difference when you get back home." STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTY'S MOBILE HOME DAMAGE IN QUAKE IS CALLED PREDICTABLE; SAFETY: HUNDREDS 
BOUNCED OFF JACKS BECAUSE THEY WERE ON UNSTABLE FOUNDATIONS AND IN AREAS KNOWN 
FOR GROUND FAILURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mobile homes in Ventura County received widespread damage in the Jan. 17 
earthquake -- destruction that some say was predictable because the homes were 
mounted on unstable foundations and located in areas where potential for ground 
failure was known. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the state nor local governments have laws requiring stronger 
foundations or disclosure to property buyers of possible ground problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile homes, those low-cost alternative homes popular with seniors on fixed 
incomes, bounced off their jacks by the hundreds in Ventura County, crashing to 
the ground and shattering the possessions and nerves of their mostly elderly 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley alone, 622 of the city's 849 mobile homes were severely 
damaged, many left with their triangular jacks poking through the floor like 
spikes, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Crest Mobile Home Village, 40 of the park's 41 coaches were shaken to 
the ground. Now, with partial reimbursement from insurance and some help from 
the federal government, many of the trailers are going back up on jacks, 
un-reinforced against the next big earthquake, Manager Curtis Atwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very senior park," he said. "Our average age here is between 76 to 
80 and they just don't have the money to pay for earthquake bracing." 
</P>
<P>
 Atwell is attaching braces to his own mobile home at a cost of about $2,000, 
he said. Others have received estimates of up to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation problems were compounded during the quake at parks in areas prone 
to liquefaction, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction occurs when a high ground-water table and fine-grain soil combine 
and shake underground like "a bowlful of sand," as one geologist described the 
phenomenon. That below-the-surface shaking often causes cracks and other ground 
failures that send mobile homes reeling and crashing, geologists and engineers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, the liquefaction zone follows the path of the Arroyo Simi, a 
usually dry river that curves through the south end of the city, the city's 
General Plan map shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mobile homes are the weakest type of building because they have very poor 
foundations," said Jean-Pierre Bardet,, professor of civil engineering at USC 
and a participant in a study on the effects of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they are very often located in areas where the soil is not very good. So 
you are putting poor construction on poor ground and the result is what we see 
in this quake." 
</P>
<P>
 Like flood zones, liquefaction zones are mapped in city and county general 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 When a house is subject to flooding during heavy rains, that fact must be 
disclosed to a potential home buyer. But that's not the case when a residence 
is in a liquefaction zone, said Jim Fisher, an engineering geologist for 
Ventura County Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said he plans to introduce an ordinance to the Board of Supervisors to 
require such disclosure in unincorporated county areas, and he urged city 
engineers to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities should require people to file a notice of geological hazard that would 
go along with the title report," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley hazard map shows that all five major parks in the city are 
within the liquefaction zone. Four of the five have a high potential for 
liquefaction, according to the map. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Trade Winds Mobile Home Park is in an area of moderate potential for 
liquefaction. At the park, which abuts the Arroyo Simi to the south, 40 out of 
the 100 mobile homes fell off their supports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the back part of our park that went down," said Manager Barbara 
Hancock. The back part is closest to the zone with the highest liquefaction 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Friendly Village Park of Simi, 189 of 221 mobile homes fell off their 
foundations, and the rest were damaged to a lesser extent, Manager June Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got more than 100 put back on their jacks," she said. "Some are putting 
on bracing and some aren't. We should have been told ahead of time we were in a 
zone like that." 
</P>
<P>
 At Susana Woods Prestige Mobile Home Park, 125 of the 139 coaches came off 
their jacks, Manager Alice Martens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the insurance will only pay to put them back the way they were, not for 
the bracing," Martens said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Simi Country Estates on Rory Lane, 161 of 274 mobile homes were severely 
damaged, but all of the mobile homes with bracing remained standing, Manager 
Cathy Pennington said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no local ordinances that regulate foundation requirements for mobile 
homes because that power rests with the state. And state inspectors are now 
allowing the repairable mobile homes to be put back up on jacks, with nothing 
but gravity to hold them steady. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kranhold, assistant director of the California Department of Housing and 
Community Development, said the very fact that many of the mobile home 
residents are on fixed incomes is the primary reason the state does not impose 
requirements for earthquake bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people choose mobile homes because it's one of the few types of 
housing that is still affordable in California," he said. "You take away the 
affordability factor once you start adding requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Kranhold said there has been discussion about creating legislation to require 
the bracing. "But even if there is legislation," he said, "it is highly 
unlikely that it would be retroactive" to include existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the next earthquake hits, county geologist Fisher said, the state 
should require mobile homes to have reinforcements to keep them on their 
mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of if we have another earthquake, it's when," he said. 
"That we know." Simi Valley Liquefaction Zones

CAMARILLO PLANNERS DELAY DECISION ON MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission on Friday delayed a decision on whether to 
approve a proposal for a 22-acre factory outlet mall west of the Ventura 
Freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners heard reports from city staff members and consultants Friday on 
how the project would increase traffic, generate noise and send more trash to 
the already overburdened Bailard Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, which had intended to have a decision on the project, decided 
to wait until its Feb. 15 meeting to consider approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really don't know if we'll approve it or not," Commissioner Walter Lusk 
said. "We need a lot more information before making a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Lusk said the information presented Friday was just an overview of the 
environmental effects of the project. The commission wants more information, 
specifically details on traffic congestion, before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 New traffic lights will have to be installed and freeway ramps improved for 
the project to be approved, city staff members said. A new signal at the Las 
Posas northbound off-ramp already is scheduled for construction this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the mall's developer, the Koll Leonard partnership, said 
they remained confident that the environmental concerns would be addressed and 
are hopeful that the project will go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to doing the project," said Steven Craig, president and chief 
operating officer of Chelsea GCA, one of the partners in the project. "We were 
the first people here and believe this project should go forward and will be a 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is approved, Craig anticipates that the mall would open in 
early 1995. He said the partnership has tenants lined up, but would not say how 
many there are or what businesses might move into the projected 70 stores.

JUDGE WON'T FREE BOY IN STABBING; VIOLENCE: LAWYER ASKS COURT TO CONSIDER 
'FRAGILITY OF THE 13-YEAR-OLD' IN SEEKING HIS RELEASE. ARRAIGNMENT IN CASE IS 
DELAYED UNTIL FEB. 18. 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura County judge on Friday refused to release a 13-year-old Simi Valley 
boy charged with fatally stabbing a Valley View Junior High School classmate. 
</P>
<P>
 As Phillip Hernandez made his first court appearance since his arrest Tuesday 
in the schoolyard slaying of Chad Patrick Hubbard, 14, Deputy Public Defender 
Donna Forry asked that he be released to the custody of his mother, Sandy 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Forry asked Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren to consider the "fragility 
of the 13-year-old," and noted that it was the first time Phillip Hernandez has 
been in trouble with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perren said he would follow the recommendation of a probation officer and 
Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison, who said the Hernandez boy should remain 
in custody because of the serious nature of the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lawyers debated, Phillip Hernandez, clad in blue Juvenile Hall garb, 
appeared calm and alert. He seemed to listen intently as he sat at the defense 
table, his face resting on his folded hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren granted Forry's request to postpone the boy's arraignment until Feb. 
18, when he will enter a plea to the murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Hernandez sat quietly in the gallery of the courtroom, comforted by the 
boy's uncle and another supporter. After the hearing, she declined to comment 
on her son's criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 Forry told the judge that Sandy Hernandez is unemployed. The boy's father did 
not attend the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Forry said she disagreed with the judge's decision not to 
release Phillip Hernandez into the mother's custody. "Whether he is charged 
with a serious offense or not, he should be at home," the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ellison described the weapon used in the 
attack as a folding knife with a three-inch blade. Witnesses have described 
Phillip Hernandez as a graffiti "tagger," but Ellison said he has no evidence 
to suggest that the boy is a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the victim have said the two boys had a running feud that escalated 
last week when Phillip Hernandez took Chad Hubbard's baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The killing brought an overflow crowd of about 350 people to a meeting 
Thursday at Sinaloa Junior High, where school officials and police officers 
described the stabbing as an isolated incident that was not gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Services for Chad Hubbard will be at 10 a.m. today at Simi Covenant Church, 
4680 Alamo St. A graveside service will follow at Assumption Cemetery, 1380 
Fitzgerald Road, Simi Valley.

<P>
 Walter J. Pray, a longtime local educator and a founding member of the St. 
Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center Board of Trustees, died Thursday. He 
was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Pray began his Orange County teaching career in 1946, providing instruction in 
American history and public speaking at Fullerton High School and Fullerton 
Junior College. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1953, he was named principal of the new La Habra High School and seven 
years later assumed the post of assistant superintendent for personnel at 
Fullerton Union High School and Junior College District. 
</P>
<P>
 When the North Orange County Community College District was formed in 1966 to 
serve the Anaheim, Cypress, Fullerton and Stanton areas, Pray was appointed 
vice chancellor for personnel and instruction at both Fullerton and Cypress 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 He retired from the college district in 1977 and became the vice president for 
community affairs at St. Jude Hospital, where he was a founding member of the 
hospital's governing and advisory boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of numerous local education and civic awards, Pray is survived by his 
wife, Barbara; his daughter, Pamela Wilson of Cornwall, Ct.; and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held at 10 a.m. Wednesday at St. Mary's Catholic 
Church in Fullerton. Burial will be at Loma Vista Memorial Park. A reception 
will follow at Cal State Fullerton's Titan Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions can be made to the Walter J. Pray Memorial Scholarship 
Foundation, North Orange County Community College District, 1000 N. Lemon St., 
Fullerton, 92632.

VENTURA CONSIDERS PROJECTS WORTH $122 MILLION; GOVERNMENT: A SEWAGE PLANT, 
WATER WELLS AND BIKE PATH LEAD THE CITY'S LIST OF 94 PROPOSED CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENT ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A new sewage treatment plant, water wells and a bike path between Ventura and 
the Ojai Valley Trail lead a $122-million list of capital improvement projects 
being considered by the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-year plan recommended by city staff members details 94 proposed 
projects that would improve or maintain the city's roads, water and sewer 
systems, and recreation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials emphasized that the proposed plan is not a wish list of 
projects. City Budget Director Mike Solomon said the $122 million is the 
"best-guess estimate" by city staff of future revenue sources and which 
facilities most need attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing in there is guaranteed," Solomon said. "But if things happen that 
change our revenue picture, if the economy gets worse, we'll make adjustments 
and change the plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next two months, the council will hold study sessions and public 
hearings on the capital improvement budget to decide which projects it wants to 
include in the plan, scheduled to be adopted before April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft was put together by city staff members based on the priorities of 
previous councils, which had adopted similar long-term capital improvement 
plans, Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council can come back and change the whole thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan calls for spending $46.1 million through 2000 on traffic 
mitigation programs and road improvements. Big-ticket items include $12.7 
million to build an expanded Ventura Freeway interchange at Johnson Drive, and 
$7.8 million for improving the freeway interchange at Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Other traffic and road projects include $250,000 for improvements of the Main 
Street northbound on- and off-ramps, and $500,000 to build a pedestrian 
overpass over the Santa Paula Freeway that would connect Camino Real Park to 
the Thille neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Water projects total about $38.5 million, most of which would go toward 
reservoir repairs and waterline replacement. About $1.2 million is earmarked 
for drilling two wells, and $5.2 million is set aside for major repairs to a 
reservoir built in 1939. Another $4.9 million would pay for replacing an aging 
reservoir at Grant Park with a 2-million-gallon steel tank. 
</P>
<P>
 About $28.5 million would be set aside for sewer and sanitation projects, 
including $8.9 million for a water treatment plant. Other projects include $1.2 
million for replacing old sewer lines and $3.5 million to replace or repair 
filters. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed plan also allocates $6.1 million for parks and recreation 
projects, including $1.8 million to construct the proposed 5.5-mile Ventura 
River bike trail, which would connect the 3.5-mile Omer Rains Trail along the 
Ventura coastline with the 9.5-mile Ojai Valley Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 About $1.7 million would be set aside for future park projects, and $495,000 
would be spent on replacing playground equipment at city parks. Rotting redwood 
fence posts in parks around the city would also be replaced with steel, costing 
about $151,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects include $3.9 million for repairs to three of the city's older 
fire stations and building a new fire station in east Ventura, $2.1 million for 
upgrading the computer system at City Hall and at the police and fire stations, 
and $1.5 million for landscaping, lighting and paving in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon said the council has historically made capital improvements a high 
financial priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start messing around with not taking care of your infrastructures, 
you'll pay double and triple in the long run," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to fund the proposed projects comes from a variety of sources. 
Sales, property and gas taxes, developer contributions, sewer and water fees, 
and state and federal grant money all contribute to the capital improvement 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fees and taxes can only be used for particular projects. For 
instance, money from residents' water bills goes toward water-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said the capital improvement budget forces council members to 
think about the city's long-term future, but, he said, from a short-term 
political view it is tempting to spend money on daily maintenance and 
operations instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maintaining services is more popular in the short term than putting money 
away for a rainy day," he said. "We have to plan beyond the term of the current 
council members and force the council to take a long view."

METROLINK STATION FUNDS GUARANTEED; TRANSIT: COUNTY AGREES TO FRONT 
$1.9-MILLION FIRST-YEAR COST FOR CAMARILLO SITE WHILE WAITING FOR EMERGENCY 
FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Guaranteeing Metrolink commuter rail service to Camarillo, the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission on Friday agreed to pick up the entire $1.9-million 
cost of building and running the station for a year if expected federal and 
state subsidies fall through. 
</P>
<P>
 With the station's Feb. 14 target opening date little more than a week away, 
commission Executive Director Ginger Gherardi reaffirmed the county's promise 
to extend commuter rail service to Camarillo on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident we can get this done," Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers to begin construction today of the platform and paved parking lot of 
the station planned for Lewis Road and Ventura Boulevard, Gherardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the county expects to receive about $1.3 million from FEMA and 
$500,000 from the California Office of Emergency Services to operate the 
Camarillo station for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for funds is part of a larger application being submitted by the 
Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority to set up a number of 
emergency Metrolink stations to help relieve traffic congestion on freeways 
damaged by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 quake, daily Metrolink ridership has surged from 8,100 to 
19,000 throughout its four-county region. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the demand, Metrolink has added four emergency stations in the 
Antelope Valley, bringing the total number of stations to 26. Another station 
is scheduled to open Monday at the Sylmar-San Fernando city line, Metrolink 
spokesman Brendan Shepherd said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state and federal emergency grants are approved, the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission will pay about $110,000, or 6.25% of the total cost 
of the Camarillo project, as required under federal emergency funding 
guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo is expected to pay about $10,000 to maintain the station 
during its yearlong emergency operation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state or federal aid falls through, the commission will make up the 
difference with federal transit dollars set aside for future bus service. The 
commission agreed to front the money to construct the Camarillo station out of 
the bus funds until the emergency aid is granted. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Vicky Howard, who is chairwoman of the Transportation 
Commission, said she is certain that the funding will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us are in the same boat, but we have to go on trust," Howard said. 
"We've been assured by the director of FEMA and the President himself that we 
will be reimbursed." 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Sherwood, a spokesman for FEMA's public assistance program, said funding 
for the Camarillo station is well on its way to being approved. "The Camarillo 
extension is in the works," Sherwood said. "It is being taken as seriously as 
any other emergency transit project." 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi told commissioners she already is planning a celebration on the 
morning of Feb. 14 to publicize the new, no-frills station. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo station plans call for a concrete platform, a paved 240-space 
parking lot, lights and a pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The train is scheduled to make two daily round-trip runs to Camarillo, leaving 
for Los Angeles at 5:44 a.m. and 6:35 a.m. and returning at 5:46 p.m. and 6:23 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, ridership on the Ventura County Line has jumped from 
1,000 to 3,000 passengers a day, said Mary Travis, manager of transit systems 
for the county's Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed to follow the lead of the Los Angeles Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority by allowing riders to use their February passes 
through the month of March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the disaster, people are thinking about new ways to travel," said 
Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, who is also a county transportation 
commissioner. "This gives us a chance to strike while the iron is hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday will consider running 
shuttle buses to the Camarillo and Moorpark Metrolink stations as a way to 
boost ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi said the commission should seize on the heightened interest in 
Metrolink to begin looking for ways to sustain the Camarillo station beyond the 
one year of emergency service. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nazir Lalani, transportation engineer for the city of Ventura, warned the 
commission that running Metrolink to Camarillo for more than a year could 
jeopardize local bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 "When FEMA (money) runs out we fear you will raid the cities' transit funds," 
Lalani told the commission. "You will either be faced with cutting the train or 
telling cities you are going to cut bus service." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the commission would closely monitor the use of funds to make sure 
local bus service is not sacrificed to keep the commuter trains running. "We 
have to be careful not to get into the position of trains versus buses," Howard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also agreed to continue seeking FEMA funds to extend Metrolink 
to Oxnard, but director Gherardi was skeptical of the plan. And, she 
discouraged the commission from advancing any money for an Oxnard station. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very strong possibility that you would not be reimbursed" if the 
county extended Metrolink to Oxnard, Gherardi said. "You would end up paying 
100% of the cost."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; AN EVER MORE INFLAMED LABOR FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westminster Fire Chief John T. DeMonaco Jr. went too far this week in 
suspending one of his captains, a firefighters union officer, for asserting 
that staffing cuts at a fire station might have contributed to a death in a 
Jan. 27 blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMonaco said the suspension of Mike Garrison was warranted because his 
statement was unsubstantiated. Contending that Garrison had acted 
unprofessionally, the chief said that firefighters who had been at the scene 
found the flames so intense no one could have survived, regardless of equipment 
or personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is complicated dramatically by the continuing battle between the 
firefighters union and the city. That faceoff has been poisoned by politics, 
recriminations and charges of wrongdoing that seem continually to escalate on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest dispute centers on a fire at a board-and-care home in which a 
mentally retarded man died. A day later, Garrison held a press conference to 
charge that the death had resulted from the mayor and the City Council putting 
politics above the safety of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council member retorted that the state fire marshal was still 
investigating the blaze and the union was merely fighting to hold on to money 
and power. The city official is one of three council members who, with the 
mayor, have been targeted for recall by supporters of the firefighters, angry 
that the council reduced the Fire Department budget last year. In the cutback, 
the station closest to the board-and-care home was stripped of one of its 
firetrucks and some of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges that politicians are jeopardizing public safety always touch a nerve. 
Because they generate such passion, they should not be leveled without clear 
supporting evidence. Garrison's contentions have been contradicted by other 
professionals, and his remarks indeed may have been ill-considered. But he is a 
19-year veteran who deserves to be heard, and the issue raised is a serious one 
worth discussing -- whatever the actual effort of the budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents of Westminster certainly should be able to sort out political 
posturing from legitimate safety questions. It's unlikely any city exposure to 
liability would be affected significantly by public contentions made in a 
volatile union dispute. Surely anyone bringing litigation against Westminster 
would seek supporting evidence anyway for any claim of negligence in emergency 
preparedness. The suspension appears mostly to be a punitive restriction on 
free speech.

TRADE EMBARGO LIFTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * While reading The Times on the lifting of the trade embargo on Vietnam and 
the reaction of the Vietnamese in Orange County (Feb. 4), suddenly an old 
memory came back to me. It was 1973.I went to a classmate's home to give 
condolences to her for a family funeral. Her parents were killed, execution 
style, by a group of Viet Cong.  
</P>
<P>
 When I read where some people, so-called respected businessmen and physicians, 
congratulated each other for the new opportunity and a legal chance to do 
business with the same people that committed this inhumane act, and many more, 
I was very upset. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand that the war is over and we all have to put it in the past. But I 
cannot comprehend that these very wealthy professionals are so happy and eager 
to work with a regime that has no moral standard and does not value human life. 
The same regime that caused them to leave their home, family and friends and 
risk their lives at sea as boat people. The same regime that is oppressing 
their countrymen, religious leaders and intellectuals. I guess a few bucks 
heals all wounds and goes a long way with morality too.

COUNTY CRITICIZED FOR MINORITY-HIRING RESULTS; JOBS: SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN 
MADE, BUT REPRESENTATION STILL LACKING IN MANAGEMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, 
REPORT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minorities have not made gains in filling top executive and law enforcement 
jobs in Ventura County government, despite the efforts the county has made to 
hire women and minorities since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the conclusion of a new five-year affirmative action plan, or score 
card on minority hiring, that the county Board of Supervisors will review 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is making some progress, but the problem is clearly that the 
number of minorities is not increasing as it should be," said Maria Diaz, the 
county's affirmative action officer who prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minorities are still being hired in the job categories they are traditionally 
hired in -- lower level, technical, clerical services and related positions," 
Diaz said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors will consider requiring each county 
department to prepare its own affirmative action plan as a way to increase the 
hiring of qualified minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report prepared by Diaz, the number of blacks, Asians and 
Pacific Islanders on the county's payroll of 6,324 employees now largely 
reflects their presence in the local economy. Overall, minorities now 
constitute 30.6% of the county government's work force -- up from 25% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos, despite a 4.4% increase in county hiring, still lag 2% behind their 
numbers in the civilian labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Women have made the greatest gains in county employment, Diaz reported. With 
57% of the jobs in county government, women are better represented on the 
county payroll than in Ventura County's civilian job market. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite a 5.3% gain by minorities in the county government's payroll since 
1986, the county has made little progress in increasing minority representation 
in management, law enforcement and technical services. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three of the 42 executive positions in Ventura County government are held 
by minorities -- the same number as in 1986 -- and minorities continue to be 
underrepresented in middle-management and supervisory positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities have also made little headway in landing public safety jobs in the 
district attorney's office, and sheriff's and fire departments. The county has 
failed to meet its minority hiring goals for attorneys, probation officers, 
sheriff's deputies, firefighters and supervisory positions in the sheriff's and 
fire departments, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Director Ron Komers attributed the slow gains to a combination of 
factors, including low turnover, personal preferences of job applicants and 
institutional barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some positions like executive jobs, fire and sheriff's positions have a very, 
very low turnover," Komers said. "It takes a long time for people in the field 
to work their way up through the ranks." 
</P>
<P>
 Another difficulty in hiring minorities for top-level positions is the general 
scarcity of qualified applicants, who can easily earn more by remaining in 
private industry, Komers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases such as the airport administrator position we are looking to 
fill, the pool of people knowledgeable about county government is quite small 
and those people are in high demand in both the public and private sector," 
Komers said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Komers said the shortage of qualified applicants only serves to emphasize 
the county's need to train and promote its own employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply saying there are not enough qualified minority and women candidates 
cannot be a perennial excuse," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has met its minority hiring goals in 19 of the 36 job categories 
studied in the affirmative action report, an improvement over 1986 when the 
county met its goals in just 11 of the categories. Each category of employment 
has its own goal for minority hiring based on the proportion of minorities 
working in that field in the civilian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hiring pattern remains similar to the past. Minorities currently 
comprise at least 40% of the county government's unskilled maintenance workers, 
social work assistants, clerical assistants, court assistants and computer 
operators. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, fewer than 10% of the county's top executives, librarians, 
attorneys and fire supervisors are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 To focus attention on minority hiring, the supervisors will consider requiring 
each department to adopt an affirmative action plan to help achieve its 
minority hiring goals. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also consider authorizing the county's affirmative action officer to 
review all new hirings for executive and other positions where minorities are 
significantly underrepresented. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative officer, said the 
affirmative action plan will help the county meet its minority hiring goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is committed to the concept of equal employment and making sure we 
have the best possible person for each job," Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have we been perfect? No," he said. "But it's important to have a score card 
so you know where you stand." Women and Minorities in Ventura County Government

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MORE RAIN FORECAST FOR COUNTY TODAY 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County residents hoping to enjoy a weekend respite from rain should 
get out and enjoy the partly cloudy morning today, because the precipitation is 
forecast to start up again by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Between noon Thursday and Friday, coastal areas in Ventura County received up 
to three-quarters of an inch of rain, while the foothills were drenched with an 
inch from the storm, said National Weather Service meteorologist Bruce 
Entwistle. 
</P>
<P>
 And the latest rain, which could continue through Monday, is expected to bring 
colder temperatures, he said. Daytime highs could be in the 50s, and lows could 
fall to the lower 30s Sunday and Monday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be downright nippy for these parts," Entwistle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain totals for the season remained low despite the steady rain, Entwistle 
said. "Anything helps, but we're still behind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rain combined with high winds to create problems for fishermen on three 
vessels, which became disabled or ran aground off Santa Cruz Island. The U.S. 
Coast Guard rescued seven fishermen from the boats. Two of the men were treated 
for hypothermia at Goleta Hospital in Santa Barbara. County Rainfall

Broadcasting Network of Virginia Beach, Va., who co-produced a television 
program called "What Are You Living For?" which was shown in the former Soviet 
Union. Many of the youths became Christians after viewing the program, then 
enrolled in a Bible correspondence course offered through CBN's office in Kiev.

 Hebert had just shut out the Vancouver Canucks, 3-0, in front of a sellout 
crowd of 17,174 at Anaheim Arena for the third shutout of his career, his 
second this season -- and the Ducks' first at home. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was one game when there weren't enough pucks to go around. Hebert 
only had to make 22 saves, and spent much of the game watching from afar as the 
Ducks played conservative offense with the lead and clogged the neutral zone at 
every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my favorite spot to be in, when the puck's in the other zone," Hebert 
said. "This was great for our fans. We've had a tough time at home, and haven't 
had the results we wanted. But tonight everyone was blocking shots and the 
forwards were coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Ducks into sole possession of third place in the Pacific 
Division and the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 They also broke a three-game winning streak by the Canucks, second in the 
division and eight points ahead of the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just a good, old-fashioned whupping," Vancouver Coach Pat Quinn 
said. "They beat us to the puck all night. I don't care if on paper we have 
more talent, you're not going to win if the other team wants it more and plays 
harder." 
</P>
<P>
 All the talent of Pavel Bure and Jimmy Carson couldn't buy the Canucks a goal 
Friday. It was the first time the Canucks have been shut out this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert, 9-5-2 in last 16 decisions, had to make 38 saves on Dec. 15 in a 1-0 
victory over Toronto at Maple Leaf Gardens to record the Ducks' first shutout. 
Ron Tugnutt also had to make 38 when he shut out the New York Islanders, 3-0, 
on Dec. 28 at Nassau Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 This was easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Guy had a couple of point blank saves. We expect that from our 
goalies," Terry Yake said. "For the most part, I think it was one of his easier 
shutouts, but you'd have to ask him. It's a big deal for all of us, not just 
Guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Van Allen scored the only goal the Ducks needed at 4:32 of the first 
period with the Ducks short-handed. Van Allen scored when he took the puck off 
the boards and carried it to the left circle. His slap shot seemed to glance 
off goalie Kay Whitmore's left pad before finding the net. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first period, the Ducks led, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoli Semenov, who returned recently from a seven-week layoff with a 
dislocated left elbow and had sat out the last two games because of lingering 
soreness, scored the Ducks' second goal on a pass from Tim Sweeney at 15:26. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney held the puck in the right circle and faked a shot as Semenov cut to 
the net, then passed across the slot to Semenov, who scored from just in front 
of the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 Down two goals, the Canucks tried to counter with aggressive forechecking. And 
with the Ducks trying to clog the neutral zone, the result was mostly a game 
that seemed to go nowhere, and a scoreless second period. 
</P>
<P>
 That was fine with the Ducks, but their two-goal lead was too tenuous for them 
to relax until late in the third, when Bob Corkum's goal at 16:04 made it 3-0. 
Corkum's goal, his 18th, came off assists from Garry Valk and Sean Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous going into the third," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. 
"We've been in that situation before, and other times we've given up a quick 
goal and they've been right back in it." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Bill Houlder, the team's third-leading scorer, was scratched for 
the first time this season. The move came one game after his most recent 
defensive blunder, when his bad pass in the defensive zone led to the 
tie-breaking goal in a loss Wednesday to Calgary. "Billy's play has dropped off 
a little bit," Coach Ron Wilson said. "It's an cheap way to get a message to 
him."

FALSE START; UCLA'S TAYLOR BATTLES INJURIES, VIES FOR STARTING ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Taylor left Huntington Beach for UCLA in the fall of 1991 with just about 
every accolade a high school volleyball player could receive. 
</P>
<P>
 His resume included honors such as Volleyball Monthly All-American, Orange 
County player of the year and All-Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the Sunset League's MVP for a year in which the league produced nearly 
a half-dozen Division I college players. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed a scholarship to UCLA on the night he was named MVP of the Orange 
County high school all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 So with the way things had been going, Taylor figured success with the Bruins 
would be only an arm swing away. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the back problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the redshirt year, the long practices and little playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a shock to go from the limelight to being such a scrub," he said. 
"It doesn't matter how good you were before in high school. Nobody cares about 
that here. All they want to know is what you can do for the team here." 
</P>
<P>
 A wake-up call, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he said. "It definitely was." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to end the story there, but Taylor hasn't written off his 
college career. He's healthy again and has three seasons of eligibility left 
after earning an NCAA championship ring last season. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's challenging for a starting role with the top-ranked Bruins (5-1), who 
play host to 10th-ranked UC Santa Barbara tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a sophomore, opened the season in the starting lineup in place of an 
injured Kevin Wong. But after Wong recovered from an ankle injury, he replaced 
Taylor as the starting left-side hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Battling for playing time is something new to Taylor, a three-year starter at 
Huntington Beach High. But at UCLA, competition to reach the main court in 
practice can send even the best high school players packing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the injuries and setbacks, Taylor stuck around Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 As a redshirt freshman last season, he earned a varsity letter by hitting .375 
while coming off the bench in nine matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was nerve-racking because there was so much pressure," said Taylor, 
a 6-foot-4 outside hitter. "This year, I feel like I'm going out to play, 
rather than to not screw up. I'm a lot more confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries took away any hopes Taylor had for an easy transition into college. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin Coach Al Scates had Taylor sit out his freshman season to lift weights 
and practice. But Taylor could do little of either because of the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a regular in the trainer's room with inflammation in his knee. He 
missed the first two months of the season, including some valuable conditioning 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such an intense pain every time I bent my knee," he said. "I could 
walk on it, but I could never jog or lift weights with my legs." 
</P>
<P>
 After the swelling subsided, Taylor returned to practice, but two or three 
weeks into workouts, his back started hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 "My back muscles were weak and not comparable to the rest of my body," he 
said. "The trainers put me on a new weight program to strengthen my back. They 
made me get away from the bench press and other upper-body lifts." 
</P>
<P>
 The back problems kept Taylor from working out the rest of the spring or 
summer. It was the first time in several years he spent a substantial amount of 
time away from the volleyball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so weird," he said, "that after a hard-core year of high school 
volleyball, I wound up having to take so much time off. The redshirt year is so 
vital for lifting and getting stronger, and I wasn't getting that done, 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor returned for the 1993 season out of shape but determined to make it on 
a talent-rich team that had an excellent shot at winning the national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just made up my mind that I wasn't going to hold back anything," he said. 
"I really worked hard. Eventually, I got to play on the first court. That was 
the best thing that could happen to me. I was hitting against the six-best guys 
in the nation, the best block." 
</P>
<P>
 It was there that Taylor really learned the college game. In high school, he 
could overpower blockers. Not so in college, where players are bigger and 
stronger, and blocks are as sturdy as concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 "College teams will take that away from you," he said. "Rarely is it there. 
You have to learn how to read a block, to respect it. You have to know who 
you're hitting against, know their tendencies. There's a lot more scouting in 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Little by little, Taylor is beginning to piece together a college career. He 
isn't as dominant as he was in high school, but Scates thinks Taylor could 
develop into a fine college player with a little more work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt is a great all-around player," Scates said. "I know he can block more 
consistently. His ball-handling is very good, and he does everything else well. 
That's the kind of player who will do well out on the beach some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like his scoring ability, and he has an attacking attitude when he swings 
at the ball. If he could just jump a little higher on his block, he would push 
Kevin for the starting position. But the way he's going, I really think he has 
a chance to start for us on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 And that couldn't come any soon enough for Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to go from playing four years in a row in high school and playing 
every match," he said, "to coming here and accepting your role as a backup 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just to be out on the court now is a crazy feeling."

MUSIC REVIEW; KLAS REVEALS A PRIMITIVE PART; THE LOS ANGELES PHILHARMONIC 
BELATEDLY OFFERS THE WEST COAST PREMIERE OF ARVO PART'S 1964 FIRST SYMPHONY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic mustered a belated West Coast premiere on 
Thursday, introducing a now-typically sparse subscription audience at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion to a little symphony written back in 1964 by the now 
suddenly fashionable Arvo Part. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, this was a ponderous and dull concert in the hands of Eri Klas, a 
guest-routinier from Estonia previously engaged here for Hollywood Bowl outings 
and a UCLA run-out. Although the program also included some major Mahler and 
Dvorak, the Part part was easily the most interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Symphony No. 1, subtitled "Polyphonic," doesn't dabble in any of the 
mystical-minimalist mumbo-jumbo that has placed Part in company with 
Henryk-Mikolaj Gorecki as a pop-chart flavor-purveyor of the month. This is a 
souvenir of an earlier, less innocent era -- an era in which the Estonian 
composer was still influenced by Schoenberg's serialism and Stravinsky's 
austerity. 
</P>
<P>
 It would stretch credibility to call the 15-minute, two-movement opus 
strikingly original. It is striking, however, in its brash rhythmic gestures, 
its bold dissonances, its grating textures and wispy melodic juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
 While Part -- then 29 and cloistered behind an iron curtain -- may have wanted 
to sound wild, his sense of order invariably made him sound mild. Everything in 
his compact symphony is neat, logically resolved. Musical t 's are crossed, i 
's dotted, shocks avoided. The technique is terrific, but the primitivism 
remains predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Klas bumped and thumped his way through his countryman's music, his apparent 
enthusiasm tempered, one assumes, with stylistic authority. Still, one can 
imagine a subtler interpretation at one extreme, or a more passionate one at 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The conductor ended the evening with a rather thick and rough performance of 
Dvorak's "New World" Symphony and was rewarded with the usual push-button 
bravos. The Philharmonic can ride this warhorse to victory in its sleep, and 
sometimes appears to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece involved the heartbreaking sentiment of Mahler's "Lieder eines 
fahrenden Gesellen." The wayfarer's songs could have broken few hearts on this 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Klas concentrated on loud, fast and mushy generalities, instantly reducing the 
poetry to prose. In the process, he neither set proper moods nor provided ideal 
tempos for his conscientious soloist, Florence Quivar. 
</P>
<P>
 The mezzo-soprano sang with her customary warmth and opulence but brought 
little dynamic variety -- much less tragic introspection -- to the intimate 
texts. She might as well have been delivering arias. 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful contribution to this rather unsuccessful event came from 
Steven Johnson of Brigham Young University, who contributed scholarly yet 
perfectly accessible program notes. Something is dangerously wrong at the 
Philharmonic when the reading is more rewarding than the listening.

QUIRKY DIRECTOR, QUIRKY DETOUR; MOVIES: BRITISH DIRECTOR ALEX COX IS GOING 
AGAINST THE GRAIN WITH 'HIGHWAY PATROLMAN,' HIS FILM ON POLICE CORRUPTION IN 
MEXICO. FOR ONE THING, IT'S IN SPANISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEILA COBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk about playing against type. Alex Cox, the iconoclastic British director 
best known for the funky, surreal "Repo Man" and the gloriously gritty punk 
bio-pic "Sid and Nancy," has just released his latest feature: a movie filmed 
in Mexico, starring Mexican actors, using a Mexican crew, on a subject with a 
specific Mexican bent (police corruption) -- and totally in Spanish, with 
English subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox's "Highway Patrolman" ("El Patrullero"), which opened Friday, is the story 
of rookie officer Pedro Rojas (Roberto Sosa), who sheds his youthful naivete as 
a fresh cadet stationed in rural northern Mexico, slowly transforming into a 
smooth operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The leap from quirky British films to a quirky Mexican film is one that makes 
perfect sense to the 39-year-old Cox, who actually had his first taste of 
directing in Mexico with 1987's "Walker," starring Ed Harris, Pedro Armendariz 
Jr. and Alfonso Arau (who went on to direct "Like Water for Chocolate"). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go back to Mexico to make another film," said Cox in an interview 
in his Culver City office, peppering his sentences with Spanish. He remembered 
a conversation with his friend Arau several years ago. Arau wanted Cox to work 
on a sequel to his low-budget first film, "Mojado Power." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cox had other things in mind. "I said, 'Listen, I will do the film, but 
you gotta make it in Spanish, really make it like a Mexican film, not like 
something for an American market.' And Alfonso said: 'Alex, you're crazy, 
because no one is going to see a film in Spanish.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Arau, of course, never imagined the enormous success of his own "Like Water," 
filmed in 1991 just months after Cox went to Mexico to do his cop movie. 
</P>
<P>
 It never occurred to Cox that "Patrolman" could be in any language but 
Spanish. "I thought it was more correct," he explained. Cox didn't want to 
repeat what he saw as the mistake of director Luis Mandoki's 1987 "Gaby: A True 
Story," based on the life of a Mexican paraplegic woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a good film, but they did it in English," he said. "And it 
seemed like, oh, man, like a traicion -- a betrayal -- to do a Mexican story in 
English."  
</P>
<P>
 Cox, who is fluent in Spanish, is married to a Peruvian and traces his 
interest in Latin America back to his UCLA Film School days. There he teamed up 
with Peruvian scriptwriter-producer Lorenzo O'Brien, who had grown up in 
Mexico. O'Brien is "Patrolman's" screenwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Highway Patrolman's" protagonist emerged after O'Brien interviewed a series 
of real Mexican patrolmen. Instead of a typical hunky hero, Pedro is thin, 
nondescript, always looking for a bad guy to prove himself against. In other 
words, he is painfully real, trying to make the right choices and not always 
succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro's human flaws are apparent at every turn: He removes his wedding ring 
when sleeping with his mistress, although she knows full well he's married. He 
hesitantly accepts his first bribe, then uses the money to placate his wife's 
anger at his infidelities. And standing at death's gate, he's visited by the 
spirit of his father -- something that would never happen in an 
English-language film, Cox said, because "English cop films don't have ghosts 
in them."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the controversial story wouldn't exactly have been choice subject matter 
for Mexican directors either. "The most important thing was to be able to talk 
about a reality that we see (in Mexico) every day: corruption and abuse of 
power," said Sosa, 23, who won the best actor award at Spain's San Sebastian 
Film Festival in 1992 for his portrayal of Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for his role, Sosa trained at Mexico's Transit Police Academy. The 
country's Federal Highway Police refused to allow the actors to train on their 
premises, wear their uniforms or use their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police corruption is a taboo topic, something no one wants to talk about," 
said Sosa, who lives and acts in Mexico City. "And to have a director from 
outside doing such a film is very important, because a foreigner is showing 
interest in something that concerns us." 
</P>
<P>
 That interest has earned Cox what may be the ultimate compliment from Mexican 
moviegoers, who seem to agree that the film has a definite Mexican look and 
outlook. (The film opened in Mexico last April.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, whose last directorial effort was "Walker," considers "Patrolman" to be 
the strongest visually of all his movies -- a result of the close collaboration 
between cameraman Miguel Garzon and production designer Cecilia Montiel, who 
convened before every single shot.  
</P>
<P>
 Garzon's hand-held camera is what ultimately makes "Patrolman" a departure 
from Cox's other movies.  
</P>
<P>
 "What I managed to do was develop a style," Cox said. "It's not a film that 
depends on master shots, long shots or close-ups. It exists in real time." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the movie's most powerful example of the use of real time occurs when 
Pedro's car breaks down on his way to help his partner Anibal, and the camera 
stays with him as he painstakingly limps up an interminable hill. The camera 
doesn't cut even when he arrives at Anibal's car, but instead keeps following 
Pedro for several yards till he finally finds his partner's body. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Pedro's appeal, Cox and O'Brien are already talking about making 
the logical sequel featuring Pedro, "El Politico" ("The Politician"). 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the duo is working on their next project, Ian McKellen's 
"Richard III," to be filmed in England -- in English -- with Richard Harris, 
Anjelica Huston, Jeanne Moreau and Malcolm McDowell. Shooting is scheduled to 
begin this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still waiting to hear from the money people," said Cox, shrugging. "If 
it doesn't go quickly, we'll just go back to Mexico."

RICK DU BROW: GAY WORLD IS TV'S NEW FRONTIER; TELEVISION: MARVIN SCHWAM 
PROMOTES HIS IDEAS FOR A NATIONAL, 24-HOUR GAY NETWORK: 'I WANT TO STOP MAKING 
GAY A SENSATIONAL TERM.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What I'm looking to do," says Marvin Schwam, a 51-year-old New York 
businessman, "is introduce an awareness of gay television." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwam is the founder and executive producer of the Manhattan-based Gay 
Entertainment Television network, whose three weekly shows -- "Party Talk," 
"Inside/Out" and "Makostyle" -- now appear on cable outlets in five major 
cities: Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the three shows form a 2 1/2-hour programming block that airs 
Saturday nights at 9:30 on Century Cable (Channels 55 or 10, depending on the 
area served by the system). Century Cable also airs a gay program block Sunday 
nights from another fledgling, Manhattan-based organization called Total 
Entertainment Television. 
</P>
<P>
 With predictions of 500 channels or more in TV's expanding universe, Schwam 
sees room for new ventures such as his GET network. He already has landed 
several major sponsors, including Miller Lite Beer, as well as guests ranging 
from the Rev. Jesse Jackson to Cybill Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 With "five more programs right now on the drawing board," Schwam envisions a 
national, 24-hour gay entertainment TV network and hopes to land some of his 
programs in syndication this year. Just last week, in fact, he attended the 
annual deal-making convention of the National Assn. of Television Program 
Executives in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing thing was how well we were received," says Schwam, who came out 
of the closet at age 33. "For the most part, many people who see your name, Gay 
Entertainment, don't want to talk to you. But we expected that. We're not going 
to convince everyone overnight that this is a subject for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're getting very little resistance from cable companies we've 
approached. Gay TV is a new frontier in this country, considering the size of 
the gay population and its spending power. I think it's as interesting for 
straight society to get a look at a world they haven't been exposed to. I want 
to stop making gay a sensational term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have 25 follow-ups from the convention. Japanese and Dutch TV and a 
Swiss-German company are interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Openly gay and lesbian themes and characters are hardly new items on TV. 
Network series such as "Roseanne," "Sisters," "Melrose Place," "Seinfeld" and 
"Law & Order" have been prominent in this area, despite the continuing 
nervousness of many advertisers about the subject -- as highlighted by a 
controversial "thirtysomething" episode several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Public television has an occasional half-hour, gay-themed magazine series, "In 
the Life," which next shows up on KCET-TV Channel 28 at midnight Feb. 20. The 
freak-out national afternoon talk shows parade gay and lesbian matters 
periodically, invariably in a sensational manner. And several gay cable 
networks have bid for recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the subject isn't new for TV, Schwam is convinced his approach is: 
</P>
<P>
 "Each week, we show faces who are proud to be out (of the closet) and 
sophisticated gay people, not the way it's been until now -- all politics and 
activism. We give cabaret acts and artists a venue. If you watch Geraldo or 
Oprah, it's sensationalistic. But we're talking about subjects that are part of 
our life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to encourage other producers to put gay programming on TV. There's 
lots of gay trash on the air, absolutely. In a way it hurts us but in a way it 
helps us because gay people are able to tell the difference. What I'm trying to 
do is elevate the quality. The gay audience is interested in every aspect of 
our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, two of GET's series -- "Makostyle," a fashion, style and celebrity 
show, and "Inside/Out," a talk program addressing gay and lesbian issues -- 
need plenty of work and smoothing out. "They are definitely going to improve," 
Schwam says, without denying the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Party Talk," an hour variety-talk series "with reports on trends, 
personalities and places," is GET's prime showcase -- a cut above the others 
and hosted by Brad Lamm, a 26-year-old former UCLA student who dropped out, and 
drag queen Linda Simpson. A New York newspaper calls them "the Regis and Kathie 
Lee of the cable-access world." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's getting rich from GET, so Lamm says that in addition to promoting 
dance parties and writing a gossip column for a gay and lesbian magazine, "I 
still bar tend one night a week to pay my bills." His show, he says, "at first 
was clunky, but now it's less clunky and funnier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're showing some people what they don't want to know and others what they 
already know. But we're not sensational or outrageous. My own personal ambition 
is that I'll be viewed as someone who hosts a darn good show and is a good 
representative of the gay community." 
</P>
<P>
 For Schwam, it's a sad matter that shows like "In the Life" and Gay 
Entertainment Television have to be presented as "something unique in our 
society and advertised as gay programs. I want someday for my programming not 
to be identified as gay programming but just be part of the available 
information the public has access to." 
</P>
<P>
 He accepts the gay program label now because "it's our only way in, since 
everyone's avoiding it, thinking it's a pariah. We're showing it's interesting. 
There are many black shows on TV, but they're not advertised as black sitcoms. 
That used to be a sensation, but no more. That's the way our programming should 
be -- just stand by itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homophobia exists out of ignorance. That's why networks separate gay subjects 
from the rest of programming. Why does it have to be singled out? Why is it 
startling that there's a lesbian character on 'Roseanne'?" 
</P>
<P>
 Schwam, who lives and works in a converted factory loft in Lower Manhattan, is 
proud of the support from his two sons, 25 and 26 years old -- products of his 
former marriage -- "who are both straight but are rah-rah because their father 
has the guts to do this." His older son, Frederic, runs the Christmas 
decoration business that Schwam started. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATPE convention experience was also special, says Schwam: "Not that I've 
ever hidden it for the last 20 years, but this is the first time I was 
identifying myself as a gay businessman because it has a significance, a sense 
of dignity and self-worth."

POP BEAT: DOES RUSH STILL HAVE IT? YES, NO; SURE, THE CANADIAN POWER TRIO HAS 
ENOUGH FANS TO FILL THE FORUM, BUT MUSICALLY THE GROUP'S ON CRUISE CONTROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether you like Rush or not, you've got to give the band's members their due. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys are -- let's face it -- slouching toward codgerhood. They started 
out in the early '70s, 19 albums ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bands that began in the early '70s never even made it to the mid-'70s. 
Yet lead singer-bassist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson and drummer Neil 
Peart are not only still going strong but they can still fill the Forum -- as 
they did Thursday. That's quite a feat for old-timers playing straight hard 
rock in a rock world that long ago shifted to grunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to Rush's credit: The show was not an exercise in nostalgia. It was built 
around the music from the group's album "Counterparts," which came out last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But is this Canadian power trio (which performs again tonight at Anaheim Arena 
and Monday at the San Diego Sports Arena) still any good in concert? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes and no. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, if you're talking pure entertainment. The audience was clearly having a 
grand time, cheering wildly after every song and begging for encores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the answer was no -- if you're talking about being enraptured musically. 
</P>
<P>
 A large part of what the audience was responding to was the special-effects 
sideshow that accompanied the music. These musicians are smart enough to know 
they can't captivate a crowd for a couple of hours anymore with their music 
alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Just about every song was bolstered by a gimmick -- fire, explosions, 
intriguing film projections and, most spectacular of all, a giant mock-up of a 
hunter shooting a giant mock-up of a rabbit. Sometimes you were so consumed 
with the gimmicks -- or anticipating the next one -- that the three guys 
playing music seemed like an afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, though, Rush didn't generate that kind of excitement, except for 
Peart's drum solo -- which was showboating at its best. If your sensibilities 
have at all been affected by today's quirky, angry, Angst -ridden rock, it's 
hard to take this band seriously.  
</P>
<P>
 Even trying to deal with Rush on its own terms, it comes up short. Others from 
the band's generation -- Aerosmith, Robert Plant, Rod Stewart, even the Stones 
-- rock harder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days Rush was, in concert at least, an explosive power-rock trio. 
But it was never in the upper echelon of rock bands, partly because these guys 
never learned how to write memorable songs. Still, you could always count on a 
Rush concert for powerhouse, no-frills rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The material from the "Counterparts" album is tame and somewhat pretentious. 
And Rush's melodic, straight-ahead style simply doesn't knock your socks off. 
</P>
<P>
 And spontaneity? It's not part of the Rush vocabulary. This is contained, 
structured music. Even during supposedly improvised jams, every note seemed 
thoroughly rehearsed. That sense of freedom and hint of rebelliousness and 
danger that underlies the best rock is sorely missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem was Lee. Is there a more uncharismatic lead singer on the 
planet? His shrill, squeaky vocals drained the life out of some of Peart's 
lyrics. And as a showman, Lee's a dedicated minimalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush was annoyingly business-like on stage. There was little humor and hardly 
any between-songs patter. It's easier to have fun at a concert if you feel the 
performers are having fun too. You never got that feeling from Rush.

allowing no other productions, whatsoever. That's turned out to be bad news for 
a group of students at St. Aloysius Junior School in London. After practicing 
since last October for their version of "Oliver!" they were ordered to stop by 
Mackintosh's production company, which invoked a law forbidding London area 
schools from performing plays that can be seen in the West End theater 
district. Despite complaints from parents, a Mackintosh spokesman held firm: 
"If 60 or 70 schools did it, then the number of parents who might not come to 
our production could be quite large." MUSIC

ENGLAND TO TRY TO HALT MAXWELL MUSICAL; LAW: INJUNCTION WILL BE SOUGHT DUE TO 
FAIRNESS CONCERNS IN THE UPCOMING TRIAL OF THE LATE MEDIA BARON'S SONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KAYE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The attorney general of England will apply for an injunction Monday to stop 
the opening of a stage musical in London's West End theater district about the 
late press baron Robert Maxwell because of fears that the show will prejudice 
the forthcoming criminal trial of Maxwell's sons, Kevin and Ian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maxwell: The Musical Review," starring British actor John Savident in the 
title role, features 14 Gilbert and Sullivan songs set to new lyrics, and is 
being produced by Evan Steadman, a former Maxwell employee who says he is using 
money he made from Maxwell to finance the satirical work. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadman has previously backed musicals, including a London production of "Me 
and My Girl." He said he will fight the injunction and continue with plans to 
begin previews Feb. 11, with the show's opening scheduled for Feb. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell's sons have pleaded not guilty to an assortment of fraud charges 
related to the running of their father's business empire, which included the 
Mirror Group newspapers in Great Britain, the Daily News in New York, the 
Macmillan publishing house, newspapers in Eastern Europe and Africa and British 
soccer teams. 
</P>
<P>
 After Robert Maxwell fell from his yacht and drowned in November, 1991, it was 
discovered that he had illegally removed about $600 million in Mirror Group 
pension funds as part of a massive shell game to prop up the heavily indebted 
private side of his business holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 No trial date has been set for the Maxwell brothers and four other defendants 
charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general's office and lawyers acting for Kevin Maxwell both 
declined to comment about the move to stop the musical, which is believed to be 
the first case of its kind in Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Steadman, who says he has invested $1.65 million in the show, said he had been 
notified by Kevin Maxwell's lawyers last September that they were considering 
seeking an injunction, but he says he had not heard anything else about it 
until the attorney general's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer says he dreamed up the idea for the show while working for 
Maxwell and observing firsthand the tycoon's corporate universe of bullying and 
paranoia. Steadman sold his communications companies to Maxwell five years ago 
for nearly $25 million and became chairman of the Maxwell Business 
Communications Group. After arriving in Maxwell's Byzantine empire, Steadman 
recalls, he thought to himself, "This is comic opera." Updated Gilbert and 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 He immediately jotted down a bit of lyric: "I am the very model of a modern 
megalomaniac." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 85% lampoon and 15% deadly serious," says Steadman, sitting in a church 
basement where the cast is rehearsing. But, despite the mirth, he says, 
audiences will find the show disturbing. "As it ends, they are going to be very 
angry." 
</P>
<P>
 The show moves through various stages of Maxwell's life and career, each 
designed to reveal the inner workings of the larger-than-life character. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Jan Ludvik Hoch to a poor Jewish family in Czechoslovakia, Maxwell lost 
most of his family in the Holocaust and wound up a decorated captain in the 
British forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical "starts with our discovery of Maxwell as a commissioned officer," 
says Steadman. "But, really, that's a device to show that he changed his name 
six times before becoming Robert Maxwell." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Maxwell's tragic beginnings, Steadman says there can be no sympathy 
for him. "Sympathy has nothing to do with it," he says. "He made his own 
decisions, and they were anti-social decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Maxwell's death in the waters off the Canary Islands was considered 
an accident when it occurred, it is now widely assumed he committed suicide 
with the knowledge that his deception was about to be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is, even if the court lets the show go on, will anyone want 
to sit through it? Steadman is circumspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know it will run for the first couple of months because there were a lot 
of people who were touched by Maxwell or were involved with businesses that 
were touched by Maxwell," he says. "He had 30,000 employees to start with, so 
there's those 30,000 and their families. But I don't kid myself that it will 
last beyond the point of those people you would expect to be interested. 
Unless, of course, it's a bloody good show." 
</P>
<P>
 If the show is a success, Steadman plans to bring it to New York, where 
Maxwell made a name for himself as the "savior" of the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 But if, as is statistically more likely, it flops, Steadman says he isn't 
going to worry about it. "I've got money to spend on anything I want to spend 
it on," he says. "So here it is. This is what I want to spend it on."

CHRISTIE'S TO HOLD OPEN APPRAISAL DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christie's New York auction house will hold an appraisal day next Saturday, 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m., at 342 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to bring artworks and collectibles -- or photographs and 
documentation of them -- to the event for free evaluations and appraisals. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts on hand will include Paul Jenkins, head of the collectibles 
department at Christie's East, and Nancy Cerbone, a specialist in entertainment 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for staging appraisal days is to make the point that million-dollar 
paintings aren't the only thing sold at auction, according to Kathleen Guzman, 
president of Christie's East. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of an item sold at Christie's is $11,000.

MUSIC REVIEW; DOUGLAS IN PIANISTIC SHOW AT AMBASSADOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gift for being simple is something you won't find in pianist Barry Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Irishman, who gave a recital Thursday night at Ambassador 
Auditorium, apparently never saw a musical phrase he didn't like to fiddle 
with. In his hands, every piece became a display piece. 
</P>
<P>
 His recital proved a fascinating catalogue of pianistic effects, an amazing 
show of virtuoso fireworks, a gaudy revelation of details. One could often 
disagree with the music-making, but had to marvel at it all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the 1986 Tchaikovsky Competition had chosen a demanding agenda 
-- nothing less would do: Debussy, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Mussorgsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas implied himself into every musical sentence along the way and, often 
as not, impeded the flow of ideas rather than directing them forward. He 
exposed all the angles and austerities and mystical effects of Scriabin's 
Seventh Sonata, "White Mass," and sounded like a sensitive robot in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachmaninoff's Moments Musicaux, Opus 16, actually seemed to move moment by 
moment, as he projected every facet and clause piecemeal. The range of colors, 
dynamics and articulations amazed but sounded deliberately applied. 
Spontaneity, abandon and a sweeping lyricism eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this could have been much worse with a pianist of lesser gifts. As it 
was, Douglas made his own prowess engaging and managed as well to completely 
avoid vulgarity. 
</P>
<P>
 The outer movements of Debussy's "Pour le piano" emerged with sparkling 
clarity and a certain dryness, while the central Sarabande glimmered in the 
pianist's elegant voicing and stratified coloring. 
</P>
<P>
 What turned out to be the pianistic tour de force of the evening, however, was 
Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition," a work Douglas has recorded and 
played locally before and which he rightly saved for last. 
</P>
<P>
 He made it a parade of intricate details and contrasts and a spectacle of 
technique. He didn't always capture the likeness of the pictures with all this 
display -- his tempos were too fast, his pursuit of thunder and nuance too 
earnest -- but one forgave him for it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an memorable concert, and it was all Douglas. TIMOTHY MANGAN

ORANGE COUNTY STOCKS TAKE A RELATIVELY SHORT TUMBLE; INVESTING: SHARES OF 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES LOST VALUE, BUT NONE MORE 
THAN 12%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DEL; JAMES M. GOMEZ, , LVERSTEI; JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff

<P>
 Orange County was not immune to Friday's 96-point drop in the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average. Fortunately, the impact was slight. Two-thirds of the 
county's largest publicly traded companies' stocks lost value in the day's 
frenzied trading, but the percentages were relatively small -- none greater 
than 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 100 local stocks tracked by the Times Orange County Edition, 66 lost 
value Friday and eight posted gains. The portfolio of an investor who owned one 
share of each of the 100 stocks would have been worth $1,013.50 when the market 
opened Friday. By the end of the day, that portfolio would only have been worth 
$976 -- a loss of $37.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Local market watchers called Friday's action a periodic market correction 
spurred by a Federal Reserve Board interest rate increase and by investor 
nervousness about the Dow's breaching the psychologically significant 4,000 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Orange County economist, Chapman University President James Doti, 
saw Friday's drop coming. In a speech Monday, Doti was advising people to sell 
their stocks in anticipation of the Fed's interest rate increase and what he 
expected would be a corresponding market plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti also quipped that the monetary tinkering was driven by President 
Clinton's desire to be reelected in 1996 -- and Federal Reserve Board Chairman 
Alan Greenspan's desire to be reappointed to his Fed post that year. The Fed's 
intervention is designed to keep inflation under control. An inflationary 
spiral would severely affect either man's chance of retaining office. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine investment banker Walter Cruttenden III said he believes that the Fed's 
interest rate increase caused Friday's stock sell-off. But he added that he 
also thinks the plunge "was a correction that has been long overdue. The Dow's 
been going up straight for 90 days without a correction," he said. "I wouldn't 
be too concerned unless this (downturn) went on for a prolonged period." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruttenden said he expects the market to fall again on Monday -- although by 
far less. "Selling begets more selling," he said, adding that Friday's decline 
is not much to get excited about. "When I started in this business, the Dow was 
at 600 or 700. Even when it hit 1,000, it was not a big deal to drop 60 points 
or so. Now we're near 4,000 and we drop 100. Percentage-wise, this shouldn't 
matter much." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday is the big question mark, said Larry H. Friend, president of L.H. 
Friend, Weinress & Frankson Inc., an investment banking firm in Irvine, who 
expects a continued sell-off. "We need to see whether Wall Street can stop it. 
It could be in for a short decline. So many people have been waiting for this 
to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market needs a 10% drop. It has been in Never-Never Land. . . . Brokers 
have been making too much money. Somebody's going to have to get hurt a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest losers in Orange County were an eclectic group of companies that 
ranged from a shoemaker and several sportswear firms to a group of health 
industry and high-tech businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posting the largest loss was CorVel Corp., an Irvine provider of 
medical cost containment and managed-care services. CorVel common shares 
dropped $2.50 on the Nasdaq market to close at $21.75 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The fickleness of the sell-off was illustrated by the fact that CorVel 
recently reported fiscal 1994 third-quarter earnings of $1.2 million, or 26 
cents a share, almost double its 1992 third-quarter profit of $661,000, or 16 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was just a lot of nervousness," CorVel President Gordon Clemons said of 
Friday's big stock sell-off. He said he believes the firm's stock will rise 
again Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Loeb, chairman of Trimedyne Inc., an Irvine maker of surgical lasers, 
said that he got "five frantic calls" from fellow Orange County executives 
unnerved by the stock drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Trimedyne stock closed at $14.125 a share on the Nasdaq market, down $1.75 
from Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Loeb said that the 11% drop in his stock's value was caused by any 
announcement made by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just the general market acting terribly," Loeb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities in Costa Mesa, said that he 
was not surprised by the stock plunge or that Orange County companies did not 
take the brunt of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem to me that Orange County companies were horribly damaged," he 
said. "If you didn't know the market was down, you wouldn't think Orange County 
companies as a whole had a terribly bad day."

INMATE MAY GET DEATH PENALTY FOR SEX SLAYING; TRIAL: ALREADY SERVING A LIFE 
SENTENCE IN MISSOURI, TIMOTHY DEPRIEST AWAITS SENTENCE HERE FOR 1989 
FIRST-DEGREE MURDER OF A BRIDAL SHOP SEAMSTRESS.

<P>
 A Missouri man already serving a life sentence in his home state was convicted 
Friday in the attempted rape and murder of a Fountain Valley woman and now 
faces a possible death sentence for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated about eight hours before 
finding Timothy DePriest, 33, guilty of first-degree murder and other charges 
in the Dec. 17, 1989, death of Hong Thi Nguyen, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen worked at a Garden Grove bridal shop as a seamstress. Her naked and 
battered body was left alongside a trash bin behind a pharmacy after she had 
been shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the attack, DePriest was on parole from a California prison for 
an unrelated rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors could not discuss the verdict Friday because they must return to court 
Feb. 14 to begin the trial's penalty phase. They will consider whether DePriest 
should receive the death penalty or spend life in prison with no parole. 
</P>
<P>
 With their verdict, jurors made it clear they rejected defense arguments that 
DePriest was wrongly charged in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest admitted using Nguyen's car, credit cards and checkbook to travel to 
Missouri. Deputy Public Defender Lewis W. Clapp said his client has abused 
drugs and was "not an angel," but pleaded with jurors to see that DePriest was 
a victim of circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest did not know Nguyen had been murdered when he purchased car for very 
little money from an acquaintance, the attorney said, and discovered the 
woman's purse and a gun in the car only while driving to Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in his home state, DePriest was captured after sexually assaulting 
another woman and then shooting and wounding a police officer during a chase. 
He was sentenced on those charges to life plus 57 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans plans to seek the death penalty 
against DePriest, while defense attorneys plan to ask the jury to recommend 
life in prison without parole for their client. Orange County Superior Court 
Judge Everett W. Dickey will make the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have criticized prosecutors for seeking the death penalty 
for a man already serving a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors say DePriest deserves no leniency because of his history of 
brutal crimes.

FULL MENU OF SETBACKS; SHELTER, ADVISERS HELP STRUGGLING RESTAURATEURS STAY 
AFLOAT; ' SOMETIMES I WONDER WHY WE'RE WORKING SO HARD FOR NOT EVEN $1 AT THE 
END OF THE DAY, AND THAT MAKES ME FEEL SADNESS AND DREAD, EVEN THOUGH THE 
PEOPLE AT THE SHELTER ARE TAKING CARE OF US, GIVING US FOOD AND CLOTHES.

<P>
 Carlos and Lucia Alcantara own a struggling Mexican restaurant here, where 
they work at least 16 hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, they have toiled in an effort to prosper and provide 
their children a better life. Offering such dishes as carnitas and taquitos de 
pollo has filled the cash register with small bills and change. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite their perseverance, the Alcantaras and their four children lost 
their apartment when they couldn't pay the rent. Now they are on the verge of 
losing their restaurant -- even though they grossed $87,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alcantaras, however, have found hope through the Fullerton Interfaith 
Emergency Service, where sympathetic officials found the family's situation so 
compelling that they have not only provided temporary shelter but have set up a 
program to help the Alcantaras stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to help them to keep going," said Adolf Vartanian, a retired 
engineer and businessman who volunteered to serve as the Alcantaras' business 
mentor, advising them on basic business practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had no prior experience in running a business before opening 
TacoMex restaurant on Commonwealth Avenue. They sank their life savings -- 
about $30,000 -- on the eatery, buying kitchen equipment, fixing, painting and 
bringing the restaurant up to city code. Carlos Alcantara gave up a full-time 
job as a truck driver and two part-time jobs as a traveling disc jockey and 
home repairman and his wife gave up being a homemaker to devote the time and 
energy needed to run the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know deep in our hearts that we're doing something good," said Carlos 
Alcantara, whose mother owned and operated a restaurant for 42 years in Mexico 
City until she and Carlos immigrated to the United States in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other small business owners, the Alcantaras were not prepared for 
the uphill struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes more than will and determination to make a small business successful, 
said Gerald Breitbart, a California Business Assn. consultant on small business 
issues and government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's typical for many small businesses to fail because the owners don't know 
anything about managing money," Breitbart said. Carlos Alcantara "has got to 
learn money management. That's really the crux of his whole problem, and 
there's just no getting around it. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any assets, 
so he wouldn't qualify for" a Small Business Administration loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, the family moved into a vacant building next door to their 
restaurant after being evicted from their apartment, where they could no longer 
afford to pay the $650-a-month rent. About a month later, they were forced out 
of the vacant building by a city code enforcement officer, who told the family 
it was not zoned as a residential site and they could not live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeless, the family was offered temporary housing through the Fullerton 
Interfaith Emergency Service, which operates the New Vista Shelter. Officials 
also launched a mentor business program about three months ago in which the 
Alcantaras are the first to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the program is to help business owners like the Alcantaras so they 
can "get back on their feet and afford to live in a home of their own," said 
Barbara W. Johnson, executive director of Fullerton Interfaith. 
</P>
<P>
 "This family is not eligible for any kind of government assistance, and it's 
quite a unique situation," she said. "We have the unique opportunity to really 
help them and offer the same service to others who may one day be in the same 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vartanian and other volunteers are helping the Alcantaras figure out how much 
money TacoMex has made and spent over the past three years. So far this year, 
Vartanian said, the business is beginning to show a meager profit -- about $100 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Alcantara, 36, tried to get a loan last year to pay off living and 
business expenses, but was turned down because his establishment was "too new 
and I had no assets to offer for collateral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he applied for welfare benefits but again was turned down, this time for 
"owning a business that makes too much money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the money (TacoMex earns) goes toward paying the (restaurant's) rent, 
buying the food and just barely keeping the business open. So the business is 
taking care of itself," he said. "The problem is, it's not producing enough for 
shelter, and if I take the money out of the business -- there goes our 
opportunity to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelo Doti, director of financial assistance of the Orange County Social 
Services Agency, said the Alcantara family is an example of needy people who 
are "shut out of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the right to apply for welfare benefits, but the working poor are 
generally ineligible," he said. The Alcantaras "will remain excluded as long as 
they are entrepreneurs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Alcantaras suffered a financial setback two years ago when two of their 
children needed medical treatment. The son had to have 16 stitches in his arm 
after running into a tree while riding a bicycle. A daughter was treated for a 
stomach infection and, later in the year, for an ear infection. The family 
spent a year paying off the $1,200 in medical bills with money borrowed from 
friends and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't qualify for Medi-Cal, (but) I had to pay those bills because the 
banks won't loan money unless you have good credit, so I can't have debts," 
Alcantara said. 
</P>
<P>
 The business must prosper on its own for his family to survive, he said. And 
the help it is receiving from the Fullerton Interfaith volunteers is giving him 
and his family something to look forward to, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Fullerton Interfaith paid for 5,000 flyers that were distributed 
last month to homes and businesses throughout the area to lure customers into 
the restaurant. The Alcantaras have hired a part-time cook to help out during 
the heavy lunch hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the volunteers' intervention, Alcantara said, he has changed the 
way he manages the business and constantly consults with Vartanian for advice. 
For example, he used to go to local grocery stores to buy food every morning 
and take the day's earnings to buy more food the next day. Now he buys food 
once a week from a wholesale grocer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have the fear that we may have to close down the business someday, 
but with all the help we're getting now, we feel like maybe we can make it," 
Alcantara said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Alcantaras keep to their daily routine. The parents get to work 
at 5 a.m. Lucia, 37, takes her children, Aurora, 11, Breeze, 10, and Charlie, 
8, to and from school each day in the family's faded blue 1977 Chevrolet 
station wagon. Carla, 2, stays with her all day. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, Aurora helps out as a cashier and waitress at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, the children sat in four of the restaurant's 19 plastic 
chairs doing homework as their mother watched from behind the tile and wood 
counter that her husband made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I wonder why we're working so hard for not even $1 at the end of 
the day, and that makes me feel sadness and dread, even though the people at 
the shelter are taking care of us, giving us food and clothes," Lucia Alcantara 
said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 The dream that one day she will be able to afford to pay for her children's 
college education and buy a home eases the dread and sadness, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Gomez, the New Vista Shelter's manager, said the Alcantaras are a model 
family. "They're a close-knit, hard-working bunch," he said. "If every family 
had the same drive and motivation, every family would be a success." 
</P>
<P>
 Business-wise, the Alcantaras are dedicated, Vartanian said. "What thrills 
Carlos the most is serving people a whole lot of good food with a big smile for 
a little price. It's breaking his back, but he is going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Carlos Alcantara, "The point is to keep (the restaurant) open against 
all the odds until we make it or break it."

STORM-WARY LAGUNA BEACH BRACES FOR MORE RAINFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Beach and its disaster-weary residents are bracing for a new round of 
winter storms expected to hit the Orange County coastline by Sunday or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new forecasts leave little time for preparations, however, as a flurry of 
rainstorms drenched the county late Thursday and Friday, largely sparing the 
South County hillsides charred in last fall's devastating fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Fire Chief Richard Dewberry said residents were already stacking 
sandbags to block possible mudslides and soil erosion that may threaten area 
homes and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have heavy equipment staged at key areas in the city where small 
tractors, loaders, and backhoes are available to help keep drains clear," 
Dewberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky remained dark and threatening Friday, even after much of the county 
had been soaked with about two-thirds of an inch of rain. Between 4 p.m. 
Thursday and 4 p.m. Friday, Laguna Beach had 0.42 inches of rain, the least 
amount recorded in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general report we have from the command post is that everything's fared 
pretty well," said Scott Jennie, a Laguna Beach firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol reported no rain-related accidents on Friday. 
However, a landslide caused temporary closure of Ortega Highway a mile south of 
the Riverside County line Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County health officials warned people not to swim in the ocean near the 
mouths of rivers, creeks and storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher levels of bacteria usually are present after a storm because of the 
runoff of animal wastes, fertilizers and road oils. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, rainfall for the season had reached only one-fourth of last 
year's. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana received 0.67 inches of rain by 4 p.m. Friday, bringing its season 
total to 3.88 inches. The city's total to date last season was 17.2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatening weather was not expected to alter the plans of weekend 
festival organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's parade celebrating Black History Month is expected to go on in Santa 
Ana rain or shine. Similarly, festivals celebrating Tet, the Vietnamese New 
Year, have not been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 In mountain communities, the precipitation took the form of powdery snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the 13 inches that fell in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino 
mountains was a gratifying addition to the snowpack that contributes to the 
area's household water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow also delighted ski resort operators who had been relying on man-made 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely incredible. It's all soft and fluffy," said Libby Coleman, a 
spokeswoman at Big Bear's Bear Mountain Ski Resort. "This is what we've 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., said there is a chance of 
more rain in Orange County on Sunday, with rain likely on Monday that could 
continue into Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there might be high pressure building in behind that," he said, "with 
more dry weather for the rest of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Kevin Johnson contributed to this report. Rain Shortfall 
</P>
<P>
 Less than an inch of rain fell in Orange County Friday, adding little to a 
total already more than four inches shy of the norm. Friday's rain, from 
midnight to 4 p.m. 02,15,08 City Inches Santa Ana 0.94 Irvine 0.80 Anaheim 0.71

MAN HELD IN 1989 COLORADO DRUG SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When police arrested 23-year-old Darrell Frank Sanchez Jr. in the crime-ridden 
Oak View neighborhood this week, the final piece of a baffling, 5-year-old 
slaying fell into place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez is suspected of participating in the 1989 slaying of his best friend, 
21-year-old Cory Edge, who police said was beaten with a steel pipe and stabbed 
23 times in the basement of Sanchez's Colorado Springs, Colo., home.  
</P>
<P>
 Colorado Springs police say that Sanchez and his younger brother, Jason 
Sanchez, killed Edge during a fight over rock cocaine that the brothers were 
allegedly trying to steal from Edge, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We received information from Colorado Springs that Sanchez was a suspect for 
a murder and was possibly living in our city," Huntington Beach Police Officer 
Mike Corcoran said Friday. "We had had previous contacts with him, so we were 
able to establish his whereabouts and arrest him without incident on 
Wednesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez had been living in an apartment in the 17000 block of Emerald Lane for 
at least six months and had been arrested by Huntington Beach police on four 
separate occasions since August on drug charges and warrants for unpaid traffic 
tickets, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez was not linked to Edge's slaying until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after finding Edge's body on Dec. 6, 1989, Colorado Springs police 
interviewed Sanchez and his family upon learning that the victim had spent the 
night at their home on the last day he was seen alive, said Colorado Springs 
Police Sgt. Ray Lachapelle. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no trace of the crime at the house, because the two brothers and 
their father, Darrell Frank Sanchez Sr., allegedly covered up the slaying by 
dumping Edge's body in a remote wooded area just outside the city before 
returning home to bleach, repaint and retile the walls and floors of the 
basement, Lachapelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had effectively destroyed any physical evidence," Lachapelle said. 
"Forensic scientists and police went through the scene, but they were unable to 
trace any evidence of value." 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the Sanchez family allegedly knew about the killing, but 
kept the secret within the family until Jan. 27 of this year, Lachapelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, a family argument escalated into violence and 40-year-old Darrell 
Frank Sanchez Sr. allegedly was stabbed five times by his brother, Ralph 
Sanchez. Ralph Sanchez was arrested that day in connection with the attack on 
his brother and later told police everything he knew about Edge's death, 
Lachapelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Ralph Sanchez) was mad, so he starts telling on his brother" as he was 
being questioned about the fight, Lachapelle said. "We learned firsthand 
information as to the actions taken by each of the suspects contributing to 
Cory Edge's death." 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be a made-for-television movie," Lachapelle said. "But, I don't 
think anyone would believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Sanchez, 20, who was also arrested on suspicion of murder Tuesday, had 
stabbed himself several times in the stomach three days earlier over a problem 
with his girlfriend, Lachapelle said. He is in the same Colorado Springs 
hospital as his father. Both are expected to recover from their wounds, 
Lachapelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Frank Sanchez Sr. was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of being an 
accessory to murder, Lachapelle said. Several other Sanchez family members may 
be charged in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Sanchez Jr. is being held at the Orange County Jail without bail. It 
is not known when he will be extradited to Colorado to face the murder charge, 
authorities said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; MAYOR FORESEES 'NEW HORIZON' FOR CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before a gathering of hundreds of city politicians, business leaders and 
residents Friday evening, Mayor Clarence J. Turner spoke of a "new horizon" for 
the coastal community in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's message was the centerpiece of the annual Mayor's Dinner, a tribute 
to the city's former mayors and an opportunity for the current mayor to deliver 
a State of the City address. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can unequivocally state that 1993 was a year to forget," Turner told the 
audience at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 During those turbulent 12 months, the city hired a new police chief, 
overwhelmingly rejected a proposed $69-million purchase of open space 
overlooking the Upper Newport Bay, and watched neighboring Laguna Beach burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner focused his speech on a continued pitch for the conversion of El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station to a commercial airport and on a sobering budget 
forecast for the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply can no longer afford the luxury of continuing to do business as 
usual," Turner said. "Newport Beach is not immune from the ravages of recession 
and we too must learn to cope with its effects." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is projecting a $3-million budget shortfall for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said the City Council in the upcoming year will be considering an 
expansion of Fashion Island to broaden the retail mix there and provide a more 
lucrative tax base for the city. City officials also foresee some cuts in city 
staff through early retirement incentives and attrition. 
</P>
<P>
 By midyear, the city is scheduled to open a new Central Library as well as a 
new fire station on Balboa Island. Also, disruptive construction projects on 
some of the city's major byways are expected to make a great leap forward in 
the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some small measure of comfort for the residents to know that as 
they drive over the smoothly paved streets that beneath those streets are new 
gas lines, new water lines and a sewer system that no longer leaks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner served as mayor during 1993 and then was reelected by his fellow City 
Council members to a second term for 1994. His term as a public official is due 
to expire in November, and he will step down.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL OKS LOAN FOR LOW-RENT HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city moved a step closer to building its first hotel for low-income, 
single people this week when the City Council agreed to negotiate a 
multimillion-dollar construction proposal with a Costa Mesa developer.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment agency agreed Tuesday to lend $1 million to Urban 
Communities/San Gabriel Partners to build a 112-unit hotel for people who earn 
less than $17,000 per year. The project's cost is estimated at $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be breaking ground this summer and occupying next February," said Kaleb 
Nelson, leader of the development group. Rents at the hotel, slated for 
construction at 224 E. Commonwealth Ave. in downtown Fullerton, will average 
$326 per month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one-room apartment would contain a toilet, sink, refrigerator, microwave 
and small stove as well as a bedroom area. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Chris Norby, the lone dissenter in the 3-1 vote, noted that the 
developer still has not acquired the land for the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't hold my breath on it," Norby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby favored local developer Tony Bushala for the job, saying he did not 
trust an out-of-town developer with few community ties to build and operate a 
hotel that will be reserved for low-income residents for the next 55 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members felt that Urban Communities was better prepared to 
handle the project and could move more quickly to the construction stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been actively promoting low-income housing after settling a 1992 
lawsuit that charged the city's redevelopment agency with not spending any 
money on housing projects for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed our redevelopment priorities to address this issue until we got 
caught up," said Gary Chalupsky, executive director of the Fullerton 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton would become the third city in the county with a 
single-room-occupancy hotel. Costa Mesa has such a hotel, and the Irvine City 
Council last week approved a proposal to build one. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's redevelopment agency is involved in nine other affordable-housing 
projects. Beneficiaries would include families and senior citizens, Chalupsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio apartments for single people, however, are in especially high demand, 
Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's group conducted a market survey to determine the need for hotel rooms 
and found that computer operators, grocery checkers, security guards, 
waitresses and locksmiths would be likely occupants of the apartments, Nelson 
said.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; FORMER CHANCELLOR BACK AT SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert A. Lombardi, a former chancellor of the Saddleback Community College 
District, has been selected to fill the job again by the district's Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi, 60, has been superintendent-president of College of the Sequoias in 
Visalia since 1991. He is expected to take over the Saddleback district's top 
post in four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed session Wednesday, Saddleback trustees unanimously chose Lombardi 
out of six finalists gathered in a nationwide search, said board President 
Marcia Milchiker. 
</P>
<P>
 "People on the committee remembered him for doing exceptional things for the 
district," Milchiker said. "They thought he had great honesty and integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi will receive a compensation package worth $145,000, although the 
details of his salary and benefits are yet to be negotiated, Milchiker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi has a long history with Saddleback. He was superintendent-president 
from 1974 to 1981 and was named chancellor in 1981 when the district 
reorganized to a multi-campus arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure, Saddleback's enrollment quadrupled to 30,000 and its number 
of class sections increased from 500 to 2,500. To accommodate the county's 
growth, the district also added a campus in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi left the district in 1982 to take a job as vice president of 
Datascan, a firm with a division in Irvine that developed educational computer 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing his resignation as chancellor at that time, Lombardi said he 
needed a career change after being in education for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1990, Lombardi returned to Saddleback for a one-year assignment as 
acting vice chancellor of human resources. The following year he was hired for 
the top position at College of the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released by the district, he said he was "excited about this 
opportunity" and "looking forward to returning to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardi replaces Richard Sneed, who retired in August. Anna L. McFarlin, 
president of Irvine Valley College, has been serving as interim chancellor.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; PARK TENANTS ASK CITY FOR $97,000 LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surprised City Council members were handed a request this week for a $97,000 
loan by mobile home residents wanting to purchase their park. 
</P>
<P>
 The council delayed action on the request until city employees have time to 
study and report on the loan proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the mobile home tenants asked the council to co-sign a $6-million 
loan to purchase a 30-year lease on Kimberly Gardens mobile home park. In 
making their request, they emphasized that no cash would be needed from the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two weeks ago, you said there would be no cost to the city," Councilwoman Ann 
Van Haun said. "Now you're asking for $97,000. It doesn't make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used to cover processing costs for the park loan, including 
land assessment, engineering and escrow fees, a representative of the residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The request you have in front of you has been (successful) in this format for 
many, many cities," said Dave Mounier, who added that he has engineered similar 
partnerships in Vista and Rancho Mirage. "This may be the last opportunity for 
the residents of Kimberly Gardens to purchase their own park." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Gardens is a 159-space park that is home to about 1,300 residents. 
The park is one of four in Lake Forest involved in rent disputes with 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are trying to persuade the council to pass a rent control law. The 
council has asked them to continue negotiating with park landlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed several reservations about the proposed loan. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tenants "are that committed to this project, why don't they reach into 
their own pockets" for the $97,000, Councilman Richard Dixon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounier said that loan requirements forbid applicants from putting up the 
money for the preliminary costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tim Link held out some hope for the park residents, saying that the 
loan would be a cheap way to bring more affordable housing into the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, $100,000 doesn't even buy one unit of affordable housing," 
he said.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; $190,000 RAISED BY COUNCILMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The five city councilmen raised more than $190,000 last year in campaign 
contributions, with most of the money going to pay off debts accumulated in 
previous campaigns, statements filed recently with the city clerk show. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly raised the most last year -- $88,151, records show. But most of 
that went to pay off loans and bills he had left over from his 1992 campaigns 
for mayor and the council. His statement says he only has $7,865 left in the 
bank for his reelection bid for mayor this November. His largest contributor 
was the Apartment Assn. of Orange County, which gave $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a series of fund raisers scheduled for this spring," Daly said, 
saying he hopes to have $100,000 in the bank by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus, who doesn't face the voters until 1996, raised 
$44,580 last year, with Pick Your Part Auto Salvage giving $2,248, his largest 
contribution, statements show. But like Daly, most of Feldhaus' contributions 
went to pay off debts he racked up during his successful 1992 campaign and his 
failed 1990 attempt. His statement shows his campaign committees have $19,000 
in the bank but still have debts of $57,000. 
</P>
<P>
 About $52,000 of that money Feldhaus owes himself from personal loans he made 
to his own campaigns. The other $5,000 is what he still owes council member Irv 
Pickler's campaign committee for a $20,000 loan given two weeks before the 1992 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his plan is to whittle down the debts over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickler, who is contemplating running against Daly or Orange County Supervisor 
William G. Steiner in November, has a war chest of $49,335 after raising 
$39,750 last year. He is prohibited by term limits from running for another 
term as a council member. His largest contribution was $4,000 from Bryan 
Industrial Properties, a local landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson, who is considering a run against Daly, raised 
$7,500 last year. He only has $2,370 in the bank. Simpson, whose council term 
expires in November, has said he will not run for reelection to that seat. His 
largest contributor was development attorney Carmen Morinello, who gave $2,250. 
Developer consultant Frank Elfend, Morinello's frequent partner, gave $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I'm going to have to make a decision shortly," Simpson said about 
the mayoral race and the need to start raising money soon. "But I'm still in 
the process of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Fred Hunter's statements show his various campaign committees owe 
him more than $81,000 -- money he loaned to the committees to finance his 
mayoral and council campaigns over the past 10 years. Hunter, who will leave 
office this year, said he has no plans to repay himself. He raised $14,750 last 
year, with Elfend and Morinello each giving him $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always put a lot of my own money in my campaigns," said Hunter, who has a 
successful personal injury law firm. "That's just the way it goes." TERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CREATIVITY PAYS OFF FOR CITY EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new program that rewards city workers for creativity is designed to save 
money and improve government, said Rick Pickering, assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering said he modeled the program, which began Tuesday, after one in 
Manhattan Beach, where he used to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-management employees who come up with an idea that improves the 
effectiveness, productivity or safety of government will be awarded up to a 
week of vacation, which they can also have the option of cashing in. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, a park worker was honored for his recommendation that Park 
Department vehicles have beepers that go on when the vehicle is in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Street sweepers already had the warning beepers, but no one had thought to add 
them to Park Department trucks, Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the beeper made the vehicles safer by alerting children and 
others, Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a new idea, or it can be reworking an old idea," Pickering said. He 
said another winning idea from Manhattan Beach came from an animal control 
officer who suggested buying elbow-length leather gloves for workers to wear 
when catching animals. Formerly, workers had worn plastic gloves which did not 
give much protection against bites. 
</P>
<P>
 The program could save the city money if it reduces injuries to city staff and 
the public, or results in quicker ways to do the same job, Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering said City Manager Allan L. Roeder funded the program by donating a 
couple months of his own vacation time. If that runs out and the program has 
been a success, the City Council will be asked to set aside money for the 
program, Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 A review committee will consider suggestions, and Roeder will make the final 
decision on the awards, Pickering said. The maximum award will be 40 hours of 
vacation time or $800. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; DECISION DELAYED ON FIRE ENGINEER 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have postponed a decision whether to fire Paul Gilbrook, the 
embattled president of the firefighters union. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Don Anderson said Friday that Gilbrook's case is still 
being evaluated and that a decision could come next week. Gilbrook remains on 
suspension with pay, he said. Anderson, who conducted a closed-door termination 
hearing Wednesday, was supposed to decide what to do Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A city investigation has allegedly found that Gilbrook drove a firetruck three 
times while his driver's license was suspended last year and improperly used 
sick leave in June and November, 1993. The offenses are grounds for 
termination, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, an engineer in the Fire Department, said he has done nothing 
wrong.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CLUB TO GET $50,000 IN RECREATION FUNDS 
</P>

<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner announced Friday that he has earmarked 
$50,000 of county recreation money for the Boys and Girls Club of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sofia, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club, said the money will 
go toward completion of a 5,460-square-foot facility at East Broadway and 
Philadelphia Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very appreciative of Supervisor Steiner's efforts," he said. "This 
will go a long way towards helping us move forward with our new club facility." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the facility will enable the club to double its 600-youth membership 
and increase club activities. The new club will include a wood shop, a library, 
a computer room and an arts and crafts room. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he allocated $50,000 from a $400,000 discretionary account called 
the Urban Parks Fund. Each supervisor has such an account that he or she can 
use to assist various recreational facilities or endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am happy to be of assistance and pleased to hear the new facility will 
enable them to provide opportunities to a larger number of children," Steiner 
said.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; NEARLY 50 COMPETE IN ICE SKATING CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 50 young athletes participated in the 21st annual Orange County Special 
Olympics ice skating competition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some raced around the Huntington Beach rink with great speed. Others required 
help from coaches to steady them as they competed in shorter and slower-paced 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning didn't seem to be everything to many. Just to get on the ice and be a 
part of the competition is very important, according to Georgiana Rae, a coach 
and a student teacher in adaptive physical education at the Jordan Secondary 
Learning Center in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Rae said the young competitors exemplify the Special Olympics oath: "Let me 
win but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt." 
</P>
<P>
 Competition does wonders for the skaters' self-confidence and pride, said 
Gayle Santiago, special education teacher at Jordan and director of the ice 
skating competition for the youngsters, all with learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love to go home and tell their able-bodied brothers and sisters who 
don't know how to skate about how well they've done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen competitors on Friday will be chosen to take part in the state Special 
Olympics ice skating competition in Fresno later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Selection is based not just on how they finished in competition, but their 
attitude, how they get along with others and their behavior, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanh Le, a 10th-grader at La Quinta High School in Westminster, finished 
first in the initial event of the day, the 10-meter straight race. She has been 
skating about five years and practices about twice a month at the Side by Side 
Rink, where Friday's competition was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Wisler, 17, a student at Jordan, said he's only started to skate on ice 
this year. Yet he was an easy winner in the 100-meter speed race. He also is a 
roller skater and a bicycle racer. But ice skating is his favorite sport, he 
said. ROBERT BARKER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; GROUP TO PROTEST GENERAL PLAN TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Tustin residents said Friday that they will express opposition to the 
inclusion of their community in the proposed Tustin general plan, which will go 
before the City Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be waving placards or have an unmanageable crowd, but yes, we will 
protest," said Don Kragenbrink, president of the Foothill Communities Assn., 
which wants its 3,831-acre area left out of Tustin's planning document. 
</P>
<P>
 The city completed its proposal for the general plan after three years of 
work. The document addresses issues such as land use, housing, conservation and 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 North Tustin, which is unincorporated, falls within the so-called sphere of 
influence of Tustin, and the city may annex it in the next 20 years. There are 
about 23,000 residents in the area, which is affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no immediate plans to annex all or part of the area, but city 
officials said that it is included in the proposed general plan simply for 
planning purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 North Tustin residents say they worry that being included in the general plan 
would be an invitation for builders to propose developments that would change 
the semi-rural character of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Neil Harkleroad said the proposed general plan could lead to zoning 
changes that would allow higher density. He said the average density now is 2.3 
houses per acre. Houses there are predominantly single-story, single-family 
structures of 1,800 to 3,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the city plan, density could reach seven houses per acre in some areas 
and allow as many as 25 houses per acre in the area bounded by 17th and Hope 
streets and Irvine and Newport boulevards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rita Westfield, the city's assistant community development director, said 
the general plan will maintain the "basic character" of the area through zoning 
ordinances that will require lower densities.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; CITY IMPOSES POLICE CONTRACT; NO RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After failed attempts at the bargaining table, the City Council this week 
unanimously imposed a contract for top-ranking police officers that offered 
them no pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Raymond H. Kromer said an impasse was declared following months 
of negotiations with the Fountain Valley Peace Officers Management Unit for a 
one-year period from November, 1992, to November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A state mediator was brought in to settle differences, but that was 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract that was imposed, however, expired in November, 1993. But Kromer 
said terms of the contract will continue until a new agreement is negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer said the management bargaining unit includes five police officers, two 
captains and three lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's final offer included increasing the city's contribution to the 
health insurance premium, eliminating the lump sum merit bonus and not offering 
any pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer said health insurance costs increased by $44 a month per employee, of 
which the city will pay half, or $22 toward the benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Kromer also said the city has no extra money to give salary increases or 
bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the amount of merit bonus, which have been given in past years, varied 
depending on salaries. DEBRA CANO

LAGUNA RESIDENT MAY APPEAL TREEHOUSE DENIAL; PROPERTY: THE DESIGN REVIEW BOARD 
HAS REFUSED TO ALLOW THE STRUCTURE, SAYING IT SHOULD BE MOVED TO A LOCATION 
THAT WOULD NEITHER ANNOY NEIGHBORS NOR REQUIRE A VARIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A homeowner said Friday he may appeal to the City Council after the city's 
Design Review Board unanimously refused to allow his son's treehouse to remain 
perched between two back-yard eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in the city's history that a resident had attempted to 
gain a permit for a treehouse. The structure, which cost Lewis Castillo $3,200 
to build, came under the city's scrutiny after a neighbor complained that it 
blocked his ocean view and infringed upon his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides needing a permit, the structure also requires a variance because the 
trees that cradle it are in a setback area of the yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick said that because the treehouse 
-- which is secured to the trees by ropes -- is "a temporary-type structure," 
the board decided Thursday night that it should be moved to a location that 
would neither annoy neighbors nor require a variance. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo, however, balked at that notion, saying all the trees that rim his 
property are in setback areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are we going to relocate it?" he asked. "A treehouse goes in a tree." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-foot-by-5-foot treehouse, which is about eight feet high at its pitched 
roof, boasts a balcony, a skylight and an ocean view -- a view neighbor Geo 
Moskios said he once enjoyed. The Castillos maintain the treehouse has not 
lessened Moskios' view or his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moskios could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally constructed four years ago at their previous home for their son 
Andrew's 6th birthday, the Castillos hit a snag two years ago when they moved 
to a new home and set about reconstructing the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Moskios, a yoga instructor who lives uphill from the Castillos, immediately 
objected to the structure, prompting the city to "red tag" it, meaning it had 
to win city approval or be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castillos have admitted they initially ignored the city's command, 
thinking the fuss over a child's treehouse was "silly" and "hoping it would 
just kind of go away." 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the city took them to court last year over the matter, the 
Castillos promised a judge they would cooperate by attempting to get proper 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Having now lost at least the first round in the battle, Lewis Castillo said he 
will "more than likely" appeal the matter to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disputes are not rare in this coastal community, where in 1991 the city 
kept a couple from moving into their new house because it was painted a lighter 
shade than had been agreed upon by the homeowners and the Design Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has overturned controversial board decisions. For example, 
the council once overruled the board after it rejected a picket fence that was 
six inches too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, Andrew Castillo, now 10, waited up for his father to find out 
what the board decided, Lewis Castillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the father said, "I think he realizes it might actually come down."

MARKET CO-OWNER ARRESTED IN BUYING OF FOOD STAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Department of Agriculture investigators and city police arrested the 
co-owner of a market Friday on suspicion of purchasing food stamps at less than 
face value from undercover agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Amparo Morfin Diaz, co-owner of La Imperial Ranch Market, was arrested on 
suspicion of trafficking in food stamps, a federal offense that is a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing food stamps at a discount would allow a merchant to pocket the 
difference when they are redeemed for face value by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a particularly sophisticated operation," said David F. Dickson, 
western regional inspector general for the Department of Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickson said that Agriculture department agents initially succeeded in using 
food stamps to purchase non-food items -- which is prohibited by law -- at 
Diaz's market in the 200 block of South Bradford Avenue. Later, the woman 
allegedly purchased food stamps for less than face value from the agents. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the federal charge, Diaz faces a maximum of five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. The Department of Agriculture also plans to seek 
revocation of the store's license to accept food stamps, Dickson said.

CHALLENGE FILED TO TUSTIN'S BAN ON PICKETING OF PRIVATE HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first court challenge to the city's controversial ordinance banning the 
picketing of private homes was filed Friday by two men who were arrested last 
year during a march near the residence of an abortion clinic manager. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit, Allen R. Meadows of Tustin and Duane G. Leach of San Juan 
Capistrano claimed that the city violated their rights to free speech and said 
they were unnecessarily detained by police on April 17, when they and others 
marched near the home of Naomi Hardin. 
</P>
<P>
 Meadows and Leach, both anti-abortion advocates, also stated in the lawsuit 
that the city's ordinance is vague in meaning and lacked critical detail in 
defining what constituted actual violations. The lawsuit was filed in Orange 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Mayor Jim Potts acknowledged Friday that the ordinance was "poorly 
written and needs some wordsmithing to tighten it." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we don't write clear laws," Potts said, "we end up paying the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Potts said the ordinance failed to provide a proper description 
of where pickets would be prohibited in relation to individual homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we prevail in court, we're still going to have to pay a great deal of 
money in attorney's fees," Potts said. "That's the sad part about this." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the council passed the ordinance, which prohibits pickets from 
targeting residents' homes. The law is based on a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court 
ruling that says protesters may visit residential areas but cannot invade 
someone's privacy by focusing on their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve days after the council passed the ordinance, Meadows and Leach were 
among 40 anti-abortion activists who marched around the neighborhood where 
Hardin lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin, manager of a Tustin clinic that performs abortions, has been the 
target of anti-abortion pickets in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Meadows, Leach and Robert Ferguson of Montebello. Charges were 
filed against them but were later dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Friday's lawsuit, the City Council rejected a claim for $5 million each 
brought by Meadows and Leach, who claimed that their civil rights had been 
violated when police arrested them during the march.

POLICE KILL MAN DURING CHASE; 2 ARE ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer shot and killed an unidentified man who allegedly pulled a 
handgun during a foot chase Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested another man at the scene and later caught a third after 
blocking off an eight-square-block area with the help of dogs and a helicopter, 
said Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of events began shortly before 5 p.m. when an unidentified officer 
stopped a car on Russell Avenue that matched the description of a vehicle from 
which shots were reportedly fired earlier in the day, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two passengers fled the car, climbing over a chain-link fence into the 
playground of Martin Elementary School, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects turned and drew a handgun, Helton said, and the officer 
fired one round at him through the fence. The man ran about 50 yards, dropped 
the semiautomatic weapon, ran 50 more yards and fell to the ground, Helton 
said. He was later pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested the driver of the 1964 Chevrolet and took him to the police 
station for questioning, Helton said. An area bounded by Flower Street, 
McFadden Avenue, Shelton Street and Wilshire Avenue was blocked off while 
police conducted a house-to-house search for the third suspect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three occupants of the car was identified by authorities. 
According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, the car is registered to Raul 
Coronel of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all shootings involving police officers, the death is being 
investigated by the district attorney's officer-involved shooting team. The 
Santa Ana Police Department's homicide unit is also investigating.

AGOURA'S CHARGE TAKES THE STEAM OUT OF SIMI VALLEY

 Agoura's Brian Ureda made a three-point shot with 11 seconds to play in 
overtime, giving the Chargers a 60-57 victory over Simi Valley in a key 
Marmonte League game Friday night at Thousand Oaks High. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Pioneers' first loss in four games since Coach Dean Bradshaw was 
suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (15-6, 6-3 in league play) led by 11 midway through the fourth 
quarter, but two-for-eight free-throw shooting down the stretch helped Agoura 
(15-6, 9-2) come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I love about this team is that they don't quit," Agoura Coach Kevin 
Pasky said. "All we did was pick up the effort and execute a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Brian Laibow sparked the Charger comeback by scoring 13 of his 23 
points in the fourth quarter, including a three-pointer to give Agoura a 55-54 
lead with 22 seconds to play in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Jeremy Roberts, who led the Pioneers with 15 points, made one of 
two free throws with 10 seconds to play to send the game into overtime. JEFF

NO FOREIGNER TO HARDSHIP; AFTERMATH OF EARTHQUAKE REMINDED ROYAL'S GRUBISIC OF 
HER LIFE IN CROATIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No electricity. No water. No school. Who says you can't go home again? 
</P>
<P>
 For Royal High's Bruna Grubisic, the immediate aftermath of the Northridge 
earthquake brought to mind life in her homeland, Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange student and basketball player from Split -- a port on the 
Adriatic Sea in southern Croatia -- was moved by the quake to recall her native 
city during offshore bombing by Serb forces a couple of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had the earthquake, she said, 'This is what it was like when we were 
being attacked -- lights out, windows closed or blackened,' " said Sandy 
Hofford, the mother of Grubisic's host family in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grubisic: "The few months that we are in war at Split, there wasn't 
regular school. Sometimes we have it, sometimes we don't. We went 10 months 
without normal electricity. And there were some -- what do you call it? 
Sniperists?" 
</P>
<P>
 She knocks on a picnic table outside Royal's gym. "Nobody I know has been 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 And snipers being considerably harder to find in Simi Valley than in Croatia, 
Grubisic must relish the relative safety and quiet of the suburbs, plate 
tectonics aside. Right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think she's bored," Hofford said. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the gregarious 18-year-old point guard finds Simi Valley a bit sleepy, 
and misses staying out until midnight every night amid the bustle of Croatia's 
second-largest city. But she's glad she split from Split, finding herself 
giddily awash in choices and personal freedoms she didn't enjoy in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 29, she arrived in the United States. Now, she hopes to receive a 
basketball scholarship so she can stay here after graduating from Royal in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Grubisic is quick to adapt . . . and thrive. She practiced with the 
Highlanders only twice before Coach Paula Getty-Shear inserted Grubisic into a 
game. One game later, she was a starter. Then she was moved from shooting guard 
to point guard and leads Royal in assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's picked up things in a few games that it's taken our girls a whole year 
to learn," Getty-Shear said. "She understands the game better than anyone else 
on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 A pass-first, shoot-later player, Grubisic only recently has looked to score, 
averaging 10.3 points in her last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's times when I feel like she could have scored every time down, but 
she's always looking to pass," Getty-Shear said. "Our team learned a lot about 
teamwork from her, being as unselfish as she is." 
</P>
<P>
 Grubisic is well-served by her experience as one of Croatia's better youth 
players, a shooting guard for Split's 18-and-under team that twice was champion 
of Croatia. But though she has won those championships and played in such 
places as Sweden, Austria and Greece, Grubisic said playing American high 
school basketball is more exhilarating. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Croatia, they don't take care of (girls' basketball)," she said in 
accented but clear English. "Men's basketball is much popular. There are lots 
of problems: no money, nobody wants to sponsor us. My team was two-time 
champion of Croatia, we play in European League, and still nobody want to take 
care of us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here everything is in schools and everything is excitement. You hear music 
when we are warming up, and lots of people come to watch games and there are 
cheerleaders. It makes the situation like it is important." 
</P>
<P>
 She appreciates the academic side of school even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different in Croatia," she said. "Even in the best school in town, the 
teachers are not very well. If they find out you don't know something, they 
will ask it of you in front of everyone and try to make you feel bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here they try to get the best of me . When they see that I am interested in 
something, they do everything they can to help me -- giving me all the material 
they have on that subject, all the literature. There is much choice for study 
here. If you try to do, then you will do the best." 
</P>
<P>
 If her assessment sounds a bit wide-eyed, consider how Grubisic came here. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaned on eight years of English classes, Pink Floyd and MTV, Grubisic was 
spurred to action by her best friend, Gigi. "She always talk about it: 
'America, America, I go to America.' So I have to find out about it -- what is 
so great?" 
</P>
<P>
 Grubisic arranged for a six-month visit through the Center for Educational 
Travel. "When they found out I played basketball, they said it is good to go in 
America because you can play there," she said. "And I want to see everything 
else. I read California. I read America. It is a big thing and I want to come 
see for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 And what she sees, she generally likes. The climate. The people. Shopping 
malls, with their myriad choices. She can take a basic drawing and painting 
class, unavailable to her in Split. 
</P>
<P>
 And the specter of war does not loom here. "I hate war," she said. "I don't 
know why they fight. It's the 21st century. Everything can be done by talking 
and planning. But now, (in Croatia) once you finish high school, if you don't 
go to university, you have to go to war." 
</P>
<P>
 For all those reasons, Grubisic hopes to extend her time here. First, she must 
find a new host family, because her stay with the Hoffords was intended to be 
for only a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes college. What are the chances? She doesn't know, but she dreams, 
hoping for a reunion with her two best friends, Gigi and Petra, in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lots of dreams that we'll be together in America," Grubisic said. 
"They are dreams, but maybe they can come true. Who knows? Everything can come 
true."

COUGARS' HILL HAS BROKEN THE MOLD; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CRAVING CHANGE, 
WASHINGTON STATE GUARD BULKS UP, SPORTS NEW ATTITUDE -- AND A TATTOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Hill is a work in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 His body, jersey number and attitude have changed. The flawless mechanics and 
downy-soft release of his jump shot are the only constants in his basketball 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure this year was different. I wanted to have a whole 
different feel for it," said Hill, a Cleveland High graduate and starting 
off-guard for Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, the changes. He bulked up, switched from No. 32 to No. 5, even got a 
tattoo. Inscribed on his right biceps is a dark blue "5." Close inspection 
reveals the artwork, which is about the size of a quarter, is composed of five 
tiny Cs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for concentration, consistency, confidence, composure and 
conditioning," Hill explained. "Coach (Kelvin) Sampson started it. Last year he 
said, 'We have to concentrate and compete.' That stuck in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Hill is a C student of the game. He is averaging 13.9 points a game, 
second only to Cougar point guard Tony Harris (14.8). Despite a slow start this 
season, Hill has made 60 of 137 three-point shots and is fourth in the 
Pacific-10 Conference with a 43.8% shooting percentage. He is shooting 82.1% 
from the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at Eddie as a weapon," said Sampson, whose team is 14-6 and has won 
four of its last five conference games. "He's a role player for us." 
</P>
<P>
 That role is to score, and score often. Unlike Harris, a slashing penetrator, 
Hill floats around the perimeter sizing up his shot. That he has been labeled a 
long-range specialist doesn't bother Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," he said with a shrug, "it's not that bad. I get to shoot. What more 
could you ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 In Hill's case, plenty. He has made difficult demands of his body and, for the 
most part, his body has responded. He began lifting weights seriously after 
last season, adding 20 pounds of muscle to his wiry frame. He pumps iron four 
days a week, two hours a session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thin all my life. This feels good now. It's healthy," he said. 
"Nobody's gonna push me around. If somebody's gonna set a pick, I think I'm 
strong enough to get through there. At the beginning of the season, I was 
bullying a little bit. I'm not doing it anymore, but I think there was a time 
when I wanted to show my strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulging biceps notwithstanding, Hill is no Karl Malone. His 178 pounds are 
distributed on a 6-foot-1 body, making him look solid but far from 
muscle-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fat," Cougar forward Fred Ferguson quipped with a chuckle. "He doesn't 
move like he's fat, but we see it in the weight room." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Ferguson's perspective might be warped by his own build, remarkably 
angular at 6-9, 218 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates tease Hill about his penchant for protein drinks, which he downs 
several times a day to gain even more weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed eats and eats," Ferguson said. "Then he drinks Exceed. He brings it on 
road trips, on the plane. Every time he eats, he drinks one. Man, he don't need 
to gain no weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill isn't complaining. He enjoys his new body. More time in front of the 
mirror, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there is," he said, adding, "In the weight room, I try not to look too 
much. When I first started lifting, a guy told me, 'Don't show off an 
unfinished product,' so I never wear tank tops in the weight room." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, therefore, can inspect his tattoo, which he recently got at a parlor 
in Moscow, Ida. He wanted a "5" on his arm for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been my favorite number," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic behind that is unorthodox -- he has tried to identify everything in 
his life that corresponds with five, or a multiple thereof. For instance, he 
wore No. 32 during his career at Cleveland and first three seasons at WSU. 
Three plus two is five. 
</P>
<P>
 Another: There are five letters in Eddie. He was born on the sixth day of 
April, the fourth month ("Four, five , six," he said, "it kind of flows."). On 
and on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go out with a bang," he said. "Do something different. We haven't 
made the NCAA tournament since I've been here, and maybe this will help." 
</P>
<P>
 With such bizarre reasoning, it is little wonder Hill's major is psychology. 
He plans to counsel and coach after college -- provided his playing career 
comes to a close -- in order to apply his studies. But a psychology background 
helps even now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a shooter is mental warfare," he said. "When you're shooting from 20 
feet, the shots aren't going to fall down all the time. You've got to be 
mentally tough and keep shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 He learned that lesson the hard way, sloshing through a slump at the start of 
the season during which he connected on one-third of his shots from beyond the 
arc, an ice-cold stretch by his standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie used to base his whole existence on whether his shot went in or not," 
Sampson said. "I said, 'OK, Eddie, let's look at our plus-minus chart.' That 
rewards kids for getting loose balls, taking charges, getting defensive 
rebounds, getting to the free-throw line, all the dirty work. Eddie is 
increasing in those areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Improving, yes, but as Hill is quick to admit, he's an unfinished product.

DIGEST: SANTA CLARA'S O'BRIEN LOSES HIS COACHING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom O'Brien, football coach at Santa Clara High the past three seasons, has 
been relieved of his duties. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, 38, compiled a 7-23 record directing the Saints, including 2-10 in 
Frontier League play. He was told of the school's decision by Sister Anne 
Eugene Metcalf, the principal, and Athletic Director Lou Cvijanovich. O'Brien 
will continue to teach mathematics and science at Santa Clara, according to 
Cvijanovich. 
</P>
<P>
 A new coach has not been named, but Cvijanovich hinted that the individual may 
have to be chosen from the Santa Clara faculty because there are currently no 
teacher openings at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank High will announce its new head football coach on Tuesday, according 
to Athletic Director Frank Kallem. 
</P>
<P>
 A 13-member selection committee composed of administrators, players, parents 
and community members interviewed St. Genevieve Coach Richard Fong, Montclair 
Prep assistant John Hazelton and Glendale College assistant Robert Dos Remedios 
on Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, a Burbank school district official said that Hazelton was 
a heavy favorite of the selection committee going into the interview segment of 
the hiring process. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis Delmatoff, the quarterback at Pierce College last season, has enrolled 
in classes at Valley College but it is not clear whether he will play for the 
Monarchs next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Coach Jim Fenwick said Delmatoff transferred to the Van Nuys school but 
didn't discount the possibility that the former Hart High quarterback could 
return to Pierce next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmatoff enrolled at Valley before last football season but transferred to 
Pierce, where he passed for 1,961 yards and nine touchdowns. Tennis  
</P>
<P>
 Free public demonstrations and clinics will highlight the rededication of the 
Burbank Tennis Center at McCambridge Park today.  
</P>
<P>
 The event will mark the grand opening of a pro shop, concession stand and 
temporary clubhouse and will showcase future expansion plans by the tennis 
center's new tenants, Paul Xanthos and Steve Starleaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Xanthos, the former Pierce College men's coach, is director of tennis. 
Starleaf, once a Burbank High player, is manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Mayor George Battey Jr. and his staff, the Burbank Department of Parks 
and Recreation staff, and Jack Kramer, the Southern California Tennis Assn. 
president, are expected to attend the ceremonies, which start at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Tennis Center is located at 1515 N. Glenoaks Blvd. Water Polo  
</P>
<P>
 Andy Bruininga, a senior driver for the Royal High team, has been selected 
sixth-team All-Southern California and 10th-team All-American by the California 
and Hawaii Coaches Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruininga was an All-Southern Section selection last fall.

COMMERCEBANCORP REPORTS '93 LOSS OF $12.7 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Struggling CommerceBancorp, working its way through bad loans and real estate 
it owns through foreclosure, reported an annual loss of $12.7 million, equal to 
$5.36 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss -- nearly quadruple the $3.6-million loss, or $1.53 a share, for the 
previous year -- has brought the company's CommerceBank subsidiary 
precipitously close to being critically undercapitalized -- a category that 
could lead to a federal takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators, however, have approved the company's plan to raise $12 million to 
$15 million in a stock offering to current shareholders and to the public. Dale 
E. Walter, company president, said he hopes to obtain regulatory approval soon 
and to start selling stock by mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, he pointed out, has improved greatly since the third quarter, 
reducing its bad loans and foreclosed real estate from about $21 million to $11 
million. It also has socked so much away in reserves for possible loan losses, 
he said, that the cash available covers 95% of the bank's bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of its strategy, the bank has been reducing its loans and other 
assets. At the end of December, its total assets stood at $187.9 million, a 28% 
drop from $259.3 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual revenue dropped 30% to $11.8 million last year from $16.9 million the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fourth quarter, the company lost $3.2 million, a slight improvement 
over the $3.7 million lost for the last three months of 1992. Quarterly revenue 
fell 40% to $2.4 million from $4 million.

 Bank Buys Mortgage Rights: Imperial Credit Industries Inc., a mortgage banking 
firm in Newport Beach, said Friday that it will pay about $6.9 million to 
purchase the mortgage servicing rights on a $1-billion loan portfolio from the 
Resolution Trust Corp. The acquisition became effective Monday, though the sale 
price will not be paid until May. The deal gives Imperial Credit the right to 
bill borrowers and collect payments on loans totaling $5.3 billion while 
earning a servicing fee that will bring about $3.6 million in revenue for the 
first year.The fee equals 0.38 percentage points on each loan. The portfolio 
contains 4,055 loans averaging $253,000 each. The publicly held company, which 
is 40.3% owned by Imperial Bank in Inglewood, expects to continue to purchase 
mortgage servicing rights from a variety of mortgage companies and other 
lenders.

EAVESDROPPING ON JOE WILLIAMS; JAZZ: THE SINGER, WHO PLAYS THE IRVINE BARCLAY 
WITH HIS TRIO TONIGHT, SAYS, 'YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TWO-WAY CONVERSATION' WITH THE 
INSTRUMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Williams, who came to fame as Count Basie's vocalist in the '50s, '60s and 
'70s, likes to talk about music. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now the amiable singer is chatting about the difference between working 
with a string orchestra -- as he does on his latest recording, "Here's to Life" 
-- and performing with his trio, as he will tonight at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our work, we listen as we perform," Williams began, using the editorial 
"we." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a conversation if you do it right," he said. "With a trio, there's 
less to concentrate on, whereas if there are 50 or 100 strings, these are 
voices that must be listened to. We must communicate with them, and so the 
listening attention span must be broadened." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams went on about the idea of performance as conversation, focusing on 
working with his trio, which features the redoubtable pianist Norman Simmons, 
who'll be with the singer at the Irvine Barclay. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a two-way conversation, between you and the other 
instruments, as opposed to one dominating," Williams, 75, said in a phone 
interview from the Las Vegas home he shares with his wife of 35 years, Jillean. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you must have someone supporting what you say, what you sing, and you 
both have to move out of the way and listen to what the other has to say as 
well. It's a matter of having feeling for each other. You know when it's done 
right, because as soon as it's over, you look at each other and smile, because 
the communication was perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a moment to talk about his camaraderie with Simmons, whom he's known 
for 40 years and with whom he's been working for close to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives me big support, the biggest," Williams said. "He's a truly 
dedicated, genuine musician." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For "Here's to Life," the singer with the luxurious, cavernous baritone worked 
with a 39-piece orchestra arranged and conducted by the acclaimed Canadian 
composer-arranger Robert Farnon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, man, that was grand, I would say," Williams said. "It really felt 
marvelous. That kind of presentation takes the feelings of love and frustration 
or whatever to another peak, as opposed to down and dirty and bumpy," as in a 
blueslike "Cherry Red." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams sings a lyric from that tune: 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, mama, rock me in your big brass bed until my face turns cherry red!"  
</P>
<P>
 One senses, even through the telephone line, that Williams is smiling as he 
sings the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Such numbers were the stuff around which Williams built his repertoire with 
Basie. But he's recorded in many other contexts, even with string sections. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he says, "people have learned, I think, that when you go and see 
Joe Williams, it isn't likely that he will sound like one of his recordings for 
long. Ever since I left Basie, I've been doing something else, something 
different each show. After all, variety is the spice of life." 
</P>
<P>
 He names a few tunes, some quite obscure. He's asked if he can remember any 
well enough to sing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most times. It's a happy feeling, I want you to know, when everything falls 
into place." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, whose career began in the late '30s and early '40s with the 
orchestras of Andy Kirk and Coleman Hawkins, doesn't hit the road like he used 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take two, three months off," he said with a laugh. "Then I can go back and 
hit it real good. But I gotta have that time off. Otherwise, my whole body 
says, 'Hold it. This isn't fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his association with Basie, Williams is succinct: "We had mutual 
respect. I recognized him as someone I might learn something from, and, of 
course, I did. So much." 
</P>
<P>
 * Joe Williams appears tonight at 8 at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. $19 to $28.

THE WAY WE RURAL; 'HILLBILLIES' CREATOR PAUL HENNING, TO BE HONORED IN SANTA 
ANA, LOOKS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "The Manhattan Hillbillies"? 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't quite work, does it? Yet the original idea for a TV series about a 
backwoods family that strikes it rich and moves to the big city had the clan 
relocating to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the few cases where a Beverly Hills address was the less expensive 
choice, creators of "The Beverly Hillbillies" opted for the exclusive West 
Coast neighborhood primarily because it was closer to their studios in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 So says Paul Henning, creator, writer and producer of the show that was one of 
the biggest hits of the 1960s, staying at the top of the Nielsen heap for the 
bulk of its nine-year run. Now 82 and retired, Henning is to be honored in 
Santa Ana tonight at Rancho Santiago College's annual "Tribute to a Television 
Classic" fund-raiser for the school's telecommunications department. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of Beverly Hills over New York may have been one of simple 
economics and convenience, but Henning's colleagues frequently praise his 
ability to make the right decision about virtually everything, from concept to 
casting to scripts in the shows he developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those shows include the "Beverly Hillbillies" spinoff "Petticoat Junction" and 
the earlier "The Bob Cummings Show." Henning also was executive producer of 
"Green Acres," another rural-based comedy from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always loved hillbilly humor," he said last week on the phone from his home 
in Toluca Lake. "The only drawback, as I saw it, was the setting. I went to see 
'Tobacco Road,' and I laughed at the humor, but I deplored the setting. It was 
so depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'If I could take a hillbilly family and put them in a 
lush setting, a more upbeat setting . . . ' That's really what it amounted to." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Henning was tapping his own roots. He was born in Independence, Mo. 
-- Harry S. Truman's hometown -- and was a Boy Scout when he first encountered 
inhabitants of the Ozark mountains in rural southern Missouri/northern 
Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "After two weeks of scout camp in Knoll, Mo., on the Arkansas border, I fell 
in love with that part of the country and the characters I ran into." Years 
later, he dropped out of the Kansas City School of Law to pursue an 
entertainment career. (There are, after all, so few instances when a lawyer can 
hoot "Welllllll, dogies!" in court.) 
</P>
<P>
 He landed a job as a singer for a local radio station and turned to writing 
quite by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, unless you were commercially sponsored, you worked for 
nothing. I finally got a (sponsor). . . . The first big supermarket chain was 
coming into Kansas City, so the independent grocers in the area formed a group, 
Associated Grocers, and wanted to get a radio program. I came up with the idea 
that another fellow and I would run an imaginary grocery store and sing about 
the products by way of advertising. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the manager of the station and told him my idea. He said, 'That's 
fine. Write it.' I said, 'I'm a singer, not a writer.' He said, 'If you want to 
sing it, you've got to write it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From Kansas City, Henning moved to Chicago and into national radio, writing 
for "The Fibber McGee and Molly Show." A year later, he decided to try his luck 
in the entertainment mecca of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent some time turning out radio sketches for Rudy Vallee, and then, after 
World War II, he landed a spot writing for Burns and Allen. With them, he made 
the transition from radio to television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television was altogether different," he recalls. "I used to say after I got 
into TV that writing for radio was stealing money." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many TV pioneers, Henning had to feel his way into a medium that was 
centered visually rather than aurally.  
</P>
<P>
 "In radio, you created an imaginative situation and as matter of fact one or 
two talented actors and actresses usually played six or seven parts," he said. 
"In TV, you were in a movie situation. It was a difficult transition." 
</P>
<P>
 But Henning adapted. He wrote for Dennis Day, Ray Bolger and "The Real McCoys" 
before getting the opportunity to create a show of his own -- "The Bob Cummings 
Show," which ran from 1955-59. 
</P>
<P>
 "In radio, the writers would always console one another when the producer 
would say, 'Take out this scene.' So we all were anxious to get into that 
chair. You decided which to take out. It was great. I enjoyed it, but it was a 
lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd introduced some hillbilly characters into episodes of "Burns and Allen" 
and "The Bob Cummings Show," so when Filmways president Al Simon asked him to 
develop a new sitcom, it wasn't a tremendous stretch for Henning to concoct 
"The Beverly Hillbillies." 
</P>
<P>
 He created the show with Buddy Ebsen in mind to play patriarch Jed Clampett. 
Bea Benaderet had asked Henning for the role of Granny, but when Irene Ryan did 
a screen test with Ebsen, even Benaderet conceded that she was the perfect 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The show reached No. 1 within two weeks of its debut in September, 1962. And 
just a year later, its success spun off "Petticoat Junction," set in the 
mythical Midwestern town of Hooterville. "Junction" revolved around the Bradley 
family -- Kate (Benaderet), daughters Billie Jo (Jeannine Riley, later played 
by Gunilla Hutton, then by Meredith McRae), Bobbie Jo (Pat Woodell, later Lori 
Saunders) and Betty Jo (Linda Kaye Henning, Paul Henning's daughter), and Uncle 
Joe Carson (Edgar Buchanan). 
</P>
<P>
 (Among those expected at tonight's tribute, besides Henning himself, are 
"Hillbillies" stars Ebsen, Donna Douglas and Max Baer Jr. (Ryan died in 1973), 
"Petticoat" alumni McRae, Saunders and Linda Kaye Henning, and "Green Acres" 
director Richard Bare and cast members Eddie Albert and Alvy Moore. Eva Gabor 
is still a "maybe," according to Terry Bales, organizer of the event. New York, 
reportedly, is where she'd rather stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that he'd spawned two highly rated series, CBS offered Henning carte 
blanche with another half an hour in prime time; he could do any show he 
wanted. But, as Henning recalls, his plate was overloaded as it was, and he 
wasn't about to ride herd over another show the way he had with "Hillbillies" 
and "Petticoat." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Jay Sommers, who had worked on some "Hillbillies" episodes, approached 
Henning and suggested a television adaptation of a radio series he'd done 
briefly in the early '50s, "Granby's Green Acres." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning liked the idea and agreed to serve as executive producer. He felt 
Gabor would be perfect as Lisa, the ditzy socialite wife of 
lawyer-turned-farmer Oliver Wendell Douglas, a role that went to veteran screen 
actor Albert. Henning also proposed setting the show in Hooterville and 
cross-pollinating the casts (and with them, presumably, the audiences) of 
"Green Acres," "Beverly Hillbillies" and "Petticoat Junction." 
</P>
<P>
 But except for those early contributions, Henning is staunch about giving all 
credit for the surrealistically silly "Green Acres" to Sommers and his 
collaborator Dick Chevillat, both of whom died in the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Benaderet died in the late '60s, and as a result, by the end of the decade 
"Petticoat Junction's" ratings were falling off. So were "Hillbillies'," and 
although "Green Acres" remained popular, CBS executives had decided that rural 
comedy was out, relevant social drama was in. So "Green Acres" was canceled, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoyed what we were doing, so it was sad to see them take the show off," 
Henning said. "I thought there was lots of mileage left. I was sorry to see the 
show go after it had run for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 But Henning was nearly 60 at the time, and the idea of attempting another TV 
show didn't interest him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I retired. I really didn't want to work that hard anymore." He was credited 
as co-writer of the 1985 Steve Martin-Michael Caine film "Dirty Rotten 
Scoundrels," but that, he said, was only because the movie essentially was a 
remake of "Bedtime Story," a Marlon Brando-David Niven comedy he'd written in 
1964. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the continuing popularity of the TV shows he created, Henning said he's 
"happy about it, but I'm not particularly surprised. If they were popular once, 
why shouldn't they still be? Buddy Ebsen said he feels if 'Hillbillies' was 
being shot today, it'd be just as popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning confessed that he still hasn't seen last year's big-budget film 
version of his creation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really can't tell you why -- maybe I'm just chicken," he said with a 
chuckle. "But I'm glad it was successful."

HENNING'S LONGEST-RUNNING WORK

 Paul Henning remembers that he got his first entertainment job "of any 
national prominence" with the help of Ruth Barth, an actress he'd met while he 
was a singer at KMBC radio in Kansas City. Barth had gone to Chicago to find 
bigger acting roles, heard about the need for a writer on "The Fibber McGee and 
Molly Show" and told Henning about it. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed the spot, and after writing for "Fibber McGee" for about a year, he 
moved to Los Angeles seeking other work. "I'd always wanted to come to the West 
Coast," he said. "I thought it was the most wonderful place I'd ever been." 
Once here, he also realized Barth was the most wonderful woman he'd ever met. 
He proposed -- by mail -- and she accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "She took the train from Chicago, and a couple friends of mine drove me from 
L.A. We met in Yuma and got married. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was touch and go for a while. Ruth and I went through some really bad 
times trying to make a living, but we stuck it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. The Hennings celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary last month.

 The 28-foot mobile generator that provided juice for rock's first 
solar-powered album, "Alternative NRG," will be on display today from noon to 4 
p.m. at the Virgin MegaStore at Triangle Square on Newport Boulevard in Costa 
Mesa. Also on hand will be Dave Wakeling, the English Beat/General Public 
singer (and Dana Point resident) who spearheaded the recording project, a 
benefit for the environmental group Greenpeace. The album features 16 tracks by 
such acts as R.E.M., U2, Midnight Oil, Sonic Youth and Annie Lennox, most of 
them recorded live with equipment powered by the specially designed solar unit. 
UB40's contribution, "Sing Our Own Song," was recorded in August at Irvine 
Meadows. (714) 645-9906.

 Steve Jacobs of the Swamp Zombies spent an interesting New Year's Eve in 
Hamburg, Germany, playing an opening set with his own band, then serving as 
pickup bass player and backup singer for alternative-rock cult hero Alex 
Chilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilton had flown over by himself to play the club gig and was looking for a 
rhythm section. Jacobs volunteered, rehearsed five or six songs before the 
show, had dinner with Chilton and then joined him for a set of the rehearsed 
material and some off-the-cuff numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The eccentric but greatly engaging Chilton has been celebrated by Paul 
Westerberg, the Posies, Teen Age Fanclub and many other young rockers who cite 
his overlooked 1970s band Big Star as a major smart-pop influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never even heard of Big Star before I'd played with him," Jacobs 
confessed. "I knew the Box Tops (the '60s band Chilton fronted in his teen-idol 
days) and had heard some of his solo stuff. I kept asking him to do 'The 
Letter' (a No. 1 hit for the Box Tops in 1967), but he wouldn't do it. He's a 
really nice guy, down to earth, and I had a lot of fun playing with him. He 
even gave me some money after the show: 100 marks."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; AMTRAK SERVICE IS RESUMED TO BURBANK AIRPORT; 
TRANSPORTATION: STATEWIDE EFFORT TO LINK DIFFERENT TYPES OF MASS TRANSIT DOES 
NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDE STOP FOR AIRPORT-BOUND METROLINK RIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amtrak service to Burbank Airport, suspended for more than a year, began anew 
Friday as part of a statewide effort to link different types of mass transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers on the Santa Barbara-San Diego line can now disembark six times a 
day at the airport's southeast edge on a new boarding platform, construction of 
which was hurried along after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we always talk about is a seamless transportation system. . . .We wanted 
to seize this opportunity" to resume train service to the airport quickly after 
the Jan. 17 temblor, said James W. van Loben Sels, director of Caltrans, a 
partner with Amtrak on the new stop. 
</P>
<P>
 However, airport-bound Metrolink riders, who pass directly through the new 
stop on the Moorpark line, will still have to travel to downtown Burbank and 
double back on a free shuttle provided by the airport -- even though Metrolink 
owns the tracks and has been invited by Caltrans to use the airport platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Airport and Ventura County transportation officials have pressed 
Metrolink for direct airport service as a convenience to train commuters from 
Moorpark and the western San Fernando Valley. But Metrolink chief Richard 
Stanger said there would be too few users to justify another stop of the train. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a wildly good day, you'll probably have maybe a dozen, maybe 20 people" 
who would use the airport stop, Stanger said. "That's only 1% or less of our 
ridership on that line. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you're causing 99% of our people to stop two minutes to let 1% get off and 
go to the airport when they could have gone to Burbank, and for admittedly a 
little more time gone to the airport from the downtown Burbank station." 
</P>
<P>
 To gauge interest in a stop on their perimeter, Burbank Airport officials have 
begun conducting a survey of Metrolink riders and will present the results next 
week to the Southern California Regional Rail Authority, which oversees 
Metrolink. The authority will consider the issue at its Friday meeting, 
including Stanger's recommendation not to add the platform stop to the 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanger noted that the new stop, on Empire Avenue just west of Hollywood Way, 
does not meet certain Metrolink requirements, such as adequate parking space 
nearby. Also, Stanger said travelers have many more options if they use the 
Metrolink Burbank station, the nexus for frequent trains headed to Union 
Station, Ventura County and the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that the rail authority can waive its requirements and 
that there could be a pool of commuters who would use the airport stop to get 
to businesses close by. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Davis, a Simi Valley councilman on the rail authority board, said he 
believes the board will approve making the airport stop part of Metrolink's 
itinerary at least on a trial basis, a move Davis himself strongly backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could only get 10 people to use this stop, it'd be worth it," said 
Davis, who represents Ventura County on the board. "It'd be 20 less trips on 
the freeway, and all for a minute and a half" more on the Metrolink schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Burbank Airport provides a free shuttle service to and from the 
downtown Burbank Metrolink station -- about a 10-minute journey. Jennifer 
Lewis, the airport's transportation coordinator, said the tram carries 100 
riders daily, up from 35 before the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite a mix of people that work in the area, airport passengers and 
people that work at the airport," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new open-air platform, which had been scheduled for construction later 
this year, cost $130,000 and is a temporary structure until a permanent one can 
be built, probably by next year, according to Caltrans spokesman John Robin 
Witt. The new stop will not be staffed. Tickets will be sold on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak service -- one train daily in either direction -- was curtailed in 
mid-1992 to allow Metrolink to develop its operations along the railway. Amtrak 
representative Ronald Scolaro estimated that between 6,000 and 7,000 passengers 
used the stop each year, or 16 to 19 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The new schedule includes three trains a day in both directions, the earliest 
arriving at the airport at 9:45 a.m. en route to Los Angeles and the latest at 
8:31 p.m. going north. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Steve Oliva of Del Mar was the lone passenger -- and perhaps the 
first all day -- to use the airport stop, getting off about 2:30 p.m. for a 
surprise weekend visit to his girlfriend in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was terrific. Normally I would drive," said Oliva, 28, who had originally 
expected to disembark in Glendale. "I haven't taken an Amtrak (train) since 
1986." 
</P>
<P>
 But once off the platform he had no idea where he was or how he would get to 
his girlfriend's place -- until reporters pointed out a waiting airport shuttle 
that could take him to a taxi rank.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SIMI VALLEY FREEWAY TO REOPEN IN 2 WEEKS; 
HIGHWAYS: TRAFFIC ON THE REPAIRED SECTION WILL BE RESTRICTED TO TWO LANES IN 
EACH DIRECTION. COMPLETION OF THE OVERALL PROJECT COULD TAKE A YEAR.

<P>
 Relief is in sight for the beleaguered, pre-earthquake users of the Simi 
Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In about two weeks, the section of the freeway shut down by the earthquake -- 
from Reseda Boulevard to the Foothill Freeway -- will be reopened, Caltrans 
officials said Friday. Traffic will, however, be restricted to two lanes in 
each direction on the normally eight-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be utilizing the westbound lanes," said Jack Hallin, Caltrans deputy 
district director. "They will be re-striped for service in both directions." 
</P>
<P>
 The supports on the eastbound lanes have already been demolished in 
preparation for their reconstruction. The supports under the westbound lanes 
were also badly damaged but have been shored up by timbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be perfectly safe," Hallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next two weeks, the shored-up lanes will be repaved. By the time 
they are ready, the transitions from the Simi to the Golden State and San Diego 
freeways will also be back in service, Hallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks will be allowed on the reopened lanes as long as they are carrying 
loads under the legal weight limit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, work will proceed on the eastbound side with the rebuilding 
projected to take about about six months. Then all traffic will be rerouted to 
those lanes while the westbound side is demolished and rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be 10 months to a year until we get all the lanes completed and the 
freeway looks like it used to," Hallin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebuilt freeway will be better able to withstand a major earthquake, he 
said. "There will be some additions to (the original) design" by designers and 
engineers using seismic data from the earthquake, Hallin said. He said 
modifications will be made to "the bridges, the columns, the footings." 
</P>
<P>
 The partial reopening of the Simi Valley Freeway, which is a key freeway in 
the north San Fernando Valley, was a high priority for Caltrans, according to 
Hallin. Bidding on the paving contract was opened on Thursday and the contract 
was awarded the same day. The repaving began Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a quick process," Hallin said. "We can do it when we have to." 
</P>
<P>
 The winning bid of about $4 million was submitted by a joint venture of 
Security Paving Co. of Sun Valley and Reyes Construction of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 If the companies finish within 14 calendar days they will get a bonus, Hallin 
said. If they take longer than the allotted time, they'll pay penalties.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 'RECOVERY' STILL TOPIC OF BUSINESS MEETING

<TEXT>
<P>
 As surely as it leveled buildings and scattered plans, the Northridge 
earthquake has provided the San Fernando Valley a chance to reconsider its 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 That opportunity won't be lost on business leaders who have rescheduled a 
meeting on the region's economic future for 7:30 a.m. Wednesday at Airtel Plaza 
Hotel in Van Nuys.The event originally was scheduled for Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting, because the theme of it has been recovery -- and that was 
before the earthquake," said Fred Gaines, a board member of the Valley Industry 
and Commerce Assn. (VICA), which is sponsoring the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even have to change the theme. We were talking about the recession. 
People talk about recovery now and they think of the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop will focus on a regional comprehensive plan being developed by 
the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG), a coalition of elected 
officials from five Southland counties. The plan attempts to map how the region 
will develop in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is the first time anyone has sat down and tried to put together a 
plan for the entire area," said Gaines, who also serves on an advisory board to 
SCAG. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets cost $10 and can be reserved through VICA, through Monday. GEOFFREY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; BRANCH OF MALIBU COURT REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas branch of the Malibu Judicial District reopened this week after 
being closed since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to handle most cases scheduled for Calabasas in Malibu, although 
it was crowded there," Judicial District Manager Ruth Goziker said."We were 
holding court at the information counters and in kitchens -- everywhere. But it 
worked very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas courthouse, 5030 N. Parkway Calabasas, opened Thursday after 
being closed since the quake, in which the building sustained about $40,000 of 
damage to walls, windows, floor tiles, light fixtures and other furnishings, 
Goziker said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no structural damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mess," Goziker said. "But the landlord responded quickly and got the 
building repaired right away." 
</P>
<P>
 The front driveway of the building, which is used for traffic, small claims 
and civil cases, may be unusable due to a 15-foot fissure, Goziker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Night court is scheduled to begin again Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases scheduled during the period of closure that were not heard in Malibu 
were postponed several weeks, said Brenda Wilderman, a court clerk in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got plenty of time to hear all the cases," Wilderman said. "We're 
fine." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; PHARMACY'S MURAL PAINTS PICTURE OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where others saw drab pine boards, Barry Pascal saw opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 After the owner of the Northridge Pharmacy lost nearly all his shop's windows 
in the Jan. 17 earthquake, he covered the gaps with plywood, then commissioned 
a local artist to paint a mural on the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal, who owns what is thought to be the oldest continuously operating 
business in Northridge, said he wanted to turn his earthquake damage into a 
"rallying point for the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The mural, which spans the length of his storefront, has a Wizard of Oz theme. 
Dorothy, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow are accompanied by the inscription 
"There is STILL no place like home" -- a defiant rejoinder to those who are 
fast fleeing Northridge for more stable ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy went to Oz because of a tornado, a natural disaster reminiscent of an 
earthquake, said Pascal. "We wanted to say that even though we have had all 
this catastrophe, there is still no place like home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northridge is still a great place to live," added his wife, Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal said the mural has been a great success among customers who have been 
flocking to the store since the earthquake. "Incredible," remarked one woman, 
who came to buy a paste used in mending cracks in counter tops. 
</P>
<P>
 The store remained open throughout the most chaotic period immediately 
following the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal said there was no way to close since the entire front of the shop was 
shattered. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake sent shelves of cosmetics flying, and destroyed untold numbers of 
decorative dolls and small porcelain objects. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, though, the Pascals managed to restore some order. The mural went 
up Tuesday, and the Valentine's Day displays have been carefully arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal grew up in Encino, and bought the Northridge Pharmacy about 20 years 
ago. The store, one of a few remaining independently owned drugstores, dates 
back about 65 years, Pascal said. Pascal has been reluctant to replace the 
windows in front of his shop because of the frequent aftershocks. He says he 
may leave the mural up for a few months, and believes it is helping repair 
Northridge's bruised confidence. Besides, he added, "it looks better than 
plywood." JILL LEOVY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSANDS JOIN RELIEF EFFORT, BUT MORE NEEDED

<P>
 At the Volunteer Center of San Fernando Valley's Panorama City office, 
volunteers are lined up at 30 telephones, matching those who need help with 
those willing to give it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the creation of the Volunteer Reception Center phone bank a few days 
after the quake, the group has received about 400 requests for help and has 
taken calls from about 3,000 individuals or groups wanting to donate time to 
the relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, 20 volunteers went to the Salvation Army Shelter at Canoga 
Park High School to distribute some of the 10,000 children's sweat suits 
donated by Big 5 Sporting Goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The sporting goods company had called the Volunteer Reception Center Thursday 
morning asking where to take the sweat suits, said Suzanne Lewis, spokeswoman 
for the center. More sweat suits will be distributed at other shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a wonderful response. People have responded with care and warmth," 
said Pat Paolilli, director of the Los Angeles Volunteerism Project, a 
consortium of six volunteer centers that created the Reception Center. But, she 
added, more help is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 The center needs more volunteers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need bilingual translators in Spanish, Korean, just about any language 
that we have in the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are also needed to repair community-based centers heavily damaged 
by the quake, and to perform clerical work, which, Paolilli said, is "not 
always the most popular thing. But we need that." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the city's Building and Safety Department needs volunteers to 
process paperwork, to make sure damage assessment forms are accurate and are 
sent quickly through the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita City Hall needs bilingual volunteers, clerical and telephone 
helpers, and counselors to talk to victims in shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 PAWS, a Santa Monica pet shelter, needs volunteers to help connect lost 
animals with their owners or find new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon's office needs 150 volunteers a day for clerical 
and field work in Sylmar, Sun Valley and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is also fielding calls for the United Way, Salvation Army and the 
American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The Volunteerism Project will continue to seek volunteers as more agencies 
realize their needs and as needs change -- moving from the crisis stage to 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all expecting this will extend over the weeks, months or years," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To all of us lucky enough not to have our homes damaged and our lives 
completely disrupted, we need to keep in mind there are many more who are 
unfortunate and will continue to need volunteer help." 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer or to request help, call the Volunteer Reception Center at (800) 
908-5170. REBECCA BRYANT

SENTENCE REDUCED FOR SINGER'S GIRLFRIEND; COURTS: JUDGE ACTED BECAUSE RICK 
JAMES, CONVICTED OF MORE SERIOUS CRIMES, WOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED SOONER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Expressing resentment that he was forced to do so by a possible scandal in the 
district attorney's office, a judge Friday reduced from four years to two the 
prison sentence imposed on the girlfriend of funk singer Rick James for 
assaulting a woman during a drug party. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff originally sentenced Tanya Anne 
Hijazi, 23, after she pleaded guilty to one count of assaulting Mary Sauger in 
the St. James's Club & Hotel in West Hollywood in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff said he felt compelled to reduce the sentence, which would have kept 
Hijazi in custody until late 1995, because James, who was sentenced to a drug 
rehabilitation program, will probably be released this fall, although he was 
found guilty of more serious offenses than Hijazi for the same incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's intolerable," Hoff said as he read a prepared statement. "It wouldn't 
be fair to Ms. Hijazi or to our system of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard B. Levine, Hijazi's attorney, said that under the new sentence, he 
hopes to see her released in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge sentenced James last month to five years and four months in prison, 
but this term was stayed when he was admitted to the California Rehabilitation 
Center in Norco. If James successfully completes the 8 1/2-month treatment 
program, he will be released on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 James, the self-proclaimed "King of Funk" best known for the 1981 hit "Super 
Freak," is engaged to Hijazi and they have a 21-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing author Charles Dickens, Hoff said recent events in the case have shown 
him "the best of times and the worst of times." 
</P>
<P>
 James' light sentence and the reduction of Hijazi's prison term come in the 
wake of an investigation into what sources close to the case said are 
allegations of misconduct by an investigator in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very troubled by this entire case, and in particular the recent events 
which have brought us here," Hoff said, referring to what he called "the 
criminal investigation" and James' "good fortune and luck." 
</P>
<P>
 The probe is focusing on the possibility that the investigator, who did not 
work on the James case, provided drugs to Michelle Allen, one of three women 
who testified against James, according to sources close to the case. Allen, who 
was in custody on theft charges and was not named as a victim, testified to 
bolster the prosecution's contention that James chronically abused women. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff said he was also disappointed that a gag order he issued to protect the 
investigation has been violated, leading to news accounts of the alleged 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "there is a very bright side to this horrible situation," Hoff said. 
The judge made it clear that the prosecutor in the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Andrew Flier, acted with a "high degree of personal integrity and honesty" and 
in no way was accused of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, saying they had a case fraught with difficulties and that the two 
victims did not want to testify again, agreed to the sentencing deal under 
which James is expected to be freed this year -- even though he faced the 
possibility of life in prison if he were convicted in a second trial on charges 
the jury was unable to resolve during a first trial. 
</P>
<P>
 While the case has now been tainted by the investigation, Hoff reminded 
everyone that in "the simplest terms, this case is about cocaine, abuse and 
assaultive behavior toward women." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day she and James were set to go on trial, Hijazi pleaded guilty to 
assault. In exchange for her plea, prosecutors dropped a dozen other charges 
that carried a potential life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, James went to trial and was convicted on Sept. 17 of assaulting and 
imprisoning Sauger, 35. While he was acquitted on several charges, the jury 
deadlocked 11 to 1 in favor of guilt on six charges, including two counts of 
torture. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal that saw him go into a drug treatment program instead of 
prison, James also pleaded guilty of assaulting a second woman at his Hollywood 
Hills home in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truly and undoubtedly, his crimes were the result of his crack cocaine 
addiction," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen L. Cooley, who supervised the 
prosecution and defended the decision to support drug treatment over prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Levine characterized Hijazi as a victim who also received 
beatings from James. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that she's not going to be incarcerated longer than Rick," said 
Hijazi's mother, Susanne Shapiro. "I think the judge was very fair," she said. 
"It gives me a little more faith in the criminal justice system."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; POST-QUAKE USE OF AIR PARK FAILS TO SHAKE OLD 
DEBATE; AGUA DULCE: AN L.A. COUNTY PANEL CONSIDERS WHAT TO DO WITH THE SITE. 
NEIGHBORS FEAR AIRPORT EXPANSION.

<P>
 The Northridge earthquake failed to break a decade-old holding pattern on the 
fate of the Agua Dulce Air Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots say activity following the Jan. 17 Northridge quake proves the value of 
the airport to Los Angeles County, while neighbors say it shows how unnecessary 
the facility really is.  
</P>
<P>
 It's all fodder for an advisory group pondering if the county should buy, 
lease or leave the site alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly interested as a commission in protecting an air park if we 
think it's a benefit to the community of Los Angeles, not just Agua Dulce," 
said Jim Burton, chairman of the Los Angeles County Aviation Commission 
subcommittee examining the air park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the week after the quake, the strip transported five law enforcement 
officers from Santa Clarita to San Fernando and Santa Monica and several 
insurance adjusters into the valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Utility company representatives flew in and checked for damage to oil and 
telephone lines and pilots had access to families and workers otherwise 
isolated by the collapsed Newhall Pass, according to activity logs provided by 
airport officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show 464 flights in and out of the private airport from Jan. 17 to 23, 
more than six times its normal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-quake actions at the air park have swayed neither supporters nor 
opponents of a suggested county purchase of the 208-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents fear county ownership will bring increased noise, traffic and 
planes. They downplay recent air park activity, saying pilots are using scare 
tactics and that airborne assistance arrived easily with or without runways. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious help was rendered by helicopters, not fixed-wing planes," said 
Jo Anne Swanson, who opposes expansion of the airport. "They turned themselves 
into a big helipad." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime members of this 2,100-resident community have watched for years as 
proposals to change the airstrip from private to public have come and gone. Two 
previous written and telephone surveys of Agua Dulce residents demonstrated 
majority opposition to any airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't changed my mind at all," said Bernice Cressy, a 12-year neighbor of 
the air park. "The Santa Clarita Valley wouldn't have suffered, I think, if 
they (pilots at Agua Dulce Air Park) hadn't done something. They just jumped on 
the bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots, who see county ownership of the 35-year-old facility as insurance it 
will not shut down and be turned into residential development, said recent 
usage demonstrates its importance in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake was a bad thing, but it was a great thing for the airport 
here," said Vic Crowe, member of the Agua Dulce Airport Assn., who helped 
compile the logs in the days after the quake. "The value for the airport, at 
least for this disaster, was the availability for businesses, private 
corporations and government agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowe noted there was no damage to the air park's asphalt and dirt runways, 
which some critics said would be unusable following a disaster such as an 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent use of the facility does provide additional information for the county 
Aviation Commission to consider for its April 15 report to the Board of 
Supervisors on what, if anything, to do about the air park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it confirms what we've been saying -- it's an important emergency 
facility," said commission subcommittee chairman Burton after reviewing the 
daily logs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said he knows of no county plan to buy the air park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airport Commission subcommittee is tentatively scheduled March 18 to hold 
another community hearing regarding the air park before presenting its report.  
</P>
<P>
 A similar session in November drew hundreds of pilots and Agua Dulce 
residents, even though a hearing on a controversial off-highway vehicle park 
and a local high school awards ceremony were held the same night.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; TELECOMMUTING TAKES OFF AFTER QUAKE; BUSINESS: 
BUILDING OWNERS ARE CONVERTING UNUSED SPACES INTO WORK STATIONS TO MEET THE 
DEMAND. MOST EMPLOYEES WELCOME THE CHANGE.

<P>
 It took nothing short of an earthquake to shake loose some interest in 
telecommuting.  
</P>
<P>
 A county-funded telecommuting center in the Antelope Valley was virtually 
ignored when it debuted less than a year ago. But since the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake cut off freeway access and caused damage to corporate offices, that 
center and others scheduled to open later this year, have been inundated with 
calls from companies interested in giving their employees an office away from 
the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Telecommuting brings the work to the worker rather than the worker to the 
work," said Jack Nilles, who coined the term and is now president of JALA 
International, a management consultant firm specializing in telecommuting. 
"Electrons are a lot lighter to move than people." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of working at locations other than the traditional office has been 
around since 1973 when Nilles suggested in a book that workers no longer needed 
to show up at an office to get their work done. They can do it from home with a 
telephone and a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the private sector expressed little interest in the county's 
pilot telecommuting project -- the Antelope Telecommuting Center on East Avenue 
K-6 in Lancaster when it opened last year. But in the week following the Jan. 
17 temblor, the center has received more than 30 calls daily from individuals 
and businesses inquiring about leasing space at the 20-person facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand proves that it's the most viable alternative," said Suzette 
Cecchini, the center's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other facilities -- the Santa Clarita Telecommuting Center and the 
Valencia Corporate Telecommuting Center, with a total of 40,000 square feet -- 
had leased all their available spaces within two weeks after the earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have every inch of that place hooked up," said Gary Johnson, technical 
adviser to the Santa Clarita center. 
</P>
<P>
 Both facilities are located at the Valencia Industrial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the sudden popularity of telecommuting has pushed some building 
owners to convert those spaces currently not being used into work stations, 
including Cal State Northridge and the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The university announced plans Friday to convert three of its unused student 
dormitories into telecommuting facilities as soon as next week. The 
ground-floor apartments of the three-story Lupin Hall will be the first 
building in which work stations will be installed and and modifications will be 
made according to clients' needs, CSUN officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal State Northridge is a pivotal part of the Los Angeles community," Blenda 
J. Wilson, university president, said in a news release. "We're pleased to work 
with Pacific Bell to extend our resources to help our neighbors get back to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 CareAmerica Health Plans, based in Chatsworth, is among several companies 
setting up telecommuting centers to ease the long drive to work. The company is 
setting up a second office at the Antelope Valley Telecommuting Center in 
Lancaster so that 14 of its employees who live in the area do not have to make 
the two-hour drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipate that this site will help our employees who previously traveled 
freeways that are now partially closed, and should assist in alleviating the 
already extensive traffic problems that have resulted from the earthquake," 
CareAmerica President Arthur Southam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees like Michelle Hafemeister praised the company's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I have time to watch cartoons and have breakfast with my 2-year-old son, 
Aaron," said Hafemeister, 31, a correspondent and field representative for 
CareAmerica. "And I can be home at a decent hour to have dinner with my 
family."  
</P>
<P>
 Other large companies, including Great Western Bank and Cigna, have rented 
spaces, and 10 others are negotiating for spots at the Valencia Corporate 
Center, which opened in December. The 30,000-square-foot facility is owned and 
run by Newhall Land & Farming Co. It charges users $1.50 per square foot a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We estimated that it would take nine months to fill the spaces," said Steve 
Valenziano, marketing director for the Valencia center. "We did it in two 
weeks. The earthquake accelerated it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more takers than we do space," he added. "All the spaces are 
practically spoken for for a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley center, which can accommodate only 20 people at present, 
plans to expand its facility to meet the higher demands, Cecchini said.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 15 work stations is equipped with a telephone, personal computer, 
modem and various software. In addition, there are five private offices for 
those with confidential work.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there is no charge for users. However, beginning in March, the 
center may charge a fee to recover operating costs when public funding runs 
out, Cecchini said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; 2 ARRESTED INSIDE COLLAPSED APARTMENTS; CRIME: 
THEY'RE CHARGED WITH ILLEGALLY ENTERING NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS COMPLEX. A WITNESS 
SAYS HE SAW TWO MEN TRYING TO REMOVE A TV SET.

<P>
 Police arrested two men Friday morning for illegally entering the condemned 
Northridge Meadows Apartments complex. Officers said that although the men were 
not caught taking anything from the quake-devastated building, they had no 
business there. 
</P>
<P>
 A construction worker saw Timothy Loughton, 24, who lives down the street from 
Northridge Meadows, and Mark Walters, 22, of Van Nuys, inside the structure and 
alerted police, said Devonshire Capt. Bruce Crosley. 
</P>
<P>
 Loughton told police he was a former resident of the building, which was 
untrue, Crosley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible they were looters, but we charged them with entering a 
condemned building," Crosley said. "They had no business to be in there, and 
it's fenced and well-posted." 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives of those who lived in the building, which collapsed during the 
quake and killed 16 people, pointed to several spots where the 6-foot-high 
fence was broken or where people could make their way inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Dunn, 18, ignored warning signs Friday and walked across a wood plank at 
a break in the fence to get inside the structure and check on his parents' 
belongings in Apartment 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked right through there; anyone could just come in," Dunn said. "It's 
wrong if you come back for your last memories and they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Crosley said police have been assigned to the building around the clock, 
although at midday Friday none were visible to Dunn and others who wandered in 
and around the yellow police tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Fitak of Northridge said he was videotaping the structure when he saw two 
men trying to take a television set out of the building and down a ladder. 
"They didn't get much out of there . . . because they couldn't figure out how 
to get it down the ladder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saddest thing is that the police prevent the tenants from going in and 
getting their belongings," Fitak said. "They tell them the places are guarded, 
and they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Crosley said there have been no reports of looting at the apartments, and only 
a few such reports elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how we could guard every red-tagged (condemned) facility," 
Crosley said. "We do our best."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; CHURCH PLANS RACIALLY MIXED BODY; PENTECOSTALS: THE MOVE 
WOULD END THE BLACK-WHITE DIVISION IN A GROUP THAT STARTED IN L.A. AS AN 
INTERRACIAL MOVEMENT IN 1906. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the last national church associations of overwhelmingly white 
denominations, the Pentecostal Fellowship of North America, plans to disband 
and form a racially mixed body. 
</P>
<P>
 The new umbrella organization for as many as 25 denominations would end a 
longstanding religious division in a group that began, ironically, as an 
interracial movement in Los Angeles in 1906. The proposed fellowship would have 
a constituency exceeding 10 million members, including the largest of them all, 
the predominantly black Church of God in Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the extreme margins of Christianity because of its humble 
socioeconomic origins and its exuberant beliefs in healing and supernatural 
events, Pentecostalism today boasts mega-churches and large television 
ministries, as well as its share of controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth also attracts political attention. It was at a national Church of 
God in Christ convention in Memphis on Nov. 14 that President Clinton described 
America's "great crisis of the spirit" in a widely reported speech. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of 40 white and black church leaders laid plans last month in 
Memphis for decisions that could be made to reshape the fellowship as early as 
the next convention in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are moving rapidly with nothing negative in the way," said Bishop B. 
E. Underwood of the Pentecostal Holiness Church, the fellowship chairman who 
proposed the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fellowship's 21 current denominations have some black members in 
their congregations -- just as the Church of God in Christ has a small minority 
of white members. But black denominational leaders were uninterested in joining 
the fellowship as it is constituted. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual move to disband gained emotional impetus in October at the 
fellowship's convention in Atlanta when Pastor Jack Hayford of Van Nuys' Church 
on the Way, speaking on behalf of white Pentecostalists to the many black 
churchmen who were convention guests, apologized for "decades of prejudice and 
misunderstanding" and embraced the president of a leading black Pentecostal 
seminary. Hayford also took part in last month's task force meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church historically has reflected or reinforced society's divisions," 
said Hayford, a leader in conservative Christian circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a happy fact that millions of responsible, repentant, Spirit-filled 
believers are . . . seeking a full recovery from the crippling impact and 
spiritual embarrassment of that past divisiveness," Hayford wrote in a 
newsletter for his church's 8,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fellowship, like the one scheduled for dismantling, would be a 
volunteer association of like-minded believers that has no authority over 
member denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opportunity to "rub shoulders and talk" with culturally conservative 
white denominations such as the 2.2-million-member Assemblies of God will 
"automatically make everyone concerned about social issues," Bishop Gilbert 
Patterson of Memphis predicted in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we face the 21st Century, I believe the impossible task of bringing blacks 
and whites together is about to take place," said Patterson, the Church of God 
in Christ bishop who will host the October meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostalism as a full-fledged movement began in Los Angeles, with racially 
mixed revivals at the Azusa Street Mission between 1906 and 1909 by a black 
preacher, the Rev. William Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
 After a black-white split in 1914, denominations developed along racial lines 
and mostly in rural and poor urban locales. The Pentecostal Fellowship of North 
America was formed in 1948, but black churches were not invited to join. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentecostalism has been shunned by many conventional churches that contended 
that speaking in unknown tongues and other claims related to being "filled with 
the Holy Spirit" created divisions among Christians. The most animated churches 
were often derisively called "holy rollers." One group of churches in the 
fellowship, the Foursquare Gospel churches, have been linked for decades with 
their flamboyant founder, Los Angeles evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the congregations were black or white, Pentecostal churches were 
largely in rural and economically depressed urban locales and their clergy 
poorly educated. Things began to change in the 1960s when groups of Pentecostal 
believers surfaced within mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches. They 
and many independent congregations with Pentecostal beliefs described 
themselves as charismatic, derived from the Greek word for divine gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the theological borders with evangelical churches have frequently 
become blurred as they found compatibility on opposition to abortion, 
pornography and gay and lesbian rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ranks include scandal-stained televangelists Jim Bakker and Jimmy 
Swaggart plus religious television network chiefs Pat Robertson in Virginia 
Beach, Va., and Paul Crouch in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pentecostalism also includes such well-regarded clergy as Los Angeles 
Bishop Charles Blake, who doubles as pastor of the nearly 11,000-member West 
Angeles Church of God in Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake was cautiously optimistic about the pending change in the Pentecostal 
Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because black churches are primarily in urban centers and white churches are 
mostly in the suburbs, it will not be easy for us to have intense 
collaboration," Blake said. "But breaking down the walls is altogether 
necessary and I support any sign of reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake praised the work of Hayford in facilitating fellowship locally between 
black and white pastors of various denominations, primarily through the "Love 
L.A." prayer meetings held since 1987 at Hollywood Presbyterian Church and, on 
major occasions, at the Crenshaw Christian Center in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford said that he places a high priority on bringing about a new 
fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastor wrote a lengthy tribute in a recent Church on the Way bulletin to 
"beloved" Bishop Benjamin Crouch, the black Church of God in Christ pastor in 
Pacoima who died in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing I said about him was embellishment," Hayford said. But he 
acknowledged in an interview that the reconciliation movement has made him and 
other white church leaders more sensitive to their black colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Patterson of the Church of God in Christ said he keeps on his office 
wall a copy of a Los Angeles Times article that ran April 18, 1906, headlined 
"Weird Babel of Tongues, New Set of Fanatics is Breaking Loose." The article, 
widely reproduced in Pentecostal circles, described in colorful language the 
zeal of the racially mixed congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Church of God in Christ was formed in 1907 after a black minister, the 
Rev. C. H. Mason, and two brethren visited the modest Azusa Street Mission, 
which stood on the edge of what is now Little Tokyo in Los Angeles. Returning 
to Memphis, Mason ordained many white ministers in later years, but a major 
group of white preachers broke off in 1914 to form the Assemblies of God. 
</P>
<P>
 "The racial barriers that were rebuilt within a decade were understandable 
given the culture then," Hayford said. "But (the original mission) was 
nonetheless a vision of what might have been all these years."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 35,000 HOUSEHOLDS GET STATE OK TO QUIT BOILING 
TAP WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Residents can now drink tap water without boiling it first, according to state 
health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Health Services Friday said the water is safe to drink 
from the Santa Clarita Water Co., which serves about 15,000 households, and 
Valencia Water Co., which serves about 20,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials Friday lifted orders to boil water after weeks of bacteria 
testing in the wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Newhall Water serves about 5,000 
households and its water was approved earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardest hit was Valencia Water, which lost three water tanks and had cracks in 
several pipelines. Hundreds of customers west of the Golden State Freeway were 
without water for two weeks after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake damaged our systems severely," said Bob DiPrimia, managing 
director for Valencia Water. "Whenever you have that sort of damage to your 
system, you can't verify the quality of the water." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents may still smell chlorine from the tap water for the next several 
days as water companies perform additional spot checks of water quality, said 
Bill Manetta, president of Santa Clarita Water.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA TRAIN LINE TO GET 5TH STATION; 
TRANSIT: METROLINK SITE ON VIA PRINCESSA WILL OPEN MONDAY. IT IS THE LATEST 
ADDITION IN TWO WEEKS SINCE EMERGENCY SERVICE WAS EXTENDED NORTHWARD. 
</P>

<P>
 Metrolink is preparing to open its fifth train station in two weeks on the 
Santa Clarita line, which has seen ridership swell dramatically since the Jan. 
17 Northridge quake crippled many Southland freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita/Princessa station, at 19201 Via Princessa, will open Monday. 
It is the latest emergency station to open since Metrolink extended service 
north to the Antelope Valley -- opening stations in Lancaster and Palmdale on 
Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sylmar/San Fernando station and one at Vincent Grade in Acton also have 
opened on the Santa Clarita line. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo said the newest station is expected to 
relieve crowding at the existing Santa Clarita station. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink's Santa Clarita line has seen its daily ridership jump from 1,000 
before the quake to as much as 21,952, a peak hit on Jan. 25. The number of 
riders on the line each weekday has declined since, with Thursday's ridership 
at 9,819, according to Metrolink records. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink Executive Director Richard Stanger said the extension of the Santa 
Clarita line to the Antelope Valley will continue for at least one year. If 
ridership warrants, the commuter train service may be made permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Hidalgo said, the only other change being considered is the addition 
of a third round-trip train to serve Lancaster and the other three platforms 
north of the permanent station in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two trains depart from Lancaster each morning, stopping in Palmdale, 
Acton and, beginning Monday, at Via Princessa before continuing on the regular 
Santa Clarita route to downtown Los Angeles. Two trains return from downtown to 
the new northern Los Angeles County stations each evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Many riders have requested a third train, Hidalgo said, particularly one that 
would leave Lancaster and Palmdale later in the morning than the pre-dawn 
departing trains. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision about an additional train or changes in the train schedule, Hidalgo 
said, is not expected to be made before late next week. 
</P>

 Trains will depart from the Via Princessa station each morning at 5:30 and 
6:11, with the ride downtown expected to take a little more than an hour. 
Trains will return to the newest station at 5:07 p.m. and 6:36 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The newest station, like the other emergency platforms, offers few amenities. 
There is a paved parking lot with 400 spaces and a 1,000-foot platform. 
Metrolink personnel will be at the station, as they are at others, to assist 
riders.

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; AFTER ALL THIS TIME, GRIMSON KNOWS THE 
SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The date was Dec. 31, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Ring a bell, Stu? 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson, the Mighty Ducks' popular enforcer, furrows his brow, shakes his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the date of his last goal, 90 games ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Tampa Bay last year," said Grimson, whose career statistics in 225 games 
look like this: Goals, 3; assists, 9; penalty minutes, 765. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson has had increased ice time with the Ducks, and though he hasn't broken 
his goal drought, his assist against Calgary on Wednesday was his fifth of the 
year, giving him a career-high five points. 
</P>
<P>
 The assist came off a perfect passing play. Terry Yake sent the puck out to 
Grimson from near the goal line, and Grimson sent it right back to Yake, who 
was open on the side of the net and scored. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahem. Actually, Grimson said, that pass was a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Best miss of my career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He fooled more than just the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Was that a shot?" Coach Ron Wilson said. "I thought it was a pass, too. It 
wasn't much of a shot, if that's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson says he isn't worried about where his next goal is coming from, even 
though there are occasional attacks from the media and opposing fans about him 
being little more than a boxer on skates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting chances. It's only a matter of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Grimson has had a couple of surprising breakaway chances this 
season, he doesn't predict his next goal will be anything fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a dirty one. It can be any way it wants," he said. "I've scored 
mostly off scrambles in front of the net. I'd say every goal I've ever scored 
in my NHL career probably came inside the hash marks (about 18 feet from the 
net). I don't expect the next one to be any different." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson swears Grimson has a terrific shot -- hard, if not accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a cannon," Wilson said. "Put this in the paper. Maybe he thinks his 
shot is so hard, and Stu's such a sportsman, that he wouldn't think it fair to 
unleash his shot because he might hurt somebody. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to see Stu score. I don't know if he really wants to score. One time 
he had a breakaway and just let the puck go. The crowd will go nuts when he 
does." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Believe it or not, Grimson also has been criticized for going soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even good Canadian boys like Stu Grimson have been corrupted since they got 
to Anaheim," wrote Jay Greenberg in the Dec. 15 Toronto Sun. "The Grim Reaper . 
. . now plays like Herbie the Love Bug." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson shrugs it off. He knows that he played almost a month with a broken 
finger that limited his fighting. He and the team did their best to hide the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to make it a public thing," Grimson said. "You have to 
understand, someone in my role, my job is to let the people on the other side 
know that if they go after our guys, they're going to get hit back. If they get 
wind that I'm playing with a broken finger and might not be able to retaliate, 
it makes it easier for them to pick on our little guys." 
</P>

 Reason No. 498 why it has taken the Ducks a while to begin to start playing 
better at home: Goaltenders Guy Hebert and Ron Tugnutt, backups for most of 
their NHL careers, were used to getting most of their starts on the road and 
are more comfortable playing away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably where I've played 85% of my games," Hebert said. "It's more 
relaxing for me. I don't have to put on a big show. Definitely you feel more 
pressure at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Hebert felt the fans' wrath in St. Louis whenever he replaced 
starter Curtis Joseph. As in, "Why isn't Curtis starting tonight?" Hebert said. 
"I probably had six or seven starts at home last year, maybe not even that 
many." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert's home and road statistics have evened out lately. He's 6-7-2 with a 
2.97 goals against average on the road, 5-8-1 with a 2.71 goals-against average 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Tugnutt, however, is 6-5 with a 2.23 on the road, and 3-9-1 with a 3.87 at 
home, where he has lost six of his last seven decisions.
