 Love is a many-splattered thing: Chris Darryn of the Talk Show Guest Registry 
in Reseda reports that the latest addition to his database of TV hopefuls is 
Brenda Love, author of "The Encyclopedia of Unusual Sex Practices." Love has 
profiled 706 subjects, including "a man who is aroused by having pies thrown in 
his face during sex."

 Who said Hollywood can't sink any lower?You may recall that construction of 
the Metro Rail Red Line caused sinkage of the Hollywood Walk of Fame and 
cracking of some plaques.

<P>
 Now, there's a sequel to this real-life horror story. Mann's Theater has 
written to Parsons-Dillingham, the construction management firm for the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, complaining that "over the past few 
weeks, an 8-by-15-foot section in the southeast corner of the Chinese Theater 
forecourt began sinking. . . . It includes handprints, footprints and 
signatures of such motion picture stars as Bette Davis, Lana Turner, Myrna Loy, 
James Mason and Esther Williams."

 And the sad fact is that, unlike the Walk of Fame plaques, the prints of such 
departed stars as Davis, Loy and Mason cannot be replaced.

 Obviously, the juror candidates haven't been buying: Don't know if you 
noticed, but "Nicole Brown Simpson" by Faye Resnick with Mike Walker is No. 1

book is No. 1, followed by Resnick's tome.

United States after California was admitted to the Union. These Americans were 
sometimes accused of ignoring California land titles and of preferring to

AL MARTINEZ: LIFE WITHOUT MARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a county of 9 million people, we're lucky if we have one or two we can 
always depend on. Bob Abrams had one. Her name was Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the element in his life that made everything work; words that made 
sense and laughter when he needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary brought music and energy into their small Westside home, and a sense of 
order that transcended even the knowledge that she was dying. 
</P>
<P>
 She cooked for her husband and young son Josh as long as she could, and dinner 
was always a formal affair. There were cloth napkins on the table when Mary 
served, and never a bottle of ketchup. 
</P>
<P>
 She was, as wives so often are, Bob's best friend, but no docile little woman 
willing to tolerate his bombast with submission. Holler she could and holler 
she did, and the silence in their house is deepest in the rooms she once filled 
with the sound of her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Her vitality lasted into the final few weeks of her life, and even then it 
burst through the pain and finality of cancer like shards of glass in sunlight, 
sinking back into darkness and silence with reluctance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm terminal," she said to me one day in a glowing period of lucidity. "It's 
a funny feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams is a familiar figure in L.A., a publicist I've known for as long as 
I've been a columnist. Mary worked as his secretary, and was a voice of casual 
good humor on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 He called one day, as he often did, but not to pitch an idea. His tone was 
edged with sorrow and incredulity. He said, "Mary's dying." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 48, she had been given only a few months to live, but clung to the threads 
of her life for almost two years. They took a delayed trip to Europe and, 
later, Mary went on a hot-air balloon ride with Josh. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted a long, last look at the world before she left it, a view from the 
heights at an existence that was fading. She saw it not through tears, but with 
characteristic gusto. She waved and winked and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary died last May 27th, shortly after noon, the sizzling energy of her life 
silenced at last. Her ashes lie in a niche at the Pierce Brothers Mortuary in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Bob there to talk about her. A light rain was falling as we sat in a 
sheltered cove. The weather seemed appropriate to the moment. Autumn has its 
own way of dealing with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 I wrote about Mary in 1992, a few weeks after she'd been told she had terminal 
cancer. If my job is to put a face on the city, I wanted to reveal a face that 
wasn't smiling. Death is a walk we take alone, and it's important to know that 
among us are those who take it with remarkable aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story doesn't end there. Bob and Josh, now 18, continue on in the 
house Mary once filled with her presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's everywhere," Bob said that day at the mortuary, his voice breaking 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 He meant it. Her clothes still hang in the closet, her costume jewelry still 
has its place on a night stand, her books still jam shelves in their bedroom. A 
whiff of her cologne lingers in the air, like the scent of roses in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary is an abiding presence in sound and image. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob sees her lying on the couch reading, and hears the clatter of her 
typewriter in the hours past midnight. She worked while others slept. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary studied the violin, and bits of classical music, played as an amateur, 
embrace her memory, the way ribbons embrace love letters from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wore her hair long and tied back," Bob said, seeing her even as he spoke. 
"I'll never stop remembering her that way." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mary died, Bob wanted to die with her. "She was too good and too young," 
he said, as we watched rain turn green patches of the cemetery into emeralds. 
"I can't think of her without crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Their house, damaged by the January earthquake, is still a wreck. His public 
relations business is all but nonexistent. But for his son's sake, he has begun 
therapy to emerge from the depression left by Mary's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life goes on," he said, reaching for sunlight. "But she'll always be there." 
</P>
<P>
 I can't imagine, and don't want to imagine, what life would be like without my 
Cinelli. But I can, at least, try to empathize with his loss and the need to 
emerge from a devastating emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 In moments of sorrow, we need the assistance of others to keep us from 
drowning in our own tears. A hand reaching out to those who grieve is one worth 
grasping. For what help it brings, Bob Abrams, . . . here's mine.

<P>
 U.S. Senate: DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D). Why take a chance with a relative unknown? 
Especially when the incumbent is terrifically effective? Feinstein is a 
powerful voice for California in the U.S. Senate and richly deserves 
reelection.

<P>
 43rd -- MARK TAKANO (D) 
</P>
<P>
 47th -- CHRISTOPHER COX (R) State Offices 
</P>
<P>
 Governor: PETE WILSON (R). Kathleen Brown is fresh and determined but the 
experienced and capable Wilson, though wrong about Proposition 187, is right 
about a lot of other things and merits a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieutenant Governor: GRAY DAVIS (D). The longtime state controller offers 
experience and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State: TONY MILLER (D). Miller, the acting secretary of state, 
promises to curb voter fraud and clear the deadwood from voter registration 
rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller: KATHLEEN CONNELL (D). Formerly an investment banker, Connell would 
bring sharp, modern management ideas to government. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer: MATT FONG (R). Fong gets the nod over Phil Angelides, a quality 
player, because of his comprehensive proposals to increase efficiency and cut 
government costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney General: TOM UMBERG (D). The tough-on-crime Orange County assemblyman 
offers a nuanced approach to crime-fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner: ART TORRES (D). The Los Angeles state senator has a 
solid record as an advocate for consumers and has much experience dealing with 
insurance issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Equalization Office No. 4: BRAD SHERMAN (D). Sherman is a solid 
choice and deserves a second term in this important but often overlooked 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent of Public Instruction: DELAINE EASTIN. Maureen DiMarco is also 
a good candidate, but the edge for this nonpartisan office is held by Eastin, a 
Fremont assemblywoman who knows educational issues and has the political acumen 
for this key post. California Legislature 
</P>
<P>
 State Senate: 
</P>
<P>
 36th -- KAY CENICEROS (D) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 69th -- MIKE METZLER (D)  
</P>
<P>
 70th -- MARILYN C. BREWER (R) Statewide Propositions 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 181 (Public Transportation Bonds): Authorizes $1 billion in 
general-obligation bonds to fund California's passenger rail transportation 
network. Unwise given the state's heavy debt load. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 183 (Recall Elections): Attacks wasteful back-to-back 
elections by allowing recall votes to be held as late as 180 days after 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 184 ("Three Strikes"): This ill-conceived and hugely 
expensive measure would imprison criminals convicted of a third felony (there 
are more than 500 such felonies under California law) for 25 years to life. 
It's dumb criminal justice policy. Worse still, it's unnecessary; legislation 
nearly identical to this initiative took effect last March. Passage would only 
make it harder for the Legislature and the governor to make necessary 
refinements in the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 185 (Gas Tax/Transportation): This measure, backed by 
Southern Pacific Railroad Co., imposes a 4% sales tax on gasoline. It would 
fund rail projects primarily; other transportation-related needs such as 
seismic retrofitting would be scanted. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 186 (Single-Payer Health Care): Establishes a state-run 
"single-payer" health care insurance plan and creates the post of state health 
commissioner. It sounds good in principle, but it's a big-government nightmare. 
This is one time California doesn't need to be the guinea pig for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 187 (Illegal Immigrants): This counterproductive measure 
would cut schooling, health and social services for the estimated 1.7 million 
illegal immigrants here -- and, even then, not come close to addressing the 
complex problem of immigration, which is rooted in economics. 
</P>
<P>
 NO -- Proposition 188 (Smoking and Tobacco Products): Masquerading as a tough 
anti-smoking measure, this mendacious offering -- paid for by tobacco companies 
-- would in fact emasculate all tough smoking regulations, both local and 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 189 (Expanding No-Bail Provisions): Amends the Constitution 
to permit courts to deny bail to individuals accused of "felony sexual assault 
offenses" who threaten another with physical harm. Good idea as long as it's 
not abused in implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 190 (Judicial Performance Commission): Reforms the state's 
Commission on Judicial Performance, which is responsible for disciplining 
errant or incompetent judges. The measure ensures that a majority of commission 
members will be from the public and grants the panel more authority to remove 
or discipline current and former judges. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Proposition 191 (Justice Courts): Eliminates justice courts and merges 
them with the municipal courts in jurisdictions of 40,000 or fewer people. Los 
Angeles County 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 2: TERRY B. FRIEDMAN. This veteran state assemblyman 
and former poverty lawyer has the patience, fairness and compassion to be an 
excellent judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 4: TERI SCHWARTZ. An outstanding prosecutor with the 
hard-core gang division of the L.A. County district attorney's office, Schwartz 
has the respect of her peers for her skill, intelligence and demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Office No. 93: MITCHELL BLOCK. In a close call over Susan 
Bryant-Deason, an accomplished prosecutor. Measures in L.A. County 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Los Angeles County, Charter Amendment A: Gives the County Board of 
Supervisors needed flexibility to increase or decrease the compensation for the 
posts of district attorney, assessor and sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- El Rancho Unified School District, Bond Measure C: Permits the El 
Rancho Unified School District in Pico Rivera to issue $13.3 million in 
general-obligation bonds in order to upgrade facilities including fire, 
earthquake, electrical and security systems; provide students with access to 
modern technology; renovate or replace obsolete facilities; construct permanent 
facilities, and make improvements to older buildings on district property. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- La Verne, Lancaster, San Dimas and Walnut, Measures E, F, G and L: An 
advisory vote to support the L.A. County Board of Supervisors' creation of a 
community facilities district (CFD). Property owners in cities that voluntarily 
join the CFD would be subject to a small assessment on their property taxes, 
when needed, to increase materials, hours and days of service at the besieged 
county public library branches in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Long Beach, Bond Measure D: Authorizes the issuance of up to $48 
million in general-obligation bonds to finance improvements to city facilities, 
bringing them into compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act.  
</P>
<P>
 YES -- San Marino, Special Tax I: Extends a special public safety tax for 
paramedic services, police protection and fire protection and prevention. The 
current levy expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Santa Monica, Charter Amendment J: Saves the city money by allowing it 
to publish condensed versions of city ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 YES -- Santa Monica/Malibu Unified School District, Measure K: Permits the 
school district to continue a special tax that funds educational improvements. 
This measure extends the special parcel tax -- $58 a year -- for six years and 
increases it to $68 per parcel. The measure requires a two-thirds majority for 
passage. Orange County Offices

PACIFIC BATTLES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article on the St. Lo memorial was welcome reading for this old sailor. 
The 40th and so far the 50th World War II anniversaries concentrating on the 
Normandy invasion have made some of us feel our ordeal in the Pacific is a 
forgotten war.What your article neglects to mention is that by far the bulk of 
those 3,000 Kamikaze attacks came at a place called Okinawa. For six weeks the 
Navy was hammered by day and by night.  
</P>
<P>
 This was the last, the bloodiest, and the least known battle of the war. The 
surrender of Germany ahead of it and the cataclysms at Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
afterward succeeded in burying news of a fight of epic nastiness. Anyone with a 
strong enough stomach who would like to know more could read "Tennozan" by 
George Feifer. It tells exactly what we were up against, courtesy of the 
warlords who perpetrated the rape of Nanking and the death march on Luzon.

 Re "Kicking Homework Out of School," Oct. 27: 
</P>
<P>
 As the producer of the longest-running, Emmy-award winning, live homework 
assistance television program in the nation, "Homework Hotline," I am deeply 
disturbed by the notion that homework is superfluous in the education of K-12 
students. We field over 700 calls per week from students who need homework 
assistance. Some of them need minor reinforcement, others require more involved 
help, and almost all of them have no parent or sibling home in the afternoon to 
help. None of the students who call our hot line complain about the 
assignments. These students are utilizing homework to reinforce the lessons 
learned in the classroom, as well as learning study habits and skills that will 
help them succeed in college and work-life in their adult years. 
</P>
<P>
 When you watch the show (which is broadcast to 10 million homes on Channel 58 
Monday through Thursday from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.), you'll see the real value of 
homework. These students are learning, achieving, getting better grades, and 
advancing to higher levels of knowledge.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * As a special-education instructor for English at Dorsey High School, I am 
very interested in educational policy for all students, but especially for 
low-achieving minority students of the inner city. The issue of homework 
reflects more than just the common concerns on how much homework to assign, 
when to assign homework, whether or not to even assign homework. Rather, it may 
be more important for us as educators, parents and policy-makers to examine 
what kinds of homework activities are assigned and to which student 
populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the area of special education, most homework assignments are usually 
reductionistic in nature, typically including activities such as "drill and 
skill" work sheets, phonics attack practice sheets, vocabulary words to define. 
Many special educators complain that their students do not return homework 
assignments and often display problems of motivation and distractibility. At 
the other extreme of the continuum, students participating in classes for the 
intellectually gifted usually bring home assignments that are meaningful to 
their own lives, authentic (based on the real world around them) and conducive 
to working with others during the assignment.  
</P>
<P>
 Ask your child to show you a recent homework assignment. Is it a list of 20 
words to define or a letter to write? Is it a phonics fill-in-the-blank work 
sheet or a real book to read (not a textbook)? Homework assignments reflect the 
teacher's and school's educational theory of how students learn! Do children 
learn through drill-and-skill or through motivation and interest?

COMMUNITY POLICING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was delighted to read the article by Chief Jerry Oliver of Pasadena (Oct. 
17). Oliver has certainly got it right.Community policing is a philosophy of 
doing business, it is not a program and it's not a quick fix. It's the right 
way to go, but it will take time to make the change in our systems. Community 
policing does not require just a change in the police department, either. It 
requires a change all through our systems. In fact, you can successfully make 
the argument that community policing is only one part of what must be viewed as 
community-based government. 
</P>
<P>
 It is going to take a long time to make the changes Oliver and Patrick Murphy 
(Commentary, Oct. 17) so eloquently describe. What works well in Pasadena may 
not work well in Glendale or La Habra. Community policing is very much a 
philosophy that must be created for an individual community.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope and I believe that we are entering a period of time in our community 
when we will reverse the decades-old trend of "letting George do it," and move 
into a period of time when we all will hold ourselves responsible for the 
conduct of our communities. It's our community and we are responsible. 
Community policing is but one element, maybe the leading element, to foster 
this change. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for presenting this issue in such a realistic and positive way.

 The interview with Mikhail S. Gorbachev (World Report, Nov. 1) struck a note 
of irony. Celebrated for his openness and candor, Gorbachev has yet to 
demonstrate that candor when it comes to a key historical reality: Communism 
was unreformable. Perestroika amounted to mere tinkering with a system which 
was, at its root, rotten. This explains why the Eastern European dictators 
dropped off their high places like ripe fruit once Moscow let it be known that 
it would no longer use troops to protect those regimes from their own people.  
</P>
<P>
 But why was communism unreformable? Because as a relic of the old industrial 
era it ran up against the new era of the computer and communications. Mind 
control from the Kremlin would no longer work -- not even at the end of the 
barrel of a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Gorbachev to admit as much would pry open a Pandora's box of even more 
hard-to-face questions such as: "Was communism a grave error from the 
beginning?" And so long as he spends time looking back at might-have-beens, how 
about this one: a 20th Century minus the bloody tyranny, economic backwardness 
and ecological disaster of communism.

By GEORGE S. MITROVICH, a San Diego civic leader, told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edith Hamilton, that remarkable teacher and woman of letters, was unyielding 
in her admiration of Greek civilization and of the Athenians, who, she 
believed, achieved the world's purest form of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 We may differ with Hamilton's assessment of the democratic attributes of the 
Athenians (it was a slave state and women couldn't vote), but find agreement 
with her in that the Athenians had a profound understanding of the word idiot.  
</P>
<P>
 To the Athenians, an idiot was any person who did not participate in the 
democratic life of the nation, and who, therefore, in the Periclean sense, was 
viewed as useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in California and across the nation, several millennia beyond ancient 
Athens and its experiment in democracy, millions of our citizens will ignore 
our own elections. They will do so for a variety of reasons -- but whatever 
those reasons are, the citizenry's failure will represent a staggering 
indifference to the fate of American society and our democratic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Their contemptible refusal to vote, which is the bare, minimum requirement of 
a citizen in a democratic state, is not a new phenomenon. It has been growing 
at an alarming rate since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been said, "we get the government we deserve." Please, if you don't 
vote, spare those of us who take this duty with the utmost seriousness, your 
empty, hypocritical complaints.  
</P>
<P>
 The Athenians were wrong about a number of things, but in their definition of 
the useless members of their society, the "idiots" among them, they got it 
right!

PERSPECTIVE ON POLITICS; GINGRICH'S WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY; A REVISIONIST LOOK 
AT THE MUCH-MALIGNED REPUBLICAN LEADER AND HIS QUEST TO BE MAJORITY LEADER OF 
THE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES P. PINKERTON, James P. Pinkerton is a lecturer at the Graduate School 
of Political Management at George Washington University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sept. 27, Newt Gingrich and the House Republicans issued their 
now-notorious "Contract with America," a 10-plank platform including tax and 
spending cuts, a balanced-budget amendment, legal reform and term limits. 
Predictably, President Clinton and the Democrats pounced, labeling it "Voodoo 
2," and "Reagan Redux," a budget-busting, job-exporting "Contract on America."  
</P>
<P>
 The media reaction has been just as harsh: "Broken Contract," snarled the New 
Republic. "Duplicitous propaganda," editorialized the New York Times. The 
double-barreled barrage is clearly taking its toll on Republican prospects; 
today the voters finally get their say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whether the Republicans are triumphant or trampled, one thing is certain: 
the charge that the contract is just a neo-Reaganite vote-grubbing ploy is 
wrong. The contract has emerged from Gingrich's brow after a lifetime of 
rumination and reflection. And Gingrich is no Gipper nostalgic -- he is an 
unconservative conservative, impatient with the past, eager to bring the 
"quality revolution" that is storming the private sector into the sleepy public 
sector. Even if Gingrich is merely the minority leader in the upcoming 104th 
Congress rather than Speaker of the House, his vision of transformation through 
technology, of a post-bureaucratic new New Deal, is sure to help shape American 
politics for the rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Most politicians seem to have no higher goal than energetic constituent 
service and endless reelection. Gingrich is different. He has built a national 
grass-roots following on his one big idea: The 20th-Century welfare state will 
not stand. Does that make him a radical? Responds Gingrich: "I'm unwilling to 
accept the boundaries and norms of the decaying Establishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's Bigthink recalls another revolutionary -- his own staff freely uses 
the adjective Leninist to describe him. Gingrich is no Bolshevik, but he plots 
and prepares like one. In his 16 years in Congress, Gingrich has created his 
own vanguard of groups with names like COS, GOPAC and the Progress and Freedom 
Foundation. The cyber-era equivalents of Lenin's agitprop pamphlets are 
Gingrich's audio and videotapes, distributed to Republican candidates and 
cadres nationwide. Gingrich's hot, apocalyptic talk -- he recently called the 
Clinton Administration "the enemy of normal Americans" -- aims to spark the 
grass-roots to insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gingrich's inspiration came not from Marx but from a visit to Verdun. An 
Army brat growing up on military bases in Western Europe, Gingrich had wanted 
to be a zookeeper. But on that World War I battlefield, he saw the glassed-in 
ossuary with the unidentifiable remains of 100,000 men, just some of the 1.3 
million who died there. That persuaded him that blundering political leadership 
can plummet whole nations into the abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich went from the big historical picture to the even bigger tapestry of 
the imagination. Science fiction is a key to understanding the Newtonian 
universe. Two of his favorite works are Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" trilogy and 
Frank Herbert's "Dune" chronicles; both are multicentury epics of wax and wane. 
A decade ago, Gingrich was an "Atari Republican" who thought that technology 
could shortcut earthbound cultural concerns. His 1984 book, "Window of 
Opportunity," argued the urgency of the Reagan "Star Wars" program, which he 
folded into a larger brief on the importance of American space supremacy.  
</P>
<P>
 But with the Cold War over, Gingrich fears that the long struggle against 
social chaos is being lost. His oft-repeated jeremiad -- "Our civilization 
cannot survive with 12-year-olds having babies, 15-year-olds killing each 
other, 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, 18-year-olds getting diplomas they cannot 
read and 25-year-olds who have never held a job" -- could have been spoken by 
Children's Defense Fund President Marian Wright Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich, however, believes that this plague of pathologies comes because, not 
in spite of, the bureaucratic welfare state. Determined to replace the Great 
Society with an "opportunity society," Gingrich is reaching into the heart of 
the welfare system to pluck out the votes and moral authority of the damned, 
the dispossessed and the despised. It is an audacious strategy, a mix of 
idealism and calculation designed to split the poor from their bureaucratic 
overseers. Gingrich strongly supports school vouchers; for him the liberation 
of inner-city schoolchildren to pursue better learning would happily coincide 
with the annihilation of the National Education Assn., a pillar of the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for streamlined models for a functional future, Gingrich analogizes 
from the debureaucratization of corporate America in the past 15 years. He 
frequently cites management gurus W. Edwards Deming and Peter Drucker as guides 
to what a Gingrichified government would look like. In "The Effective 
Executive," Drucker urges his readers to examine any activity and ask 
themselves one question: "If we did not already do this, would we go into it 
now?" Few institutions can survive the rigorous "Drucker Test" intact. Vice 
President Al Gore's "reinventing government" initiative may have chipped at the 
Gibraltar of bureaucratic obsolescence, but Gingrich promises to bring in the 
blasting caps. One target: the health-care system. Gingrich believes that 
health-care costs would crash like the price of computer chips if only the 
IBM-like bureaucracy were blown away. His solution is for market forces and 
health-care "IRAs" to make every American a cost-conscious, comparison-shopping 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich plans a secular alliance to besiege the last bastions of bureaucracy. 
He shies from the late Lee Atwater's inclusive "Big Tent" formulation, but he 
clearly sees hot-button moral issues such as abortion and homosexuality as a 
diversion. Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition is one player on his "new 
majority" team, but so is Steve Gunderson, the openly gay GOP congressman from 
Wisconsin. Says Gingrich, using words not often heard in Georgia, "I've never 
asked him what he does in the bedroom and he has never asked me." 
</P>
<P>
 As Lenin wrote, "every crisis in history . . . stuns and shatters some, but it 
enlightens and hardens others." The crucible of the next two years will 
distinguish glass from diamonds. With his own rare clarity, Gingrich sees his 
chance to cut a window of opportunity for himself and his ideas.

THIRTY-SOMETHINGS COME OF POLITICAL AGE; POLITICS: WHEN A CONTEMPORARY RUNS FOR 
CONGRESS, A WHOLE GENERATION IS FORCED TO GROW UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTORIA McKERNAN, Victoria McKernan is a Washington-based novelist. Her 
friend, Tom Hecht, is running for Congress in Wisconsin. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sue and I are sprawled on the old orange corduroy sofas, still grungy from our 
camping trip when Tom finally gets home. He navigates easily through the toys 
and puzzles and piles of camping gear his wife and I have just dragged in, and 
plunders the kitchen for dinner, which today will be a cucumber, two carrots, a 
pear, cheese curds and zucchini bread. 
</P>
<P>
 He kisses his wife and drops beside me on the mushy couch. The comfortable 
disarray feels like old times. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom has always had boundless energy, and despite a long day's work, he is 
eager to talk, hearing the highlights of our camping trip, quizzing me on my 
own life, and then, as usual, slipping into politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a half hour, we are plowing through the minefields of welfare reform 
and U.S. policy in Haiti. It is the same sort of passionate political 
discussions that we have had for years, Tom and Sue and various others crowded 
on these very couches, talking out our plans for the world. But this time it is 
for real. Tom is running for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the campaign has been going on for more than a year, I'm still not 
used to the idea that a friend of mine, a contemporary with whom I have danced 
all night, flipped pancakes and moved furniture, could actually be helping to 
govern the country some day soon. It is hard to picture Tom at a state dinner 
after I have watched him at his kitchen table devouring a mixing bowl full of 
spaghetti, "carbo-loading" for a triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, I know this guy. I dated his housemate. We had yard sales together. 
Being best friends with his then-girlfriend, (now wife and mother of a 
2-year-old) I was privy to his every fault and transgression.  
</P>
<P>
 There is something unsettling about the idea of one's contemporaries running 
for Congress. Was this always so? Did Eisenhower or Truman have old school 
buddies sitting around shaking their heads, saying, "Can you believe it? Do you 
remember what that bonehead did that time . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Our generation, the thirty-somethings, have been notoriously reluctant to 
admit that we have grown up. The American people have always wanted wise, noble 
and (though loathe to admit it) somewhat paternalistic government. The horror 
of my generation now is that this government must come from us. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a hard time accepting Tom as a congressman, not because I know him to be 
unqualified but simply because I know him at all. And yet, Tom fits perfectly 
our classical ideal of a representative -- intelligent and creative, of common 
birth and modest background. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning and politics, never pretty I'm sure, have become savage. Five or 
six appearances in one day, shaking hands, handing himself out in pamphlets. 
How can the people possibly know him? How does an ordinary person without 
millions to spend on a campaign even compete?  
</P>
<P>
 Tom is lucky. Wisconsin is still the sort of place where a campaign bicycle 
ride is respected. What happens to the Toms in California, Texas and New York? 
</P>
<P>
 Tom has already traded his Guatemalan shorts for blue shirts and khaki pants. 
How much more will he and his family have to change? Will Sue have to start 
wearing pantyhose every day? Will these couches have to go? 
</P>
<P>
 Can you even get elected with couches like these I wonder? They are horrid 
things, soft of spine and saggy of cushion, but still undeniably orange. These 
couches, hulking there like a dowager and her hunchback son, came from a 
friend's group house, to my group house to Tom's group house some 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But these couches are exactly why Tom should be elected. These couches are 
fiscal responsibility; living within a budget and choosing priorities for 
spending. These couches are family values; spending your money on frequent 
flights home to Grandma's instead of on new furniture. These couches are 
substance over form, issue over rhetoric, tradition over speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 As we finally turn out the lights and go to bed, I feel this mix of awe and 
sadness and lovely fragile hope. In the dark, the couches look like battered 
old orange freight cars, freight cars loaded with dreams, ideals and 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now my only thought is, if Tom actually wins, will we have to move these 
things again?

WHO IS MINDING THE SPYHOUSE?; CIA: THE AMES CASE SHOWS THE NEED OF AN OVERHAUL 
AT THE TOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARVIN OTT, Marvin Ott is a professor of national-security policy at the 
National War College in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recently released report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence 
regarding the Aldrich Ames espionage case is a catalogue of horrors. The 
committee, which is responsible for overseeing U.S. intelligence agencies, 
provides a detailed and gripping account of how the CIA ignored a crescendo of 
evidence that it had a traitor in its midst. The agency's harshest critics 
could not have imagined so damaging a sequence of events as actually occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 From April, 1985, to this past February, Ames spied for the Soviet Union from 
within the CIA. During that time he was frequently drunk on the job (and was 
once hospitalized for alcoholism), failed to provide required reports on his 
professional activities, met apparently dozens of times with Soviet "handlers," 
was unproductive in carrying out his CIA assignments, was given poor ratings by 
his supervisors, engaged in a lavish and conspicuous lifestyle that was clearly 
unsupportable on his CIA salary, deposited his cash payments from the Soviets 
in local bank accounts in his own name, stole documents, probed colleagues for 
information he was not authorized to have, disregarded security regulations, 
showed "deception" on his routine polygraph (lie detector) test and was 
careless to the point of unconcern when it came to concealing his espionage 
activities. He was so sloppy and cavalier that he drove his KGB sponsors to 
distraction. Nevertheless, in the words of the committee, "Ames was never 
disciplined by the agency and continued to be promoted and given key 
assignments during the course of this almost nine years of espionage activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences for the CIA's ability to gather intelligence on the Soviet 
Union were catastrophic, resulting, according to the committee, "in the 
execution of 10 Soviet sources, the imprisonment of many others, the compromise 
of over 100 intelligence operations against the Soviet Union, and the passing 
of several thousand classified documents to the KGB." By 1986, the Soviets were 
"wrapping up our cases with reckless abandon," commented one CIA officer. 
</P>
<P>
 How can such ineptitude and inattention possibly be explained? The committee 
report does not try to answer that question except to note the existence of a 
CIA culture "unwilling and unable" to face the possibility that one of their 
own had become a Soviet agent. Whatever the validity of that explanation, there 
is at least one other major factor at work. Ever since the paranoid witch hunts 
within the CIA for a nonexistent mole in the 1960s and early 1970s, 
counterintelligence and security have been viewed with distaste and even 
disdain within the agency. To be assigned to either was a career dead-end for a 
CIA officer. Both were used as a dumping ground for substandard employees. In 
the critical period of the late 1980s when Ames began his career of betrayal, 
the overall head of CIA security was a former intelligence analyst with no 
background in investigatory or security work. In short, the designated 
guardians of the agency's secrets were its weakest employees. Give your least 
valued, potentially most disgruntled personnel responsibility for your most 
sensitive programs and you have a disaster waiting to happen.  
</P>
<P>
 The entire affair has been made far worse by the CIA senior management's 
reaction to it. When the scope of the intelligence losses first became known, 
CIA's leadership failed to inform the congressional oversight committees, as 
required by law. When Ames was finally arrested, CIA management initially 
attempted to downgrade his importance. When the full scope of the disaster 
became publicly known and the agency officials responsible had been identified, 
the current director, James Woolsey, responded with mild letters of reprimand 
to less than half of them. As the committee noted, no one "was fired, demoted, 
suspended or even reassigned as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 All this has highlighted a crisis of purpose and direction that has confronted 
the intelligence community since the Berlin Wall fell. The CIA and other 
agencies were created to collect intelligence on and do covert battle with the 
Soviet Union. With the Soviet empire's demise, what purposes do these agencies 
serve? Do those purposes justify the massive and expensive enterprise U.S. 
intelligence has become? 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey had a unique opportunity to turn a fresh page in the history of 
American intelligence. He became director in a new Administration at a time 
when everyone was looking for new ideas and a new direction -- and a new 
austerity. He had a mandate to take bold initiatives. There have been none. As 
for Ames, he was a blight on the record of previous directors. Woolsey was in a 
position to claim credit for finally bringing Ames to justice and to underline 
the seriousness of the matter by punishing those responsible and instituting 
tough reforms in counterintelligence. He has not. Finally, in these difficult 
times when close and effective collaboration between the intelligence agencies 
and the congressional oversight committees is vital, Woolsey has so mishandled 
the relationship as to virtually disqualify himself from continuation in 
office.  
</P>
<P>
 If the CIA is to remain an important component of national security in the 
late 1990s -- and that is by no means certain -- it will certainly require a 
major overhaul under new leadership.

 Meilen Tu, a 16-year-old from Northridge playing only her second professional 
tennis match, upset eighth-seeded Amanda Coetzer, 6-1, 6-3, on Monday in the 
opening round of the Virginia Slims of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzer is ranked No. 16 in the world. Last year, the South African won 
tournaments in Australia and Japan, but she was able to win only one service 
game against Tu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I played well, I'd have a chance," said Tu, who lost to Meredith 
McGrath, 6-3, 6-4, last Tuesday at Oakland in her professional debut. "I knew 
she was a little bit nervous because I came out playing pretty well. I was 
attacking right away. I didn't give her any errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Capriati, who has been on a 15-month hiatus from tennis, will play a 
first-round match against sixth-seed Anke Huber on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati, who was arrested May 16 for misdemeanor marijuana possession, has 
refused to do interviews before her match. In a statement she said, "I wouldn't 
say I'm in tip-top shape, but I feel good enough to break the ice." 
</P>

 Capriati, 18, entered a 28-day in-patient drug rehabilitation program in Miami 
after her arrest.

NBA ROUNDUP; BULLS HAVE TOO MUCH IN RESERVE DURING 98-83 VICTORY OVER 76ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toni Kukoc scored 19 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter, when he and the 
Chicago Bulls' other reserves outscored the Philadelphia 76ers by 20 points and 
rallied the Bulls to a 98-83 victory Monday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive career-high scoring game for Kukoc, who during 
training camp balked at being a backup.The second-year pro from Croatia, who 
outscored the 76ers during the fourth quarter, 19-14, scored 25 points Saturday 
against the Washington Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Pippen, the only Bull starter to play in the final quarter, scored 22 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 104, Atlanta 86 -- Karl Malone scored 28 points and the Jazz held the 
Hawks to only 29 points in the second half at Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks were short on offensive options because of the trade of forward 
Kevin Willis to the Miami Heat before the game. The Hawks acquired Steve Smith 
and Grant Long from the Heat, but neither was at the game. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 105, New Jersey 96 -- David Robinson had 18 points and 19 rebounds 
and reached 10,000 career points to lead the Spurs at San Antonio.

MORNING BRIEFING: KINGS' JESTER FROM FRENCH LICK GETS IN LICKS FOR SPORTS 
EDITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Reynolds is the Will Rogers of the NBA. And in a day and age when 
players strike, leagues lock their players out and fans sulk, a sports humorist 
is a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds is a longtime member of the Sacramento Kings' front office. He has 
been general manager, player personnel director, coach, and now, player 
personnel director again. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, he was the luncheon speaker in Sacramento for the editors representing 
the Western Region of the Associated Press Sports Editors. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything I say here changes or improves your life," he said, "you really 
haven't got a life." 
</P>
<P>
 Good point. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: The NBA franchise known now as the Sacramento Kings is one of the 
NBA's most traveled. Where did the Kings originate? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back home in Indiana: Reynolds is from French Lick, Ind., so he obviously has 
some Larry Bird stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry was this big ugly guy," Reynolds said. "But he was the best-looking 
person in his family, and I'm not just talking about his brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "French Lick had a population of about 1,009, but we lived in the suburbs. His 
family lived in town. They were poorer then we were, so we made fun of them. 
It's the American way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 French Lick, Part Deux: Reynolds said that fame is not only fleeting in French 
Lick, it is nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom still lives back there and she's getting along in years, but my 
brother is there and helps her out a lot," he said. "A while back, my brother 
was sick and the yard started growing a lot, and Larry Bird noticed that one 
day when he drove by. So he went home, got his lawn mower and mowed my mom's 
yard. When I heard about it, I called my mother and asked her about it and she 
said, 'Oh, yes, that happened. It was one of Rose Bird's boys, but I'm not sure 
which one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA Today: "Ten years ago, the players used to come into the league with 
big contracts and at least feel guilty about it," Reynolds said. "Now, some guy 
comes in his rookie year, getting half the rebounds of Karl Malone, and making 
more money than John Stockton in a lifetime and he feels like he has it 
coming." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the world go around? "Invariably, when they say it ain't about 
money, it's about money," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking ultimate warrior: On some of the new NBA rules, including the one 
against hand-checking, Reynolds said: "I like the rule. Our league was starting 
to look like the World Wrestling Federation. Before long, Hulk Hogan would have 
been playing power forward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Life in the NBA fishbowl: "Just think about it, there I was, coaching in the 
Forum, and being able to argue with Jack Nicholson," Reynolds remembered. "Or 
watching as Magic Johnson called all the fouls for the referees in the closing 
minutes. Ah, what a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This couldn't happen, could it? Reynolds' thoughts on salaries: "If I had $70 
million guaranteed, I might miss a lick or two in some games." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' rap: The Sacramento executive had this thought on the NBA's 
projected expansion: "There are plenty of players out there for us to come up 
with a couple of more bad teams." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Kings began life as the Rochester Royals in Rochester, 
N.Y., in 1948-49. The Royals moved to Cincinnati for the 1957-58 season, then 
changed their name to the Kings and moved to Kansas City-Omaha in 1972. In 
1975, the Omaha part of the franchise was dropped and in 1985 the club moved to 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Reynolds had this final thought about the NBA, a league attuned to 
international marketing and goodwill, sending the Clippers to Japan for their 
first two games this season: "Perhaps we don't want the Japanese market." BILL

NEWSWIRE: TU, 16, UPSETS COETZER IN SECOND PRO MATCH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Meilen Tu, a 16-year-old from Northridge playing only her second professional 
match, upset eighth-seeded Amanda Coetzer, 6-1, 6-3, on Monday in the opening 
round of the Virginia Slims of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzer is ranked No. 16 in the world. Last year, the South African won 
tournaments in Australia and Japan, but she was able to win only one service 
game against Tu -- the fourth game of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 A long deuce battle ensued in the ninth game of the second set between the 
two, each using a two-handed backhand. Tu closed the match when Coetzer hit a 
lob out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew if I played well, I'd have a chance," said Tu, who lost to Meredith 
McGrath, 6-3, 6-4, last Tuesday at Oakland in her professional debut. "I knew 
she was a little bit nervous because I came out playing pretty well. I was 
attacking right away. I didn't give her any errors."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; COUGARS STILL HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT JOHNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When USC quarterback Rob Johnson cashes that big NFL bonus check next summer, 
he should send a contribution to the Washington State football scholarship 
fund.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars have been known as an outstanding defensive team but they could 
not prove it by their performances against Johnson the last three 
seasons.Johnson completed 60 of 85 passes for 915 yards against the Cougars. 
His three touchdown passes to Keyshawn Johnson on Saturday gave him seven 
against the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 And by completing 20 of 31 for 327 yards, Johnson raised his 1994 completion 
percentage to .675.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State's athletic director, Rick Dickson, will receive a letter this 
week from the Pacific 10 Conference office, reminding him that the conference 
has a guideline about impartiality on the part of public address announcers.  
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Johnson, the Cougars' PA man at Martin Stadium for the last 10 years, 
encouraged "First Down!" chants by the crowd Saturday on Cougar first downs, 
and was impartial only in announcing USC plays -- until Trojan Ed Hervey made a 
remarkable catch late in the game, a play Johnson described as "fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll send Washington State a letter, a gentle reminder, that we encourage 
impartiality," said conference spokesman Jim Muldoon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 USC faces another noted defensive team Saturday against Arizona, and Coach 
John Robinson said it's a better unit than Washington State's. "It's a more 
balanced defense, and it doesn't play as close to the edge as Washington 
State's," he said. "They play a better overall defense against a variety of 
offenses." EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; DONAHUE: WEEK OFF WAS PRODUCTIVE

<P>
 A week off did UCLA good, said Coach Terry Donahue, but, then again, it wasn't 
really a week off. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins practiced hard on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, then had a 
weekend respite before beginning preparations for Saturday's game against 
Arizona State at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a productive week," Donahue said. "We made some progress in our 
timing, and it helped get some people ready to play who might not have been 
able to play if we had had a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Mike Flanagan is one, right tackle Chad Overhauser another. Both are 
nursing leg injuries. Linebacker Rod Smalley and fullbacks Daron Washington and 
James Milliner profited by a week off to nurse injuries. All are expected to 
play Saturday night.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders' magic number is 1995. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe then they will have a new coach, a new playbook, a new attitude and a 
new opportunity to fulfill their enormous potential. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What happened Sunday at Kansas City was a disgrace to the silver and black. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 A night full of penalties, other fundamental mistakes and poor decisions left 
the Raiders (4-5) with the same record as the Rams going into Sunday's game at 
Anaheim Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The Raiders can't continue to do this," ESPN commentator Joe Theismann said 
in the third quarter after either a pass intended for Tim Brown or a run by 
Harvey Williams. "The Chiefs aren't stupid." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the Raiders continued to do that and finished with a total of three 
points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was a shame that a terrific performance by the defense -- led by Chester 
McGlockton up front and Terry McDaniel in the secondary -- was wasted. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler was off form again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The questions to be asked about the quarterback: Was last year an exceptional 
year that he won't be able to match again? Is his arm hurt? Is the play calling 
from the sidelines so predictable that he can't overcome it? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Enjoying more success Sunday was Chris Chandler of the Rams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It develops that the Rams' most important quarterback acquisition might have 
been Chandler, not Chris Miller. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chandler hung up some good numbers -- 19 for 25, 223 yards and two touchdowns 
-- in the Rams' 27-21 victory over Denver, despite having his bell rung early 
in the third quarter. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Los Angeles universities had perhaps the two best wide receivers in 
the nation, J.J. Stokes of UCLA and Johnnie Morton of USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The same should be true next season with Keyshawn Johnson of USC and Kevin 
Jordan of UCLA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a junior college transfer who caught three touchdown passes against 
Washington State, has the smile, confidence and tools of Michael Irvin. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the mythical national championship is Nebraska's to lose now that the 
Cornhuskers are No. 1 in both polls.Remember, they will be playing a highly 
ranked team in the Orange Bowl while Penn State will be playing a lesser 
regarded team in the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I guess the problem with Nick Van Exel last season was that he didn't shoot 
enough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers open their home schedule Friday against Denver, and the Clippers 
open Thursday against Atlanta. Plenty of good seats are available. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Give the edge to the Golden State Warriors in the deal that sent Billy Owens 
to the Miami Heat for Rony Seikaly. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Surprise of the rookie crop could be guard Wesley Person of the Phoenix Suns, 
who scored 23 points against Miami on Sunday. The younger brother of Chuck also 
attended Auburn and was the 23rd draft choice overall. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What do you think about those unbeaten, Atlantic Division-leading Washington 
Bullets? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only American citizen among the top 26 males in the New York City Marathon 
was third-place finisher Arturo Barrios, a native of Mexico City who got his 
citizenship papers in September. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens' front-running ride on One Dreamer, who won the Breeders' Cup 
Distaff at 47-1 Saturday, reminded me of his work aboard filly Winning Colors 
in the Kentucky Derby six years earlier. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas saddled eight starters in Breeders' Cup races and only Cat Appeal, 
who was eased in the Juvenile Fillies, didn't bring home a check. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lukas' horses earned $1,936,000, lifting the 59-year-old trainer back to the 
top of the national standings with $10,844,000 in earnings this year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lukas says Timber Country is as good as any 2-year-old he has had, which puts 
the colt in the same company with Grand Canyon. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Horses that finished first or second in each of the Breeders' Cup races have 
been nominated for stakes that make up Hollywood Park's seven-race Autumn Turf 
Festival. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita is hoping to attract Timber Country to its Derby, Concern to the 
Strub Stakes and Holy Bull to the Big 'Cap. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A young heavyweight to watch is 6-foot-5, 222-pound Courage Tshabalala of 
South Africa, who scored his eighth consecutive knockout by flattening Ricky 
Rice in 20 seconds on the Foreman-Moorer card. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I get a kick out of the boxing purists who say that having a 45-year-old 
champion is bad for the sport. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the revival of George Foreman is the greatest thing to happen to the 
sport since the emergence of Muhammad Ali.

 The seasons of Arizona State and UCLA are parallel, and for more reasons than 
their matching 3-6 records. 
</P>
<P>
 Both anticipated being better, but injuries have gotten in the way and neither 
has stood out on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is ninth in the Pacific 10 Conference in total defense and Arizona State 
is last. The Sun Devils have given up an average of 31.1 points, and teams have 
passed for 2,500 yards against them. UCLA gives up 28.1 points and 223 rushing 
yards a game.

<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys, resisting the temptation to look ahead to San Francisco, 
were in a fighting mood after losing one of their best players. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith rushed for 163 yards and scored twice and Troy Aikman threw a 
touchdown pass and ran for another Monday night in a 38-10 victory over the New 
York Giants that cost them wide receiver Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-time Super Bowl champions improved to 8-1, best in the NFL, with their 
12th consecutive victory over an NFC East opponent. Harper sprained his left 
knee just before the teams scuffled heading to the locker rooms for halftime, 
and owner Jerry Jones said the injury "didn't look good." 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a tear and we're worried about him being out for the year," Jones 
said in the press box during the game. "The way the doctors were talking, I 
didn't like the way it sounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas plays at San Francisco (7-2) next Sunday in an important game for 
playoff home-field advantage. But the Cowboys apparently weren't thinking about 
San Francisco as they handed the Giants (3-6) their sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dominated the game from start to finish but we have a tragic loss because 
Harper is probably out for the season," Dallas Coach Barry Switzer said. "It 
just devastates us. We'll have to go to a second-team player against the 
49ers." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the Giants had lost six games in a row since 1980 under 
Ray Perkins. Dallas, which has won five consecutive times against the Giants, 
hadn't beaten them this badly since a 52-7 romp in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no contest," Giant Coach Dan Reeves said. "We looked as bad as we 
could look. Dallas was too strong and too good. This hurt. I don't like to be 
embarrassed like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas put the game away quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman and Smith took the Cowboys 95 yards in 10 plays for a 7-0 lead early in 
the first quarter. Smith ground out 58 yards on the drive, and Aikman finished 
it with a 17-yard pass to Michael Irvin and a 22-yard touchdown strike to 
Harper, who beat rookie Thomas Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored Dallas' second touchdown on a one-yard run to join Jim Brown as 
only the second player in NFL history to score 10 touchdowns a season in his 
first five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowboy offensive guard Derek Kennard suffered a sprained big toe but may play 
against the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half ended on a bizarre play when Harper and Giants defensive back 
Tito Wooten went down in a tangle in the end zone on a long Hail Mary pass. 
Harper injured his left knee on the play, missed the second half and will 
undergo a magnetic resonance imaging test today. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who left the dressing room in crutches, said, "He (Wooten) 
cheap-shotted me. All I've got to tell him is the last game of the season is in 
New York and somebody is going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper left, vowing, "I'll be ready for Sunday. I'll be ready for Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 After the play, Irvin and Jarvis Williams of the Giants exchanged swings as 
more players gathered. No damage was done as the teams pushed and shoved their 
way to their dressing rooms, scattering cheerleaders and halftime performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas safety James Washington took a tripod away from a photographer during 
the scuffle and brandished it as a weapon, although he never hit anyone.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; KEEFE'S MOVE TO THE WEST COAST GIVES THE 
ANTEATERS ANOTHER SHOOTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Keefe was resigned to putting his college basketball career on hold and 
attending a prep school in the East. His SAT scores weren't lacking and his 
grade-point average was fine, but Keefe wasn't happy with the kinds of college 
opportunities afforded him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought with a year of playing at a prep school, I could get to a better 
level of Division I basketball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keefe's play last summer in an AAU tournament in Las Vegas drew notice 
and, all of sudden, he had scholarship offers from Rutgers, Boston University, 
Duquesne, Drexel, Richmond . . . and UC Irvine. The Anteaters had a scholarship 
to offer when Todd Whitehead left school because of academic difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (Rod) Baker told me he wanted me," Keefe said. "My parents kind of made 
me take the trip out here to see the school. It's a long way from home 
(Winchester, Mass.) and that was a big factor for me. I thought about it for 
two weeks before I decided. And how far away it is is what I thought about 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I really liked the coaches and when I weighed UCI with the other offers I 
got, this came down to the best opportunity. The coaches said I would get the 
chance to play some minutes because there's really only one other player at 
(the shooting guard) position." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about significant others . . . the Anteaters' starting shooting guard is 
senior Chris Brown, the nation's No. 1 three-point shooter last season. Maybe 
Keefe would have gotten more playing time at that prep school. But the 6-foot-4 
freshman has been impressive in practices and scrimmages. And he's proven that 
he's more than just a shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say he has been a surprise," Baker said. "It's more of one of 
those occasions when a player turns out to be exactly what we thought he would 
be. All too often, it's the other way around, when a player isn't as good as 
you thought and you have to start making adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 At Winchester High, Keefe averaged 28 points as a senior, was the Middlesex 
League Most Valuable Player and still wasn't a campus hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball isn't given that much attention in our town," Keefe said. "I mean 
a lot of people come to the games, but football is the big sport in our town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have a very successful basketball team. I was really the only one 
who concentrated on basketball. Everyone else on the team came out as like a 
second sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Keefe's focus resulted in his ascent to the top of Winchester's all-time 
scoring list with 1,163 points during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I was the focus of the team," Keefe said, "but it's not like I'll have 
to make this big adjustment to play here. On my AAU team, I played with guys 
who are going to Kentucky and North Carolina, so you don't go into it thinking 
you're going to be the man on those teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker says Keefe came into his own in competition with the big boys and sees 
the same kind of improvement every day during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has pretty good fundamental skills," Baker said. "He listens. He learns. 
He plays hard. And, as a sidebar to that, his ego is not a problem. I don't 
doubt that it's in there, but he keeps it in check." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, however, Keefe's self-confidence shows. After a few weeks of 
pickup games against teammates and other area college players, he was asked for 
his feelings about the local talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played against better," he said. "I think the players back East are a 
little bit better. I think I can play here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sequestered: Baker isn't exactly overjoyed with the new NCAA cost-containment 
rule that prohibits coaches from scouting other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all football," Baker said. "They do all their scouting by tape, so why 
can't we? But they all play on the same day. They have no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to hope that (an opponent) will provide us with tape, unless we can 
somehow get it off the airwaves. Anyway, you can only get nuts and bolts from 
tape. You can't get a feeling about how a team reacts to changes or certain 
situations from a tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker never misses a chance to take in a game, even when he has to accept the 
abuse he gets from Cal State Fullerton fans at Titan Gym. He admits coaches 
probably will circumvent the rule by sending local high school coaches or even 
educated boosters, but it won't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a ton of people you can send, but it's not the same," he said. "I 
want to be there, or have one of my assistants." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Polo yo-yo: The water polo team is ranked eighth in the nation, which means 
it's a down year for the Anteaters. But they're up at the moment, having upset 
sixth-ranked UCLA Sunday to extend their winning streak to three. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (8-11) will be seeded sixth in this weekend's Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation tournament at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. The Anteaters play 
ninth-seeded Long Beach State at 2 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former Corona del Mar standout Keri Phebus of UCLA is the top-seeded player 
for the Rolex/International Tennis Assn. Southern California Women's Tennis 
Regional, Wednesday through Sunday at the UCI Tennis Stadium. The singles final 
is scheduled for 10 a.m Sunday, to be followed by the doubles final. . . . The 
men's and women's cross-country teams compete Saturday in the NCAA District 8 
Championships on the Randolph Golf Course in Tucson, Ariz. . . . Rod Baker on 
freshman Kevin Simmons, who had his nose broken and front teeth loosened in 
practice 10 days ago: "He was back in practice (two days later) on Monday with 
a mouth guard and a nose thing and there's something to be said for that. We've 
had a few guys here who would've set up residence in the training room and been 
out six months." . . . Skipper Andy Beeckman and crew Danielle Hill, Eric Knopf 
and Jonathan Posner won the Sloop qualifying race at Waikiki Yacht Club last 
week to qualify for the Sloop Nationals at St. Petersburg, Fla., Nov. 18-20. . 
. . Mark Roberts, play-by-play announcer for the Riverside Pilots, will handle 
Irvine basketball broadcasts this season for KUCI (88.9 FM). Roberts has done 
play-by-play for Birmingham and Pensacola of the Continental Basketball Assn. . 
. . Members of the women's basketball team put in a lot of work during the 
off-season, according to Coach Colleen Matsuhara, and the result has been 
spirited early-season practices. "So far, I'm quite pleased with overall 
conditioning level," she said. "It's been much better than I thought it would 
be, a very pleasant surprise."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: RANCHO SANTIAGO, FULLERTON PLAYING 
FOR MORE THAN FOOTBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Put the simplest way, Rancho Santiago and Fullerton meet Saturday in the 
biggest regular-season football game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what's on the line when the Dons and Hornets play at 7 p.m. Saturday at 
Cal State Fullerton: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A share of the Mission Conference Central Division title. The teams each 
have 4-0 records. Rancho Santiago (7-1) has won seven in a row and Fullerton 
(5-2-1) has won five of its last six. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An invitation to the Simple Green Orange County Bowl Dec. 3 at Orange 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rankings. Rancho Santiago moved into the top spot in the Southland Poll 
Monday and Fullerton is ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The lead in the oldest series in the state. The teams first met in 1916 and 
are 33-33 with four ties. Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas has a 6-6 record 
against his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be fun playing (Fullerton) for the championship," Ogas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy is 0-2 against Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," Murphy said. "This is fun. Having an opportunity to coach a 
game like this is what you're in coaching for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This season: Neither team was expected to challenge for the division title but 
defense has made the difference. Fullerton is first in the 14-team conference, 
giving up 341 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the start we knew if we had a strength it was going to be the defense," 
Murphy said. "They are really playing well together and improving each week." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago is second in the conference, giving up 351 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play of our defense has been the No. 1 reason we're doing so well," Ogas 
said. "They have given us a lot of confidence to try things on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago is coming off a 72-21 victory over Southwestern. The 72 points 
is a Mission Conference record and the second-highest total in the Dons' 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons scored 80 points against El Centro (now Imperial Valley) in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton beat Orange Coast, 35-9, also on Saturday. The Hornets had eight 
tackles for losses and OCC had minus 37 yards rushing in 23 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterbacks: Rancho Santiago's Simon Fuentes and Fullerton's Marc O'Brien 
are accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes, from Garden Grove High, is 87 of 128 (68%) for 1,382 yards. He has 16 
touchdowns, which ties a Rancho Santiago single-season record. Four of his 
passes have been intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, from Valencia High, is 134 of 202 (66%) for 1,702 yards with 10 
touchdowns and five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A large crowd?: If ever a game could draw well, it's this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the teams met in a game of this importance was in 1988 when 
Fullerton was 7-0 and Rancho Santiago was 6-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton made a goal-line stand in the final minute and came away with a 
24-17 victory before about 5,000 at Fullerton District Stadium. Coincidentally, 
the series was tied (30-30-4) before that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can get a big crowd," Ogas said. "We're going to tell the kids 
about the olden days and try to renew the rivalry." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is doing what it can to increase the crowd by offering a two-for-one 
ticket deal on $7.50 reserved seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is available with a coupon, which can be obtained at the Fullerton 
athletic department, at Boege's Sporting Goods, the Togo's sandwich shop across 
from the college, the National Sports Grill and the Off-Campus Pub. All 
locations are in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 General admission tickets are $5. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 And one more makes 100: Golden West is going for its 100th consecutive 
conference victory in women's volleyball at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Rancho 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (16-2, 9-0) beat Saddleback in three games Friday for its 99th 
consecutive conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over Saddleback also assured the Rustlers of at least a tie for 
the Orange Empire Conference title. Golden West is ranked second in Southern 
California behind Cerritos, which beat the Rustlers twice earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West, the five-time defending State champion, is the top-seeded team in 
the Southern California water polo playoffs, which start Friday at Long Beach 
Belmont Plaza. The Rustlers (25-2) play No. 8 Rancho Santiago (18-12) at 9:30 
a.m. Long Beach (20-4) is seeded second and plays No. 7 Fullerton (21-11) at 
12:30 p.m. In other first-round games: No. 4 Citrus (29-5) plays No. 5 Orange 
Coast (17-7) at 11 a.m. and No. 3 Grossmont (28-6) plays No. 6 Cuesta (18-9) at 
2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round winners qualify for the State tournament, Nov. 18-19 at 
Belmont Plaza. The Southern California tournament continues with semifinal 
games at 6 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. Friday. The championship game starts at 7:30 p.m. 
Saturday.

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; GREENBERG SATISFIED WITH TEAM'S PLAY IN 
SEASON'S FIRST EXHIBITION GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One exhibition game does not a season make, so men's basketball Coach Seth 
Greenberg is understandably neither giddy nor dejected following Saturday's 
102-94 victory over High Five America at The Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most teams in early November, the 49ers didn't look especially polished 
in their exhibition opener. Overall, though, Greenberg is satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played hard and unselfish," Greenberg said. "We did a good job 
extending our defense. I thought our defense was great for 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach led by as many as 18 points in the first half and 17 in the second. 
The 49ers often beat High Five America's pressure defense, leading to many 
layups and open jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Their success against the pressure is a big reason the 49ers shot so well. 
Long Beach was 68.3% from the field -- including a sparkling 80.8% after 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We handled it well," Greenberg said. "We've only worked on our pressure 
offense for about 10 minutes in practice so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, point guard Rasul Salahuddin and forward Juaquin Hawkins, both 
juniors, stood out, Greenberg said. Salahuddin (6 feet 3) scored nine points 
and tied Hawkins (6-6) for the team lead in assists with seven. Hawkins also 
scored four points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rasul was pretty solid when the game was undecided," Greenberg said. "Juaquin 
played exactly the way I want him to." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach did commit an eye-popping 35 turnovers, but Greenberg said he 
didn't lose any sleep over those miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing combinations out there that we won't be playing together 
during the season," he said. "We made some stupid passes when we were up by 17, 
but most of the turnovers were the result of some unique lineups." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting game: An NCAA decision on the eligibility of senior point guard Tyrone 
Mays is expected within the month, said Mary Ann Tripodi, Long Beach director 
of compliance and student services. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays, a starter for the men's basketball team last season, is academically 
ineligible for the fall semester because Long Beach officials incorrectly 
counseled him about selecting the proper courses in order to remain eligible 
under NCAA guidelines. Long Beach filed an appeal with the NCAA eligibility 
committee, seeking to restore Mays' eligibility immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 If denied, Mays (6-1) would become eligible at the end of the fall semester if 
he maintains satisfactory academic progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said Mays needs only six classes to graduate. At worst, Mays, who is 
practicing with the team, should miss only five games. Tripodi said he should 
regain eligibility in time to play with the 49ers in the Michigan State 
tournament (Dec. 29-30) at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the wire: Hawaii's split with the 49ers last week keeps the Big West 
Conference women's volleyball race going. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii (21-3, 14-2 in conference), ranked fifth in the nation by Volleyball 
Monthly magazine, closes its conference schedule by playing two matches against 
No. 11 UC Santa Barbara (22-5, 11-3), the conference's fourth-place team, on 
Thursday and Friday at home. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Long Beach (19-4, 13-2), which is tied for second with Pacific, will 
play seventh-place Irvine (6-17, 5-10) tonight at The Gold Mine, and closes its 
conference schedule at fifth-place San Jose State (12-10, 8-7) on Friday and at 
No. 6 Pacific (20-3, 13-2) on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach water polo team will play host to the Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation tournament, beginning Friday at 2 p.m. on campus. The tournament 
continues Saturday and Sunday, starting at 8 a.m. both days, at the Belmont 
Plaza Pool in Long Beach. Stanford is seeded first in the nine-team field, 
followed by USC, California, Pepperdine, Pacific, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara, 
UCLA and Long Beach. Injuries have wrecked the season for Long Beach (5-16, 0-8 
in federation), but a strong showing would make things a little brighter around 
the 49ers' pool. "With the problems we've had," Coach Ken Lindgren said, 
"anything would be a plus." . . . Elated 49er athletic officials said 
approximately 10,000 people toured The Pyramid Saturday in conjunction with The 
Brewster's Long Beach State Tip-Off Celebration Dinner. What's more, officials 
said the school has sold 1,429 season tickets -- nearly tripling the previous 
record of 500 established during the early 1970s. Many season-ticket packages 
also have been sold. "We set aggressive goals coming in and and we're exceeding 
them at this point," said Bill Shumard, assistant athletic 
director/administration and development. "The public's response to The Pyramid 
has been nothing short of tremendous." No need for worry, though. Shumard said 
several hundred tickets will be available for every game at the 5,000-seat 
facility. . . . A game between the women's basketball team and 49er alumni is 
scheduled Saturday night at 7:30 p.m. at The Gold Mine.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: PASQUARELLA BRINGS SUCCESS TO AYALA HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few months after Mark Pasquarella was hired as the football coach at Ayala 
High in Chino Hills in 1990, he began to wonder what he had gotten himself 
into. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the school had not yet opened, the former Covina coach had to conduct 
spring practice on a local field with little grass and lots of gopher holes. By 
fall, the sprawling campus had opened but there were no athletic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 freshmen and sophomores who went out for the team spent their first 
season practicing at nearby Boys' Republic High, a boarding school for problem 
kids. Home games were played at Chino High. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things I thought would be in place simply weren't," said 
Pasquarella, who had left a job at Covina High for Ayala. "There was talk 
(that) the campus might not even open up on time. We didn't have a field, and 
the locker room wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly second-guessed my decision to leave Covina." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, however, things had improved. The school's teams were given 
varsity status and assigned to the Southern Section's Olympic League, a 
Division X conference made up primarily of private schools with small 
enrollments. Although there were no seniors, Ayala finished 4-6 that football 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1992, the Bulldogs had moved up to the Division III Sierra League. Lineman 
Steve Dundee became the school's first player to receive a Division I 
scholarship, signing with Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, things have gone better than anticipated. Ayala qualified for the 
playoffs last year and was eliminated by Montebello in the first round, 24-21. 
This year, the Bulldogs were the division's top-ranked team until they lost to 
Rowland, 7-6, last Friday.

 At 8-1 with a game left in the regular season, Ayala is guaranteed its second 
consecutive playoff appearance and expects to get a home game in the first 
round. Quarterback Steve Birnbaum, a 6-foot-4, 180-pound senior, is being 
recruited by several colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala's enrollment has grown from 1,000 in 1990 to 2,900. More than 100 
players are out for football. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have any bleachers or lights, but the program is moving 
ahead," Pasquarella said "It's taken a while for the kids to buy into our 
coaching philosophy, but they're coming around." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ayala is not the only new school enjoying success on the football field. 
Fontana A.B. Miller, South El Monte, Corona Centennial and Rancho Cucamonga 
have all had winning seasons shortly after opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga leads the pack, however. In only its third year, the school 
has a league title to its credit and could add another this season. The Cougars 
finished 10-2 last year after losing to Temecula Valley in the Southern Section 
Division V quarterfinals. They are 8-1 this season and expected to challenge 
for the Division VI title. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids bought into our program much quicker than any of us expected," Coach 
Pete Fotia said. "This has all been a very pleasant surprise." 
</P>

<P>
 Carson, the City Section's defending Division 4-A champion, is in danger of 
missing the playoffs after three forfeits left the team with a 1-8 record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts, who have won nine City championships, are coming off a 13-10 loss 
to San Pedro in a Southern Pacific Conference game Friday. Before that, they 
had to forfeit conference victories over Crenshaw, Harbor City Narbonne and 
Wilmington Banning for using an academically ineligible sophomore transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson finishes the regular season Thursday afternoon at home against 
Washington. A victory would improve its conference record to 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
 A playoff committee will meet Friday to determine the 4-A and 3-A brackets. 
The section's top 16 teams will be put in 4-A and the second 16 in 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "For varying reasons I still feel we're a good team that should make the 4-A 
playoffs," said Carson Coach David Williams. "But our destiny is out of my 
control right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Belmont's Robert Levy, a member of the playoff committee: "Carson is 
probably a team that should be in the 4-A playoffs, but you have to put your 
feelings aside and look at their record."

 Bill Redell, a football coach accustomed to the limelight, is suffering 
through his second losing season at St. Francis in La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Crespi coach who guided the Russell White-led Celts to the Southern 
Section Division I championship in 1986, took over at St. Francis last year 
with expectations of quickly rebuilding the Catholic school's football 
fortunes. But the Golden Knights finished 3-7 last year and are 4-4-1 this 
season, having lost consecutive league games to Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and 
West Hills Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I misjudged just exactly how far down the program was when I took it 
over," Redell said. "I think it has improved the last two seasons, but we're 
certainly below where I thought we'd be." 
</P>

 Bloomington is expected to be the section's top-seeded Division VIII team. The 
Bruins became the state's highest scoring 11-man team in the regular season 
last Friday with a 68-27 victory over Riverside La Sierra. In nine games, 
Bloomington has scored 580 points, breaking the record of 565 set by Redding 
Foothill last year. . . . Senior Edgar Soto rushed for 158 yards and two

BOOK REVIEW: NOVEL; LIFE AS A FAILED WRITER AND BOGUS ACADEMIC IN A RITZY 
ITALIAN VILLA; THE CLIFF, BY DAVID R. SLAVITT ; LOUISIANA UNIVERSITY PRESS; 
$21.95, 154 PAGES

 David Slavitt's 50th book -- yes, 50th -- is a savage sendup of the literary 
life, a novel to keep away from those innocents entering MFA programs who don't 
yet know about things like agents, slush piles, writer's block, book tours, bad 
reviews, university tenure, writers colonies and grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of "The Cliff" is deceptively hilarious. John Smith is a failed 
writer taking refuge in teaching at an obscure college. Out of the blue, he 
receives a letter from The Foundation inviting him to spend some time, all 
expenses paid, at the legendary Villa Sfondrata in Bellagio, Italy, so he can 
finish his project on the death of Mussolini in peace and quiet, surrounded by 
lakes, Alps and fresh air. The letter, however, was meant for the respected 
historian John Smith, on the other side of campus. This John Smith is more 
interested in mostaccioli than in Mussolini -- and he's about to be sacked by 
the English department. 
</P>
<P>
 He carries the letter around in his pocket for a few days, fully intending to 
deliver it to the real John Smith. But time passes. Then the real John Smith 
has a heart attack and is attached to various life-support systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Our John Smith figures the real John Smith has more important things on his 
mind -- like staying alive -- than worrying about responding to The Foundation 
about some grant. So, with no job prospects, no income, soon no place to live 
and nobody to go visit, John Smith goes to the Villa Sfondrata pretending he is 
the John Smith who is writing about the death of Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
 Having seen too many Peter Sellers and Woody Allen movies, I went into this 
story fully expecting a sidesplitting escapade of mismatched identities, a 
silly love story, lots of slapstick entrances and exits (maybe a few guys 
dressed in gorilla suits) and a colorful cast of solipsistic, 
pseudo-intellectual literary characters exchanging witty dialogue. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cliff," although smart, doesn't turn out to be quite as hilarious as the 
premise implies. Slavitt is not so much telling a story as using his narrative 
to spoof everything he's probably come across in his distinguished and, let's 
face it, long academic career. He's jousting with philosophy and ethics ("It 
would be agreeable to go to the Italian Alps . . . But surely unethical! 
Outrageous to take advantage in that way of someone's innocent error. . . . But 
by now I was thinking what Freud had taught me to think, that there is no such 
thing as an error"). 
</P>
<P>
 There are some wondrously funny moments. Our brilliant, moody, schlemiel of a 
narrator, a guy who can't even make his rent, is highly critical of the food 
served at this historic villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Our John Smith, the impostor, lives in daily terror of being exposed as a 
fake. His biggest worry are the evenings when the resident musicians, 
statesmen, poets or scientists discuss their works in progress. The guests -- 
who come and go -- and there are lots of them -- seem amusing enough, like the 
publisher who twirls, skips and hops down the halls when he thinks he is alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem here is that the characters are described, and Slavitt lets it go 
at that: There they are and well, isn't it amusing? Then one guest disappears. 
Slavitt's now turned it into a mystery, sort of Agatha Christie-style. But as 
the narrator, and reader, suspects: it's hardly a mystery at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavitt is brilliant and he writes with grace, passion and humor. The 
narrator's sincere attempts to reconcile with his alienated daughter are 
touching and not at all sentimental. The highlight of the book must be the 
narrator's scathing letter to the manager about the villa's terrible service 
and dismissive treatment of its guests. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is, inevitably, the ersatz historian John Smith's version of the 
death of Mussolini, a sendup of why the Italians could never win a war: The 
partisans have captured Il Duce but don't know what to do with him. "In 
Menaggio, however, the phone was out of order. They pushed on farther south to 
Mezzegra, another tiny village just below Tremezzo, where a prominent partisan 
chieftain lived, or anyway his mother did, in a farmhouse in the hills. They 
figured they could ask him what to do. Or at least to use the phone. Or if not 
the phone, then the bathroom . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cliff" unfortunately is too self-consciously satirical to pass as a real 
novel. It is an academic exercise in how the writing life works -- but the book 
fails, ironically, as fiction.

RSVP; CHANEL'S NO. 1; BOUTIQUE FOLLOWS TRADITION WITH BENEFIT FOR LOCAL ARTS 
EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS

 In the tradition of Coco Chanel, fashion came to the aid of the arts Saturday 
when the Chanel boutique in South Coast Plaza staged a benefit for local arts 
education and outreach programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Orange County performing arts organizations -- Opera Pacific, the 
Pacific Symphony Orchestra and South Coast Repertory -- came together for a 
fund-raiser and performance called "Saturday in the Plaza with Chanel." 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 people paid $75 each (or $125 for preferred seating) to attend. 
Proceeds were expected to exceed $20,000 and will be distributed equally among 
the beneficiaries. Following Chanel's Footsteps 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities began with a buffet reception and informal fashion show in which 
wispy-thin models sported head-turners such as quilted mini-skirts, simple 
black slip gowns and other selections from Chanel's 1995 cruise collection. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's impossible to know what Chanel would have thought of the clothes, 
she certainly would have approved of the cause. She was known for supporting 
Igor Stravinski, Jean Cocteau and other artists of her day. In keeping with her 
spirit, Roger Martin, director of the Chanel boutique, decided to honor local 
performing arts groups that offer outreach programs to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not feel arts education was getting the attention it deserved," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers filled their plates with fare catered by Wolfgang Puck. Among the 
offerings were gourmet pizzas with smoked salmon or shrimp, seafood salads, 
Mediterranean cuisine and such Asian specialties as pot stickers and shrimp 
tempura. Three Acts 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m., guests were invited to a makeshift theater set up in the center's 
Jewel Court to see samples of the arts programs each group takes to Orange 
County schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all of the cutbacks in arts education, these organizations are taking it 
upon themselves" to expose young people to the arts, said Barbara Roberts, who 
co-chaired the event with her husband, Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory presented a play called "Make the Break," a story about 
a teen-age boy who recently broke up with his girlfriend and must overcome his 
grief to help a friend. The play, written by Jervey Tervalon, recently toured 
local junior high and high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an audience that doesn't get much live theater," said Jose Cruz 
Gonzalez, director of the play. "We're developing audiences for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Pacific's Overture Company presented selections from Donizetti's "Don 
Pasquale." The show also featured performances by members of the Pacific 
Symphony Institute Orchestra and 15-year-old Brenda Lee Jones, winner of the 
1994 PSO Chinese-American League Showcase for Young Musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time the three primary producers have worked together on a 
fund-raiser," said Louis Spisto, executive director of the PSO. "It's a great 
way to showcase their programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the faces in the crowd: Beth Broderick, star of the television show "The 
Five Mrs. Buchanans" and former Huntington Beach resident, who created a stir 
with her sheer white mini-skirt; Gloria Gellman, George and Arlene Cheng, 
William and Laila Conlin, Jerry and Bobbi Dauderman, James and Barbara Glabman, 
Patricia Houston, Claire Trevor Bren, Olivia Johnson, John and Susan Kensey, 
Tom and Anne Key, Frank and Marilyn Lynch, Marcy and Maurice Mulville, Sharlene 
Strawbridge, Gayle Widyolar and David Scott. KATHRYN BOLD

O.C. ART REVIEW; WEIGHING RELIGIOUS PROS AND ICONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Never a stranger to adventurous art -- and hallelujah for that -- Chapman 
University's Guggenheim Gallery has taken on a hugely controversial topic in 
"Treading on Hallowed Ground" (through Nov. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 mostly little-known artists represented in the show address a society 
in which genuine spiritual expression often has been eclipsed by materialism, 
bigotry and doublespeak. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by the gallery's associate curator, Maggie Owens (with a frequently 
illuminating essay by Jacki Apple, a performance artist who teaches art history 
at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena), the show encompasses a range of 
viewpoints and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the artists seem to be making an earnest, if awkward, case for the 
viability of traditional religious symbolism, while others use it to comment on 
the oppressive results of religious dogmatism. (Although the show was to have 
included work by Joel Peter Witkin -- famous for his photographs of grotesques 
-- a dispute with his former dealer kept him from participating, according to 
Owens.) 
</P>
<P>
 Several pieces vividly telegraph sardonic points of view, if not necessarily 
with the degree of nuance and metaphorical richness offered by the most 
rewarding art. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Davis' painting "The Conformist" offers a standardized image of Jesus -- 
except that he wears the brown business suit and American flag pin of a 
religious conservative. The irony, of course, stems from the disjunction 
between this image and the renegade historical Jesus. Amusingly, the celestial 
light around his head recalls formal Bachrach-style portraits of business 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Barminski's paintings give a hip, flip spin to traditional icons, 
reflecting an age that markets Christ and Pepsi with cheerfully similar 
crassness. "Time Out for Refreshing" archly implies that a swig of Pepsi might 
be just the thing Jesus could have used to take the sting out of his crown of 
thorns. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Hernandez contrasts the comfort and visual splendor of religious 
ceremony with the inflexibility of some of its religious tenets in "All the 
Pope's Children," an editorialized version of a Pope's miter. Against the 
blood-red silk of the ornamental headdress, myriad tiny blue embroidered hands 
symbolize aborted fetuses -- or, possibly, babies abandoned by mothers whose 
faith officially allowed no other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Ocampo, one of the Young Turks of the Los Angeles art world, is known 
for images that fiercely decry the Catholic Church's historical complicity with 
politically oppressive regimes, particularly in New World colonial outposts of 
Catholic Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 In his untitled painting in this show, Ocampo ventures again into 
controversial territory by focusing on imagery identified with Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional image of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns merges in Ocampo's 
painting with the claws and wings of what appears to be a Nazi eagle emblem 
clutching a bloody, headless body. Accompanied by double swastikas, this 
man-bird (a bitterly distorted combination of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, often 
shown in art as a dove) flies above a prison or concentration camp courtyard 
peopled by devils. 
</P>
<P>
 In a corner of the painting -- where a wealthy donor might appear in 
Renaissance religious art -- a praying woman is consumed by fire. Viewed 
through Ocampo's uncompromisingly severe vision, collusion between evil 
temporal and spiritual empires demonizes the poor sinner and offers, at best, a 
false salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear whether Ocampo means to indict Pius XII, the conflict-avoiding 
Pope whose rule began in 1939. Decidedly anti-Nazi, the Pope nevertheless chose 
to preserve the church as an island of neutrality and to avoid possible 
reprisals on defenseless believers rather than speak out decisively against the 
slaughter of Jews and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the other work in the show lacks the one-two punch of these 
pieces, in part because, as Apple points out, "the attempt to infuse the art 
object with a spiritual message or content is a far more difficult task" than 
ironic commentary. But there are a couple of exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Watton's quilt, appliqued with the words "Believe or Die," ironically 
recalls the dilemma of Catholic and fundamentalist Protestant women who cannot 
choose abortion without contravening the patriarchal laws of their religion. It 
is the medium, however, that lifts this piece above mere sloganeering. 
</P>
<P>
 Often made by several women working together, quilts are vehicles of 
cooperation as well as symbols of "traditional" (read: anti-liberal) values. 
Quilts also are attractive and useful articles made from castoff materials. 
Implicitly, the piece seems to call for compassionate understanding of women's 
struggle of conscience, as well as new ways of reworking outworn ideas for 
women caught between belief and reality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Cecile Gee is the standout, however, for her strikingly successful 
juxtaposition of two loaded images in "Cross Bed." A bed supported on a 
jerry-built foundation of plain wooden crosses and made up with flowing white 
sheets evokes the private struggle of a Believer trying to reconcile the 
uncompromising demands of faith with the lures of comfort and sexual 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the bed hangs a mirror; in this context, it might be either a sexual aid 
or the representation of an infallible Eye whose imagined scrutiny of Gee's 
soul may be inseparable from Gee's troubled gaze at her own psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the appeals made by other pieces on view are not as clearly or 
thoughtfully constructed, or as compelling on a visual level, the show offers 
an excellent springboard for discussion and reflection on a burning topic. 
Particularly at a university, where students are encouraged to open their minds 
to divergent ideas, shows like this are only to be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Treading on Hallowed Ground" continues through Nov. 19 at the Guggenheim 
Gallery, Chapman University, 333 N. Glassell St., Orange. Hours: noon to 5 p.m.

ART REVIEW; CONTINUITY OF LIFE IN INDIA'S ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Peaceful Liberators: Jain Art From India," a beautiful new exhibition 
that opened Sunday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, a group of more 
than 20 compelling sculptures are unlike any I've seen before. In fact, they 
may have no counterparts anywhere in world art. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often carved in the soft sandstone so common to Indian sculpture, but 
found in metal and other, harder kinds of stone as well, they depict figures, 
always unclothed and always male, standing upright in a quietly unusual, 
frontal pose. 
</P>
<P>
 The legs are stiff, feet slightly apart. Arms hang loosely from broad 
shoulders but away from the tapering torso, so that the arms never touch the 
body. The head faces forward, with the trace of a smile across its full and 
sensuous lips and eyes typically downcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The smooth limbs of these standing figures are usually columnar and elongated, 
the arms ending in oversized hands that hang like weights meant to stabilize 
the torso. Elongated earlobes dangle too. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a body in which every muscle, nerve-ending and square inch of exposed 
flesh seems utterly relaxed yet briskly attentive, as if meant to be receptive 
to the slightest sign of life outside itself, and you'll have some idea of how 
remarkable the pose is. It's as if the entire body functions as a kind of human 
dowsing rod, mystically attuned to the hidden rhythms of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 The pose is called kayotsarga , which roughly translates into 
"body-abandonment" posture. It is believed to represent a perfect pose of 
nonviolence, in which a human being can inflict the least harm on any living 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you're unaware of that precept, which is specific to the Jain 
religion, there's no mistaking the eloquent vulnerability of the pose. A 
visible sense of renunciation, to which the human spirit surrenders itself, is 
broadcast loud and clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jain religion is far less well-known than the Buddhism and Hinduism so 
familiar in India, but it shares many central tenets with both. A spiritual 
quest seeks liberation from the otherwise eternal karmic cycle of life, in 
which death is followed by reincarnation. In a manner unique to Jainism these 
sculptures demonstrate, in part, how to slip those mortal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 They also make up a significant chunk of the largest segment of the LACMA 
show, a segment composed of 36 sculptural images of spiritual deities known as 
Jinas, from which the religion derives its name (Jain is pronounced jine ). The 
others show deities seated in the cross-legged lotus pose of meditation, and 
they include an austerely elegant, red-sandstone Jina encircled by a delicately 
carved halo, as well as an elaborately carved stele whose graceful central 
figure is surrounded by more than a score of attendants, lions and elephants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jainism is a religion of radical asceticism, but it shares a lot with Buddhism 
and Hinduism. (The nudity of the sculptural Jinas, a practice followed by Jain 
monks, is symbolic of a complete renunciation of worldly things, including 
clothes.) If subjects differ, stylistically not much seems to separate Jain art 
from its Buddhist and Hindu kin. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, repetition of sensuous forms and intricacy of luxurious patterns 
proliferate. Together, these stylistic traits evoke a continuity of life and a 
resplendent sense of connectedness among all things. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborate patterning also declares a central role for decoration in Jain art. 
Not only are the figures ornamented, they are themselves ornaments: Many of the 
carvings were originally part of vast decorative programs on temples and 
shrines. Decorative adornment assumes a kind of sanctity. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which was deftly organized by LACMA senior curator 
Pratapaditya Pal and also features an essential catalogue with several readable 
essays, is the first to focus on Jain art. Its 127 sculptures, paintings and 
architectural fragments, which range in date from the First Century to the 
early 20th Century, include rare loans from India and Britain, many never 
before seen in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It also includes a likely surprise for any but the Jain specialist. In 
addition to the three dozen sculptures of Jinas, there are galleries for often 
remarkable ritual objects and for images of subsidiary deities. Yet, the show 
concludes with an unexpected room dominated by monumental paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 For those (like me) who think first of exquisite miniatures when Indian 
painting is considered, the existence of monumental works comes as something of 
a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One gallery in the exhibition contains elaborate folios and decorated book 
covers from a variety of Jain manuscripts, and several eye-popping 
cosmographical charts are also on view. But monumental Indian paintings? 
</P>
<P>
 Those in the show's last room are apparently unique to the Jain faithful. 
Typically made with opaque watercolors on cotton cloth, they are of two kinds: 
images of cosmic man (woman, as in most Indian art, has a tougher time in the 
transcendence racket) and pilgrimage pictures depicting holy sites. 
</P>
<P>
 One cosmic man is a flat, partially transparent silhouette of a 7-foot-tall 
Jina standing in the body-abandonment posture. He is metaphorically tattooed 
with symbols of the higher universe, around the head and shoulders; of the 
earthly realm, corresponding to the torso, and of the infernal world, in the 
vicinity of the legs and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more remarkable are the colorful pilgrimage pictures, in which aerial 
maps of holy sites merge with frontal representations of shrines and temples. 
The big, ornate, tapestry-like paintings would be hung during festivals, so 
that those Jains who were unable actually to make the pilgrimage could get the 
same benefits by looking at the picture. This is landscape painting of a most 
unusual order. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a fitting coda to an unusually ambitious and compelling show. "The 
Peaceful Liberators" ranks among the most significant shows the museum has 
organized in several seasons.

PACIFIC CHORALE'S OPENER HAS PROPER SEASONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Post-Brahmsian music written by Howard Hanson in 1969 and Morten Lauridsen in 
1980 set the stage Sunday night for John Alexander's highly effective 
conducting of Brahms' own "Ein deutsches Requiem" in the Pacific Chorale's 
season-opening program at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was not too much. Hanson's handsome "Streams in the Desert," colorfully 
rather than painfully tonal, and Lauridsen's lean, alternately acerbic and lush 
"Mid-Winter Songs" composer without actually aping his style. Still, their debt 
to him is clear. Our debt to him, of course, is long-established and resonates 
in every part of the "German" Requiem. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's association with this monument gives him the courage to take 
risks, which he did Sunday in some very slow tempos in the two opening 
movements. In terms of continuity and dramatic tension, he made those tempos 
work; they set up the excitement that arrives midway through that second 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, the conductor followed through with canny musical choices. He 
allowed choral climaxes to peak dynamically without ever becoming strident; he 
coaxed some first-rate soft-playing from the assisting Pacific Symphony; he let 
the work speak through its contrasts. Brahms was well-served. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander's 180-plus vocal musicians seemed in fine form, producing handsome 
sounds, strong blend and legato singing, and, half the time (in German), 
followable text-articulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 David Pittman-Jennings was the authoritative, if sometimes woolly sounding, 
baritone soloist in the Requiem, Margaret Morrison the clear-voiced but 
unradiant soprano. 
</P>
<P>
 The more touching performances were given in the first half of this evening, 
when Hanson's ode to nature in the face of drought (Isaiah 35) gorgeously 
sounded a defense of the environment few could refute. With champions like 
Gerard Schwarz -- who has now recorded a number of Hanson's symphonies -- and 
Alexander, the all-but-neglected composer may rise again. 
</P>
<P>
 As performed elegantly by the Pacific Chorale, Lauridsen's masterly 
"Mid-Winter Songs" achieved a transparency and emotional resonance the 
composer, who was present, must have appreciated. In this part of the program, 
the (English) text emerged clearly, the dominant sound of the chorale meshed 
effortlessly with that of the orchestra, and the beauties of Robert Graves' 
words were unimpeded.

 Ready for King David, the Musical?: Producer Andre Djaoui says a musical he's 
planning based on the life of King David will be "the most spectacular and 
dramatic production ever staged, as well as conveying a message of inspiration, 
hope and peace to the world." The producer has some impressive talent to back 
his claims: composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice, Academy Award winners 
for their score of the animated Disney hit "Aladdin." They will write the music 
and libretto for the biblical tale, which is slated to be staged in Jerusalem 
in 1996 to mark that city's 3,000th anniversary. "King David" is also expected 
to tour worldwide, including a stop in Los Angeles, before alighting on New 
York's Broadway and London's West End. Menken also has a current Broadway stage 
success with the music for "Beauty and the Beast" (he co-wrote the original 
film score), while Rice co-wrote the score for the latest Disney animated 
movie, "The Lion King." For Rice, this will be his third biblical musical. He 
was the librettist for "Jesus Christ Superstar" and "Joseph and the Amazing 
Technicolor Dreamcoat." Cast and production crew have not yet been selected.

 Accentuating the Positive: It used to be that networks announced when shows 
were being canceled. But now, given the delicate state of prime-time series, 
it's news when additional episodes are ordered for existing programs. So ABC, 
which last week canceled "Blue Skies," announced that it has called for nine 
new chapters of "On Our Own" and six more of "Me and the Boys." "On Our Own" is 
a Sunday night family show about five brothers and two sisters who have been 
orphaned; "Boys" appears on Tuesday nights and stars comic Steve Harvey as a 
widower with three sons. The added shows will give "On Our Own" a total of 22 
and "Boys" 19. MUSIC

JAZZ REVIEW; GENE HARRIS SERVES HIS BLUES-PLATE SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Harris doesn't like to stray far from home. That's not to say the 
renowned keyboardist and confirmed homebody doesn't travel the world with his 
quartet, big band or as a soloist. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he performs, Harris is most at home with the blues. And no matter how 
somber the ballad, how upbeat the be-bop tune or how infectious the pop ditty 
he's playing, Harris stays close to home, injecting the blues into everything 
he presents. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was no surprise Sunday afternoon at the Robert B. Moore Theatre at 
Orange Coast College that Harris, after announcing he would "ease" into the 
program with his quartet and play some blues later in the show, turned the 
first number, the melancholy "The Trouble With Hello Is Goodby," into a 
showcase for his blues-drenched keyboard ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Here and elsewhere during the performance Harris displayed his signature 
touches: rolling barrelhouse lines, lots of flatted fifth accents (the "blue 
note") and dynamic swings that ranged from softly spoken phrases to shout 
chords. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the tune, Harris made his bluesy approach work. Of the least 
likely numbers in which this technique succeeded was Chuck Mangione's "Children 
of Sanchez," the Latin-inflected, melodic theme that was made all the more 
poignant by Harris' take-it-to-church attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard jazz tunes Harris chose, such as Thelonious Monk's "Straight No 
Chaser" and Sonny Rollins' "Oleo," were perfect vehicles for Harris' style and 
he filled them with an almost gospel-hall excitement. Straight blues tunes like 
"C.C. Rider" found Harris at his crowd-pleasing best. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris' foil in this approach was guitarist Ron Eschete, who proved himself 
capable of bending a few notes himself. Eschete's style, though, is more 
direct. As a soloist, he strings together long, lyrical phrases that 
occasionally break off into dissonant counterpoints. His tones are clear and 
precise, but this finely cut style doesn't stop him from proceeding at 
breakneck speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eschete is also clever at dropping themes from other songs as he purrs along. 
On this afternoon, he was heard to quote from "Bernie's Tune," "Eleanor Rigby" 
and "Salt Peanuts," among others. Each fit hand-in-glove inside the musical 
context. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon's best-received quotation came from bassist Luther Hughes, whose 
"Oleo" improvisation metamorphosed into "The Flintstones" theme. Hughes gave 
solid support throughout the show, whether called upon for sensitive backing or 
gut-bucket pluck. His solos, often employing his instrument's upper range, were 
crisp, fleet and full of musical content. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Paul Humphrey provided adequate, to-the-beat timekeeping and rattling 
improvs that kept his three partners jumping. Humphrey used brushes, sticks and 
his bare hands during the course of "Straight No Chaser," giving his 
presentation harmonic as well as rhythmic weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The foursome seemed to peak just before the first intermission with an upbeat 
medley that opened with George Gershwin's "Summertime." It never reached that 
pitch again during the performance's second half, which opened with a "clean, 
polite" (as Harris described it) version of "By-By Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 Show-closing presentations of "Funky Gene's" and a flag-waving rendition of 
"Battle Hymn of the Republic," though vibrant with blues and gospel feel, were 
something less than the big-win excitement that one expects from the dynamic 
keyboardist. But the first set was a sure winner.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; FASTBACKS STAY ON SLOW TRACK TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seattle's Fastbacks have inspired half of the Northwest's '90s rock bands, but 
even after 12 years the power-punk quartet itself remains fairly obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, at Hell's Gate in Hollywood, the quartet banged out hyperactive pop 
for a small group of avid fans while messing around on stage as if at a casual 
rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the set was so loud it massed into one eardrum-busting buzz, the rest 
slap-happy punk with no particular place to go. Though fun in spots, there was 
a nagging sense of defeat as the band seemed to just give up toward the end -- 
playing sloppily, even by grungy standards. 
</P>
<P>
 There was hardly time to clap in between numbers as the band jammed songs 
back-to-back Ramones style. Lead singer and bassist Kim Warnick, clad in 
cutoffs and plenty of eyeliner, sang in tough monotones, while second guitarist 
and singer Lulu Gargiulo injected engaging, sing-to-yourself-in-the-shower 
vocals. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Bloch, the group's primary writer, provided jokes in between numbers, 
then launched catchy and moving tunes, motivating a few audience members to 
pogo. But the Fastback's main asset -- a driving pop sensibility -- ultimately 
became buried under a haphazard delivery with no zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the otherwise likable band, you could see why it's remained on the 
fringes -- it's hard to embrace a group that shows so little interest in its 
own work. LORRAINE ALI

MUSIC REVIEWS; SEQUENTIA OFFERS HAUNTING PROGRAM OF MEDIEVAL SOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No doubt, the sound of the respected Medieval music group Sequentia, founded 
in 1977, has benefited from the fickle machinations of the music market. This 
year, Gregorian chant has received an almost surreal boost in popularity, 
thanks to best-selling chant albums.Things ancient are suddenly fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Age is always relative. Sequentia's two performances Sunday for the Da Camera 
Society's Chamber Music in Historic Sites series, sponsored by Mount St. Mary's 
College, were given in San Gabriel Mission, built in 1771. That made the venue 
four centuries younger than the most recent music heard on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Sequentia's co-founder Benjamin Bagby, the seven singers comprising the 
Sons of Thunder vocal ensemble projected a collective sound that was neatly 
articulated and hauntingly sonorous. The ensemble alone is reward enough to 
hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, however, the singers balanced an enchanting musicality with a 
cohesive thematic thread. Under the heading "Bible Voices," the program 
consisted of various Bible stories, i.e. Noah and the Ark and Samson and 
Delilah, relayed in Medieval songs spanning several centuries. A recording for 
Harmonia Mundi is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Dolorum solatium," Bagby accompanied on Medieval harp. Baritone Sanford 
Sylvan achieved a rare moment of individual glory with his compelling solo on 
"Stirps Jesse florigeram." Blurring the line between secular and sacred, the 
fascinating program closed on a relatively lusty, even humorous, note with 
"Syon egredere nunc de cubilibus." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliche though it might seem, this music -- when performed this correctly and 
under such pristine circumstances -- has a luster that is both timeless and 
timely. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; BRITTEN QUARTET POLISHED AND POLITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some performers see a piece of music as a responsibility; others, as an 
opportunity. Listeners admire the former type while (secretly, perhaps) 
preferring the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Britten Quartet, appearing Sunday in Beckman Auditorium at Caltech in a 
Coleman Chamber Concert, is a distinctly admirable ensemble. Conscientious and 
polished musicians -- violinists Peter Manning and Keith Pascoe,, violist Peter 
Lale and cellist Andrew Shulman -- they performed their program as if they had 
done so thousands of times. Maybe they had. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of hard-won poise doesn't work well in all music, however. Here, it 
worked best in Ravel's String Quartet, where instead of the often-encountered 
precious perfumes, coloristic niceties and fervent emotions, we heard warm 
lyricism, rhythmic and textural clarity and calm fluidity. A successful take on 
the piece. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Schubert's ubiquitous "Death and the Maiden" Quartet, the English 
musicians, on their first U.S. tour, missed their chances. It sounded as if 
precise ensemble and beautiful solo playing mattered more than the music 
itself. The intensity of this work, its underlying drama, poetry and 
relentlessness were lost in the effortlessness of the playing. It seemed like a 
breeze when it should have been a gale. 
</P>
<P>
 In the less-familiar challenge of Benjamin Britten's String Quartet No. 2, one 
was thankful for the lucidity of the performance while not feeling entirely 
convinced. Behind this composer's formal clarity is wonder and ferocity, here 
not delivered. Perhaps Lale's bow clattering to the floor with the last chord 
of the piece summed up the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In encore the quartet offered the little Polka by Glazunov, Liadov and Sokolov 
from the multi-composer, multi-movement "Les Vendredis." Cute. TIMOTHY MANGAN

TV REVIEW; 'SLOP': RACIAL PARABLES WITH NO PAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Submitted for your approval: People of color in search of an exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are standing on the verge of gettin' it on ," intones funk-meister George 
Clinton -- the Crib-Keeper, or Alfred Hiphop, if you will, of the HBO fantasy 
anthology "Cosmic Slop" -- welcoming us to "the black hole." 
</P>
<P>
 It's Clinton's disembodied mug, floating through the ether with a third eye 
and an adjustable hairdo, doing the hosting duties on this three-parter 
described by its creators as "a multicultural 'Twilight Zone.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said creators are the Hudlin brothers, of "House Party" and "Boomerang" fame, 
so interest automatically rises even among the funk-impaired. And in a way, the 
gambit of doing moral fantasy parables with ethnic or minority themes is a 
natural, as these three episodes update the socially conscious ethos of Rod 
Serling's 1959-65 series much more provocatively than subsequent mainstream 
attempts at re-creating the name or magic have. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, though, none of these half-hours quite pay off the way they should, 
and "Twilight Zones" were famous for nothing if not great payoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 First up, and liveliest, is "Space Traders," directed by Reginald Hudlin from 
a script by black novelist Trey Ellis (finally getting a screen credit after 
having his name removed from the "Inkwell" debacle). A few years distant, 
planetary visitors offer to solve all of America's pressing problems, with one 
caveat: All the nation's blacks must be delivered en masse to be taken away in 
spacecraft, for reasons unspecified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The premise is silly even by paranoid/PC standards, but this none-too-subtle 
setup is pretext for some surprisingly sharp and amusing satire: Many white 
CEOs have their own statistical reasons for wanting to thwart the forced 
African American exodus, while black leader Robert Guillaume is convinced that 
the only way to turn white America against the plan is to convince the country 
that blacks want to go to this other planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the throwaway gags help take off the bitter edge -- like the reported 
aside that melanin-heavy George Hamilton has agreed to go aboard, too, if 
called. Now if only the episode had any kind of ending, twist or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle segment, "The First Commandment," directed by Warrington Hudlin, is 
the most cosmically sloppy of the three. Nicholas Turturro stars as a Catholic 
priest whose parish liberally mixes Christianity and Santeria, despite the 
church's call to exclusivity; a spooky "saint" comes to life and sets everyone 
straight. The message seems to be that these disparate religions are strands of 
one true faith, a notion destined to offend much of the viewing audience.

 The conclusion, "Tang" (directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan), takes the biggest 
chances: It's a grungy two-character drama, about a shiftless husband and 
abused wife whose fates turn nastier when a mysterious gun is delivered to 
their apartment door. Chi McBride and especially Paula Jai Parker do a riveting 
job of finding social realism as well as genocidal metaphor in this 
self-destructive duet. 
</P>
<P>
 Like David Lynch's "Hotel Room," this looks to have been the pilot for an HBO 
anthology series that won't make it past the initial trilogy. But -- its 
anticlimaxes aside -- the Hudlins' "black hole" seems too promising a series 
concept not to regret its getting lost in a black hole.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; SAN DIEGO COUNTY D.A.; 2 REPUBLICANS SLUG IT OUT IN 
WIDE-OPEN RACE; EX-PROSECUTOR PAUL PFINGST AND JUDGE LARRY STIRLING MAY BE IN 
THE SAME PARTY, BUT THEY DISAGREE ON A RAFT OF ISSUES, FROM "THREE STRIKES" TO 
HOW TO COLLECT CHILD SUPPORT FROM DEADBEAT DADS.

 Here is a full list of the things that Paul Pfingst and Larry Stirling, 
candidates for district attorney of San Diego County, agree on: Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are against it, although for different reasons. Pfingst, 43, a former 
prosecutor, says it is unconstitutional; Stirling, 52, a municipal judge, says 
it is too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a partial list of the things Pfingst and Stirling disagree on: 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 184, the "three strikes and you're out" measure. 
</P>
<P>
 * What to do about teen-agers with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 * How best to collect child support from deadbeat dads. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether the county needs a 24-hour court for abusive spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether endorsements from law enforcement groups mean anything. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether the district attorney should be a prosecutor or a systems manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who should investigate shootings involving police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether Pfingst is fudging on his resume by saying he supervised the biggest 
homicide team around. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether Stirling was an ace crime fighter or a lackey of the National Rifle 
Assn. when he served in the Assembly and state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 From this collision of ideas and passions, San Diego County voters must do 
something they have done only twice in the last half-century: select a new 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving 24 years, Dist. Atty. Edwin L. Miller Jr. was crushed in the 
June primary in the wake of a failed prosecution in a high-profile case that 
the county grand jury said smacked of a witch hunt. Before Miller, the job was 
held by James Don Keller, who served 24 years before retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice between Pfingst and Stirling, or maybe the whole notion of picking 
a new district attorney, appears to have flummoxed voters. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll released Wednesday by the San Diego Union-Tribune and KNSD-TV showed 
22% of voters for Stirling, 21% for Pfingst and 55% undecided. (In the primary, 
Pfingst got 31% and Stirling 23%.) 
</P>
<P>
 The poll energized the combatants, both Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stirling campaign began furiously leaking documents, trying to pick away 
at Pfingst's reputation as a tough but principled prosecutor, a reputation made 
largely on his successful prosecution of California Highway Patrol Officer 
Craig Peyer for the murder of a female college student during a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfingst went on the attack during a debate on KFMB-TV, attempting to hold 
Stirling responsible for the Legislature's failure to pass anti-crime 
legislation during his nine years in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins, something is coming to law enforcement that voters in the past 
have shown little appetite for: change. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in 25 years we're going to be able to overhaul the 
criminal justice system," Stirling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfingst had been considered the clear front-runner because of his strong 
showing in the primary, his endorsements from the Union-Tribune, KNSD and law 
enforcement groups, and his celebrity from the Peyer case and a short stint as 
a legal commentator on television. 
</P>
<P>
 He has hammered at the theme that the district attorney should be a prosecutor 
(Stirling has never been a prosecutor), that the county should step up 
collection from deadbeat dads rather than hire a private agency (as Stirling 
suggests) to enforce court-ordered child support, and that the district 
attorney, not city councils, should investigate officer-involved shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 He has criticized Stirling for his refusal to "stand up to the NRA."

<P>
 A raging cyclone that lashed two south Indian states has killed at least 192 
people over the past week, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 54 people were killed by the cyclone and heavy rains in Tamil Nadu 
state, minister S.D. Somasundaram told lawmakers in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Andhra Pradesh, which shares the Bay of Bengal coastline, 138 
people died in collapsing buildings and flash floods that cut off roads and 
damaged irrigation channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 33,000 huts, 10 buildings and 12 bridges in Tamil Nadu were destroyed, 
Somasundaram said, adding that the state government provided makeshift shelters 
for about 4,000 people made homeless by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 40,000 were reported homeless in Andhra Pradesh.

GROUNDING OF ATR PLANE IN ICING CONDITIONS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON PHILLIPS, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board issued an emergency recommendation 
Monday night that the type of plane that crashed in northern Indiana last week, 
killing all 68 on board, be grounded whenever there are icing conditions, 
pending a special government review. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board, although not prejudging the cause of the crash of American 
Eagle Flight 4184, said there is enough concern about the plane's 
characteristics when operating in icing conditions that immediate action is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, a twin-turbo prop ATR72-210, flew for about 35 minutes in icing 
conditions while holding for a landing slot at O'Hare International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane experienced a sudden deflection of the ailerons -- flat pieces of 
wing that control turns -- turned on its back and plunged into a soybean field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration has already issued new flight standards 
for the ATR series of airplanes, made by a French-Italian consortium, most of 
which fly in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Those standards recommend against use of the autopilot in icing conditions and 
strict adherence to other anti-icing procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board, an independent agency that investigates major airline 
crashes and makes recommendations, said it agreed with the FAA action but added 
that the recommendation does not go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board said in a letter to the FAA that the onset of the icing problem may 
be rapid and it is "not certain the pilot would be able to recover" after the 
process starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The board said that the FAA should initiate a special review of the ATR's 
certificate to operate in this country, with detailed tests of the effects of 
wing ice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the plane should be prohibited from flying whenever there are 
icing conditions or icing conditions are even predicted, the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots should also be given special instructions on what to do if they 
inadvertently enter icing conditions, the board added.

SHUTTLE CONFIRMS LOW OZONE LEVEL OVER ANTARCTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atlantis and its crew soared over the edge of the Antarctic ozone hole Monday 
as shuttle instruments surveyed the gases swirling in the atmosphere below. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gunson, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Calif., said his ozone monitor aboard Atlantis confirms the findings of 
instruments on permanently orbiting satellites -- that there is very little 
ozone inside the Antarctic ozone hole at nearly all altitudes of the 
stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozone protects humans, animals and plants from ultraviolet rays and is being 
eaten away largely by man-made chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the space shuttle flew through the southern lights, the colorful 
atmospheric streaks caused by the interaction of atoms and charged particles 
from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlantis also experienced more communication trouble. A radio channel linking 
the shuttle and Mission Control was unusable. Another radio system provided 
adequate contact until engineers restored full communications.

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; SAVINIO THE STAR ON CLOSING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savinio is more relaxed these days and his connections are enjoying it more. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased by owner Gary Biszantz for about $100,000 in 1992, the 4-year-old 
gelded son of The Minstrel is starting to get his act together and he came up 
with the best performance of his career Monday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 second choice in Oak Tree's closing-day feature, the $163,200 Carleton 
F. Burke Handicap, Savinio had a dream trip behind the pacesetters Square Cut 
and Newton's Law, then had the right response when called on by Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start at 1 1/4 miles, Savinio rolled home by 4 1/2 lengths in 
2:02 3/5. Square Cut, a 21-1 shot, saved second by a neck over 5-2 favorite Sir 
Mark Sykes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been training great and the big thing is he's starting to relax now," 
trainer Walter Greenman said of Savinio. "That makes a big difference. This is 
a beautiful, well bred horse that is an absolute pleasure to train. It really 
makes me feel good to see him put it all together and run like he did today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no idea what his next race will be. I suppose we'll just see 
how he comes out of this one and take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Savinio hadn't won either of his two previous starts, he had run 
well. He was second, a length behind Earl Of Barking at Del Mar, then chased 
Romarin, one of two Brazilian monsters in trainer Richard Mandella's barn -- 
along with Sandpit -- in an allowance race on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day, I got overly aggressive with him in the first part of the race 
and I strangled him," said McCarron after his second stakes win of the 27-day 
meeting. "He's a horse that pulls hard and I wanted to get the jump on him. . . 
. not let him pull me out of the saddle like he had done with Eddie 
(Delahoussaye) a few times. I got him too far back and I forced him to make up 
too much ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I found a compromise . . . a happy medium with him. I let him break a 
little bit, then I took a hold of him. He rated well. He gave me a nice easy 
ride. I didn't have to let him run until the three-sixteenths pole." 
</P>
<P>
 Square Cut, who began with two victories in five starts on the Santa Anita 
turf course, put away Newton's Law, who wound up last, after some fast 
fractions, and had enough left to hold off Sir Mark Sykes. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third straight race Sir Mark Sykes was beaten as the favorite and 
he had no real excuse.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a little flat in his finish," jockey Corey Black said. "I had a 
good trip following Savinio and I thought I was going to be no worse than 
second at the quarter pole. I couldn't believe I couldn't get by Square Cut, 
the way he went early. But my horse just went even down the lane." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Following up his title at Del Mar, Corey Nakatani led the Oak Tree jockey 
standings, finishing with 30 victories, three more than Alex Solis. Eddie 
Delahoussaye was third with 25 and Kent Desormeaux with 22, and Laffit Pincay 
with 20 completed the top five. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Jones finished on top with 10 victories in the trainer standings, two 
more than Craig Lewis. Sandy Shulman, Mel Stute, Charlie Whittingham, Mike 
Mitchell and Dave Hofmans each had seven. 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the fifth for Jones in the Oak Tree meeting, putting him one 
behind all-time leader Bobby Frankel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The year after hosting the Breeders' Cup, the Oak Tree meeting's daily 
averages were down both from last year and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding Breeders' Cup Day both in 1993 and 1994, the track was down 8% in 
daily average on track attendance and 5.2% in total attendance. Daily average 
handle on track declined 6.6%, but total handle was up 17.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Total daily average attendance declined 7.4% this year compared to 1992 and 
daily average attendance on track was down 11.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will open its 34-day meeting Wednesday with first post time at 
12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening-day feature is the $50,000 Jim Hill Stakes at one mile on the 
turf. Six 2-year-old fillies were entered, topped by Royal Vale, the 117-pound 
high weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Artica and Wilga both are fresh from maiden victories and are bred to move up 
on the grass. Favored One is a Yakima import who was a distant second to Cat's 
Cradle in her California debut, Regal Ruthie comes off a troubled trip in the 
Cal Cup Juvenile Fillies and Angelwith approval is a maiden. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Win The Case, at 10-1, didn't leave with his field in the day's second race, 
but he wasn't declared a non-starter by the stewards. They ruled that the 
gelding's gate opened simultaneously with the rest of the field. . . . Tricky 
Code won the $60,800 Bara Lass after 34-1 shot Velvet Tulip was disqualified 
for interference approaching the wire. Ridden by Corey Nakatani and trained by 
Gary Jones, Tricky Code paid $7.40 as the 5-2 second choice. Favored Desert 
Stormer was third.

IBM, APPLE AND MOTOROLA UNVEIL STANDARD FOR PCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM and Apple, with an assist from Motorola, set aside their legendary 
differences long enough Monday to formally unveil a new common personal 
computer standard for the PowerPC micro processor they began developing three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But machines based on the joint specifications and designed to run a variety 
of operating systems won't appear until 1996. In the meantime, computer 
industry watchers say, the IBM-Apple alliance could stumble over technical and 
political hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wonder whether the machines will come to market soon enough to make more 
than a dent in the awesome power of industry giants Intel and Microsoft, whose 
chips and operating systems, respectively, appear in 85% of the world's PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another step along the road (IBM and Apple) have been traveling for 
three years," said Richard Shaffer, a principal in the New York consulting firm 
Technologic Partners. Of the prospects for success, he said, "there's still 
considerable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, some prominent companies, including Toshiba and Canon, have 
lined up to make the new PC. Canon, for example, funded FirePower Systems, 
based in Menlo Park, Calif., strictly to make PowerPC systems. Software giant 
Novell, the leader in PC networking software, said it will prepare its products 
for the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, developing a compatible design that will allow an array of software 
programs to run seamlessly could prove technically tricky. Moreover, the former 
archrivals can't seem to come to terms on a plan for IBM to license Apple's 
user-friendly operating system, Mac OS, for use on its machines. Analysts view 
such a licensing agreement as pivotal to enlisting software developers to write 
programs for the system. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensing pact, analysts said, would have added heft to the notion of a 
common hardware platform. But at a briefing in New York, executives of IBM, 
Apple and Motorola declined to discuss licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobuo Mii, president of IBM's Power Personal Systems division, inadvertently 
shed some light on the issue, saying IBM would ship a machine with the Mac OS 
in 1996. That would imply that some sort of pact is imminent, but, according to 
industry scuttlebutt, the two companies are quibbling, as usual, over details. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, noted that 
there is undoubtedly a camp inside IBM that despairs of forcing OS/2, an IBM 
operating system that has proved a costly failure, to take a back seat to Mac 
OS. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, IBM is sending confusing messages by throwing in its lot with 
Apple in an effort to develop a new industry standard while emphasizing that it

 "The strategy is schizophrenic," Lupatkin said.

 If they can pull off their merged technology, however, the companies could

 "To the degree these companies can indeed deliver one box capable of running 
several operating systems -- the Holy Grail of corporate computer buyers -- 
they'll pick up oodles of market share," Lupatkin said.

 Much as they like the idea, though, corporate buyers seem content to wait and

FINANCIAL MARKETS; MARKETS TAKE A BREATHER ON ELECTION EVE

<P>
 The nation's financial markets held steady Monday as investors marked time on 
the eve of the general elections and an interest rate hike widely expected next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed mixed, breaking last week's losing streak, when the Dow Jones 
industrial average tumbled more than 123 points, or 3%. On Monday, the Dow rose 
1.35 points to 3,808.87. But declining issues still outnumbered advances by 
about 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. Big Board volume was a light 256.2 
million shares, down from 282.7 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields rose for a sixth consecutive session, with the benchmark 
30-year bond closing at 8.16%, up from Friday's 8.15%. Its price, which moves 
lower when yields rise, slipped 3/32 point, or 94 cents per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 In the currency markets, worries about further dollar-buying action by the 
Federal Reserve System in the wake of last week's two-day intervention helped 
deter speculative attacks on the U.S. currency, market participants said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 97.33 Japanese yen, down from 97.50 on 
Friday. The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 1.5163 German marks, 
up from 1.5156. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little news to influence trading in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 With the recent run-up in bond rates, strategists were nervous about the 
market's ability to digest the Treasury's sale of $17 billion in three-year 
notes today and $12 billion in 10-year notes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight political races and the strong possibility of rising interest rates 
sapped enthusiasm on Election Day eve, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elections are causing a little bit of caution on Wall Street," said 
Walter Revis, market analyst at Principal Financial Securities. "The market 
hates uncertainty, and the polls are still going back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 But politics were not the only thing on investors' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer price index for October, set for release Thursday, and a meeting 
next Tuesday of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will weigh the central 
bank's monetary policy against recent data on inflation, added tension, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is widespread speculation that the Fed will raise interest rates for a 
sixth time this year. Most analysts expect the Fed to opt for an increase of 
0.5% in short-term interest rates, but some say the central bank could be more 
aggressive in its fight against inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are a little skittish for a number of reasons, and they want to see 
the whites of their eyes before they decide to commit again," said James Volk, 
director of equity trading at Jensen Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the recent batch of strong third-quarter earnings, the market has been 
unable to gather any upside momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly to blame is concern that rising interest rates will cool the economy 
and lead analysts to lower their earnings forecasts for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is going on very well, but there's some thinking that we may be 
peaking here soon," said John Church, chief investment officer at Glenmede 
Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks fell abroad. Sporadic corporate selling and arbitrage-linked sales sent 
Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average down 192.34 points to 19,619.22. Frankfurt's 
30-share DAX average closed off 24.04 points at 2,043.52, while London's 
Financial Times 100-share average ended down 31.8 points at 3,065.8. In Mexico 
City, the Bolsa index drifted 6.71 points higher to 2.588.35. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM, Apple Computer and Motorola said they agreed on a new hardware platform 
design for computers based on the PowerPC chip. IBM ended up 3/4 to 71 7/8, and 
Apple added 3/8 to 40 3/4, but Motorola lost 2 to 56 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler fell 7/8 to 46 1/2. There was market speculation that investor Kirk 
Kerkorian will begin selling his 9.2% stake in the No. 3 auto maker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Snapple Beverage fell 3/16 to 13 5/8. Quaker Oats last week made a 
$1.7-billion bid for the maker of fruit drinks and iced teas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike rose 1 7/8 to 61 1/2. Goldman Sachs added the stock to the firm's 
"recommended" list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dell Computer introduced its first multiprocessor network servers, and its 
shares rose 2 1/8 to 43 7/8.

 Sunny Hills struggled in the early part of the season, losing six of seven 
nonleague matches. Sunny Hills even lost to Sonora in the first round of league 
play, a shocking first for such four-year varsity players as Rudolph.But the 
Lancers turned it around last Tuesday, winning a share of the league title by 
beating Sonora, 10-8. Rudolph led the way, 6-0, 6-1, 6-0, and improved to 30-0 
in league play. She has lost six games in league. Rudolph, who hopes to attend 
Harvard, also won her second consecutive league title, beating teammate Barbie 
Bayless, 6-0, 6-4. She also beat Bayless in the final last year.

 Secoda is much more than just Valencia's quarterback -- he kicks, he punts, he 
calls defensive signals from his position in the secondary. "He does just about 
everything for us," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said.That was clear Friday in a 
24-7 victory over Western that kept the Tigers in the running for the Orange 
League title. Secoda scored on a three-yard run, threw an eight-yard scoring 
pass, kicked a 34-yard field goal and three extra points. He also intercepted 
two passes -- and almost picked off a third -- giving him a county-leading nine 
this season.

 TIMELY HELP: Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's disclosure, to increase awareness, is 
already having a dramatic effect here. Monday morning, says Linda Scheck, 
director of the Alzheimer's Assn. of Orange County, "Our phones were going 
crazy." . . . The group's annual conference is Friday at the Pan Pacific Hotel 
in Anaheim, and the announcement has greatly increased interest in attendance. 
Adds Scheck: "It's kind of like a coming out, and we thank him for that."

 NIXON & MAHONEY: Richard Nixon gets his name on a plaque at the new La Habra 
community center, at La Habra Boulevard and Euclid Street, where his old law 
office used to be. But some visitors at the dedication Monday (B2) wondered why 
the tiny patch of green at the corner is named Mahoney Park. . . . . Says City 
Manager Lee Risner: "It started as a joke and developed into a serious 
thought." Councilman William D. Mahoney had complained the corner was ugly, and 
needed grass and pretty flowers. Now it has.

 TOUGH LOVE: With a book like "Sweet Revenge (How To Get Back at Men Who Have 
Wronged You)," readers may wonder if the authors, Devra Rossi of Newport Beach, 
right, and Elizabeth Wright of Fountain Valley, have ever been burned by the 
men in their lives. Answers Wright: "What woman hasn't?" . . . . The two 
discuss their book Wednesday on the Sally Jessie Raphael talk show (Channel 4, 
3 p.m.) One tip from the book: Get a picture of him naked and fax it to his 
office.

 ADD LOVE: A different view on love comes late-night on Anaheim's KDOC-TV's, 
Channel 56, "The Love Channel," which features longtime radio personality Jim 
(the Poorman) Trenton of Newport Beach. The show includes medical experts and 
some celebrities, dispensing advice on romance, sex and health to young 
callers. . . . This month, the show went national: It's been picked up by 
Network One, a 24-hour cable satellite network.

 CAMPAIGN COSTS: Four years ago, Vicky Howard and Bill Davis, colleagues on the 
Simi Valley City Council, spent $200,000 battling to be county supervisor. 
There were high personal costs as well. . . . "Let's put it this way," Davis 
said. "We still serve on (city-county) committees together, and we're very 
cordial. But did we patch it up and become close friends again? No." . . . Now, 
when Davis sees Supervisor Howard over their common back fence, "I say, 'Hi, 
how are you?' That's it."

 CIVICS LESSON: Besides deciding the guilt of Mark Scott Thornton, the 
20-year-old's high-profile murder trial has become a compelling civics lesson 
(B1). Students have sat through testimony three times during the first week of 
trial. . . . At break, one Newbury Park high-schooler told Judge Charles 
McGrath that Thornton's alleged crime made no sense. "I have yet to see a 
murder that has made any sense," the jurist replied. "And this one surely 
doesn't either."

 COOL PORT: Tiny Port of Hueneme has captured a piece of international trade by 
building the West Coast's most modern refrigerated warehouse (Valley Business, 
Page 10). . . . With that fine fridge, Hueneme finally lured a shipping firm 
that hauls Sunkist Growers' fruit overseas. . . . Port executives "continually 
came after me," said Gerry Fountain, president of Cool Carriers USA. That 
persistence paid off with a 26% jump in port tonnage in the last fiscal year.

 COURT CHALLENGE: County officials have decided to adopt a wait-and-see 
strategy if Prop. 187 passes today. . . . "We don't do anything on the 9th of 
November," said county Supt. of Schools Charles Weis. "We will wait until it's 
been tested out a little bit." Richard Wittenberg, county chief administrator, 
said county health officials fear a spread of disease if health care is denied 
illegal immigrants, but would abide by the new law. "I think that it will be 
challenged . . . and (delayed) in the courts for some time," he said.

 Bill Hughes of Newhall writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you! Have you forgotten that the mayor has the right to a secret 
ballot just as you and I have? He is free to share how he is going to vote or 
not share how he is going to vote. And when you resort to calling him "chicken" 
you remind me of a little kid who hasn't gotten his way. . . .  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Here it is Election Day, and I still haven't gotten my way. Or at least I 
don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 By my deadline Monday, Mayor Richard Riordan, to my sincere chagrin, still 
hadn't announced a position on Proposition 187, the most important and volatile 
issue on today's ballot. Not a peep since my column last week urging him to 
take a stand. Maybe I should have held my breath until I turned blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Hughes apparently doesn't think so. He says that it was childish of me to 
suggest that Hizzoner, by dodging 187, is exhibiting all the moral courage of a 
candidate from Zacky Farms. Well, I can live with that. He's chicken and I'm 
childish. 
</P>
<P>
 But actually, many people seem to share my dismay, if not my disgust. As I 
mentioned Sunday, the Riordan column has generated plenty of reaction. Mr. 
Hughes, in fact, was the first person to defend the mayor's silence on 187. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Mr. Hughes, I haven't forgotten that Mayor Riordan has the right to remain 
silent, but it seems to me that Mayor Riordan has forgotten his responsibility 
to lead. The mayor is acting like a criminal suspect exercising his Miranda 
rights, knowing that anything he might say can and will be used against him in 
the court of public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 All I'm saying, as emphatically as I can, is that the mayor is wrong to 
exercise that right -- that he has a duty to speak out on the important matters 
of the day. He is wrong because we didn't elect him to sit on the sidelines 
when confronted with an issue that has sowed such anger and suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 He is wrong because many people -- especially those still wrestling with how 
they'll cast their ballots today -- were hoping to find something helpful in 
the opinion of the mayor of America's No. 1 destination for immigrants. They 
agree that it's odd that Mayor Riordan would endorse Wilson for governor, 
Feinstein for senator and None-of-Your-Business on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps I should check the wires. Perhaps, as I type these words, the mayor is 
faxing a press release, unequivocally endorsing Proposition 187 -- or 
denouncing it. Please hold on -- it will just take a second. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nope. All I found on the city wire at 5:41 p.m. Monday was some stories marked 
Simpson, Fleiss, Reagan, box office, honeymoon murder and satanic abuse. 
Nothing on Riordan or Proposition 187. The state wire is similar but also has 
something about an I. Magnin lawsuit, a tribal riot and a Navy sex 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't you rather read a story about Mayor Riordan's bold last-minute 
declaration on 187? 
</P>
<P>
 Some people, like Mr. Hughes, may think I'm making too much of Riordan's 
silence, but I voted for the man, figuring he was the best candidate to heal 
our riot-torn city. I was part of that small percentage of voters who opted for 
Mike Woo in the general election and switched to Riordan in the runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember my reasoning well. The thought of a non-traditional politician 
appealed to me, as did the thought of a hardheaded businessman. But I also grew 
increasingly offended by the message from the Woo camp that a city as diverse 
as Los Angeles should be led by a member of a minority group. The implicit 
suggestion that a white guy -- that is, my kind -- simply wouldn't do, annoyed 
me. Such racial rhetoric can widen the divides in our city; Riordan was 
reaching out to broaden his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Proposition 187 comes along and Riordan says nothing. When I punched 
the spot next to his name, I expected better. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Proposition 187 came up, I expected him to do as Sheriff Sherman 
Block, LAPD Chief Willie Williams, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and City Atty. 
James Hahn have done. They say Proposition 187 would do far more harm than 
good. Riordan could have followed the lead of other Republicans of national 
standing, such as former Education Secretary William Bennett and former HUD 
Secretary Jack Kemp, who summoned the courage to just say no. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, I expect the vote tallies to show that Proposition 187 will win, but 
I don't expect Los Angeles to erupt in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 But if there's trouble, I do hope the mayor loses plenty of sleep.

CAL LUTHERAN TEACHER SURPRISED TO BECOME NEW BISHOP; RELIGION: PROFESSOR, A 
PROPONENT OF COMPLETE PARTICIPATION BY GAYS AND LESBIANS IN THE CHURCH, WILL 
OVERSEE 152 CONGREGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mostly, he was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Paul Egertson did not think it likely that he would ever be elected 
bishop of the Lutheran church's 152 congregations in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But last weekend, before an assembly of 440 pastors and congregation members, 
the 59-year-old religion professor at Cal Lutheran University was elected to 
one of the church's most powerful positions. As bishop, he will oversee 
Evangelical Lutheran Church parishes throughout Ventura, Kern, Los Angeles, 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the surprise comes from the fact that being bishop was never a burning 
ambition for Egertson; as a rule he prefers to follow divine direction wherever 
it takes him. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, Egertson said he was surprised that he -- a proponent of 
complete participation by homosexuals within the Lutheran faith -- could be 
elected by a group that for the most part strongly opposes his viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexuality is considered a sin by the Lutheran church. Gays and lesbians 
can become pastors in the church, but only if they vow to be celibate, Egertson 
said. But he believes the church needs to reconsider its stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a popular position," Egertson acknowledged. "It was one of the 
reasons I thought I would not be electable. It scares so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his feelings are no secret to church members. At last year's assembly, 
or synod, he lead a workshop on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lutheran church is in the midst of an in-depth study on sexuality that 
examines the issue of homosexuality. A first draft released last year offered 
the first break with tradition, proposing that the church might need to rethink 
its policy on gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 But most church members responded negatively to that draft, Egertson said, 
leading him to believe that the church was not yet ready for such radical 
change. For that reason, he said, he hopes his stance on homosexuality will not 
be misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not support a gay agenda," Egertson said. "I am not pro-gay. I support 
the position of a minority of people in the church who pray and work for the 
full acceptance of gay and lesbian people in the life and ministry of the 
church." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of his six children is gay, he said, and that fact has shaped his 
viewpoint to a great extent. His gay son went through four years of seminary 
training, but could not be ordained because he refused to take the vow of 
celibacy. His son has given up hope of ever becoming a pastor in the Lutheran 
church, Egertson said, and is now an assistant dean at Golden Gate University's 
law school in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson said he is now trying to alleviate any fears in the congregation that 
he will spend all his time pushing for a change in church policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We operate democratically," he said. "I'll have the power to influence, but I 
don't have the power to impose my viewpoint. I'll certainly contribute my 
rationale, but I want to assure people I believe in a lot of things besides 
that. We share most things in common." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Larry Wagner, pastor of Ascension Evangelical Lutheran Church in 
Thousand Oaks, said Egertson is better known for his teachings than for his 
stance on homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul's primary reputation has been as an excellent theologian and a great 
teacher in the church," Wagner said. "Paul has a rich history in the church. 
You'd have to be living in a cave if you were in the Lutheran church and you 
did not know who Paul Egertson was." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining acceptance, despite his non-traditional views, should not be a problem 
for Egertson, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once an election is completed all of us are called on to support and work 
with the voice of the majority," Wagner said. "Whether or not I agree with 
everything he feels theologically doesn't detract from the fact that I respect 
him very much as a pastor and a friend, and I intend to embrace him as bishop." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson began teaching at Cal Lutheran in 1984. He was director of the Center 
for Theological Study from 1979 to 1992. He holds degrees from Pepperdine 
University, Luther Northwestern Seminary and the School of Theology at 
Claremont College. 
</P>
<P>
 Egertson will officially become one of 55 Lutheran bishops who lead the 
5-million-member church in early 1995, and will serve a six-year term. He said 
he will have to give up teaching because his new job will keep him too busy. 
But he said he will only serve one term. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I would very much like to go back to teaching," he said.

GIRL TELLS THORNTON JURY OF HER KIDNAPING; CRIME: AT MURDER TRIAL, WITNESS 
STEPHANIE CAMPBELL TESTIFIES THAT SHE FEARED FOR HER LIFE THROUGHOUT THE FIVE 
DAYS OF HER ABDUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She did not know if she would live or die after being kidnaped last year by 
accused Thousand Oaks murderer Mark Scott Thornton, Stephanie Campbell told a 
Ventura County jury Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the five days of her abduction she pretended to be happy and hoped for 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he might hurt me or either kill me," Campbell said softly, speaking 
of the young man who had taken her to the movies and the mall just weeks before 
the kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first face-to-face encounter since Campbell slipped away from 
Thornton in a Reno casino last September and notified authorities that she was 
a kidnap victim, the 17-year-old witness said she had no inkling the defendant 
might have committed murder before kidnaping her. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said he showed a violent streak even while they were on the road to 
Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, Thornton fired a shot after a motorist cut him off on the 
highway, she testified. And when a police officer there stopped him for running 
a red light, she added, Thornton contemplated shooting the officer before 
driving off and escaping arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say that before he snatched Campbell from outside her house, 
shooting at the girl's mother in the process, Thornton had abducted and killed 
Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 He then stole the 33-year-old nurse's truck, which he used to abduct Campbell 
and go on a five-day trek to Northern California and Reno before being arrested 
at a casino there, they add. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to robbery and kidnaping, Thornton has been charged with murder 
and a special circumstance that could send him to the gas chamber if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilt phase of his trial, which began last week, is expected to last three 
to four more weeks. If he is found guilty of first-degree murder, then the jury 
would weigh a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was the first witness to take the stand Monday as the prosecution 
began presenting the second week of its case to the jury in front of Superior 
Court Judge Charles R. McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering questions from Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris with poise and 
composure, Campbell stayed calm even when the questions surrounded her apparent 
decision not to try to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have conceded that Thornton kidnaped Campbell. But they also 
said that she was free to go at any time during the five-day ordeal. 
Prosecutors disagree with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell testified that Thornton kidnaped her as soon as she arrived home from 
work around 11 a.m. on Sept. 4, 1993. As she approached the front door of her 
family's townhouse, the defendant appeared suddenly and grabbed her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Come with me. I have a gun,' " Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he pulled her away, Thornton shot at her mother, Linda Campbell, she said. 
He then forced Stephanie Campbell into O'Sullivan's truck -- banging her head 
against the top of the vehicle in the process -- and told her she would die if 
she tried to get away from him, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 That night, they stayed in a room at a Bakersfield Econo Lodge, she said. 
Thornton slept in the bed with his gun under his pillow and she slept on the 
floor. She thought about trying to get away, Campbell testified, but she was 
never sure her abductor was asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tossed and turned. I didn't think he was asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, around 11, they got back on the road. She said she asked him 
where he got the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that one of his friends had sold it to him," Campbell said. He 
told her that the truck belonged to his friend's mother, who was out of town, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 They made their way to San Francisco by their second night together, stopping 
along the way at some stores to buy clothing and a sleeping bag. Even though 
she was allowed to go in the dressing rooms at these places, such as K mart, 
she said Thornton always stood close by with his gun tucked in his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said she kept asking Thornton to allow her to phone her parents. He 
said he would, she said, but never kept his promise and seemed to grow angry at 
her requests. 
</P>
<P>
 He reiterated his order that she not try to escape and threatened to starve 
her, she said: "He told me he would tie me up and not feed me if I tried to 
escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next four days, Campbell said she just decided to cooperate, as the 
two of them slept in the back of O'Sullivan's truck at various campgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared," she said in response to one question from Kossoris on what was 
going through her mind. "But I was acting content, like everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said she believes that is how she was finally able to persuade 
Thornton to travel to Reno, and not Oregon, which is where he wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he had maps and she quickly focused on Circus Circus in Reno. "I told 
him that I would like to go there . . . because I knew there were a lot of 
people there and a lot of security in a casino." 
</P>
<P>
 She said they were at the casino for about an hour when, at midnight, she 
slipped away and told a security guard that she had been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started crying, and I told him I was from Los Angeles, and I had been 
kidnaped," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard "was in shock," she said. He took her to a security room, where she 
was allowed to call her mother. Thornton was arrested in the casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said her family moved to Thousand Oaks from Fresno in July, 1993, 
when her father, who is in the Army, received a transfer. Until their home was 
ready, the family -- which included Stephanie, her younger sister and parents 
-- stayed at the Econo Lodge motel in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness said she met Thornton at the motel pool and that they began 
dating. Her mother would drive the two of them to the movies, to the mall and 
to fast-food restaurants, she said. Things seemed to be going well and the 
defendant appeared at ease with her, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He told her that he was staying at the motel because he and his mother did not 
get along well, Campbell testified. Eventually, however, the Campbells moved 
into a home, and Stephanie said she got a job at a yogurt shop. 
</P>
<P>
 That is also when she broke off their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton continued trying to see her, she said, once grabbing her outside the 
yogurt shop. Campbell said she called the police, who already had a warrant for 
his arrest but had not been pursuing him. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new complaint, they started an active search. That prompted Thornton, 
prosecutors say, to begin his desperate plans for a getaway -- plans they say 
led him to steal Kellie O'Sullivan's truck, kill the Westlake nurse and kidnap 
Campbell.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS AIM TO HEAD OFF 
VIOLENCE; ELECTION: PATROLS WILL BE BEEFED UP TODAY AT SCHOOLS AND POLLING 
SITES. AUTHORITIES HOPE TO PREVENT SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

<P>
 Concerned about the potential for Election Day violence over Proposition 187, 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department is putting more deputies on the streets 
today and has ordered extra patrols of school campuses and polling stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from every law enforcement agency in the county met with top 
sheriff's officials Monday afternoon to coordinate response plans if there are 
widespread, chaotic demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter said he is not expecting any problems, but has ordered 
the additional patrols and other precautions because of the passions 
surrounding the controversial ballot measure, which would deny education and 
most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you have a large group of people intensely interested in an emotional 
issue like Proposition 187, the potential for that group of people to lose 
their leadership and become violent or aggressive is certainly there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, anti-187 protests continued Monday in Ventura and Oxnard, as Latino 
community leaders issued a plea for calm if the measure passes. A scattering of 
students waved signs and marched in Simi Valley and Moorpark. So far, all the 
protests in Ventura County have remained peaceful, except for a few incidents 
of fighting and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred to 150 students walked out of De Anza Middle School in Ventura on 
Monday afternoon, waving hand-painted placards and chanting "No on 187." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the students reached Main Street, the group had thinned to about 
50 protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just before they got to Ventura High School, an officer announced over a 
loudspeaker that they would be allowed to complete the demonstration inside the 
high school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, they continued their chants against the ballot measure and took turns 
voicing opposition to the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We organized this walkout because we all believe the same thing," said 
12-year-old Becky Ramirez, a seventh-grader at De Anza, "that we should all 
have the same rights to have the same education." 
</P>
<P>
 As the students in Ventura protested, 14 high school and college students on a 
hunger strike since Sunday in Oxnard's Plaza Park held an anti-187 rally that 
drew about 25 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the small showing at the rally, 19-year-old Adriana Jasso said the 
group, which includes a 9-year-old boy, is confident of the community's 
backing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand our community is out there supporting our protest," Jasso said. 
"We're raising the consciousness of our people." 
</P>
<P>
 El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a countywide Latino advocacy group, issued 
a public statement Monday in an effort to diffuse the potential for violence 
after today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are particularly urged not to walk out of school on the days 
immediately following the election," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Marcos Vargas, the Concilio's executive director: "Violence may be 
unavoidable in Los Angeles, but at least here locally community leaders and 
students can do everything they can to ensure there is no threat to public 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez also urged calm, saying people should realize that 
even if the measure passes it will face a legal challenge in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that if people understand that they would be calm about the 
situation," he said. "It's not over till it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in Ventura and Oxnard, where the largest student protests in 
the county have occurred, said they expect to hold classes on Wednesday 
regardless of whether Proposition 187 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Supt. Bill Studt said he does not expect any problems, but has asked 
all part-time campus supervisors to work an extra two hours Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our intent is to have school that day and get on with the educational 
program," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Ventura, high school and middle school principals will meet this 
morning with Ventura police officers to plan strategies for dealing with 
potential protests on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have any idea if there will be any kind of a backlash if it 
passes," said Supt. Joseph Spirito. "We just want to make sure we contain it 
and give the kids an opportunity to discuss (the issues involved with 
Proposition 187.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said they will take a similar approach in dealing 
with demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said deputies will intercede only to protect the First Amendment 
rights of protesters or the safety of other citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very much in the role of peacekeeper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to extra patrols, Carpenter said, deputies in the mounted patrol 
unit will be "immediately available," as will helicopters for aerial 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 Responses to any disturbances will be monitored from a command center in the 
basement of the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, police say they will follow the same contingency plan they have 
operated under for the past three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Chief Stan Myers said regular patrols will not be increased today, 
though extra officers will be called in as needed. One officer is already 
assigned to each high school campus as part of a school safety program, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Ventura, a handful of plainclothes detectives have been ordered to 
report for duty in their uniforms today. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just standing by in case we need them," said Lt. Pat Miller. 
</P>
<P>

OXNARD MAY ALTER GRAFFITI REMOVAL PLAN; BLIGHT: COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER SHIFTING 
MORE CLEANUP DUTIES TO A CONTRACTOR OR PRIVATIZING ALTOGETHER. SOME SAY CURRENT 
PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL AND DOESN'T NEED CHANGING. 
</P>

 Graffiti had reached such epidemic proportions in Oxnard by 1991 that almost 
every alley in the city was smeared with spray paint, according to a city 
report, and city leaders opted for a blitzkrieg plan to eradicate the unsightly 
etchings. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to be working: Graffiti has been on the decline in Oxnard for 18 
months, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Oxnard City Council today will consider two alternative 
plans to remove graffiti blight: shifting more of the city's responsibilities 
to a contractor, and privatizing altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The current programs involve Neighborhood Watch groups, police investigators 
and city workers and contractors who paint over the inscriptions almost as soon 
as they go up, said Manny Vega, who is in charge of Oxnard's anti-graffiti 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Removing the graffiti as soon as it is painted has really helped," Vega said. 
"That way, the tagger doesn't get a chance to brag about his pseudo artwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the city's program, including a hot line that residents can call to 
report graffiti, would remain, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Tom Holden said the city needs to determine if contracting for 
all services would be cheaper and more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about privatizing, it's about maximizing our dollars," Holden said. 
"The bottom line is important, but we have to continue fighting this, because 
we're making some headway." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the number of scribblings is going down dramatically, the fee paid to 
a contractor to paint them over is expected to decline by $86,000 this year to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, city officials expect to spend a total of $337,000 this budget 
year -- almost $100,000 less than last year's $436,000 -- fighting graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said he favors entertaining offers from contractors to determine if they 
could remove graffiti more cheaply and would encourage the City Council to hire 
the lowest bidders if they could do the job well.  
</P>
<P>
 But he warned that the city may lose something along with the savings it would 
gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we contract everything, we kind of lose control, which is something you 
don't want to do," Vega said. "Our objection to that is that in the past 18 
months we have made a lot of progress, and we would hate to lose ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Branthoover, chairwoman of Oxnard's Inter-Neighborhood Council 
Committee and a crusader against graffiti, said the city should leave the 
current program alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the city would want to change something that is doing so 
well," Branthoover said. "You've got volunteers out there who are diligently 
painting over graffiti because they think the city can't afford to do it, and I 
suspect that they would stop doing that if they knew some private firm could do 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said he has yet to make up his mind on what would be 
best for the city but that he is pleased with the current plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the magnitude of the problem we had, I think we have done well," 
Lopez said. "I don't know if the other alternatives will help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what option the City Council chooses, Vega said, Oxnard should 
update its graffiti removal contracts so the city is charged by the square foot 
instead of by the hour, and require companies to remove all etchings 
immediately. The city's current contractor, Shumate Sandblasting Co., is only 
required to remove racist or profane graffiti right away. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the city's efforts to quickly paint over tags, Vega attributes 
the drop in graffiti to the work of the neighborhood councils and tougher 
sentencing laws -- such as the one that recently put Oxnard's most notorious 
graffiti vandal behind bars for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said the 15-year-old tagger, who toyed with Neighborhood Watch leaders 
throughout Oxnard, was responsible for much of the graffiti in the city.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; CAMPAIGN SPENDING; VOTERS, BOARD CONFRONT KEY CHOICES TODAY 
</P>

<P>
 The four candidates competing for two open seats on the Board of Supervisors 
have spent more than $300,000 on their campaigns, but Ventura County election 
officials are predicting that despite such heavy spending, only about 59% of 
the county's 351,921 registered voters will cast ballots in today's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's ballot will include more than 100 elective offices, including 
positions on nine city councils, 17 school boards and 18 special district 
boards. In addition to the two supervisor races, voters will decide the race 
for county auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will pick three state legislators, a governor, two congressmen and a 
U.S. senator. Nine other statewide posts are also on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls open at 7 a.m. around the county and close at 8 p.m. The Election Day 
forecast calls for mostly sunny and clear skies, with afternoon temperatures 
ranging in the low to mid-60s. 
</P>
<P>
 As voters go to the polls today, the county Board of Supervisors will decide 
whether to revise the campaign finance rules that govern county races. 
</P>
<P>
 All four supervisorial candidates have complained that a 3-year-old ordinance 
has made it extremely difficult to raise money, especially in tough economic 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who wrote the 1991 campaign finance ordinance, 
has proposed changes she hopes will clear up some of the confusion about the 
law and more accurately reflect the spirit in which she wrote it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current ordinance, candidates can receive up to $750 from 
individuals and businesses in primary elections and no more than $250 in 
general elections. Candidates can accept as much as $1,800 from political 
action committees in the primary and $600 in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she was prompted to revise the ordinance after several 
candidates approached her about problems they had encountered with the 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her proposal, VanderKolk said, the amount of money candidates could 
receive during the election cycle would remain the same, but it could be split 
in any way between the primary and general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a candidate who receives a $100 contribution from an individual 
in the primary would be able to receive an additional $900 in the general 
election under VanderKolk's revised ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk said she believed the change would make it easier for candidates to 
raise money while keeping a lid on campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I continue to believe that it is very important to limit the amount of money 
raised for a campaign," she said. "I think contribution limits are very 
important to try to regain some public trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisorial candidate Judy Mikels, who is running against Scott Montgomery 
in a district that covers Simi Valley and Moorpark, said she welcomed the 
change. Under the current system, she said, it is difficult for those 
candidates who actually qualify for the runoff to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be much more clear, and it would accomplish the same thing," 
Mikels said of the proposed change in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mikels and Frank Schillo, a candidate in the supervisorial district 
covering most of the Conejo Valley and Port Hueneme, said they would prefer 
that there be no contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the current restrictions, Schillo said, he and opponent Trudi Loh 
ended up spending more than $100,000 each on their campaigns, making the race 
one of the most expensive in county history. Each candidate spent more than 
$30,000 of his or her own money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There shouldn't be any law at all," Schillo said. "It doesn't make it any 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, supporters of a proposed ballot initiative that would ensure that 
sales tax dollars from Proposition 172 are spent on public safety programs said 
they will not gather signatures today at polling stations around the county as 
initially planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Stoll, a member of a group called Citizens for a Safe Ventura County, 
said the organization believes the measure may no longer be necessary. He noted 
that Supervisor John K. Flynn and all four supervisorial candidates had already 
signed a petition in favor of the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of the today's supervisorial election, Stoll said, there 
will be three votes on the board to support allocating all Proposition 172 
funds to law enforcement and fire service programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's election will cost taxpayers about $880,000, or approximately $2.50 
per registered voter, said Richard Dean, county clerk and recorder. The state 
will reimburse the county for a small portion of the cost, he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; INTERNATIONAL ADOPTIONS WILL BE SEMINAR TOPIC 
</P>

 Adoptive mother Elyse Garrett vividly recalls her first glimpse of 8-month-old 
Nataly, who had been born prematurely, abandoned by her birth mother and sent 
to an orphanage in Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe it when I first saw her," the Santa Margarita 
resident said."She was so tiny and pale. Her little face was all swollen and 
puffy. But I knew she was mine." 
</P>
<P>
 That experience in 1992 prompted Garrett and another licensed social worker, 
Barbara Marshall, to found Star Coalition for Children, a nonprofit 
organization that facilitates international adoptions and humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
 They will discuss their organization and show a video about Garrett's trip to 
Belarus at a free seminar from 2 to 4 p.m. Sunday at Saddleback Memorial 
Medical Center in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett now has two adopted children from Eastern Europe. Her second daughter, 
Siena, was born the same day in the same hospital as Nataly. Because of red 
tape, Garrett had to go back eight months later for Siena, who was also 
abandoned.  
</P>
<P>
 The adoptions marked the end of a painful odyssey for Garrett, who is 43 and 
single. After being unable to arrange an adoption through the county, Garrett 
contacted a private agency in 1990. She was ready to take home twin girls, but 
four days after their birth, the biological mother decided to keep her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett turned to Eastern Europe after she heard she could adopt children from 
the former Soviet Union. 
</P>

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; BUFFET TO RAISE FUNDS TO SEND KIDS TO CAMP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pre-Thanksgiving Day family buffet will be held by the East Valley 
Coordinating Council to raise money to send needy youngsters to summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The buffet will be held at 11:30 a.m. Nov. 15 at the First United Methodist 
Church of North Hollywood, 4832 Tujunga Ave. The suggested donation is $5. 
Between 40 and 50 people can be accommodated at the buffet, which includes a 
turkey dinner with all the trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to raise as much money as possible," said Albert Sulprizio, vice 
president in charge of programs for the coordinating council. "All our money 
goes to help send kids to camp. We help anyone who is recommended to us, 
basically, kids who can benefit from it the most." The coordinating council has 
sent 40 to 50 kids to summer camp each year for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The featured speaker at the buffet will be Suzanne Johnson, project 
coordinator of the High School Magnet Program in Electronic Information. The 
magnet program is a partnership between the Los Angeles Public Library and the 
Los Angeles Unified School District, with participation of students, faculty 
and librarians from the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Judith Tetove, senior librarian at the Sun Valley Branch Library, 
will speak about the status of Internet access through library computers, and 
homework computer centers coming to branch libraries in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The homework computer centers are computers outfitted with word-processing 
software and educational computer games children can use. "Eventually, every 
branch library in the Valley will have four homework computer centers for 
public use," Tetove said.  
</P>
<P>
 The computers can be used between 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. by children only.  
</P>
<P>
 Tetove will also speak about the new computerized circulation/catalogue 
system, which will completely replace the old card catalogue library system. 
</P>
<P>
 For further information or to make a reservation for the buffet dinner, call 
Albert Sulprizio at (213) 656-0955. TIM MAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 18-YEAR-OLD TARGETED IN DRIVE-BY 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Someone in a passing car fired shots at an 18-year-old Thousand Oaks man as he 
stood with friends outside a house -- and missed, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 One bullet hit a parked car, but no one was injured in the Sunday night 
shooting, which police said may be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second drive-by shooting in a month for the city that claims the 
second-lowest crime rate in the United States, and it was the third time in a 
year someone had attacked Cary Laviada with a deadly weapon, police records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 A bullet grazed the teen-ager's head in April when a gunman in a car shot at 
the car Laviada was riding in. And several gang members attacked him in his 
girlfriend's parked convertible Sept. 29, stabbing him several times with 
broken bottles and a screwdriver. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not arrested anyone in the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Laviada could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His father said the youth left home in Thousand Oaks about six months ago 
because he did not want the attacks on him to jeopardize his younger siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody sure doesn't like that boy," said the man, who asked not to be 
identified by name. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the gang members who may have attacked his son, he said, "Me and my 
neighbors . . . we want them out of here. Not just arrested, not just whatever. 
I want them completely out of our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Laviada has been trying to find work and finish his general equivalency 
diploma, but has had trouble with Thousand Oaks gang members ever since he 
attended Conejo Valley Continuation School last year, his father said. MACK

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; GROUP HELPS THOSE 
STRIVING TO BE JUST FOLKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "folks" at Tierra del Sol, like Leandra Muntean, have been feeling pretty 
proud of themselves for the last year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the outdoors better. I like to rake," said Muntean. The woman, born 
with a mental impairment, has been one of the folks, a term used by the Tierra 
del Sol staff for their clients, for 14 years -- "since the nuns were here," 
Muntean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tierra del Sol was founded in 1970 in Sunland to provide daytime activities 
for adults with developmental disabilities, including mental retardation, 
autism, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. The group started by using the grounds of 
a Catholic convent and school for prospective nuns. The facility's organizers 
purchased the 7 1/2-acre property from the School Sisters of Notre Dame in 
1986. The organization now has two other campuses, in Van Nuys and Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been within the past two years that Tierra del Sol has started trying 
to expand the world of their nearly 300 clients, helping them to integrate into 
the community and work with agencies as volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it," Muntean said. "It was different." Just last month, Muntean also 
took her first bus trip to a mall in Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the clients have won paying jobs through their volunteer work, and the 
staff here has noticed that those clients have changed, that they no longer 
walk slowly under a cloud of depression, but with heads high and a sense of 
purpose, said Nancy R. Bissonette-Andrew, the agency's associate director of 
planning, programs and evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a 100% difference," said Serena Zamora, an instructor at Tierra del 
Sol for eight years. "Some of the clients I've had since I started. Now, they 
really have a sense of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who cannot speak have shown a preference for activities based on 
their talents, Zamora said. On a recent Thursday morning, students in Zamora's 
class packed lunches for the homeless at the Frontline Foundation in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the class also help to clean up the grounds and the trains at 
Traveltown in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were just going along with what was put in front of them," Zamora 
said, remembering the days when she and the clients spent eight hours a day in 
the classroom. Now, with the volunteer work, recycling and other activities, 
they are rarely in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Tierra del Sol volunteers also work with the Salvation Army, the U.S. Forest 
Service, convalescent hospitals and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 One group helps with clerical work at a Special Olympics office in Burbank.  
</P>
<P>
 Muntean, who lives in a group home in Chatsworth, helps rake and pull weeds at 
a small park in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Through community integration programs and volunteer work, Tierra del Sol 
hopes to erase much of the stigma attached to those with mental disabilities, 
said Vicki Nadsady, the group's community development officer.  
</P>
<P>
 The group also needs volunteers to help maintain and upgrade the property, 
which is running out of class space. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups that could use Tierra del Sol volunteers, or those who want to 
volunteer to help Tierra del Sol, can call Bissonette-Andrew at (818) 352-1419. 
</P>
<P>
 The Retired Seniors Volunteer Program of the San Fernando Valley needs 
volunteers for the Los Angeles Unified School District Science Center in North 
Hollywood for gardening chores and to help care for small animals. Mentors are 
also needed to tell life stories at adult continuation schools. No experience 
is necessary. Those interested should call (818) 908-5070. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Involved is a weekly listing of volunteering opportunities. Please 
address prospective listings to Getting Involved, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth, 91311. Or fax them to (818) 772-3338.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; JOB FAIRE AT OAKS MALL HAS SMALL 
TURNOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mimi Dahle, a Santa Claus photo concessionaire, swept into The Oaks mall 
Monday to hire a troop of five bearded men, but found the early season's 
pickings a bit thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are all of Santa's helpers this year?" asked Dahle, whose Santa Clauses 
pose with starry-eyed children in the mall each year. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a bustling holiday season, shopkeepers at the Thousand Oaks mall 
plan to hire twice as many temporary employees -- nearly 700 -- as they did 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the mall's eighth annual Job Faire drew only about half as many applicants 
on its first day this year as it did last year. Most were Thousand Oaks-area 
youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be that more people are already working," said Dolores Brum, a 
representative with the state Employment Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Held Monday and today and again on Nov. 21-22, the job fair is an attempt to 
match employees with jobs at about 100 shops and department stores at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, fair organizers filled 348 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, employers hope to fill at least 687, including those for sales 
clerks, cashiers, food-service workers and gift wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really amazing how fast I got the job," said Veronica Malanche, 17, a 
senior at Newbury Park High School. She had marched up to a reception table for 
an application, completed it and was hired on the spot by United Artists 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Skala, 17, was hired just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Christmas, my mom puts me in charge of wrapping gifts," Stacey said 
with amusement. Now she will get paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Martin, a J.C. Penney personnel manager who hired Stacey, said his firm 
is seeking about 120 temporary employees, compared to about 60 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed the increase in job demand to the Jan. 17 earthquake that closed 
some San Fernando Valley stores, including J.C. Penney in North Hollywood. Many 
displaced shoppers may now come to the easily accessible Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahle, meanwhile, was having better luck in finding her Santa. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Wolfe, 41, of Simi Valley was filling out an application for one of the 
five positions Dahle was offering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always adored Santa so I wanted to be him," Wolfe said. "Ho, ho, ho."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY MAY GIVE $22,000 FOR SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County supervisors will be asked today to approve a $22,000 contract with the 
American Red Cross to help fund an emergency winter shelter for the homeless 
beginning Nov. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 If the contract is approved, the money will go toward paying the estimated 
$89,830 cost of the shelter at the Oxnard National Guard Armory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County chapter of the Red Cross has operated a winter homeless 
shelter since 1987. This year the shelter is slated to be open through March 
31, providing a hot meal and a place to sleep for as many as 120 people each 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 In November and again in the last two weeks of March, the shelter will remain 
open only if there is a 50% chance of rain or the nighttime temperature is 
expected to drop below 40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter will be open continuously from Dec. 1 through March 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of funding for the shelter will come from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, according to a PSSA report prepared for supervisors. In 
addition, the cities of Oxnard and Ventura and the Red Cross will contribute.

 Roaming into downtown Orange is a little like stepping back in time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Towne Plaza is home to 46 antique shops that radiate from the city's 
famous traffic circle at Glassell Street and Chapman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47th shop is due to open next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambience of the historic plaza, which was founded in 1876, creates a nice 
setting for an antique district, according to David Connelly of the Old Towne 
Antique Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70- and 80-year-old buildings are perfectly designed for small antique 
shops, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The antique boom began in 1972 when Marty Burns opened her shop on Glassell 
called Marty's Things. Today

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FLAG-RAISING FOCUS OF WORKER'S APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An electrician at Oxnard College is fighting a three-day suspension, saying he 
was disciplined because he refused to fly the flag at full staff after the 
death of former President Richard M. Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Jensen, who has worked at the college for more than five years, said he 
was merely upholding a federal law calling for flags to be flown at half-staff 
for 30 days after a President or former President dies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patricia Parham, the district's personnel director, told trustees a 
different story. She said Jensen was suspended for "inefficiency, extended 
breaks and socializing during business hours." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also said their policy is to fly the flag at half-staff for 
three days after the death of a President or former President. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen took his dispute to the governing board of the Ventura County Community 
College District last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not guilty and I have have not done anything wrong," Jensen said. "What 
this boils down to is a personality conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law supports Jensen, according to Ventura College of Law librarian 
Bernard Jaffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees delayed making a ruling on the matter, saying they needed more 
information to make a decision. Parham said she would prepare a report for the 
governing board so trustees can rule on the suspension at a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said the suspension would cost him about $450. JEFF McDONALD

 Plaza Park, at the corner of Chestnut Street and Thompson Boulevard, should be 
improved with new restrooms and possibly a gazebo, the Ventura City Council 
decided Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council requested bids on the construction project, estimating that the 
city would pay about $170,000 to replace old restrooms and to remove a nearby 
concrete structure once used as restrooms but now overgrown with dirt and 
weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura has also received nearly $50,000 in federal funds to pay about half 
the estimated $100,000 cost of the gazebo, city officials said. But the city 
would construct the gazebo only if there is enough money left from the restroom 
project, or if other funds are found for it in other accounts, the council 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the restrooms is expected to start in late December. CONSTANCE

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Brian Herdeg has been an outstanding resident of the West Valley for 37 
years, and during those years, by his active involvement in civic affairs, he 
has contributed a great deal to this community. It is very unfortunate that you 
choose to sensationalize allegations by an unnamed woman that besmirch the 
doctor's fine reputation.The identity of "S.M." is protected, while her charges 
against Dr. Herdeg are reported in graphic detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Your reporter may think that he reported the story objectively because he did 
interview the doctor and quote him, but the reporter failed to include this 
pertinent information: The Los Angeles Police Department and district 
attorney's office had investigated the case more than a year ago and determined 
there was not a sound basis for filing charges. Furthermore, criticism by the 
California Legislature of the state medical board's handling of some past 
complaints against physicians has caused that body to press for judicial 
involvement in cases that were previously handled internally. 
</P>
<P>
 I know I speak for many, many people -- patients, friends and acquaintances -- 
when I express my own feelings of sorrow that Dr. Herdeg and his family must 
endure the pain of this type of publicity. There will be hearings and 
testimony, and there will ultimately be an outcome. I hope The Times will give 
as much space and prominence to an article fully clearing the doctor's name at 
that time.

AHMANSON DEVELOPMENT PLAN CALLED BAD DEAL FOR PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Finally someone had the courage to say, "The emperor has no clothes." I refer 
to Susan Genelin's excellent piece on the Ahmanson development deal, and in 
this case the emperor is the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy ("Offer by 
Ahmanson Co. Is No Bargain," Oct. 2). The Ahmanson deal is only the largest and 
latest of numerous ghastly development projects, usually involving severalfold 
upzonings, supported and even promoted by the conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy gives this support in exchange for the privilege of purchasing 
the project-associated open space. The open space gets appraised by 
hand-selected appraisers and rubber-stamped in Sacramento by the General 
Services Department, often at grossly inflated value. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll bet most people thought they were getting 10,000 acres of free parkland 
out of this deal. What they are really getting is 3,050 houses on 
environmentally sensitive land originally zoned for less than 30 houses, tens 
of thousands of extra cars on the 101 Freeway, increased water and air 
pollution, and, oh yes, they also get to spend $29.5 million (or more?) for 
various parcels of land that would have been difficult to develop in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were no Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, the developers would have 
to invent it. Or have they?

 * Regarding the Ventura County Board of Supervisors' vote to delay the 
private-for-public purchase of parkland ("Supervisors Favor 3-Year Extension 
for Ahmanson," Oct. 25), I have two questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Was it in the public interest to extend the purchase of the parkland? 
Certainly not. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Board of Supervisors representing the best interest of the public, or 
the Ahmanson Land Co.? 
</P>

<P>
 * At last The Times has printed an article (Valley Commentary, Oct. 2) which 
clearly explains the convoluted nature of the Ahmanson Ranch deal. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ventura County supervisors approved this destructive project, they 
said the main reason they did so was to bring 10,000 acres of land into public 
ownership. Let's just look at who benefited from this arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hope got $16.7 million of public money for Jordan Ranch. The land was 
zoned for 15 houses and had no access easements. It was and still is 
landlocked. Bob Hope's friends, Potomac Investment Associates, got to transfer 
entitlements it never even received over to Ahmanson Ranch. Ahmanson and 
Potomac got permission to build 3,050 houses, two golf courses and 400,000 
square feet of commercial space on land that was zoned for 34 houses. Potomac 
got $10 million more of public money for land next to a leaky landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we're told the public may have to cough up some more money to keep this 
deal alive. I say let it die.

OBITUARIES ; RAY RUSSUM, AD SALESMAN, VENTURA ACTIVIST, DIES AT 62; COMMUNITY: 
CITY COUNCIL WATCHDOG AND 'TREMENDOUS SALESPERSON' RETAINED RESPECT OF THOSE ON 
BOTH SIDES OF ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ray Russum, an advertising salesman who retired in Ventura and became a gadfly 
to the City Council, has died at the age of 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Russum, who was born and reared in North Hollywood, died of pancreatic cancer 
Friday in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Russum worked as a real estate agent and advertising salesman for local 
publications and television, according to one of his four daughters, Teri 
Russum. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was probably the most tremendous salesperson you would have ever met," she 
said. "That was his thing, whether he was selling ideas or real estate." 
</P>
<P>
 Russum originally made a name for himself by appearing in numerous "Little 
Rascals" films beginning at age 3, she said. She said she was not sure which 
character he played. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was in community activism that Russum made his mark locally. Current 
and former members of the Ventura City Council remembered Russum as an 
ever-watchful citizen-activist who was never shy about speaking his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1990, Russum rounded up dozens of his neighbors in the Ventura Keys 
to protest an assessment district that would have forced residents to pay to 
dredge the waterways throughout the upscale neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor has called us freeloaders," he said in a 1990 Times interview. 
"(But) we really have the highest property taxes in the city of Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 The self-appointed "California Crusader General" funded his own weekly 
television show that lambasted members of the Ventura City Council each Monday 
before its meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Relentless in his quest to lessen government interference in the lives of its 
people, Russum often used puppets and ventriloquists' dolls on his show to 
mimic council members speaking among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote, produced and directed the whole thing," his daughter said. "It was 
all right off the cuff. He was probably the most creative person I've known in 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The often sharp ridicule left no hard feelings among some city leaders, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a council critic, but he always did it in a way that made sense," 
Councilman Jim Monahan said. "I've always had the greatest amount of respect 
for Ray Russum. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me on a regular basis and always let me know whether he approved or 
disapproved" of council actions, Monahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors remember Russum as a leader who never failed to muster local 
interest in a government issue that affected him or his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a fighter, and he was a very sincere fighter," said Paul Masi, a 
friend of seven years. "You knew where he stood all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Masi credits Russum with getting the city to reconsider its assessment 
district on Ventura Keys residents in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy that found out about it," Masi said. "We fought it and we beat 
the City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Others agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all coming unglued," former Ventura Vice Mayor Donald Villanueva said at 
the time. "Russum has triggered a wave of panic." 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative compromise on the assessment district is in the works now, 
Councilman Gary Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1 p.m. memorial service for Russum is scheduled today at Forest Lawn in 
Hollywood Hills.

BEACH RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: Miguel Bustillo's excellent article "Valentino's Beach Party," Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 I take personal umbrage to George Johnson's assertion that the assessment 
districts were just a tool to get the peasants off the beach, principally 
because, I suppose, I'm one of his so-called peasants.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not a doctor, lawyer or corporate head. On the contrary, I'm a senior 
chief petty officer, U.S. Navy, retired. I own and reside in a small cottage in 
the Hollywood-by-the-Sea tract in the Channel Islands Beach Community Services 
District, and have been a beach resident since 1959 when the Navy assigned me 
to serve as leading chief of the Naval Security Group Detachment at Point Mugu. 
Also, I was elected treasurer and was an active member of the Hollywood Beach 
Project Ad Hoc Citizens Committee, in its successful campaign to establish the 
badly needed improvement projects that Johnson strongly denounces. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time in the not too distant past, we beach people had to make an 
important decision: whether we would just trod along indifferently and let the 
chips fall where they may. Or, instead, take advantage of our new harbor and 
work to create the dynamic community we now have, despite opposition from a 
small group of dissenters like Johnson. Fortunately, the large majority 
selected the latter.

 I am deeply distressed over comments made in "Valentino's Beach Party," Oct. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 The characterization that more recent residents of Channel Islands Beach have 
brought about "the Encino lifestyle" is puzzling. Is that the same as a 
Pasadena lifestyle, or Glendale lifestyle or even Toluca Lake lifestyle? It 
certainly is not the Malibu lifestyle.  
</P>
<P>
 Our neighbors at Hollywood Beach are eclectic, running the gamut from 
well-to-do to a little above poverty level. Some are even middle class. But, 
who cares? We all love the beach and the still unpretentious lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps these naysayers would be more productive and happier citizens if they 
stopped trying to polarize our community and renewed their efforts toward 
preventing annexation.

OVERFISHING DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forgive me if I don't join in the celebration regarding Ventura Harbor's 
renovation that has attracted 17 more long-liners from Florida and Louisiana 
("New Jobs Seen With Renovation of Ventura Harbor," Oct. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Harbor desperately needs something to pull them out of their financial 
woes, but to welcome these long-line fishing boats here with open arms is very 
short-sighted.They will, no doubt, help the Port District financially in the 
short run. They will also deplete our offshore fisheries in a few short years 
as they have done on the East and Gulf coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-liners' depletion of these coasts is well documented. For example, a 
once healthy swordfish population, where the average fish was 200 pounds, was 
soon diminished to an average of only 40 pounds. You don't have to be a marine 
biologist to figure out that a 40-pound swordfish is unable to reproduce. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-liners are not here to create jobs or help out our struggling Port 
District. They are here only because they have decimated their previous fishing 
grounds, and our abundant offshore waters are their next stop. 
</P>
<P>
 A prudent man will learn by the mistakes of others, and not repeat them. 
Richard Parsons (port district general manager) and the Ventura Port District 
have chosen to ignore the mistakes made on the other coasts and have sold us 
out to people who will soon put an end to our healthy offshore fishery. 
</P>
<P>
 The establishment of a commercial long-line fleet here will very likely put 
the final nails in the coffins of many of our struggling local commercial 
fishermen.

JEWISH GROUP DISMAYED OVER ATTACKS ON BUDDHIST SYMBOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As chair of the Anti-Defamation League's Valley civil rights committee, I read 
"Symbol of Misunderstanding" (Oct. 14) about the Buddhist Temple in Chatsworth 
with great interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the article failed to mention the ADL's strong response to the 
numerous initial expressions of concern about the religious emblems.The ADL, 
after determining that the emblems were not Nazi swastikas but rather Buddhist 
symbols of peace which predated the Holocaust, served to calm the community and 
to urge tolerance toward the temple and respect for the First Amendment rights 
of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the ADL's Valley office contacted everyone who had expressed alarm, 
to allay their fears and educate them about the Buddhist emblem. We are 
saddened by the intolerance and violence that has greeted this temple, and 
again urge respect for the diversity of the many religious groups in our 
community, including the Hwa Yen Buddhists.

SOKA UNIVERSITY URGED TO LEARN A LESSON FROM DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disney's recent decision not to build a theme park next to the Civil War 
battleground of Manassas is a lesson that Soka (University) should take to 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney was finally persuaded that its project simply didn't belong at that 
location. No one claimed that Disney was not entitled to build a theme park -- 
just that it shouldn't be built at that specific site. Disney has not abandoned 
the project but will relocate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka's plan to build a college campus at Gillette Ranch is a perfect analogue 
to Disney's plan to build at Manassas. Soka's campus doesn't belong at Gillette 
Ranch, for a host of environmental, traffic and growth-inducing reasons. Soka 
is entitled to build a campus, but not at that specific site. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear distinction must be made between Soka the institution (like Disney the 
institution) and the question of whether its project is good or bad. Just as we 
can admire Disney but deplore its Manassas project, we can also respect Soka 
but deplore its Gillette project. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka would have us believe that attacking its project is an attack on Soka 
itself. But just as the Manassas project is only one part of the Disney 
enterprise, the Gillette project is only one part of the Soka enterprise. 
Soka's main campus is in Japan, with satellite branches in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Disney, Soka is immensely wealthy; it can afford to buy any parcel of 
land it wants, wherever it wants. It is a great tragedy that Soka chose -- like 
Disney -- to try to develop land that cries out to be left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Disney, which realized that it made a mistake, Soka has not yet seen 
the light. Perhaps Soka will learn from Disney and abandon its plans for 
Gillette Ranch. When Soka finds a non-controversial site to build its campus 
on, I'll be the first to cheer them on for their wisdom and good sense.

ACCUSED FOOTBALL PLAYER SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM CSUN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a CSUN alumna, I was shocked and disgusted to learn through The Times that 
an attempted murder suspect remains a member in good standing of the CSUN 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 A student-athlete who has been awarded an athletic scholarship has an 
obligation to the university to maintain good standing as a student and to 
train and develop his athletic skills for which he has won a scholarship. 
Beneath these obvious requirements, that student has the obligation to carry 
himself in a manner befitting a university representative; to behave in a way 
that will not embarrass or disgrace himself and the university. 
</P>
<P>
 I would argue that as the student sat until recently in the San Bernardino 
County Jail, he was not bringing favorable publicity to CSUN. For this reason 
alone, he should be suspended from the football team pending resolution of his 
legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the university has an obligation to the student-athlete. I hardly 
think that a full-time student with serious criminal charges pending against 
him should be spending his extra time on the football field. If CSUN fails to 
admit that the student should be suspended on moral principles then it should 
at the minimum suspend him for his own good so that he can focus his energies 
on his schoolwork and his legal dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to tell if CSUN's position of not taking action is one of 
sheer greed or sheer stupidity. Is the university trying to get every last dime 
out of its scholarship investment by keeping him on the team? Does the 
university truly believe that suspending this player from the team pending a 
resolution of his legal difficulties will be in violation of his rights? Either 
position is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not asking that the university convict him before his trial, nor am I 
suggesting that he is entitled to anything less than due process. However, he 
should not have the privilege of participating in college football during this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The best and the brightest are honored to represent the university, in 
academic competitions, the arts and intercollegiate athletics. It is a disgrace 
to all those individuals who have earned that honor, past or present, when 
someone who has been charged by the state of California for double attempted 
murder gets to stand in that same spotlight.

PROJECT FOR SENIORS' HOUSING OPPOSED FOR HIGH COSTS, TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the buildings at Ventura Boulevard and Woodman Avenue are in "advanced 
disrepair. . . a present mess," as you say in your editorial of Oct. 9, then 
why haven't the city officials used their authority to force the owners to 
simply clean up their property? 
</P>
<P>
 If only an "extra five feet" is not much, then why not simply reduce the 
height to conform to the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan? 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is "opposed by some of its neighbors," then why have thousands 
of neighbors signed petitions against this project? 
</P>
<P>
 The questions you should be asking are: 
</P>
<P>
 Why does Councilman Yaroslavsky support the project when so many object? 
</P>
<P>
 What guarantee will the city (taxpayers) have that enough profit can made to 
pay back the loan after the landowner and developer walk away with their fat 
profits? 
</P>
<P>
 GEORGE WEISENFELD 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura Boulevard is not an appropriate site for senior citizen housing, 
particularly when that housing consists of a one-bedroom unit totaling 600 
square feet. How depressing to be exiled to a sardine can in our old age. Many 
seniors require live-in health care assistance, and the proposed project does 
not have space to accommodate these needs. 
</P>
<P>
 There is too much traffic on Ventura Boulevard for seniors to walk safely. My 
parents, who live in the area, recently saw an elderly man cross the boulevard 
mid-block, oblivious to oncoming traffic. Ventura Boulevard is the alternative 
highway when the freeway is busy. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no affordable market within walking distance of this project. The 
"market" noted on the plan map is an expensive convenience store with limited 
choice of products, not a place where low-income seniors can shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the earthquake, there are many existing apartment buildings on side 
streets in Sherman Oaks and other areas. Many of these remain uninhabitable 
because the owners have been financially unable to rebuild or repair. It would 
cost far less to loan these owners money to repair units on the condition that 
the building be used for low-income senior citizens. Instead, our City Council 
is prepared not only to finance the construction of a new building, but also to 
finance the acquisition of the site, which is not owned by the prospective 
developer. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The project involves costs not disclosed in the proposal. For example, the 
city will widen the southwest corner of Woodman Avenue at Ventura Boulevard by 
up to eight feet. There is an existing business on that corner, and the 
property will have to be acquired by eminent domain. You and I will pay for 
this property. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question but that the property needs to be developed, but senior 
housing is not the answer.

ERRONEOUS REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I believe that erroneous information is being circulated about a company 
called The Worm Concern.  
</P>
<P>
 I have been a customer of this odd but interesting effort to use regenerative 
materials for the last 10 years.Thanks to its superior products (compost and 
worms) I have had a beautiful and abundant garden for years. 
</P>
<P>
 I have visited The Worm Concern on many occasions and have often been 
accompanied by my children. We have always enjoyed these visits and none of us 
has ever detected any foul odors or seen any vermin (unlike garbage dumps, 
landfills, etc., compost must be clean to develop properly because it must be 
exposed to air). 
</P>
<P>
 In search of composting materials I have also visited several horse stables, 
where I have consistently noticed odors, flies and other environmentally 
adverse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that before anybody judges The Worm Concern that they visit the farm 
and see for themselves.

PARKLAND QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the Ventura County Board of Supervisor's vote to delay the 
private-for-public purchase of parkland, I have two questions. Was it in the 
public interest to extend the purchase of the parkland? Certainly not. Is the 
Board of Supervisors representing the best interest of the public or Ahmanson 
Land Co.?

SPRAYING CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I realize that agriculture is the No. 1 business in Ventura County, but we 
must find other methods besides malathion spraying to stop the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Corona, no ladybugs, bees or birds are to be found in the area 
sprayed.People are complaining of nervousness and breathing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time I see land movers tearing down a farm or fruit trees, I will be 
right with them. Because it's big money in farming and it's people in the 
agriculture business in this county who do not care about our next generation, 
our children.

 I hope you will follow up on the water bills in Camarillo after a few 
malathion sprayings and after citizens have followed the state's glib solution 
to concerns of toxicity: "Just hose everything off."

 So much for drought conservation efforts.

AGOURA HILLS TREES TO BE DEDICATED WITH PLAQUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a new philosophy in many communities these days: If you want 
something done to improve your community, don't expect your fiscally strapped 
city government to do it; raise money and do it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy guided a group of Agoura Hills residents who wanted to replace 
trees around the city that had died because of lack of maintenance and other 
causes. The residents said they knew that the city, battling a deficit, was in 
no position to help. 
</P>
<P>
 So they began a fund-raising campaign that they say has raised $1,800. Last 
week, they held a ceremony for the planting of the first tree on Kanan Road 
near Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way it is going to happen in the future, with the privatization 
of things," said Dan Kuperberg, chairman of the city's Community Services 
Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 For $50, donors can have a tree planted in their names, commemorated with a 
plaque installed on a nearby sidewalk, said Carol Rosenberg, the co-chairwoman 
along with Darlene Ballman of a citizens committee trying to increase the 
number of trees in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward purchasing the trees, which cost about $20 to $30 
each, Rosenberg said. The $50 covers the purchase and planting of the trees and 
purchase of the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree and plaque serve as a fitting memorial to loved ones, said Rosenberg. 
Many of the people who have donated are using the trees as monuments to those 
who have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Gowland of Santa Monica said she and her husband, Peter, will have a 
tree planted in honor of the late Frank Rosenthal, the father of their 
granddaughter, Tracy Rosenthal of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracy was very close to her father," said Gowland. "They got along 
beautifully. She is very much like him in her love of people and her sense of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, a Santa Monica native, moved to South Carolina in 1992, where he 
died Aug. 5 at age 53, said Gowland. The Gowlands' daughter, Ann, was married 
to Rosenthal for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tree is like a connection to Frank," said Gowland. "We very much feel 
that we are all part of the earth. It's like a circle: We came from the earth 
and we are going to return to it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase of the program, expected to begin in early spring, trees 
will be planted in the parks as well as along the streets, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees are London planes, similar to sycamores, growing to about 40 feet, 
with a 30- to 40-foot crown, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions for the tree program can be mailed to TREE, c/o City of Agoura 
Hills, 30101 Agoura Court, Suite 102, Agoura Hills, 91301. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the fund-raising effort has allowed the city to qualify for 
matching grants from the federal government, administered through a state 
program called California Relief, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it shows how strong the community feels about this," she said. "The 
seeds that we have planted will ensure a beautiful Agoura Hills of the future."

 The San Diego Chargers will have quarterback Stan Humphries back when they 
visit the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. He sat out the 10-9 loss to the Atlanta 
Falcons last Sunday to allow his dislocated left elbow to heal. His backup, 
Gale Gilbert, made his first start in eight seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stan will not be questionable," Coach Bobby Ross said. "He will play and he 
will start. That's a fact. Unless he gets hurt this week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers defeated the Chiefs, 20-6, in San Diego on Oct. 9. But they 
haven't won in Kansas City since 1989. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Miami Dolphin Coach Don Shula said leading receiver and scorer Keith Byars 
will be sidelined the rest of the season because of a knee injury that will 
require reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-year veteran has been Miami's top receiver with 49 catches and 
touchdown leader with seven. His two receptions Sunday extended his streak of 
catching at least one pass to 111 consecutive regular season games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis Colt quarterback Don Majkowski suffered a partially torn ligament 
in his right thumb on the third play of Sunday's 22-21 loss to Miami and will 
be sidelined two to four weeks. The Colts have a bye this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh Steelers might not know until late in the week if quarterback 
Neil O'Donnell can play next Monday night against the Buffalo Bills. O'Donnell, 
who injured his left leg in overtime Sunday at Houston, was diagnosed with a 
lower left leg contusion and a sprained ankle. Mike Tomczak will start against 
Buffalo if O'Donnell can't. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although his wife tried to talk him into retiring, Buffalo Bill wide receiver 
Don Beebe, who suffered a concussion when hit by linebacker Bobby Houston of 
the Jets, said he will be ready for the Steeler game. . . . Minnesota Viking 
cornerback Anthony Parker could miss Sunday's game at New England because of a 
hamstring injury. . . . Washington Redskin Coach Norv Turner said Gus Frerotte 
and No. 1 pick Heath Shuler will compete in practice for the starting position. 
The Redskins have a bye, then meet the Dallas Cowboys on Nov. 20. . . . The 
NAACP met with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and agreed to call off a threatened 
Thanksgiving Day boycott of Texas Stadium protesting the team's minority hiring 
practices and vendor operations. . . . The Cincinnati Bengals put quarterback 
Don Hollas on the injured reserve list.

NOTEBOOK; FREEWAY LEAGUE FACES UNUSUAL POSSIBILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anything could happen Thursday when the Freeway League season ends. In fact, a 
special meeting was called Monday to determine what the league will do if that 
possible four-way tie for first place does come to fruition -- there was 
nothing in the league constitution that allows for that. 
</P>
<P>
 And if there isn't a four-way tie for first, there could be a four-way tie for 
third place -- and that final automatic playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 League principals met Monday and determined that any four-way tie -- rather 
than being decided by the best record within the group of teams that are tied 
-- will be broken by the equivalent of a coin flip. 
</P>
<P>
 Any three-way ties will continue to be decided by head-to-head competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 If Sonora (5-4, 3-1) loses to Sunny Hills (3-6, 2-2), there will be at least a 
three-way tie for first place between Sonora, Sunny Hills and either Fullerton 
(5-4, 2-2) or Troy (6-3, 2-2), which play each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The joker in that scenario is Buena Park (3-6, 2-2). If Buena Park loses to La 
Habra (3-6, 1-3) and Fullerton wins, the playoff seeding will be Sunny Hills, 
Fullerton and Sonora; if Buena Park loses and Troy wins, a coin flip will 
determine what happens. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Buena Park wins and Sonora loses, there will be a four-way tie for 
first place -- and the subsequent coin flip to determine which three teams get 
automatic playoff berths. That means Troy, ranked ninth in Division VII (the 
league's only ranked team), would share the league's best overall record and 
have victories over Orange County's 10th-ranked Rancho Alamitos and once-beaten 
Costa Mesa, and could miss the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any other way to get around it," Troy Coach John Turek 
said. "I have total faith in my principal (Jerry Atkin) -- he's a good flipper. 
He's been pretty good with the flips in the past; hopefully that will continue. 
If we would have played better the last couple of weeks, we wouldn't have this 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a shame for us to miss the playoffs, but I don't know any other 
way it can be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sonora and La Habra win, there will be a four-way tie for third place; 
Sonora will be No. 1, the Fullerton-Troy winner will be No. 2 and everyone else 
will have their fingers crossed at the coin flip. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sonora, Fullerton and Buena Park win, then the order will be Sonora, 
Fullerton and Buena Park; if Sonora, Troy and Buena Park win, then the order 
will be Sonora, Buena Park and Troy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the rest of the county is a little easier to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Century League: Foothill (5-4, 4-0) will be the No. 1 entry into the playoffs 
regardless of its outcome against El Modena (3-6, 1-3). Villa Park (8-1, 3-1) 
will be No. 2 if it defeats Santa Ana Valley (3-6, 1-3) or if Canyon loses; if 
Canyon (6-3, 2-2) beats Orange (4-5, 1-3) and Villa Park loses, Canyon is the 
No. 2 team by virtue of its victory over Villa Park last week. If Orange beats 
Canyon, the Panthers go to the playoffs as the No. 3 team because of their 
head-to-head victory. Canyon holds third-place tie-breaker edges over El Modena 
and Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Empire League: There will be a two-way tie for first and third because four 
teams have one loss in league play; Kennedy (7-2, 3-1) plays Century (5-4, 3-1) 
and El Dorado (5-4, 3-1) plays Loara (4-5, 3-1). Kennedy would go as the higher 
seeded team if it's tied with Loara, but not if it's tied with El Dorado; 
Century would go as the higher seeded team if it's tied with El Dorado, but not 
Loara. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West League: Servite (7-2, 4-0) is No. 1 and Westminster (6-3, 3-1) is 
No. 2 regardless of the outcome of their games. If Saddleback (3-6, 2-2) beats 
Tustin (1-8, 1-3), the Roadrunners are No. 3. If Saddleback loses and is tied 
with Tustin for third place, Tustin is No. 3 by virtue of its victory. If there 
is a three-way tie for third place with Saddleback, Tustin and Santa Ana or 
Ocean View, there will be a coin flip because no team will have the 
head-to-head advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove League: Rancho Alamitos (6-2-1, 5-0) is No. 1 with a victory over 
Bolsa Grande (2-7, 1-4). Los Amigos (8-1, 4-1) is No. 2 with a victory over 
Pacifica (5-4, 3-2). If Rancho Alamitos loses and Los Amigos wins, Rancho is 
No. 1 because of its earlier victory over Los Amigos. If Los Amigos loses, 
there will be at least a two-way tie (and Pacifica No. 2 because of its victory 
over Los Amigos), and possibly a three-way tie for second place that includes 
Garden Grove (4-4, 3-2); in that case, a coin flip determines which two teams 
go to the playoffs and in what order. A coin flip will also break a three-way 
tie for third place between Pacifica, Garden Grove and Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange League: Brea-Olinda (7-1-1, 3-0-1) is No. 1 if it beats Valencia 
(3-5-1, 2-1-1), but a Valencia victory will give the Tigers any tie-breaker 
advantage against Brea. If Brea loses and Savanna (7-2, 3-1) beats Western 
(7-1-1, 2-1-1), then Savanna will be No. 1, Valencia No. 2 and Brea No. 3. If 
Brea loses and Western beats Savanna, then Valencia will be No. 1 and a coin 
flip will determine No. 2 between Brea and Western. If Brea and Savanna win, 
then Brea will be No. 1, Savanna No. 2 and Valencia No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Coast League: The winner of the Laguna Hills (7-2, 4-0) vs. Costa Mesa 
(7-1, 3-0-1) game goes to the playoffs as the top entry. If Laguna Hills loses, 
it finishes second; if Costa Mesa loses and University (4-4-1, 2-1-1) beats 
Aliso Niguel (3-6, 1-3), a coin flip determines who is No. 2. University 
finishes at least third. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea View League: Newport Harbor (9-0, 4-0) is No. 1. If Corona del Mar (4-5, 
2-2) beats Woodbridge, the Sea Kings go to the playoffs unless El Toro (5-3-1, 
2-1-1) beats Newport and Irvine (4-4-1, 2-1-1) beats Santa Margarita (4-5, 
1-3). If El Toro and Irvine finish tied, a coin flip determines who has the 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast League: Mater Dei (9-0, 4-0) is the No. 1 team. If Trabuco Hills 
(7-2, 3-1) beats Capistrano Valley (5-4, 2-2), the Mustangs finish No. 2 and 
the Cougars only finish No. 3 if San Clemente (4-5, 1-3) beats Mission Viejo 
(3-6, 2-2); however, if Mission Viejo wins, the Diablos will be No. 3. If 
Capistrano Valley wins and Mission Viejo wins, creating a three-way tie for 
second, a coin flip decides which two teams advance. If Capistrano Valley wins 
and Mission Viejo loses, the Cougars will be No. 2 and Trabuco Hills No. 3. If 
Capistrano Valley and Mission Viejo lose, creating a three-way tie with San 
Clemente, there will be a coin flip to determine third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunset League: Los Alamitos (9-0, 4-0) is No. 1. Esperanza (6-3, 3-1) is No. 2 
if it beats Fountain Valley (4-5, 2-2), and Edison (7-2, 2-2) is No. 3 if it 
beats Marina (6-3, 1-3). If Fountain Valley wins and Edison loses, Fountain 
Valley's No. 2 and Esperanza is No. 3. If Fountain Valley wins and Edison wins, 
a coin flip will break the three-way tie for second place. If Fountain Valley 
and Edison lose, creating a three-way tie for third place with Marina, a coin 
flip will determine the outcome.

THE WEEK AHEAD: SEOUL; U.S.-KOREA TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher will visit Seoul today and Wednesday to 
consult with South Korean leaders on the nuclear agreement the Clinton 
Administration recently signed with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, South Korea is expected to play the leading role in 
providing the Pyongyang regime with new light-water nuclear technology that 
cannot easily be used to make nuclear weapons. However, Washington and Seoul 
have not yet spelled out exactly how much money South Korea will have to spend 
on the North Korean project. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher will also reaffirm American security commitments to South Korea, 
which still confronts the threat of more than 600,000 North Korean troops 
massed north of the demilitarized zone between the two countries.

DOCUMENTARY; AFRAID OF FLYING? TRY CATCHING A RIDE ABOARD 'MAYBE AIRLINES' TO 
SARAJEVO; JUST GETTING TO THE PLANE CAN BE HUMILIATING, COMPLEX, PERILOUS -- 
AND SOMETIMES FUNNY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Aren't you afraid?" sensible people ask foreign correspondents as they set 
out for besieged Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a logical question, as this forsaken Bosnian capital has been savaged by 
combatants for 2 1/2 years, and the bombs and bullets make no distinction 
between the Sarajevans who are their targets and the U.N. peacekeepers, foreign 
aid officials and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question that would get an unqualified affirmative answer, at least 
from me, if my natural instincts for survival weren't so thoroughly distorted 
by the mental and physical gymnastics required to get here in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely getting aboard a U.N.-operated relief flight to Sarajevo has become so 
complicated, humiliating, perilous and unpredictable that putting that part of 
the trip behind me makes me feel like I've got the world beat. 
</P>
<P>
 After being bumped a dozen times to make space for anything from leotards to 
lentils, finally jumping from the open tail of a C-130 cargo plane onto the 
Sarajevo runway in a blizzard of exhaust fumes has the same satisfying "yes!" 
sensation as spiking a football after a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It feels like winning the lottery, beating the odds, putting one over. And it 
even has its amusing moments. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, there would seem to be little to laugh about in the United 
Nations' courageous, expensive and trouble-plagued undertaking to feed hungry 
Sarajevans. But behind the scenes, the humanitarian airlift that has fed this 
rebel-encircled city since July, 1992, operates like a black comedy crossing 
"Catch-22" with "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The airlift is known by its pilots, ground crews and passengers as "Maybe 
Airlines," operating under the proud motto: "Maybe We Fly, Maybe We Don't." You 
can buy "Maybe Airlines" T-shirts from a French canteen tucked behind a wall of 
sandbags at the airport. The "airline" brings together by-the-book soldiers and 
bizarre civilians, from swaggering Tom Cruise wanna-bes who pilot the cargo 
planes to Ukrainian ground crewmen in plastic sandals -- even in winter. Then 
there's the explosives-sniffing dog "Foster" who has the entire French 
contingent vying for his affection. 
</P>
<P>
 After 26 months in service, the operation is replete with stories, from the 
scandalous to the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time a Canadian pilot bumped four senior North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization officers to make room for a Canadian television crew that planned 
a documentary about his brave flyboys. 
</P>
<P>
 A German journalist for an obscure dance magazine who wanted to bring in 
neon-colored tutus for a Sarajevo ballet school managed to get the Luftwaffe to 
up his standing to military priority with the contention he was carrying "vital 
cargo." 
</P>
<P>
 French flight crews have commandeered relief aircraft to fly in personal 
stocks of wine and pate, and Bosnian black marketeers with bogus press 
credentials use the airlift as a free shuttle on which to transport suitcases 
full of coffee, sugar, liquor and cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists, who have the lowest priority among the soldiers, relief workers, 
missionaries, peaceniks and assorted do-gooders, often find themselves forced 
onto an aerial trapeze, swinging on commercial flights around southern Europe 
in vain efforts to get in the right place to catch the airlift that is the 
sole, if unreliable, access to Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 How the white-knuckled flights come to impart a sense of accomplishment is 
best explained by the disorder and frustration that afflict each journey's 
onset. 
</P>
<P>
 You set out laden with guilt, as well as tons of luggage. Spouses, parents, 
children, even other colleagues, act like you're headed off for certain death 
-- a prospect we correspondents try to treat as ridiculous so as to calm our 
families' fears, as well as our own. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to get stuck there forever one of these days," my husband 
admonished as I set off in mid-October, well aware that the airlift had been 
grounded for the two previous weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish you would stop doing that," my mother said disapprovingly in a phone 
call, as if going to Sarajevo were some kind of unseemly habit, like showing up 
at the dinner table chewing gum. 
</P>
<P>
 The logistics of getting there as safely as possible help you focus on 
something other than fear. To gain access to a U.N. relief flight, you must 
scurry across the Balkans to collect credentials, then obtain a helmet and flak 
jacket that together usually weigh more than 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The more experienced you get with Sarajevo's deprivations, the more gear you 
consider essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of being caught up in an intensified siege or being marooned by a 
prolonged suspension of the airlift compel most of us to bring in at least 
small caches of "backup food": dry soup mixes, granola bars, peanut butter and 
the like. They can always be given away to grateful Sarajevans before 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
 You want a first-aid kit, candles, flashlights, a shortwave radio and heaps of 
batteries. And of course, without a laptop computer you'd be unable to send 
back any news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with minimal clothing and the disincentive of having to carry everything 
across the Sarajevo tarmac at a brisk, sniper-defying trot, keeping the load 
below the 66-pound limit is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip begins with the guessing game of choosing a venue from which to get 
in. There are more flights from Ancona, Italy, than from Split, Croatia, but 
the latter has the attraction of being within driving distance of other locales 
in Bosnia-Herzegovina that you can visit if the Sarajevo airlift is grounded. 
</P>
<P>
 For an October visit, undertaken with my Warsaw colleague, Dean E. Murphy, we 
gambled on getting in from Split.  
</P>
<P>
 The five seats allotted to passengers on each of three daily French flights 
are on a first-come, first-served basis, so you have to get up at 5 a.m. to get 
to the airport by 7, in time to jostle for space with the dozens of Priority 
III passengers angling for a seat. Then you wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you wait for the fog to lift in Sarajevo, where it seems to be foggy 
every day until noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times you wait because the last relief planes came back with bullet 
holes, and airlift administrators want to seek fresh assurances -- insincere as 
they may be -- from the Bosnian combatants that they won't target the aircraft 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Often you wait because no one at Split or Ancona knows whether they're flying 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Biding time at Split airport is an experience with the surreal. It bears a 
resemblance to the intergalactic bar in the movie "Star Wars," with cocky 
pilots in their chevroned flight suits and aviator shades sipping coffee next 
to camouflage-clad Croatian policemen, homebound Bosnian civilians bearing 
slings and casts from medical treatments abroad, bearded black-marketeers 
skulking around in leather jackets and robed peace activists headed for the war 
zone to share the Bosnians' pain. 
</P>
<P>
 We learned, after flying from Vienna to the Croatian capital of Zagreb and 
then driving for 11 hours to Croatia's Adriatic port of Split, that flights had 
been suspended that Tuesday because of small-arms fire directed at the planes. 
The suspension lasted all day Wednesday, and fog grounded the airlift the day 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, our fourth day of 5 a.m. reveille for nothing, we should have been 
immune to the vicious cycle of hope and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The airlift was operating. The weather in Sarajevo was clear. Even some 
military flights that had slipped in without passengers late Thursday had 
returned with reports of nothing untoward. 
</P>
<P>
 But the French air operations team emerged to inform our ever-growing numbers 
that their aircraft was being diverted to Zagreb to fly military cargoes until 
at least Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 So we repacked our armor, drove back to Zagreb and flew from there to Rome, 
then Ancona, where the relief flights were supposedly getting out without 
problems. Somewhere en route, my bags were set in a pool of fish brine because 
they emerged from the Alitalia baggage ramp with the overpowering odor of low 
tide. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7 a.m. Sunday, we were at Ancona airport, and close to 11 a.m. we were 
allowed to "check in." 
</P>
<P>
 This involves having your luggage weighed to make sure it doesn't exceed the 
30-kilogram limit. Then British Royal Air Force police officers go through it, 
item by item, to make sure no one carries contraband. Your money is counted. 
Letters are opened. Your neatly folded shirts and underwear end up in a tangled 
heap. 
</P>
<P>
 After you repack, you sit in a small waiting room for word that a plane is 
ready to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot of sniffing and seat-changing as the fish odor emanated from 
my bags. Most people would be embarrassed, but I figured it hardly made the 
annals of unpleasant relief flights. I once shared the ride with a planeload of 
seed onions, which gagged even the unflappable cargo crew, and more than a few 
hardened passengers have lost their lunches when pilots have soared into 
evasive action after being locked onto by combatants' missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 C-130 Hercules cargo planes are like flying submarines, with strange tubes and 
equipment affixed to every inch of bulkhead. Lights blink, valves hiss, steam 
wafts from unknown sources and the engines make a deafening roar. The seats are 
simple canvas slings that hang down from the bulkhead, clustered up toward the 
cockpit with the loading equipment and around a mounted metal container that 
looks like a mailbox but bears the illuminating warning: "This urinal is to be 
used for its intended purpose only." 
</P>
<P>
 Ground fire at previous relief planes can cause a flight to be called back 
right up to the moment of scheduled landing. 
</P>
<P>
 The planes take a gut-clutching plunge from their cruising altitude down to 
the tarmac, to minimize the time they are visible and vulnerable to ground 
fire. Ours landed fairly smoothly, and we gleefully leaped out after four 
pallets of flour sacks had been rolled into the sturdy arms of waiting 
forklifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, seven days, two 300-mile drives, four flights and much stomach acid 
after leaving home, we arrived in Sarajevo at 1 p.m. on a Sunday, lugging our 
smelly bags through the wreckage of the airport terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 We were elated. We had made it. We had won. 
</P>
<P>
 At least it felt that way for the first few minutes. Trying to Fly "Maybe 
Airlines" 
</P>
<P>
 Getting from Zagreb, Croatia, to Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, can take six 
days of nerve-fraying travel. Here's a recent itinerary for two Times 
correspondents. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday: Drive for 11 hours from Zagreb to Split, Croatia. U.N.-operated 
relief flights to Sarajevo suspended due to small-arms fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: Split. Get up at 5 a.m. Still too dangerous to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: Split. Get up at 5 a.m. Fog grounds all planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: Split. Get up at 5 a.m. All aircraft diverted to Zagreb to fly 
military cargoes. Drive back to Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday: Fly to Rome and then to Ancona, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday: Ancona. Arrive at airport at 7 a.m. Board flight at 11 a.m. Arrive in 
Sarajevo at 1 p.m.

WORLD VIEW; MORE FACES AT U.N. TABLE?; SECURITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO GROW, MOST 
AGREE -- AND NATIONS ARE LOBBYING FIERCELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped create the United Nations, he 
envisioned a Security Council with "five policemen" defending the world against 
aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly did not see Germany or Japan among the policemen. Far from 
candidates for police recruitment, they were the enemy states of World War II, 
and the Security Council was supposed to beat them down should they ever try to 
cause trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as the United Nations approaches its 50th anniversary, there is a 
mood for reform, and many members, including the United States, agree that 
Germany and Japan should finally take a place alongside the Big Five -- the 
United States, Russia, Britain, France and China -- as permanent members of the 
Security Council, the international organization's most powerful and 
significant arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite the general agreement, change may not come for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. member nations so far cannot decide whether to enlarge the council by 
designating other permanent members. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if that decision is made, there remains the question of which nations to 
choose, and whether any would have the veto powers of the Big Five. Approval of 
Germany and Japan may be withheld until other nations are chosen in the 
bargaining for a package deal. An amendment to the U.N. Charter requires 
approval by two-thirds of the General Assembly but can be killed by any member 
of the Big Five, each of which has veto power. Lobbying is now rampant, and 
suitors are tugging diplomats one way and another. 
</P>
<P>
 India, Nigeria and Brazil -- because of their large populations -- strike some 
as logical choices for an enlarged council. 
</P>
<P>
 But rival contenders -- Pakistan, Indonesia, South Africa, Egypt, Argentina 
and Mexico -- do not like the idea of being pushed aside. Nor does Italy, the 
third member of the World War II Axis powers, like the idea of giving way for 
Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan has warned the United Nations against "creating new centers of 
privilege" while trying to fix the problem of an inequitable Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer the discussion goes on, the more the blood heats up," a senior 
British official said. "But the question is not Germany and Japan. The rejected 
ones are the problem. Their intention is to avoid adding the extra permanent 
members because they won't be part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it will be likely settled in 1996 or 1997. It's not easy to put it off." 
</P>
<P>
 More pessimistic analysts, however, predict no realignments will be made until 
the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some kind of reform of the Security Council seems inevitable. Looking to 
the 50th anniversary, which will be celebrated next October, U.N. diplomats 
started the process a couple of years ago, setting up a special committee on 
revamping the Security Council and asking every government to submit proposals 
to it. The committee has sifted through mounds of paper but is far from ready 
to reveal its recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council, which has the authority to order military action against 
a government that is threatening international peace and security, is now made 
up of the Big Five plus 10 other countries that serve for two-year terms. The 
10 now are Brazil, Spain, Pakistan, Djibouti and New Zealand (whose terms 
expire at the end of this year) and Nigeria, Oman, Rwanda, the Czech Republic 
and Argentina (whose terms expire at the end of 1995). 
</P>
<P>
 For the 179 members of the United Nations who are not one of the Big Five, 
winning a stint on the Security Council is a meaningful moment in their 
national histories. 
</P>
<P>
 Depression descends upon ambassadors of non-permanent members once their terms 
are up. They are forced once again to devote most of their time and energy to 
U.N. bodies such as the General Assembly that talk a lot but produce very 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even to have served means membership in a select group. Eighty countries 
have never served on the Security Council. And 44 have been elected to only one 
two-year term in the last 49 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy has provoked a good deal of discussion with a plan that would keep Japan 
and Germany from a permanent seat. Italy's per-capita gross domestic product, a 
measure of national wealth, is greater than that of three permanent members -- 
Britain, Russia and China -- and the Italians see no reason for Japan and 
Germany to join the charmed circle if they cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, in fact, fears that Germany and Japan may scavenge enough votes for 
permanent seats on the council and then somehow kill the chances for anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 An Italian diplomat, sure that the Germans and Japanese were wooing the Third 
World, said: "They need 108 votes to get a resolution accepted, and we fear 
that they will present it (the resolution) out of the blue as soon as they 
realize they have enough votes. We are therefore lobbying with those countries 
too to get votes against Germany and Japan and stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Italians have devised a complicated proposal that they 
hope will satisfy everyone. Under the Italian plan, the Security Council would 
have three categories of members: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Big Five that now have the veto: the United States, Russia, China, 
Britain and France. 
</P>
<P>
 * A pool of 20 rich or large or populous or militarily efficient or culturally 
significant countries that would rotate every two years into 10 semi-permanent 
seats. None would have a veto. Italy does not name the 20, but Italy, Japan, 
Germany, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Nigeria, Egypt, South Africa, Brazil, 
Mexico, Argentina and Canada would surely be included. 
</P>
<P>
 * Five to 10 more non-permanent members elected from the remaining 159 other 
countries for two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian proposal, however, is cumbersome and so far has attracted little 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Italian ambassador is very active," a British diplomat said, "but it is 
not enough. To create a third category of members is just a silly way to walk 
around the problem, and it can jeopardize the effectiveness of the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and Germany intend to go on the Security Council with somewhat different 
commitments than those set down in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 As originally conceived, the permanent members of the Security Council had a 
special obligation to use their armed forces to put down aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Japan, though willing to let troops serve as U.N. peacekeepers, does not 
allow the use of force by its soldiers in a U.N. military operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, Germany could send its troops into combat for the United Nations, 
but it has never done so in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono insists that a lack of commitment to 
deploy armed forces should not disqualify his country in a modern United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today the international community expects the U.N. to play all sorts of roles 
-- in peace and security, disarmament, diseases, non-proliferation, 
development, et cetera, et cetera," Kono said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, noting that the Big Five are all nuclear powers, Kono said: "It is 
important to have the countries that are non-nuclear states on the Security 
Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kono did not bring it up, there are strong pressures, especially from 
the United States, for Japan and Germany to pay a larger share of the U.N. 
budget, and the two economic powers are unlikely to do so unless they see a 
seat on the Security Council in their future. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first proposals to enlarge the council emerged in 1992, the George 
Bush Administration was lukewarm, fearing a weakening of the U.N. body that had 
proved so vital to Western interests during the Persian Gulf War of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration has changed that policy. Deputy Ambassador Karl 
F. Inderfurth told the General Assembly in mid-October that "we 
enthusiastically endorse Japan and Germany for permanent membership." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration would also add three more non-permanent seats, 
bringing the total on the council to 20 -- a Big Seven (the current five plus 
Germany and Japan) with veto power, plus 13 non-permanent members elected for 
two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Inderfurth also endorsed a popular proposal that would allow non-permanent 
members to run for reelection to the council. They now must step down after a 
two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 This proposal is a sop to countries such as Nigeria, Brazil and Italy, which 
presumably have enough clout to whip up support for reelection, but the idea 
would surely not satisfy their desire for a permanent seat. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous other proposals. Many Third World countries believe that 
the Security Council should be expanded whether or not permanent members are 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe that the current membership of the Security Council is weighted 
in favor of Europe and that the poorer countries of the world merit more 
representation. The world has changed, and the United Nations should recognize 
this. For example, Africa provides 52 members of the United Nations, nearly 30% 
of the total, but now has two seats on the Security Council, less than 15% of 
the seats there. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1966, when the Security Council was expanded from 11 to 15 members, the 
10 non-permanent seats have been allotted according to a set formula: five from 
Africa and Asia, two from Latin America, one from Eastern Europe and two from 
Western Europe and the industrialized British Commonwealth countries. Some 
Third World countries want to expand the non-permanent seats to 16 and allot 
them this way: five from Africa, four from Asia, three from Latin America, two 
from Western Europe and the industrialized Commonwealth, one from Eastern 
Europe, and one to alternate from different regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain and several other countries have warned the United Nations against 
doing anything that might diminish the effectiveness of the Security Council. 
Others have warned of opening a Pandora's box by changing its makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 But Third World governments look on arguments like these as a smoke screen to 
hide privilege. Britain is a permanent member of the Security Council not 
because of its size or power or wealth but because of its history as a victor 
of World War II. Adding Japan and Germany and others would diminish British 
importance in the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, both Britain and France were hostile at first to any change. "The 
Americans," British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said earlier this year, 
"have a saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' And I think there is 
something to be said for that." 
</P>
<P>
 But both Britain and France, perhaps facing the inevitable, have changed their 
policy and now support adding Japan, Germany and perhaps a few others. 
</P>
<P>
 American conservatives oppose enlarging the Security Council because, as the 
Heritage Foundation put it in a recent report, "adding more countries . . . 
will dilute American influence." 
</P>
<P>
 The report added that, since some of the new Third World members could 
represent dictatorships, "an expanded Security Council will be more likely to 
oppose American values and interests." 
</P>
<P>
 But this did not dissuade the Clinton Administration from pushing ahead. In 
his speech to the General Assembly, U.S. Deputy Ambassador Inderfurth noted 
that some governments are urging a delay in enlarging the Security Council 
because the world is so unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the United States," Inderfurth said, "this is a false choice. The case to 
strengthen the council is compelling precisely because of the mounting tumult 
of the post-Cold War world and dangers it poses for all of us, not 10 years 
from now, but today." 
</P>

 Times researcher Paolo Mastrolilli contributed to this article. The Italian 
Plan 
</P>
<P>
 Italy has devised a complex plan for the U.N. Security Council that seems to 
satisfy many concerns -- except perhaps efficiency. It would keep the council's 
five permanent members plus five or 10 non-permanent members. But it would add 
10 semi-permanent members, without veto power, drawn from a pool of 20 nations. 
Likely candidates would be Germany, Japan, Italy, Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, 
Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Australia, Czech 
Republic, Sweden, South Korea, Jamaica, Costa Rica and Bangladesh. The council 
would then total 20 or 25 -- representative but be cumbersome. New Place 
Settings? 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council -- five permanent members plus 10 rotating members 
-- reflects its World War II origins. The Big Five (top), which hold veto 
power, were Allies in that war. Under one proposal (bottom), the former Axis 
powers of Japan and Germany would also become permanent members, along with 
three populous Third World nations -- most likely Brazil, India and Nigeria. 
There would be no change in the 10 non-permanent members, which serve two-year 
terms. The question of expanding veto powers is being debated.

THE WEEK AHEAD: BERLIN; A WREATH AT THE WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Commemorating the fifth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 140 
Americans will lay a wreath Wednesday to honor Germans shot while trying to 
cross the old divide, then hold a candlelight march from the eastern half of 
the city to the west. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, organized by the Citizen Ambassador Program of People to People 
International, from Spokane, Wash., will follow a day of workshops on efforts 
to unite the people of eastern and western Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The American organization has invited Germans to participate and has the 
blessing of Berlin City Hall, says program spokeswoman Barbara Schulte. But she 
added: "We wish thousands of Germans would participate, but I don't think so. 
Berliners don't like a memorial to that date. The wall is still in their 
heads."

POSTSCRIPT; LOVER'S SECRET PAST SEEN AS KEY TO PEACE ACTIVIST'S VIOLENT END; A 
NEW BIOGRAPHY OF GREENS FOUNDER PETRA KELLY RULES OUT THE 'DOUBLE SUICIDE' 
THEORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Petra Kelly died in bed beside an open book -- "Letters from Goethe to 
Charlotte von Stein" -- at the hand of her lover and co-founder of the German 
Greens Party, Gert Bastian. She was asleep when Bastian shot her in the head at 
point-blank range before killing himself on the stairway outside the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a violent death for one of the world's best known peace activists, 
murdered by a 69-year-old retired NATO general known for his gentleness, was so 
astonishing that some devotees still refuse to believe it two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, accept it, friend and fellow activist Sara Parkin writes in "The Life 
and Death of Petra Kelly" (Pandora, London), which is appearing in bookstores 
just as the Greens have made a comeback in Germany's Parliament with Kelly's 
notable absence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not only the powder burns on Bastian's hand that led police to discount 
the possibility of a third person as the killer, Parkin says. Kelly's bedroom 
walls were covered with an unbroken pattern of bloodstains, evidence that no 
third person could have been in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Police at first termed the Oct. 1, 1992, deaths a "double suicide," as if the 
two had had some sort of pact. There was never any evidence to support such a 
theory, however, and virtually everyone who knew Kelly ruled out that she would 
have chosen to die.  
</P>
<P>
 "Furthermore," Parkin writes of her activist, media-conscious friend, "even by 
the most remote of possibilities that Petra should have wanted to end her life, 
we knew she would not dream of doing so without sending us all (and the press) 
a fax." 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, did Bastian kill the woman he loved, from whom he was inseparable 
to the point that people said their names as one: PetrandGert? 
</P>
<P>
 Parkin, a former leader of the British Green Party, tries like several German 
authors before her to answer this question. She has her theories after a year 
of examining Kelly's life and death, but they remain just that. Bastian also 
left no telling faxes, letters or suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
 The world knew Kelly as a feisty and tireless campaigner for peace and 
environmental issues. She was the feminist face of Germany's anti-nuclear 
movement in the 1980s and of the "anti-party" Greens Party, which spearheaded 
Europe's most powerful environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Less well known was that, when Kelly died at 44, she and Bastian were so 
estranged from the Greens that their bodies lay three weeks in their Bonn home 
before anyone noticed the two were missing. Many of Kelly's colleagues had 
grown tired of her stardom -- her waifish looks and perfect, biting English 
made her a media darling. She was disorganized and difficult to work with -- a 
driven activist. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, perhaps, was that Kelly held to the notion of a Greens 
anti-party that made no tactical alliances with Germany's traditional political 
parties. After losing all their parliamentary seats in the 1990 elections, most 
Greens wanted to become a mature political party that could share in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Those pragmatists control the party now and led it to success in the Oct. 16 
federal election, where the Greens won 7% of the vote and were returned to the 
Bundestag as the third largest party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greens today do not have a figure as attractively strong as Kelly appeared 
to be. Parkin had been drawn to Kelly's charisma, but in researching her book, 
she discovered a bird-like woman who, at the end of her life, had become such 
an Angst- ridden wreck that she could scarcely venture out of her nest without 
the support of Bastian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Petra was a fairly anxious person," Parkin said in a telephone 
interview from her home in France. "But I didn't realize she was clinically 
anxious, that she had an anxiety neurosis. And I didn't realize the extent to 
which it handicapped her. Gert Bastian in many ways masked that. He did 
everything. . . . I also don't think people realized he was dependent on her." 
</P>
<P>
 Bastian resigned his NATO post in 1980 to protest a decision to put 
first-strike nuclear weapons in Germany and joined the Greens movement, where 
he met Kelly. In 1983, the two were part of the Greens' first delegation to 
enter the Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the married Bastian had given up his parliamentary seat and any life of 
his own to become Kelly's aide de camp -- her manager and bag carrier living 
almost full time in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastian complained to friends of his chaotic life with Kelly, but both had 
said repeatedly that they could not live without each other. And friends 
believed them. 
</P>
<P>
 The dependence alone did not seem to be reason enough to kill Kelly. So what 
was it?  
</P>
<P>
 Parkin says that no one really got to know the quiet Bastian who lived in 
Kelly's shadow and, Parkin now believes, suffered tremendously from experiences 
he kept secret. Bastian had been a soldier on the Russian Front in World War II 
but always denied he knew anything about the Third Reich's atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian Front was where the Final Solution began," Parkin pointed out. 
"Millions died. . . . the special units were put in to round up the Jews and 
gypsies. Now, an ambitious, rapidly promoted, decorated officer can't say he 
didn't know. And he did say that. He said, 'I was lucky.' And I just don't 
believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Parkin believes that the principled Kelly represented salvation for Bastian, a 
kind of redemption for his sins. And she strongly suspects that Bastian feared 
losing Kelly over another secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastian also denied that he ever had had any contact with the former East 
German security police. Investigators looking into his and Kelly's deaths 
determined there was nothing in his Stasi file. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer believes that Bastian's denials don't ring true. While she has no 
reason to believe that he was a major spy, she writes: "It is improbable the 
Stasi would have been allowed to overlook a NATO general openly expressing 
doubts about Western European security policy." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Kelly's death, the Greens were pushing for access to their 
Stasi files. On the morning that he murdered Kelly, in fact, Bastian had 
returned a telephone call from a Greens colleague who informed him that party 
members' files would soon be opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police definition of what was significant might be quite different than 
Petra's definition. A minor event in the 1970s that he had lied about would 
have been in her mind a gross betrayal," Parkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public may never know. Bastian's wife reportedly has decided not to open 
his file. More on Kelly

PROFILE; A LIFE OF CONTROVERSY; OPPONENT OF NAZIS, MCCARTHY AND EAST GERMAN 
REGIME GETS READY TO SHAKE UP THE GERMAN PARLIAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 81, Stefan Heym has led a life of confrontation, with enough intellectual 
hairpin turns, moral standoffs and brushes with the law to be the stuff of an 
old-time picaresque novel -- and not a very believable one at that. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the onetime best-selling American novelist was elected to the 
German Bundestag, and as the oldest member will be the "president by 
seniority," formally the most honored member of the lower house of Parliament 
and the one whose opening speech on Thursday will set the moral tone for the 
next four years of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Heym, a German-born Jew who fled the Nazis in 1933, is a reluctant 
politician -- "writers are always called upon to support causes and to be the 
key figures that we do not want to be," he lamented in 1990 -- and indeed, a 
reluctant German, who confessed in his 1988 memoirs that after tasting the Nazi 
horror of the 1930s he never wanted to live in his mother country again. 
</P>
<P>
 American book lovers will remember Heym as the author of such erstwhile 
favorites as " The Crusaders," a World War II novel that drew on his 
experiences as a U.S. Army propagandist -- he waded onto the Normandy beaches 
with his typewriter in 1944, a few days after D-Day -- and that in its own time 
was likened to Norman Mailer's more enduring "The Naked and the Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the early 1950s, Heym had renounced his place in the American book 
world, giving up not only his U.S. audience but also his U.S. citizenship, and 
making a new home for himself in the intellectually stifling climate of the 
German Democratic Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 His defection ought to have been a major propaganda coup for East Germany, but 
instead of cultivating him, the Communist regime banned all but two of his 
books, recruited his own cleaning woman to spy on him, froze his bank account, 
kicked him out of the perk-dispensing East German Writers' Union and 
eventually, in response to his attempts to publish in West Germany, wrote a 
special paragraph that placed his activities into its penal code. The laughably 
open-ended "Lex Heym" made it a crime to communicate abroad any information 
damaging to East Germany, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet the more the state harassed Heym, the more committed a socialist he 
declared himself to be. He remained convinced that East Germany could somehow 
be reformed, and he chose to stay there even when opportunities to flee West 
presented themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, in his latest caper, Heym ran for Parliament on the ticket of the 
reconstituted East German Communist Party -- the successor to the very outfit 
that once banned his books and spied on him and is now reorganized and renamed 
the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). 
</P>
<P>
 All of which could make for fireworks Thursday when he opens the new 
parliamentary session. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Germans believe that the hard-line left died a richly deserved death in 
1989, when the Berlin Wall fell, and are appalled that a socialist fossil like 
Heym should turn up in the Bundestag at all -- let alone have the top 
opening-day honors and national platform that he will enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been rumors here that some parliamentarians, mainstreamers who have 
heckled the PDS mercilessly since its founding in 1990, will either walk out 
when Heym opens his mouth, ignore him or shout him down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will speak to my colleagues in Parliament in a way that makes them feel 
that I am someone who wants to cooperate with them," Heym said reassuringly, 
adding mischievously that he intends to invoke the spirit of Clara Zetkin, a 
leading Weimar-era Communist, in his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Zetkin, who at 85 was the Parliament's "president by seniority" in 1932, gave 
a firebrand Opening Day speech that called for the creation of a Soviet Germany 
and rattled her fellow deputies so badly that they turned around and elected 
the rising Nazi Hermann Goering their parliamentary president in the very same 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 Such sheer cussedness turns off many Germans. "Never has so much been said and 
written about a political aspirant who has so little to contribute," complained 
the German writer and essayist Henryk Broder, who liked Heym better when he was 
picking fights with the East German dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Heym's uncompromising spirit has impressed many in his East Berlin 
constituency -- the economically poor but culturally rich Prenzlauerberg and 
Mitte districts. 
</P>
<P>
 People there, mindful of the high unemployment and relatively low wages in 
their side of the country, have been deeply disappointed until now with the way 
German unification has turned out. They believe that, second-class citizens in 
their own country, they need a tough representative in the Bundestag to fight 
for the interests of the former East. 
</P>
<P>
 And over his 81 years, Heym has shown that he is nothing if not a fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Helmut Flieg in the eastern German town of Chemnitz in 1913, Heym ran 
afoul of the Nazis at 18, when he published a poem scorning Germany's decision 
to send advisers to the Kuomintang army in China. He was kicked out of school 
and blacklisted, and eventually went into exile when the Nazis -- who wanted to 
arrest him -- couldn't find him and took his father hostage instead. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled to Prague, sending home an all's-well cable signed with what would 
become his nom de plume, Stefan Heym. Later, he moved to the United States, 
took a job in a print shop and set to work writing his first novel in English, 
"Hostages." 
</P>
<P>
 The book, a psychological murder mystery set in Nazi-occupied Prague, brought 
Heym instant celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount bought the rights and made "Hostages" into a motion picture. But 
then the Army drafted Heym and sent him back to Europe, putting him to work 
writing propaganda leaflets and radio scripts calling on German soldiers to 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Heym's leaflets is, in fact, credited with bringing about the fall of a 
well-equipped German garrison on an island off Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Heym said that when his homeland was liberated he felt a tremendous surge of 
hope for the world -- but his next novel, the best-seller "The Crusaders," 
suggests that his hopes soon turned to bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in wartime Europe, "The Crusaders" depicts not only the evils of National 
Socialism but also the corruption and pettiness within the U.S. military and 
even the decay of America's founding, democratic ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 Heym's disappointment with America grew during the McCarthy years, when he 
began to fear that the anti-democratic tendencies he had witnessed in Germany 
in the early 1930s were building in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife was a member of the U.S. Communist Party. He himself had recently 
written a novel favoring the 1948 ascent of communism in Czechoslovakia. He 
figured that it was only a matter of time before he was publicly vilified, so 
he left America in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not choose to go to East Germany, but bounced visa-less and homeless 
around Europe until finally the German Democratic Republic agreed to let him 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 But he almost immediately wore out his welcome, writing novels -- banned in 
the East but acclaimed in the West -- on such themes as freedom, truth and the 
clash between power and individual integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 By November, 1989, when more than half a million East Germans took to the 
streets of East Berlin to demand reform, Heym had become one of his country's 
most respected dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends! Fellow citizens! Take charge!" he told a cheering East Berlin crowd 
just days before the Berlin Wall was opened, urging listeners to achieve 
"socialism, not the Stalinist type, but the authentic type that we want to 
build at last." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the middle of the following year, most East Germans had made it 
eminently clear that what they really wanted was not so much as to build 
authentic socialism as to go shopping with their new hard currency in the 
well-stocked West German department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, it seemed as if the aging perennial survivor had suffered one 
disappointment too many. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Great Change, Heym lost not only his privileges, but also the very 
ground underneath his feet," Broder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Visitors who strayed to his house in (the eastern Berlin district of) Gruenau 
told of seeing a tired, old man suffering from a sense of meaninglessness." 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the PDS offer that he run for the Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 Heym's critics said he went into parliamentary politics at 81 not because he 
has anything useful to offer, but mainly to amuse. Indeed, Heym hasn't joined 
the party that helped him to his electoral victory, and has had little to say 
so far about what exactly he hopes to accomplish in the Bundestag. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why must a person always have programs?" he asked. "Why can't I just take 
things as they come, and make decisions based on my long experience as a writer 
and a political person? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why must I decide beforehand what I think about this and that? I cannot, and 
I will not do that. It would be so boring. You can expect surprises from me."

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; A NEW MOOD IN MEDELLIN; VIOLENT CITY IS LEARNING TO LIVE 
MORE PEACEFULLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Albeiro Espinosa spent more than two years in a trance killing people in 
Medellin. 
</P>
<P>
 He shot them from bicycles, motorcycles and cars. He killed them as a gang 
member and hired assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blind," he recalls, "on cocaine, pills or marijuana, without thought 
or compassion. We would kill one, two, three, four people and then realize the 
next day what we had done. Then we would keep killing, because we knew someone 
was going to come for revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Espinosa, 26, is in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the waist down, the 
survivor of four assassination attempts. His brother and sister have been 
killed. And 110 "friends" from his neighborhood are dead, warriors and victims 
of bloody street battles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Espinosa is no longer involved in drugs or violence. He talks about a 
course in human values that he is taking, and about his job selling clothes. He 
talks about his need for a good wheelchair and about peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa, like the city where he learned to "kill or be killed," is learning 
to live again. 
</P>
<P>
 Medellin, Colombia's industrial center with a population of about 1.6 million 
and 6,892 homicides last year, is one of the world's most violent cities. It is 
the birthplace of slain drug kingpin Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cocaine 
cartel, the home of hundreds of former assassins who killed judges, police and 
presidential candidates for drug traffickers in the 1980s and early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, it is also the site of an extraordinary movement of recovery. Since 
the death of Escobar in a rooftop shootout with police nearly a year ago, 
hundreds of people involved in violence in the city have stepped forward to 
make peace. 
</P>
<P>
 About 650 members of militias -- illegal vigilante groups that cropped up in 
poor areas to combat drug trafficking and crime -- signed agreements in May to 
stop terrorizing their neighborhoods. Many are now cooperating with police as 
neighborhood watchmen and clean-up crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Former assassins are participating in vocational training and psychological 
group-therapy programs. Former gang members are building wells, parks and 
nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still violent men and boys in Medellin, some still working the drug 
trade, others involved in radical political movements. But many sections of the 
city have changed sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 In Barrio Antioquia, two years of gang warfare claimed the lives of 220 people 
between the ages of 12 and 16. Then two of the most violent gangs celebrated a 
peace pact with rum and a pig roast. Local merchants chipped in to help the 
gang members buy food, clothes and medicines. The city government offered free 
medical service and jobs. The constant shootouts, which had made the 
neighborhood impassable, are now gone, replaced with concerns about work, study 
and the refurbishing of the local sports park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many people working in non-governmental organizations in the 
barrios, or trying to help people there to start up family businesses," said 
Jorge Mario Aristizabal, a businessman whose construction firm, Conconcreto, is 
subsidizing tuition and transport for former gang members who want to go back 
to school. "There is a strong awareness that we have a serious social problem 
and that we must help find a solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristizabal traces the crisis back to the early 1980s, when drug trafficking 
arrived in the poor neighborhoods of Medellin. It was an era when a 
15-year-old, modeling himself on Escobar, could make $1,000 for an 
assassination and buy his shoes, his motorcycle and his respect. Many young 
people preferred the easy money of drug trafficking and violence to the low 
salaries of legitimate work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Medellin's problems also have deeper roots. Between 1951 and 1973, peasant 
families fleeing political violence and poverty in the countryside invaded the 
hillsides around Medellin, tripling the city's size. The new arrivals, with 
their country ways, became the labor force of the richer people. They felt 
increasingly isolated, without opportunities for education or good jobs and 
their children became frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture that resulted was a mixture of the new and the old: the absolute 
willingness to kill to get ahead mixed with the cult of the Virgin Mary and 
dedication to the family matriarch. Today, hired assassins still flock to the 
sanctuary of the Virgin Maria Auxiliadora outside Medellin to pray. They offer 
watches, chains and money to the Virgin. They ask for good luck and well-being 
for their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two cities were created," Colombian journalist Antonio Morales Riveira wrote 
in his book "Censored File," "and in the upper floor were born the kids of 
today, the third generation of violence, whose reference points since birth 
have been bullets." 
</P>
<P>
 Faber, at 17, understands those references instinctively. He killed someone 
for the first time at age 12. Two members of a rival gang came gunning for him. 
He escaped, and the next day he returned shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that if I didn't kill them, they would kill me," he said."The best way 
of defending yourself in a poor neighborhood, even if you're not born violent, 
is by attacking." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Faber is learning to deal with people in nonviolent ways and is free 
from his steady diet of narcotics. He longs to become a therapist.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use drugs, I don't rob and I don't kill anymore," he said. "I 
consider myself a totally sober and positive person." 
</P>
<P>
 Faber credits his new life to a therapeutic community run by the Presencia 
Colombo Suiza, a non-governmental organization dedicated to helping young 
people from troubled backgrounds re-integrate into society. Sponsored by 
private Swiss donors and Colombian institutions, Colombo Suiza has become a 
psychological lifeline for about 1,600 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, members of the organization's 28-person team of sociologists, social 
workers and psychologists descend into the Villa Cafe barrio and La Iguana, a 
neighborhood of broken wooden houses and choked, dusty streets where daily 
shootouts once claimed many lives. The organization runs a nursery, a 
kindergarten and restaurant there. 
</P>
<P>
 The children it reaches find new lives at the group's two urban centers and 
farm. They find comfort in group discussions and psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be very withdrawn," said Alex Fernando Arango, 16, whose father was 
forced into a car by a group of men and executed five years ago. "Now I 
participate in the community. I help to organize youth groups, theater and 
dances." 
</P>
<P>
 But 15 years of drug trafficking and violence have not been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug trafficking, always Medellin's worst plague, continues to thrive. Many 
former Medellin cartel members are now working with the less violent Cali 
cartel, authorities say, and many traffickers continue to operate 
drug-processing laboratories near the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the official cessation of hostilities, more than 40 of the 650 militia 
members who signed peace agreements with the government in May have been slain 
since then by unknown assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say Medellin will have to create employment and educational opportunities 
for the poor if things are to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Guillermo Sepulveda, a peace adviser to Medellin's mayor, emphasized the 
importance of understanding and social justice in closing the gap between "the 
two cities," between those who feel part of the system and those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have passed laws mistakenly thinking that we are living in a society that 
is a product of consensus. . . ." he told a group of entrepreneurs at a seminar 
not far from Medellin's teeming, red-brick slums. "But those terms are 
relative. The concept of justice varies five minutes from here."

MEDIA; CHINA'S LATE-NIGHT RADIO PROGRAMS TELL IT LIKE IT IS; HOT TOPICS FOR 
CALL-IN SHOWS ARE SEX, PSYCHOLOGY AND CULTURAL CHANGES. 'POLITICS IS TOO 
COMPLICATED,' SAYS ONE HOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's nearly midnight, after curfew at Zhongshan University. The lights are 
out, but all through the dorms students are switching on their radios in the 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul's Wonderland is open again," intones a deep voice over rock music. "It's 
Thursday, and we're still alive." Tonight's topic on the most popular radio 
show in town is one of special interest to the students lying still in their 
beds: the worthlessness of a diploma in the anything-goes economy of this 
southern China boom town. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 11:30 they turn off the lights and power. You can't drink, you can't 
take a bath, you can't make love," says Banike Wong, a guest host. "But you can 
listen to the show. It's a kind of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Late-night radio shows with names such as "With You Till Dawn," "Night Date" 
and "The Night Is Not Lonely" have sprung up across China, giving people a 
chance to tell it like it is. After decades of not daring to voice an opinion 
lest it be held against them -- even resisting sleep for fear of blurting 
something incriminating while dreaming -- people are now staying up late for a 
chance to talk about subjects that were once taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 Open for discussion are topics ranging from how to make love to how to make 
money, psychological problems and growing up in a fast-food culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tend to talk about sex a lot," says Paul Lowe, the Chinese host whose 
English stage name has become a trademark. "Politics is too complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also banned. An official sits in the studio of the state-run station to 
monitor the phone calls, screening out unsanctioned topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talk about sensitive subjects, we don't even have a call-in line," 
says Wong, the guest host. "Homosexuality, for example, is too dangerous. 
Prostitution is too sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions of sexual technique are OK, but a show about living together 
before marriage brought an official reprimand from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But the talk jockeys know that it's not what you say, it's how. 
</P>
<P>
 "The topic of homosexuality is banned, but talking about movies is not," Lowe 
says. "So we talk about homosexual movies like 'Philadelphia' or 'The Wedding 
Banquet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe is no Howard Stern. His show is sentimental, not shocking. It's meant to 
provoke, not offend. 
</P>
<P>
 He got his start on the radio six years ago with a program that introduced 
Western pop hits, and it evolved into one of the country's first talk shows, 
with Lowe doing most of the talking. Between songs, he told stories of growing 
up during the Cultural Revolution and personal tales of love and life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has his story, but I think it is also important to tell mine. Some 
of the listeners are too young to remember the Cultural Revolution, and don't 
know why China is the way it is today," he says, referring to China's 1966-1976 
political turmoil. "These days, young people only think about which restaurant 
is best. When I was young, my only thought was how not to be hungry." 
</P>
<P>
 Exposing his own thoughts draws out others, he says, and creates an atmosphere 
more intimate than the average radio program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit mysterious. Girls can hear my voice, but can't see my 
face," he says. "I can be anything they imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings of "Paul's Wonderland" -- more than 70% of the listening audience 
-- show that he has captured more than a few imaginations. Lowe mentions that 
he is the highest-paid broadcaster in the province, perhaps the country. That 
brings him a degree of celebrity and the protection that goes with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young women in ankle-length slip dresses come into the cafe where they 
have heard Lowe is having dinner, and stand on their combat-booted toes to scan 
the crowd. They don't know what he looks like, but the 27-year-old with permed 
hair, a crisp white linen shirt and easy confidence stands out.  
</P>
<P>
 They spot him. "Paul! It's Paul!" they giggle, but are afraid to venture any 
closer. Wong smiles slyly, and points to his friend. "He is known as the Music 
God," he says. "He can do anything he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Lowe wants to push the limits a bit. His new project is an 
experiment in radio theater. Tomorrow's show is a thinly disguised political 
allegory called "Zooropa," using animals as characters, reminiscent of George 
Orwell's "Animal Farm." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very progressive, very sensitive," Paul says. "We'll see how it goes." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as Paul is progressive, Su Jingping, the director of a popular talk 
show in Beijing, is cerebral and cautious. Su would rather take calls than 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing our show is like playing with kites, not balloons," he says. "We hope 
to fly higher and higher, but with the strings still in our hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Su says that after he spent 13 years in the northern countryside during 
China's turbulent political campaigns in the 1960s and '70s, he came to the 
Beijing radio station with an idea: "One thing we learned is that people 
shouldn't believe propaganda in a simplistic way." He wanted to create a 
people's program where "everybody could say what they want to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The result: a hit call-in show called "Life Hotline." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy to get a line, though. The switchboard can handle 1,000 incoming 
calls at once, but overloads several times a night. Those who can't phone, 
write. From a thick stack, Su selects a letter from a woman who describes how 
the show was a comfort to her daughter while she was dying of cancer. After the 
girl died, her mother slipped the earphones back on her daughter's ears so she 
could still tune in from the next world. 
</P>
<P>
 "People relate to the show in a very important way," he says. "We talk about 
the things of everyday life: bitterness and happiness, love and hate, poverty 
and wealth."  
</P>
<P>
 But the most popular topic is sex. Su leafs through a blue leather-bound 
calendar and reads out the titles of the most popular shows: "Sexual 
abnormalities and crime." "The difference between pornography, science and 
art." "Is masturbation dangerous?" "How to talk to your kids about sex." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an argument about whether it is suitable to discuss such subjects on 
the program. So it's a kind of progress to be able to talk about masturbation," 
Su says. "In certain areas, sex is still a forbidden city." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every major city in China now has a similar program -- the talk shows 
provide a forum to vent spleen or get advice, and titillating entertainment for 
those who just listen. 
</P>
<P>
 They also serve as an anonymous gauge of what is considered acceptable in a 
fast-changing society, and a source of censure when things get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 A Guangzhou radio program called "Today's Hotline" carried a report of forced 
labor at a plant outside the city: Migrant workers were beaten, locked up and 
made to work without pay, it said. The radio station phoned a labor department 
official and had him listen to the indignant callers. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mr. Liu said the case exposed "slavery in the socialist society under the 
(Communist Party's) leadership," words that 10 years ago would have earned him 
his own stint at forced labor. A Mr. Peng said he knew of many similar cases 
throughout the region, and a Ms. Gu wouldn't let the official get off with his 
excuse of having too few supervisors to monitor the entire province. The show 
spurred authorities to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the commercial frontierland where they are based, Guangzhou shows are 
progressive. Beijing is intellectual, says Su, and the provinces are 
provincial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beijing people are fond of discussing theoretical problems in a macro way. 
Other programs in other provinces are just like medicine: You call with a 
problem and they give you a prescription," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 On "Life Hotline," a rotating panel of guest experts answers the more 
technical questions and offers on-air advice. Some are more in tune with 
callers' concerns than others -- one counselor caused a stir when he jumped off 
a Beijing bridge because of a failed romance. 
</P>
<P>
 He survived, and his ordeal sparked a three-day discussion about "the 
spiritual illness of modern Chinese." Now he's back on the program, not 
discredited, but more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call to talk to him especially," Su says. "He can relate more closely 
to their problems.

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; PREMIER'S ASSASSINS FIGHTING FOR FREEDOM; RUMORS ABOUND 
THAT BERNARD AND PHYLLIS COARD, WHOSE CRIME SPARKED GRENADA INVASION, MAY BE 
FREED EARLY FROM PRISON. BUT PUBLIC OPPOSITION IS STRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years after they were spared the hangman's noose, Bernard and Phyllis 
Coard languish in a prison fortress atop a hill overlooking the green slopes 
and sheltered harbors of this Caribbean island. 
</P>
<P>
 Former officials of the Grenadian government, the Coards were convicted of 
murdering Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and his followers in the bloody coup 
cited as one justification for the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the couple are fighting to gain their freedom, an unlikely prospect. 
The case lingers as a reminder of Grenada's tumultuous history at a time many 
on the island want to forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 The island is awash with rumors that the government of Prime Minister Nicholas 
Brathwaite is considering releasing the Coards, a move that does not seem to 
have much popular support. Bishop still enjoys a sort of cult-hero status among 
many Grenadians, who blame the Coards' treachery for derailing Grenada's 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I hear mention of (Bernard Coard's) name, my skin crawls," said 
Anthony Phillip, 44, a construction worker who returned to Grenada after the 
invasion. "If I see him, I would break him in two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved Maurice Bishop. He had a lot of good things in mind for his people. 
He tried. Maurice was not a Communist. Coard was a Communist." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip was one of about 100 people who turned out recently at a political 
rally for the New National Party, which governed briefly after the invasion. 
Grenada is scheduled to hold national elections by June, and politicians have 
already begun to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brathwaite plans to release the Coards, it seems unlikely he will do so 
before the election, since an unpopular action could hurt his National 
Democratic Congress party at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coards' cause is being championed by Ramsey Clark, the former U.S. 
attorney general, a quixotic champion of political causes. Clark argues that 
the Coards were set up as scapegoats by the Ronald Reagan Administration, which 
he says was bent on destroying a pro-Cuban leftist government on Grenada. What 
better way to justify the invasion than make it appear that the revolution had 
turned on itself? the American asks. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies that the People's Revolutionary Government, which came to power 
in a 1979 coup by overthrowing corrupt and heavy-handed Prime Minister Eric 
Gairy, was mired in a bitter internal struggle. Hard-liners in the Central 
Committee, such as Phyllis Coard, who had a reputation as the most fervent of 
the government's Marxists, and her husband Bernard, an ideologue who was 
finance minister, were fighting for greater control over the direction the 
government was taking. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 13, 1983, the hard-liners arrested Bishop and several members of his 
Cabinet and declared a 24-hour, shoot-to-kill curfew. On Oct. 19, crowds of 
Bishop supporters managed to free the prime minister, and they all marched to 
Ft. Rupert, on the edge of the capital city of St. George's, to challenge the 
Coard faction. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bishop and his group were overpowered. They were lined up against a wall 
of the fort's inner patio and shot to death: Bishop; Jacqueline Creft, his 
pregnant girlfriend and education minister; 14 other officials, and scores of 
civilian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days later, the U.S. armed forces invaded Grenada. Reagan cited the 
killings as proof that anarchy had seized the tiny island. The truth is the 
U.S. government had little use for Bishop either, but his demise lent a pretext 
to the invasion that would win the applause of many Grenadians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coards were arrested by the American invaders almost immediately and taken 
to a U.S. warship in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, the U.S.-installed government filed murder charges against 
the Coards and 17 others. Charges against one defendant were dropped when he 
agreed to turn state's evidence, and after numerous motions and delays the 
trial of 18 people got under way in April, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceedings were high theater, full of irregularities, and they dragged on 
interminably. One journalist covering the trial described it as a Mad Hatter's 
tea party. The defendants refused to recognize the jurisdiction of the court, 
complained that they were being mistreated in prison and were frequently 
removed from the courtroom after breaking into loud chants. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys quit en masse -- at the defendants' request, according 
to a 1987 report by Amnesty International. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 4, 1986, the Coards and 12 others were found guilty of murder and 
sentenced to hang. Three were found guilty of manslaughter, and one defendant 
was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, the multimillion-dollar, multiyear appeal process began, and this time 
the 14 defendants sentenced to death let their attorneys do their job. For 
months the defense team argued the law before a three-judge panel, which in 
July, 1991, upheld the convictions and sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports at the time said that five of the defendants, including Bernard Coard, 
were prepared for execution -- shaved, fitted for suits, their graves dug, the 
gallows built. But finally, Brathwaite commuted the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 A death sentence commuted to a life term is one thing. But freedom for the 
Coards? 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Clark asked that secret 
U.S. documents relating to the invasion be declassified. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark maintains that the documents might help bolster his contention that 
Coard and the Central Committee did not order the Bishop assassination. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an act of conciliation, these people should be released," Clark said in a 
telephone interview. "(The case) hangs over St. George's . . . like a pall." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the irregularities and oddities in the trial, U.S. officials in 
Washington hold up the Coard prosecution as an example of a functioning justice 
system in post-invasion Grenada, and the possibility of a release does not seem 
to have much appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Grenadian issue, but I don't think we'd like it," a U.S. official 
said. "They (the Coards) are criminals and they had due process." 
</P>
<P>
 More important, quite a few Grenadians have their doubts about releasing the 
Coards. 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing the convicted killers "would be extremely unpopular and their lives 
would be at risk," veteran Grenadian writer Alister Hughes said. 
"Reconciliation -- now? So soon? I don't think so. I don't think reconciliation 
would sink in too well now. Too many people lost their folks. . . . People are 
too bitter still. Maybe their grandchildren can forgive."

PHOTO ESSAY; GRAND INDIAN EPIC GOES UP IN FLAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who thinks gunpowder, vigorous swordplay and religious piety don't mix 
should consider the Dussehra festival. 
</P>
<P>
 This singular Hindu holiday, which carries a dramatized moral as easy to 
comprehend as a Hollywood oater where the bad guys all wear black Stetsons, is 
a re-enactment of one of the most famous of India's epics. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Christian Easter or the Jewish Passover, the holiday symbolizes the 
triumph of good and hope over evil. What's more, to the delight of children and 
adults alike, it makes its point with roaring flames and a crescendo of bangs. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening each October, as dusk falls across northern India, a large part of 
the population gathers in clearings or city parks. There, giant effigies of 
Ravana, the legendary 10-faced demon king of present-day Sri Lanka, have been 
erected. In many cases, the evil monarch is flanked by likenesses of his 
brother, Kumbhakarna, and son, Meghanada. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravana is the heavy in the Ramayana, the Hindu epic that legend says was 
composed about 500 B.C. In the story, which has parallels to Homer's Iliad, 
Ravana abducts Sita, virtuous wife of the brave and noble god-king Rama, and 
carries her off to his island. 
</P>
<P>
 Rama's servant Hanuman tracks down Ravana and his captive. The forces of Rama 
assemble and defeat the evildoers in a long and furious battle. When Ravana's 
heart is cleaved by Rama's magic, fiery arrow, the entire living world 
shudders, and the Earth quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ramayana is the stuff of collective Indian memory and remains so vividly 
contemporary that in December, 1992, a mob of Hindu activists razed a Muslim 
mosque in the town of Ayodhya that they believed had been built on the site of 
Rama's birth. For Hindu militants, the god-king's rule has come to symbolize a 
blissful time before Muslims and other foreigners arrived in India. 
</P>
<P>
 At a typical Dussehra festival, costumed warriors act out the great battle 
that pitted Rama against Ravana as Indians of all walks of life and faiths 
keenly follow the action. Then, the big moment arrives. One by one, the 
effigies are put to the torch. Each is consumed by fire and torn apart by 
thunderous bangs as the flames reach the gunpowder charges. The onlookers cheer 
wildly. 
</P>
<P>
 Order, peace and justice have been restored to the world. Until next October, 
and the next Dussehra festival.

A NEW COLLEGE COURSE; AS ENROLLMENTS SWELL, SCHOOLS TURN TO DISTANCE EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Meet Michael Forrest, modern-day professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest guides Coastline Community College students through earth science 
subjects, such as glaciers and earthquakes. If you're taking his weekly night 
course, feel free to ask him questions -- but if you want to leave an apple on 
his desk, you've got to drive about 30 miles to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 He teaches at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson, and his lectures are piped 
to a huge video screen in the Coastline classroom. Coastline students can see 
Forrest crack jokes, courtesy of a maze of hidden telephone lines, and Forrest 
can see the students on his own screen as they talk to him over a microphone.  
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of a growing movement called distance education, in which 
students take classes on or off campus with television, video, telephone, fax 
and computer tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Televised courses have reached adult students since the 1970s. But now quickly 
improving telecommunications technology and the so-called information 
superhighway make distance education a practice that has budget-challenged 
university leaders pondering its possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is, in fact, a revolution in the delivery of education," Coastline 
President Leslie Purdy said.  
</P>
<P>
 Distance education is rapidly evolving at a time when California will soon be 
faced with a higher education dilemma: too many students for too few classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The California State University system expects 150,000 to 300,000 more 
students in the next decade. Planners would have to build 10 Cal State 
Fullertons to teach them, an improbable feat during tight-budget times.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford new classrooms, let alone new campuses," said Ralph Mills, 
research and development director of the CSU Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators are trying electronic teaching techniques to accommodate some of the 
influx. But even people thrilled about the potential of electronic revolution 
wonder about the unknown consequences of such teaching, and doubt it will be a 
magic bullet for higher education problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to get on top of it or it could be out of control," 
Pepperdine University President David Davenport said. "It could be very 
sterile, and you'd just be in a classroom looking at a screen. Why pay $20,000 
to look at a screen?"  
</P>
<P>
 Some teachers and other campus employees fear that courses by video and 
computer will mushroom without thought to how they will change traditional 
college life -- not to mention how they will increase faculty workload and 
alter the way colleges determine how productive teachers are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the instructors I've talked to about this are very much concerned 
with the lack of personal relationships that students will see," said Bob 
Simpson, a math instructor at Fullerton College. "That's one of the most 
important parts about going to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Christensen, 26, an Irvine Valley College student, said he would rather 
learn from a teacher in person than on a screen. But he sees possibilities. "If 
you could have access to great professors (on video), and could interact with 
them, that would be good," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Lewis, UC Irvine's director of student activities, added: "I hope people 
realize this electronic thing has some real pluses, but it could have minuses 
too if it doesn't pay attention to the human side of college." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Educators cite a number of reasons to try distance education: reaching 
disabled students, reducing commuting to campuses, letting students direct 
their own learning, giving students a way to escape crowded lecture classes, 
allowing students to take courses that are scheduled for the same time by 
attending one and seeing the other later on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Projects now underway in the CSU, University of California and community 
college systems open a window to what college students may see in the 21st 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Take John Witherspoon's class, for instance. Witherspoon, professor emeritus 
of telecommunication at San Diego State University, saw students in his 
"Technological Trends in Telecommunication" course in person twice the whole 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Witherspoon videotaped the course so students could watch at their 
convenience. Students used computers to communicate with each other, 
Witherspoon and a telecommunications expert in Britain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witherspoon typed assigned questions during "computer conferences" -- open 
meeting halls in cyberspace in which students see the questions appear on 
computers at home or in a lab. Students type answers and debate other students 
electronically. "It became like a seminar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The class fit the changing schedules of many CSU college students, who often 
work long hours and have families, Witherspoon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a post-class survey, 60% of his students said they got more personalized 
attention from the instructor than in a traditional class. But the survey also 
showed a trade-off: 60% of students also said they preferred to talk to a 
professor in person, not over a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 CSU officials are pushing ahead with other efforts throughout 22 campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An advertisement in an academic newspaper proclaims that Cal Poly San Luis 
Obispo is "Building (a) 'Virtual University' to Reach More Students." Students 
can avoid getting swamped by a crowded survey architecture course by using 
detailed multimedia materials instead, the advertisement reads. Lecture clips, 
graphics and full-motion video come up on a screen with the click of a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Systemwide, CSU's most well-known initiative, $4-million Project DELTA, will 
examine how technology will change teaching and administration.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the project: 
</P>
<P>
 * Campuses put art and biology teaching materials on-line for access by others 
in the CSU system.  
</P>
<P>
 * Students can get a degree in business administration by taking courses from 
several CSU campuses electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning college-level courses are offered by video to high school students 
in remote California towns, enabling students to take advanced courses as soon 
as they get to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Threlkeld, director of Cal Poly Pomona's Distance Learning Center, said 
his campus is developing packaged course work in hotel management for 
distribution in Mexico, Taiwan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get a piece of the tuition out of it all," Threlkeld said. "We're 
seeing ourselves as sort of being (filmmaker) George Lucas. We'll produce the 
packages available anywhere, anytime, and at a high-quality level." 
</P>
<P>
 Threlkeld said he subscribes to the "export your best, import the rest" theory 
of higher education, in which campuses develop areas of strength and use 
distance education to offer students classes in other subjects.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are nostalgically leaving the craft and art period of higher 
education," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Research-oriented University of California has also joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI graduate business students living in San Diego talk to teachers' 
assistants in Irvine through video-conference rooms. Such rooms also enable 30 
students in Irvine and three students at UC Riverside to take a graduate 
philosophy course from one professor this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point it's certainly not cost-effective," said Bill Nail, UCI 
director of media services, but cost savings may result when larger numbers of 
students become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The UC system may soon share professors of small departments among campuses by 
video-conferences, he said, which could eliminate the need to have the same 
classes on every campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking at offering 17th-Century metaphysics (by video-conference) 
for example," Nail said. "How many experts in that area does the UC really 
need?" 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening added: "Sharing among campuses is a trend. 
It's emerging, but a trend." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent UC task force also suggested that offering courses by 
video-conference between campuses will fill gaps in instruction wreaked by 
three rounds of early faculty retirements. Nearly 2,000 instructors have 
retired early from nine UC campuses since 1990, depleting various departments.  
</P>
<P>
 Alan Hoffer, director of UCI's education department, said the campus is 
working with the Institute of Multimedia in Chiba, Japan, to offer UCI students 
Japanese language and culture resources electronically. The first classes are 
likely next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffer is excited about the technology's potential, but "we don't want to make 
this into a system of robots," he cautioned. "There is still personal contact 
that's needed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Information and Computer Science Department Chairman Tim Standish heads a UCI 
committee to look at how that campus will develop and invest in education 
technology. Standish said computers, fiber-optics and telecommunications 
breakthroughs are happening so quickly, it is tough to predict which electronic 
tools will be worth buying in the long run and which ones will enrich students' 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "You only want to (spend money on computers) if it gives you a good advantage 
and keeps repaying the investment," Standish said. "We're trying to find out 
when the use of computers advance pedagogy."  
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said distance education works well with adult students, but probably 
won't make it easier to squeeze many extra students into UC schools. However, 
it can enhance teaching for traditional college-age students on a limited 
basis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional college-age students "don't want anybody else but human beings to 
deal with," Wilkening said. "They know computers don't write letters of 
recommendation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students fear they will pay escalating fees and spend fewer hours with 
faculty members in the computer age. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to focus on the state's priorities and restore adequate funding (to 
education) instead of using a technology that hasn't been proven to perform the 
task as well as traditional methods," said Scott Lay of Placentia, a UC Davis 
student interviewed by electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening predicts a gradual change in store for the tools of teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know that we will end up being a 'virtual university,' " Wilkening 
said. "But imagine recording the lectures of our eminent professors. We should 
be taping our great minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Private universities also are experimenting with distance education. Concordia 
University plans to link its Irvine campus with the other nine Concordia 
campuses nationwide by video-conference. Pepperdine, like several other 
universities, put library journals and texts on-line so that students can read 
them by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 And among California community colleges, which have been experimenting with 
distance education techniques for two decades, Coastline is in the vanguard of 
cooperating with state universities to offer more courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Arrieta, a student in Forrest's "Natural Processes" class, said the Cal 
State Dominguez Hills night course offered through Coastline is convenient 
because he works in Costa Mesa and lives in Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first class this way, and it took a while to get used to it," 
Arrieta said, as he prepared to take an exam delivered by courier. "But the 
teacher gets really enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes us relate to him -- even though he's far away." Growing Demand 
Educators are exploring ways, including distance education, to better teach the 
students that will want to enter colleges in the near future. Higher education 
researchers say the number of high school graduates in California will rise by 
nearly 187,200 students between 1992 and 2009-an 81% increase. *

UCI BENEFACTOR'S PLEDGE DISAVOWED; PHILANTHROPY: WIDOW REFUSES TO PAY FUNDS 
PROMISED FOR BARCLAY THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The widow of developer Richard A. Barclay has no intention of paying the 
remainder of a $1-million pledge he made to the UC Irvine theater that bears 
his name, her attorney said Monday in response to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Barclay made the pledge," attorney Jeff Benice said. "Marjorie 
Barclay did not." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the UC Irvine Foundation, the city of Irvine and the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre filed suit against Marjorie A. Barclay and her late husband's estate, 
charging that the family has not paid $600,000 of the $1-million pledge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Richard Barclay agreed to help complete the 750-seat theater, set on 
a 2.3-acre site on the UCI campus. According to the lawsuit, the Barclays made 
two payments totaling $400,000 to the foundation in June, 1990, and June, 1991. 
After Richard Barclay's death in 1992, the payments stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit states that Richard Barclay pledged the gift in both his and his 
wife's name and that in exchange for the pledge, the theater would be named 
after the Barclays. 
</P>
<P>
 But Benice said, "You won't find her name on any of the" documents. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that since the death of her husband, a Newport Beach real estate 
developer, Marjorie Barclay has been suffering financial difficulties and feels 
no obligation to honor a pledge made by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Benice also denied that the pledge stipulated that the theater be named after 
its benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggestion that Richard Barclay made the pledge in order to get his hame 
on the building "is also untrue," Benice said. "It was offered to him after he 
made the pledge." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young said Richard Barclay had been adamant about 
his name being on the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "The theater was basically marketed with that name," she said. "Lots of money 
and identity is tied to the Irvine Barclay name. It's not fair to other donors 
who didn't have the opportunity to have a building named after them." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the foundation has made several attempts to negotiate the 
payment and that "legal documents show there's enough money in the estate to 
honor the pledge."  
</P>
<P>
 Benice said his client is "going to aggressively defend against the claim. She 
just believes it's very inappropriate, given the fact that her husband did give 
$400,000 and that they are taking a hardball position with Richard Barclay's 
widow to extract money from her."

PEERS MOURN GARDEN GROVE HIGH STUDENT; CRIME: FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD SLAIN SATURDAY 
IN A DRIVE-BY SHOOTING IS REMEMBERED FOR HIS EARNESTNESS AND MATURITY. FRIENDS

<P>
 As authorities probed the drive-by shooting that killed 15-year-old Cesar 
Torres outside a weekend birthday party, acquaintances Monday recalled a gentle 
young man who seemed to impress everyone with an earnestness and a maturity 
well beyond his years. 
</P>
<P>
 A former boss recalls being instantly won over by Torres when the Garden Grove 
High School sophomore showed up for work last summer. The boy's first question 
wasn't about pay or break time, "it was, what was the appropriate thing to 
wear," said Ron Suttle, the maintenance chief for the Garden Grove Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome trouble with math, Torres took summer classes. He talked excitedly 
at work about spending a paycheck on a birthday gift for a sibling. Friends 
said gang members tormented him, trying to get him to join and later 
threatening him. Torres refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a 15-year-old, he didn't have a smart mouth. He was very prompt. He was 
very conscientious," said Tim Kibbey, who supervised him in the furniture 
workshop at the school district. "I would say he was more mature than a 
15-year-old kid." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, police and witnesses said, Torres was one of three young people 
shot as they left a crowded birthday party by gunmen in two cars prowling a 
normally sedate Garden Grove neighborhood. The two other victims were shot in 
the legs and treated at a local clinic. Police withheld their names because 
they are juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to discuss the case in detail but said Monday that the 
shooting may have stemmed from a dispute between rival groups of graffiti 
taggers. It was not known if Torres was affiliated with either group, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the questions we're trying to find out is if it's a gang-related 
incident, and I use 'gang' in the loosest sense of the word," Capt. Dave 
Abrecht said. "We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Abrecht said investigators interviewed witnesses again Monday seeking a motive 
and clues in the shooting, which took place at about 10:50 p.m. in the 11600 
block of Faye Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Sally Heraldez, the sister of Torres' girlfriend, said Torres had been 
threatened after refusing to join a local gang. Heraldez said her family is 
staying away from their house, where the party was held. The family spent 
Monday packing up belongings and were moving from the house, which was for sale 
prior to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possessions she was packing were family photographs, including a 
shot of Torres and Gabriela Escobar, his girlfriend for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last two years of his life, he just wanted to be with my sister," 
Heraldez said. "They were like best friends -- inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
 At the high school Monday, psychologists and other district counselors 
comforted grieving students, and Torres was described by the principal as a 
low-key student who got "average to below-average" grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow students were notified of Torres' death during the morning 
announcements and responded by setting up a fund to help his family pay for 
funeral expenses, Principal Peggy Mahfood said. Donations are being accepted at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew at the school district's maintenance yard was in shock Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was selected for a city-run summer job program for disadvantaged youths 
last summer, officials said. When he indicated he enjoyed working with his 
hands, Torres was placed in the maintenance center fixing chairs and desks 
alongside employees three times his age, Kibbey said. Eager to learn and always 
early for work, Torres was soon a popular fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was quiet -- a quiet kid at first," Kibbey said. As Torres warmed up, he 
talked a lot about his girlfriend and spoke fondly of his family. Two days a 
week, he went to classes to catch up in math. His work supervisors tried to 
help out by giving him work-related number problems to solve. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres mentioned to co-workers that gang members had tried to get him to join, 
but he kept refusing, Kibbey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy didn't even come close to fitting the (gang) mold. He had a buzz 
haircut, but that was it," Kibbey said. "He was like a lamb." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres so enjoyed his summer job, he asked to return next year, officials 
said. He even talked about working full time at the maintenance yard after 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fit in with a bunch of middle-aged guys who are pretty tough," Kibbey 
said. "There are a bunch of big guys who are pretty hurt over this."

LAWYER SAYS CONTRACT NOT TIED TO LIMO FAVORS; GOVERNMENT: WILLIAM W. STEWART, 
WHOSE FIRM PROVIDES LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO THE INDIGENT, INSISTS JUDGES AND OTHER 
OFFICIALS WOULDN'T BE INFLUENCED BY THE RIDES, AND HE DENIES GETTING SPECIAL 
TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Judicial decisions to repeatedly extend attorney William W. Stewart's 
lucrative contract to defend poor people accused of Orange County crimes were 
not influenced by the lawyer's practice of providing limousine travel to some 
of the same judges and officials who oversaw contract operations, the attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a strongly worded defense of the local judiciary Monday, Stewart said the 
judges and other officials chauffeured to private dinners, fund-raisers and 
sporting events throughout the area were "beyond reproach" and would never be 
"influenced by a few rides in a limousine." 
</P>
<P>
 "The judiciary in Orange County is clean," Stewart said in an interview 
following disclosures in The Times that he regularly made his firm's limousine 
available to judges and other public officials who could influence decisions to 
renew or cancel a contract that paid him as much as $1 million a year in 
attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot require judges or other officials to cease being my friends just 
because they are elected to public office. That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the co-author of Orange County's new gift-ban ordinance 
characterized the attorney's limousine service as creating a perception of 
impropriety at the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 William R. Mitchell, director of Common Cause in Orange County, said Stewart's 
15-year contract alone is enough to question whether Stewart "has a special 
relationship with the decision makers." 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the judges) don't consider the limousine rides gifts, and they don't 
report them because they don't want people to know about their special friend, 
Mr. Stewart," Mitchell said. "It unduly taints the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judges Myron S. Brown and Luis A. Cardenas acknowledged last 
week that they had been guests in the attorney's limousine over the years and 
did not reimburse the firm nor report the rides as gifts as they are required 
by the state Fair Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both judges, Stewart's longtime friends, have presided in cases involving 
Stewart or his law firm, and Brown once served as chairman of the county's 
Alternate Defense Committee, which makes recommendations on indigent defense 
policy for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas said he may have used the car more than once but could only remember 
traveling to a charity event "a long time ago." Brown said he accompanied 
Stewart to football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum at least three 
times during the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has also used Stewart's hotel suite in Las Vegas but also did not report 
that as a gift as required by the FPPC. Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez, one of five members of the Board of Supervisors who has routinely cast 
votes to extend Stewart's contract, said he had used the limousine on at least 
two occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Vasquez said, he was performing county business and did not believe he 
was required to reimburse the firm. A second time, Vasquez said, he paid the 
driver for transportation to attend a dinner in Los Angeles. The driver, 
however, said he never received any form of payment from the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Another passenger, district attorney's investigator Rusty Hodges, said he paid 
for the service both times he used the car. The driver said the investigator 
once stuffed $100 in his shirt pocket as payment for one trip, and Hodges said 
he chipped in about $20 or $30 on another occasion when he was sharing the car 
with other passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the officials believed they did anything wrong by using the limousine, 
but Mitchell focused much of his criticism on the judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Stewart) does not provide favors without expecting something in return," 
Mitchell said. "The contract he has is a favor in itself," because it is not 
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stewart prizes his relationships with the judges and other officials, 
he said he has never won special treatment from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the contract and have kept it this long because I have done an 
excellent job," Stewart said. "I have earned and continue to earn the respect 
of the judicial system based on merit. That's the way it will continue to be in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same breath, Stewart said he has become the target of former associates 
who have been seeking to wrest control of the county business from his firm, 
which has long represented local indigents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a very big-hearted person who has taken care of a lot of people in my 
career. Then some of them turn around and double-cross you." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Stewart was criticized by other local judges for 
"subletting" most of his contract caseload to other attorneys while still 
keeping a substantial portion of the payments for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the judges accused Stewart of abandoning his role in the 
courtroom to pursue other business interests in South America. Court officials 
have confirmed that Stewart sometimes communicated with them by telephone or 
fax from South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the fact that Stewart's firm has the contract sends a message to 
Orange County," Mitchell said. "You don't need to be a full-time lawyer in 
Orange County if you are willing to give gifts."

but will they make you happy? That, among other things, is what a pair of 
Orange County university professors and two colleagues want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Profs. Michael Birnbaum of Cal State Fullerton, R. Duncan Luce of UC Irvine, 
Ward Edwards of USC and Barbara Mellers of UC Berkeley are conducting a study 
into how sudden riches change a person's attitude, health, happiness and 
spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
 Birnbaum, a psychology researcher, said the study also will probe how wealth 
affects the way people make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Science Foundation, a research agency funded by the federal 
government, thought enough of the idea by the professors to give Cal State 
Fullerton and USC two grants totaling nearly $300,000 for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were awarded Sept. 1, and will fund the project until 1997. 
Researchers plan to seek other grants and support to continue the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody talks about what happens to people and how they spend their money" 
after they win the lottery, Birnbaum said, "but we don't have much research." 
</P>
<P>
 The professors plan to interview about 200 winners of prizes over $100,000 and 
another 200 winners of smaller prizes through the televised Big Spin, Birnbaum 
said. Californians get to the Big Spin after their names are drawn from a 
collection of qualifying lottery scratcher cards.  
</P>
<P>
 Big Spin winners can take home $25,000 to $2 million, depending on the spin of 
a wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, good fortune has turned 1,021 Californians into millionaires 
through Super Lotto and the Big Spin, said Bob Taylor, spokesman for the 
California Lottery. No one has worked with the state lottery to study its 
winners before, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 One nationwide study by a Florida Institute of Technology professor in 1985 
concluded that most lottery winners keep working after they hit the jackpot. 
Researchers in the California study will inquire whether new winners intend to 
quit their jobs or take big vacations, then keep track of them to see whether 
they follow their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Birnbaum also is interested in how human judgment and decision-making follow 
mathematical trends based on wealth. The four researchers are all scholars of 
decision-making processes; Luce said he is primarily a consultant on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 According to standard theories on the topic, Birnbaum said, the more money 
people have, the more "risk-neutral" they become; the less money people have, 
the more they shy away from taking risks. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are risk-neutral, for example, are willing to pay 50 cents for the 
chance to play a coin flip game in which they would win $1 if the coin landed 
heads up, or win nothing if the coin landed on tails. People who shy away from 
risks would not be willing pay 50 cents for the opportunity to play the same 
game of chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Birnbaum and his colleagues want to find out if the theories hold up by 
testing people who are recent lottery winners, both before and after they 
appear on the Big Spin. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the researchers are curious about how big payoffs affect spending 
habits. Birnbaum said big winners are more likely to make changes in their 
work, home location, even the restaurants they patronize -- which could lead to 
the stress of adapting to a new way of life.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll ask people how often they went out to eat before they won, and then how 
much they went out to eat afterward," Birnbaum said. "The research is 
inherently interesting, so we expect we'll have some new ideas and questions to 
ask that occur to us as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
 And for the ultimate question: Can money buy happiness? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting question," Birnbaum said. "I don't know."

TICKETED DRIVER TAKES A BITE OUT OF COURT THAT NIBBLED HIM FOR $10; LITIGATION: 
SMALL CLAIMS JURIST AWARDS $200 TO MAN AFTER ANTELOPE VALLEY TRAFFIC COURT 
WRONGLY ISSUED WARRANTS FOR HIS ARREST OVER A HANDLING FEE. 
</P>

<P>
 Kenneth Dine, a North Hollywood contractor, let the registration lapse on his 
1984 Pontiac. He was driving on the Antelope Valley Freeway when a California 
Highway Patrol officer nabbed him for the expired license plates and slapped 
him with a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 He promptly paid the registration fee and dutifully sent in proof that he had 
done so. 
</P>
<P>
 The response was not what he expected: A computer-generated notice said he now 
was charged with the crime of failing to appear in court -- with bail set at 
$364. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a bench warrant for Dine's arrest -- with bail set even higher, at 
$500. 
</P>
<P>
 It took two trips to the Antelope Valley Courthouse in Lancaster before Dine 
finally sorted things out. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, angry as hell, he sued for his time and trouble -- and won. In Small 
Claims Court, he was awarded $200. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal decision goes well beyond the sweet intoxication of righteous 
vindication. It spotlights the authority of court clerks and of the computers 
that do their bidding -- a power that is largely unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the supervising judge of the Antelope Municipal Court concedes that the 
warrant was issued mistakenly, under authority that the clerks believed they 
had but -- as the small claims commissioner pointed out -- actually do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start reading these (California Vehicle Code) sections, it's not 
quite as clear," Judge William Seelicke said. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got that right, said Dine, offering an essential truth: "Just because 
somebody tells you to send them 10 bucks doesn't mean you have to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not, Dine is quick to point out, that he is some wacko bent on raising 
hell. This, he says, was about democracy -- about how traffic court is an 
essential institution where government power is felt most keenly by the largest 
number of people, and where it is most essential to stand up for one's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to test the restraints of democracy," he said. "Otherwise you lose 
your rights because they get nibbled up from below. It's not like Congress 
passing up a big law that takes away your rights. It's these little nibbles." 
</P>
<P>
 The nibble that ate at Dine began Sept. 19, 1992, on the Antelope Valley 
Freeway, when a Highway Patrol officer gave him a ticket because his license 
plates had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dine paid the overdue license plate fee and, as required by law, notified the 
Antelope Municipal Court by mail that his plates were current. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not, however, pay a $10 handling fee that had been tacked onto the 
ticket. He believed he was obligated to pay the fee -- but, after careful study 
of the vehicle code, to the DMV, not to the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 28, 1992, the court issued Dine a letter telling him the clerks were 
still waiting for the $10. On Dec. 9, the court computer spat out a document 
entitled "complaint" that charged Dine with the misdemeanor crime of failing to 
appear in court to pay the $10 fee. Bail was set at $364. 
</P>
<P>
 Dine wrote in to protest. In January, 1993, a court commissioner dismissed the 
criminal "complaint" but reimposed the $10 fee, giving Dine until Feb. 16 to 
pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Dine did not appear. On Feb. 26, the court computer once again charged him 
with a crime and issued a warrant for his arrest. Bail was set at $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Dine was wanted by every police officer in California for $10 -- in a case 
that began with a simple infraction that had already been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal basis for the warrant -- like the "complaint" that preceded it -- 
was the section of the vehicle code that makes failure to appear in court a 
misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in 1985, the state Legislature added a section that expressly forbids 
such warrants on three conditions: The driver has a clean record, has a valid 
California license and was initially ticketed with an infraction. Dine met all 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, the court is simply supposed to notify the DMV of the 
motorist's failure to appear. The DMV, in turn, is to collect any court fees 
when registering the driver's vehicles. That, the Legislature found, would be 
more cost-effective. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was the point that Dine kept making in letters to the Antelope 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 1, 1993, needing to renew his license by his July 4 birthday, Dine 
finally trucked out to Lancaster in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 He waited all day until his case was heard, he said. Late in the afternoon, he 
said, a judge dismissed the warrant and told Dine to pay the $10. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, the clerks had closed the cash register. Dine had to return 
to Lancaster the next morning to pay the $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he sued in Van Nuys Small Claims Court, the court nearest his home. On 
Sept. 20, 1994, Commissioner Kirkland Nyby ruled in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Caler, the Antelope Valley court administrator, faxed Nyby a letter Oct. 5 
asking for an explanation of the ruling. Caler said the court clerks believed 
that Dine's case had been handled properly; she said that Dine had plenty of 
chances to pay the $10 by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nyby wrote to Caler that the 1985 addition to the vehicle code plainly 
bars the warrant that her clerks issued for Dine's arrest. A "reasonable 
expense to clear up the mistakenly issued warrant," he said, was $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding Judge Seelicke said the Antelope Municipal Court no longer issues 
warrants such as the one Dine got. 
</P>
<P>
 Dine says he will remain vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people assume the courts know what they're doing," he said. "My personal 
experience has shown me that they don't."

A FRESH START; HOUSING: THE MOVING TO OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM WILL TAKE FAMILIES 
OUT OF THE PROJECTS TO SEE IF A NEW ENVIRONMENT HELPS THEM SUCCEED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Patricia Williams does not mind that she could become a guinea pig in a 
national experiment about housing, education, race and social mobility. All 
that really matters, she says, is a possible ticket out of the troubled Jordan 
Downs public housing project in Watts, where she has lived for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go anywhere out of the projects, anywhere out of the Watts area," 
said the mother of eight. "Kids outside have a better chance than the kids 
being stuck in Jordan Downs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and many other public housing residents in Los Angeles and four other 
U.S. cities hope to be chosen for a controversial federal program called Moving 
to Opportunity. It uses rental subsidies to find out what happens when poor 
families settle in more affluent neighborhoods, presumably closer to decent 
jobs and better schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, in other words, a test of the old question about environment's effect 
on people, especially children. The test comes amid increasing national concern 
about how public housing can isolate generations of residents in a web of 
unemployment, welfare, crime and despair. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give people new life opportunities in better neighborhoods, at least 
their kids, if not the whole household, can turn into functioning citizens 
rather than ciphers in the welfare system or criminal justice system," said 
attorney Alexander Polikoff, who designed a successful Chicago desegregation 
program that is the model for Moving to Opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 First proposed during the George Bush Administration, the $70-million project 
will move 1,325 families nationwide over the next few months. In Los Angeles, 
188 households will be selected by lottery from an anticipated 1,000 or so 
applicants, mainly African American and Latino women with children. Recent 
recruiting meetings were very well attended at such local housing projects as 
San Fernando Gardens in Pacoima, Ramona Gardens in Boyle Heights and Jordan 
Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the participants will be in the control group and receive traditional 
Section 8 rent assistance vouchers that can be used in privately owned 
apartments anywhere in their home state for at least five years. The other 
half, with the help of intensive counseling, must use the vouchers in specified 
neighborhoods where less than 10% of households are below the federal poverty 
line, which is about $14,700 for a family of four. The education and employment 
of the two groups will be tracked and compared. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, many Section 8 recipients stayed in low-income neighborhoods 
close to friends and relatives. In contrast, the 18-year-old Chicago 
desegregation program has moved low-income African American families to 
integrated and more upscale suburbs. The children of the relocated families 
showed more school success than children who stayed in the city. As a result, 
social scientists and Jack Kemp, former Housing and Urban Development 
secretary, persuaded Congress to try a national test. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moving to Opportunity has encountered strong opposition, even though the 
number of vouchers is tiny compared to the overall federal rent subsidy 
program. White politicians from Baltimore suburbs recently protested the 
possible MTO move of 285 households -- mainly African American -- from 
Baltimore city public housing, saying it would export poverty to middle-class 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's very essence is not to concentrate families, but to scatter and 
integrate them as much as possible, HUD officials said. They insist that 
Baltimore protesters distorted issues for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's unfortunate," said Margery Turner, HUD deputy assistant 
secretary for research, "that the fears and the prejudices of families in this 
close-in suburban community have really been built up and exploited to generate 
opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, a Democrat who has embraced Republican Kemp's 
plan, insists that Moving to Opportunity will proceed in Baltimore and the four 
other cities -- Los Angeles, New York, Chicago and Boston. But the Baltimore 
dispute caused Congress to shelve a proposed expansion. Cisneros continues to 
push other initiatives for more choice in housing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, more than one-third of the city's 756 census tracts are 
eligible by their low poverty rates to be in Moving to Opportunity's more 
experimental side. Those are scattered mainly across wide swaths of the San 
Fernando Valley, the Westside and the Wilshire district. Housing authority 
surveys show that many of those neighborhoods appear to have decent numbers of 
vacant apartments that meet federal guidelines for fair market rents. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams would like to move to Westwood if she wins the lottery. "I have 
friends who live there, and it seems so pretty and peaceful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old single mother, who is a part-time cafeteria worker who 
receives welfare, makes no secret of why she wants to leave Jordan Downs. The 
highly visible drug dealing, she said, presents bad role models for her 
children and grandchildren. Her two older daughters live in their own 
apartments in the development with their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they can visualize is being a high roller, a drug dealer. That's all they 
have to look forward to. And it just goes on and on and on. I'm tired of 
looking at the same old thing every day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Los Angeles' sprawling and multiethnic nature, disputes like 
Baltimore's are not expected here, according to officials of the Housing 
Authority in Los Angeles, which runs the local program. Many middle-class 
neighborhoods of Los Angeles already have some racial integration in rental 
apartments, they say. Although the movement will be dispersed widely, all the 
eligible middle-class districts will be within the city's boundaries, avoiding 
Baltimore's problems of sending families into neighboring towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has a whole different character (than Baltimore)," said UCLA law 
professor Richard Sander, who is president of the Fair Housing Congress of 
Southern California, an organization hired to help with Moving to Opportunity. 
"I don't think there is this idea in the Anglo community here that there is a 
barrier that can't be breached." 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain the experiment's integrity, families will not be screened for 
chances of success, officials say. But once the residents are chosen, the Fair 
Housing Congress and a housing advocacy group called Beyond Shelter will help 
those in the more experimental half to find apartments and counsel them on 
transportation, child care and being a good tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Donald Smith, executive director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority, 
seems ambivalent, calling MTO "a difficult and risky experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Although families may find better housing and schools, he is skeptical about 
employment prospects because the program does not include job training. Even 
well-established middle-class families have employment difficulties these days 
because of the economy, Smith added. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Housing Authority and tenants believe MTO is worth a try, as long 
as it does not detract from other efforts to reform public housing. 
</P>
<P>
 At recent meetings, the housing authority's Section 8 administrator Steve 
Renahan and a Spanish-language interpreter explained MTO over the noise of many 
children in attendance. Overall audience response was enthusiastic, especially 
because the local waiting list for regular vouchers has been closed for four 
years, with about 40,000 families on it. 
</P>
<P>
 (Both Section 8 and public housing tenants generally pay 30% of their income 
for rent. But different formulas may mean somewhat higher rents for Moving to 
Opportunity families who leave public housing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who intend to apply is Luz Elana Tafolla, chairwoman of the San 
Fernando Gardens residents council. Although crime has declined because of 
better security and tenant activities, housing projects' problems are often 
exaggerated by outsiders, she said. The stereotype stigmatizes children in 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids don't want to say they live here because they think people will 
think they are bad," said Tafolla, 40, who has lived in the development with 
her two children for eight years, since a divorce pushed her into deep 
financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot of bad people here," she said. "There's a lot of people who 
sometimes have problems and can't afford rents outside. But it's mainly a lot 
of good people who have dreams and desires for a better life." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to Opportunity may offer that, she said, through bigger apartments in 
newer buildings in nicer neighborhoods. Tafolla hopes to move close to her 
son's middle school in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of MTO is based on the experience of youngsters in Chicago's so-called 
Gautreaux Program, which has moved about 5,500 black families to better housing 
since 1976. That desegregation movement is named after Dorothy Gautreaux, the 
African American woman whose lawsuit successfully challenged Chicago housing 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at Northwestern University found that only 5% of black children 
who moved to integrated Chicago suburbs dropped out of school, compared to 20% 
of those who used Gautreaux vouchers to stay in the city. The youngsters who 
moved to the suburbs went on to college at higher rates too, 54% compared to 
21%. The new suburbanites, however, did report cases of maladjustment, racial 
bias and isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Less dramatic was the effect on adults' jobs prospects. A study found that 64% 
of the Gautreaux adults in the suburbs were working, compared to 51% of those 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 James Rosenbaum, the Northwestern sociology professor who headed those 
studies, is optimistic that MTO can succeed nationwide if carefully 
administered. It is important, he said, that a wide variety of neighborhoods be 
made available. There is the temptation, he said, of just seeking places "where 
you won't get too much flak." 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh criticism has come from conservative writer James Bovard, who attacked 
rent subsidies in a recent issue of American Spectator magazine. It is not 
clustering of low-income people in public housing that causes social problems, 
but "the web of irresponsibility and viciousness created by paying generations 
of people to become government dependents," Bovard wrote. Moving to 
Opportunity, he said, is another welfare plan doomed to backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal administrators fear opposition from another camp: urban activists who 
might view the program as hurting public housing and taking away its most 
motivated families. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Polikoff, the Chicago attorney, believes it would be wrong to keep 
families in the projects just for the sake of maintaining population numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is offering those who are motivated a chance to escape," he said. "Some 
will get out and have heartwarming success stories, others will have 
distressing failures. But at least society is recognizing the need to provide 
escape hatches for some."

MISSING WOMAN FOUND SAFE IN HER CAR; RESCUE: POLICE SAY SHE SPENT AT LEAST TWO 
DAYS INSIDE AWAITING HER HUSBAND'S RETURN AFTER THEY RAN OUT OF GAS. THE MAN 
SUFFERS FROM ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND COULDN'T REMEMBER WIFE'S LOCATION.

<P>
 A disabled 79-year-old woman, whose husband left her in their car then forgot 
where he parked, was found safe Monday after spending at least two days waiting 
for her husband, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iris Larzabal, who recently underwent hip surgery and is unable to walk, was 
hospitalized for dehydration after police, responding to a neighbor's call, 
found the car parked about two blocks from the Promenade and Topanga Plaza 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, she spent more than three days in the car -- the first day and a half 
with her 88-year-old husband, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't eat, she didn't get out of the car as far as we know," said LAPD 
Missing Persons Detective Alex Valadez. "But she is in good health, a little 
dehydrated, but just fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's ordeal began Thursday evening, when Jose and Iris Larzabal drove 
from their North Hollywood home to eat dinner at a restaurant near the 
intersection of Victory and Topanga Canyon boulevards, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home, their car ran out of gas near Erwin Street and Canoga Avenue 
-- about three blocks from where they ate, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than risk getting lost in the dark, the couple decided to spend the 
night in their car, a 1980 Toyota Corolla, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Larzabal told police that on Friday morning, he ventured out to look for 
gas and return with medication for his wife, but became disoriented and got 
lost, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iris Larzabal told police that the couple had spent two days in the car 
together before her husband left to get help on Saturday morning, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a discrepancy in their stories that we haven't worked out yet," 
Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Larzabal told police that a motorist spotted him about noon on Friday 
near the intersection of Topanga Canyon and Parthenia Street -- about 4 1/2 
miles from his car. The stranger gave him a ride to his North Hollywood home, 
Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really frustrated with himself, blaming himself for what happened 
because he couldn't remember the way back," said his granddaughter, Marie 
Rajabi. 
</P>
<P>
 Rajabi said her grandfather speaks only Spanish and was in an area of the West 
Valley with relatively few Spanish-speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody was paying much attention to him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the couple's family had been searching for them since Thursday 
night. When Jose Larzabal returned home without his wife, they phoned police, 
Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the weekend, police in helicopters and squad cars searched areas of 
Woodland Hills and Canoga Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But officers had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Monday morning, someone phoned police and asked them to check on a 
woman who had been sitting in a car for at least a day, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iris Larzabal's ordeal ended at about 9:45 a.m. when Los Angeles Fire 
Department paramedics took her to a Kaiser Foundation hospital in Woodland 
Hills, where she was reunited with her family -- except for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "He refused to come," explained Rajabi. "He's cleaning up like a little demon 
because the house is messy and he thinks she'll be mad at him when she comes 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Larzabals are doing fine, Rajabi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't praise police enough for the work they did on this," said 
Rajabi. "She's a tough cookie. It's a nice ending to what could have been a sad 
story."

WINS BENEATH HIS WINGS; LIFELONG LOVE OF FLYING PROPELS PILOT, HOME-BUILT RACER 
TO VICTORY

 As a child, Jon Sharp used to "fly" a plane that was attached to a short wire. 
As an adolescent, it was remote-controlled airplanes. As an adult, he's still 
playing with aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now, the planes are not toys. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Sharp, 44, pilots an aircraft he helped build. Aptly named 
Nemesis, the plane is an air racer that has set a host of speed records and 
dominated the Formula One racing class since it appeared on the circuit in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great airplane," said Ray Cote, a 26-year veteran of air racing and 
holder of more Formula One national titles than anyone else. "It's way out in 
front, way ahead of all the others." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp credits the success of the plane to the team approach that went into its 
creation and maintenance. "If you want to be competitive and win, you have to 
develop the expertise and truly exploit the team concept." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Sharp and his accomplishments with Nemesis will be recognized by 
the National Aeronautic Assn. Sharp will receive the Pulitzer Trophy, air 
racing's most prestigious award, said Art Greenfield, secretary of the NAA's 
Contest and Records Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pulitzer Trophy, which has been in the possession of the National Air and 
Space Museum for four decades and was deeded to the museum last year, was first 
handed out in 1920 and for the next five years was given to the winner of the 
National Air Races. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very famous during the 1920s, the heyday of airplane racing," 
Greenfield said of the trophy. Although it has been more than 60 years since 
the trophy was awarded to anyone, Greenfield said the NAA intends to reactivate 
it as an annual award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a beautiful trophy with a rich history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp will receive the sterling-silver trophy, which will actually remain in 
the possession of the National Air and Space Museum, for his performance during 
the 1993 race season, Greenfield said. Top pilots in the four other air race 
classes will also be honored with the Pulitzer. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Air racing is similar to auto racing except that it is done about 50 feet off 
the ground, said Sharp. The planes speed along a three-mile oval course at 
about 250 m.p.h. The 24-mile races take only about 6 1/2 minutes to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other Pulitzer recipients, Sharp on Friday will receive another 
recognition -- the Louis Bleriot Medal. It is an international award named for 
a French aircraft builder and designer who won the first air race in 1912 
against the likes of the Wright brothers and other aviation pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council of the Federation Aeronautique Internationale awards a maximum of 
just three of the medals each year to holders of speed, altitude and distance 
records in planes weighing less than 2,204 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp set a speed record on Aug. 1, 1993, at the Aeroshell Speed Dash in 
Wisconsin, where he piloted the long, smooth and slender Nemesis at an amazing 
277.26 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think he would be highly honored to receive both (awards) in one 
year," said Greenfield. "It speaks for itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his plane and the Nemesis Air Racing Team, Sharp said, "Not in my wildest 
dreams did I ever think it would be this successful. Most of this is pretty 
numbing to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his love of things that fly, Sharp's desire to race also dates back to 
his childhood. "I raced everything from pedal cars to tricycles to slot cars," 
he said. "I've raced a lot of people from stoplights." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Sharp earned his pilot's license in the early 1970s, a co-worker 
told him about a home-built racing plane that was for sale. Sharp bought it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one single event led to all these others," Sharp said of his first 
plane, a Cassutt Racer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't race it for a long, long time," he said. "I just flew it around to 
air shows and terrorized airports and that kind of stuff. It was a little, 
itty-bitty, tiny airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Sharp got a call from a friend who invited him to bring his Cassutt 
to a race in Mexico. "We came in last by a real long way." 
</P>
<P>
 But the next year, Sharp did a little better in that race. And then he ran 
into a friend who used to build engines, and in the 1978 Cleveland Air Races, 
Sharp and his plane actually "got past a couple people." From that point, he 
said, "I was hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later, Sharp joined up with a pair of Orange County engine 
builders who through their company, Aero Mag, began building engines 
specifically for racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still flying Aero Mag engines to this very day," said Sharp, who earns 
his living as a composites research engineer with Lockheed Advanced Development 
Co. Sharp won his first national title at the Reno National Championship Air 
Races in 1982 with such an engine in the little Cassutt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Sharp and his team began building Nemesis. The name was selected 
based on what they hoped to do with the plane. "We thought of all the typical 
names -- Eliminator, Annihilator. We didn't want to eliminate anybody. We just 
wanted to be the thorn in their side." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is just what Nemesis has done. The 520-pound plane has won 19 of the 
21 air races Sharp has flown it in, and it holds four national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bohannon is an air racer out of Texas who often finishes second behind 
Nemesis, which he described as the most modern racer on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been chasing them with a much older design airplane," he said. "We're 
slowly catching them by learning more and more ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As Sharp does, Bohannon believes it's the Nemesis Air Racing Team that has 
made the plane such a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody that's involved with that team's in the aerospace industry," he 
said. "It's really difficult to beat a team that's as well dialed in as they 
are." 
</P>
<P>
 Nemesis, made of composite materials, was built in 15 months of evenings and 
weekends in a hangar at the Mojave Airport. Sharp flew it for the first time in 
July, 1991, and that September it won the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time since Formula One racing began more than four decades 
before that a new airplane, racing for the first time, won a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nemesis is a great airplane," said Jack Sweeney, secretary/treasurer of 
the Air Racing Council of the United States. Sweeney said the plane has been so 
successful because of "great attention to detail and design and great attention 
to design techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It basically has wiped up all the competition and will continue to 
do so until the next one comes along." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp hopes to have the "next one" as well. The Nemesis Air Racing Team is 
already looking to build another plane. The name has already been selected and, 
like the first Nemesis, it is hoped it will prove prophetic. The plane will be 
called Nemesis IYWN. The initials stand for "In Your Worst Nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Sharp said the goal is to continue to squash the competition while 
living by the team motto, namely "Chase the dream, not the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to become the best of the best," he said. And that means passing 
Cote's record of 12 national titles, nine of which he won in a row. So far, 
Sharp has acquired six national titles, including four in a row with Nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cote, who stopped racing three years ago but may return, does not mind if 
Nemesis edges him out of the record books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Records are there to be broken," he said. "If everything goes well, he will 
beat the record."

VERDICT IN BRUTALITY CASE UPHELD; LAW: U.S. SUPREME COURT'S DECISION MEANS CITY 
MUST PAY $890,000 TO A FLEEING KIDNAPING SUSPECT WHOSE ANKLE WAS FRACTURED WHEN 
AN LAPD SQUAD CAR RAN OVER IT. A DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY CALLS THE RULING 
'DISTRESSING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, dismissing a final appeal in a Los Angeles police brutality 
case, said the city must pay $890,000 in damages to a fleeing suspect who was 
run over by a police squad car five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In upholding the jury verdict, a federal appeals court in California said 
officers may not use "deadly force" to stop a fleeing suspect if "more 
reasonable alternatives" are available.  
</P>
<P>
 In his appeal to the high court, Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn said 
this ruling allows jurors to second-guess police officers who are compelled to 
make split-second decisions when chasing a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 But an attorney for the suspect, Henry Bradford, said the lower courts had 
applied the law properly and concluded correctly that a Los Angeles police 
detective did not need to run over Bradford's leg to capture him. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, the justices said they would not review the ruling in the 
case Los Angeles vs. Bradford, 94-70. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge verdict had surprised city attorneys in 1991 because Bradford had 
admitted that he was involved in a plot to kidnap a Ladera Heights woman and 
her young son and to demand a ransom of cash and cocaine. Bradford said his job 
in the plot was to pick up the ransom money, and he later served a year in 
prison for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that admission, jurors in Los Angeles voted to give the then 
37-year-old hairdresser $850,000 to compensate him for his injuries and they 
tacked on another $40,000 to punish the officer. However, lawyers noted that 
the trial took place in August, 1991, five months after Los Angeles Police 
Department officers were videotaped beating motorist Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very strange case and certainly a distressing result for the 
city," said Katherine J. Hamilton, a deputy city attorney who worked on the 
appeal.  
</P>
<P>
 But Barrett Litt, an attorney who represented Bradford, said the evidence of 
police brutality "had to be pretty compelling for a federal court jury to 
unanimously decide this person (a criminal) was entitled to compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 The case began the evening of March 14, 1989, when members of the LAPD's 
Special Investigations Section staked out an area along the Harbor Freeway. 
Earlier that day, kidnapers had abducted Sharon Landford and her son from their 
home and had phoned the woman's mother demanding ransom. They threatened to 
kill their hostages if the ransom was not delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was to be dropped over the side of the freeway near Gage Avenue in 
South-Central Los Angeles. The LAPD officers were lying in wait nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bradford emerged from a car and picked up one of the ransom packages, an 
officer ordered him to freeze and radioed a call to other officers. Bradford 
began running, and Detective Michael Sirk accelerated his squad car around a 
corner and blocked his escape. Sirk again told Bradford to halt, but when he 
fled, the officer "deliberately drove the police car into Bradford," the 
appeals court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was knocked to the ground, and the car ran over his left ankle and 
fractured it. By the time of trial two years later, Bradford could walk, aided 
by a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Supreme Court has said police can use deadly force only if it 
is necessary to prevent the escape of a dangerous suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, lawyers for Bradford argued that police had surrounded the 
area, so it was not necessary to use such force to stop the fleeing man.  
</P>
<P>
 In affirming the jury's verdict, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said "there 
was substantial evidence . . . for the jury to conclude that Detective Sirk's 
use of a car as a weapon was unnecessary because Sirk had more reasonable 
alternatives."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; $2-MILLION CENTER IS DEDICATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 150 residents and elected officials on Monday dedicated the $2-million 
Community Center at La Habra Boulevard and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which is not yet completed, will have meeting rooms and receptions 
halls for group gatherings and social events.Officials said the center is 
expected to serve thousands of people annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve old buildings -- including the office where former President Richard M. 
Nixon practiced law -- were torn down to make room for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists had fought for more than a decade in an effort to get the 
city to keep Nixon's law office and other historic buildings from being razed. 
They lost their battle when the city decided to erect a new community center, 
but history will be preserved, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spot where the former President's desk once stood will be remembered with 
brick marker and a plaque honoring Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is expected to open in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the center cost less than the cost of restoring the old 
buildings, which included the Wester Hotel and the city's first two-story brick 
business building. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent A. Roberts, a former councilman who fought for the preservation of 
Nixon's law office, said he looked forward to seeing the building complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (the center) will be a benefit for the city," he said. "Nothing can be 
done to bring back the Nixon building. That's history, and we've got to move 
on."MIMI KO

 They feasted on tacos and fajitas , sipped horchata , a Mexican drink of rice, 
sugar, milk and cinnamon, and watched Colombian dancers do the salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Under bright skies, about 300 people gathered Saturday at A.G. Currie Middle 
School to enjoy music, dance and food from around the globe during the school's 
annual international festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Day of the Family" was intended to celebrate the school's recent choice 
as a Distinguished California School and to showcase its diversity, Principal 
Dan Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey indicated that the school's 800 students come from 56 
countries and speak several languages, making the school the most diverse in 
the Tustin Unified School District, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful," said Gloria Dickerson, a parent. "Part of the problem is, 
we don't understand each other. We come from different backgrounds and 
cultures. It's great to find out about each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickerson said she is happy that her daughter, Kelly, 12, an eighth-grader, is 
going to a multicultural school, unlike herself when she was growing up in 
Philadelphia. "This is almost like going to a foreign country," she said, "and 
you learn a lot by traveling abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 Campus groups such as the Foreign Languages Club and the Just Say No Club sold 
food, T-shirts and other merchandise to raise money, while the Tustin Police 
Department, American Red Cross and other agencies operated information booths.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WOODLAND HILLS; WOMAN, 
79, FOUND SAFE IN PARKED CAR AFTER 2 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A disabled 79-year-old woman, whose husband left her in the car and then 
forgot where he parked, was found safe Monday after spending at least two days 
waiting for her husband, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iris Larzabal, who recently underwent hip surgery and is unable to walk, was 
hospitalized for dehydration after police, responding to a neighbor's call, 
found the car parked about two blocks from the Promenade and Topanga Plaza 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, she spent more than three days in the car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's ordeal began Thursday evening when Jose and Iris Larzabal drove 
from their North Hollywood home to eat dinner at a restaurant near the Victory 
and Topanga Canyon boulevards, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way home, their car ran out of gas near Erwin Street and Canoga Avenue 
-- about three blocks from where they ate, police said. Rather than risk 
getting lost in the dark, the couple decided to spend the night in their car, a 
1980 Toyota Corolla, Valadez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Larzabal, 88, told police that on Friday morning, he ventured out to look 
for gas and to return with medication for his wife, but became disoriented and 
got lost, investigators said.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PROPOSED MALL IS GENERATING INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tower Records, Good Guys electronics, AMC Theaters and a variety of other new 
businesses could move into downtown Glendale as soon as next summer if a 
developer succeeds in building a major outdoor retail project that has been in 
the making for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 JMB/Urban Development of Century City also has recruited the Cheesecake 
Factory restaurant and several other as yet-unidentified retail businesses to 
move into Glendale Marketplace, an outdoor mall proposed for the two-block area 
between Brand Boulevard, Broadway and Harvard and Louise streets, city 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's real strong interest in this project because it's going to be 
different from what currently exists in Glendale," said Kirk Pelser, a project 
manager with the Glendale Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there we have street retailers along Brand Boulevard and major 
retailers in the Galleria, but there are no nationally known retailers on the 
street." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the mall, which was originally envisioned as an extension of 
the Exchange shopping center but later was retooled to include larger retail 
stores, could be under construction by summer, in a best-case scenario.  
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency has already hired consultants to design a 950-space 
parking garage and to prepare an environmental impact report on the mall, which 
will have up to 250,000 square feet of retail space with three anchor stores 
and a multiplex cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction could be delayed a bit because JMB/Urban has yet to acquire any 
property in the designated area. The affected parcels are owned by about a 
dozen different parties, with whom the developer will have to negotiate 
individually, Pelser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That part of the process has lagged behind somewhat," he said, noting that 
JMB "started off by obtaining appraisals and trying to determine what the 
market values of the properties are, and now they're in the process of trying 
to contact each of the owners."  
</P>
<P>
 At its weekly meeting today at Glendale City Hall, the agency will consider 
granting the developer a 60-day extension of its Nov. 1 deadline to begin 
obtaining options on the properties.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency has the option to walk away from the deal if it feels the developer 
is not making progress on developing interest by retailers, financing the 
construction or acquiring property. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; LAPD BREAKS GROUND FOR NEW STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Irene Bokman remembers when the only dirt at 11640 Burbank Blvd. was on the 
pitcher's mound in the park's Little League field. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the only thing left is dirt -- mounds of it -- in a 10-foot-deep crater 
carved into the former field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gaping hole in the ground does not bother Bokman. It makes her feel 
safer, since it will soon be filled by the Los Angeles Police Department's new 
North Hollywood station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing," Bokman, 39, said of the station's construction, which was 
celebrated Monday at a ground-breaking ceremony. "The field was sitting here 
empty. It hadn't been used in years. In fact, I was going to call my city 
councilman and recommend they do something when they started digging things 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilmen Joel Wachs and Richard Alarcon, whose districts are served by 
the North Hollywood Division, were among those who, along with LAPD Chief 
Willie Williams, lauded the $15.2-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have new facilities," Williams told a crowd of about 75 police and 
community supporters. "This is one of two or three that must go up right away." 
</P>
<P>
 The new 37,340-square-foot facility will be twice the size of the current 
North Hollywood station, house 234 vehicles, provide closer access to the 
Hollywood Freeway and be located in the middle of the division's patrol area, 
police said.

<P>
 "We will be more centrally located, so we will be able to respond quicker," 
said North Hollywood Patrol Capt. Robert McNamara. "I think we will be more in 
touch with the community. And the facility will also facilitate the 
modernization of our computers." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, whose construction actually began last month, is expected to be 
completed by October, 1996. When finished, it will replace the LAPD's 
second-oldest station at 11480 Tiara St. Opened in 1958, the current station 
has become outdated and too crowded for the division's 210 officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been out of space for a very, very long time," McNamara said. "We 
have had to use some of the jail cells for interviews and storing of records." 
</P>
<P>
 The current North Hollywood Station on Tiara Street will be turned over to the 
city Department of Parks and Recreation, which owned the old park at 11640 
Burbank Blvd. The two agencies simply swapped land, McNamara said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new North Hollywood station is the first of three replacement stations to 
be constructed with cash from Proposition 2, a bond fund approved by voters in 
April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other stations, the 77th Street and Newton divisions in Los Angeles, will 
be torn down and rebuilt on the same sites beginning in the next several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, North Hollywood Capt. Richard Wahler and the officers under his 
command will just be happy monitoring their special hole in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be surprised at how excited we can get seeing all this heavy equipment 
digging dirt," Wahler said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; ARCHITECTS HIRED FOR CHILD CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transit Authority has hired Mutlow/Jubany Architects of Los 
Angeles to design a child-care center at the Sylmar-San Fernando Metrolink 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA will hold an open house for the community to review proposed 
architectural plans and renderings for the center at 6 p.m. Wednesday in the 
San Fernando City Hall council chambers, 117 MacNeil St. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-story building, to be constructed at the southeast end of the 
Metrolink station, adjacent to 1st and Hubbard streets, is designed to 
accommodate a maximum of 70 children from infancy to age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is searching for a state-accredited child care operator to run the 
center, which will be geared primarily to the children of adults who use the 
transit system on a daily basis, said Desiree Portillo-Rabinov, MTA project 
manager for the San Fernando Valley-North County Area team. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's interior space will be approximately 5,000 square feet, with an 
outdoor playground of about 5,610 square feet. Its proposed hours of operation 
are from 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The fee for using the center will be set after a study has been completed to 
determine how much the population of the area can afford to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not reveal the center's cost, but said it will be paid for by 
state and local grants. The city Department of Transportation donated the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right at the beginning stages," said Portillo-Rabinov. "This is the 
community's facility; there's a real need for child care for commuters. That's 
why we're holding the open house, to bring the people up to date, answer 
questions and get their input. I want to emphasize that the final design has 
not been approved yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo-Rabinov said the architecture will be in the Mission style, to 
reflect the demographics of the local population -- about 55% Latino, 33% 
Anglo, 5% African American and 5% Asian.  
</P>
<P>
 The center will include several observation rooms with wide windows, so 
children can watch trains arriving and departing from the station.  
</P>
<P>
 The final design and bid package will be completed by Jan. 3. Construction is 
expected to start in March, with an opening scheduled for September. TIM MAY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
SUPERVISORS ADVISED TO PAY $600,000 TO SLAIN BOY'S KIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Claims Board recommended Monday that the Board of 
Supervisors pay $600,000 to settle a claim by the parents of Daniel Angel 
Ortiz, an unarmed 15-year-old car theft suspect shot to death by a sheriff's 
deputy in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed that Ortiz was shot in the back after a high-speed 
chase.Deputy Jose Belmares, now 32, said he fired a first shot at the 
Montebello teen-ager to prevent him from backing his car into the deputy' 
patrol car, then fired four more shots in the mistaken belief that the youth 
was armed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department fired Belmares, citing his "deplorable" lack of 
judgment, but the county's Civil Service Commission reinstated him. The 
commission later reversed its decision and Belmares is appealing that reversal, 
attorneys said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN WHO 
KILLED HIS BRIDE IS RESENTENCED TO 33 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chiropractor who threw his bride overboard on their honeymoon cruise in 1988 
was resentenced Monday to 33 years, nine months in prison after a judge 
reviewed his life sentence for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Robin Roston of Santa Monica was convicted five years ago of the 
second-degree murder of Karen Waltz Roston nine days after they were 
married.Witnesses on their honeymoon cruise from Los Angeles to Mexico said 
they had been fighting before Karen Roston was beaten, strangled and thrown 
into the sea 20 miles off the Mexican coast Feb. 13, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge James Ideman sentenced Roston to life in prison in October 
1989, saying the killing was one of the cruelest crimes he had seen. New 
sentencing guidelines at the time provided for a 14-year term, however. An 
appeals court a year ago upheld the verdict, but sent the case back to Ideman 
for resentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual in that this case was tried right at the time the sentencing 
guidelines came into effect, so there were no precedents for the judge to 
consider," Assistant U.S. Atty. Kendra McNally said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since then, there have been significant additions to case law, and the judge 
had an opportunity to review that." 
</P>
<P>
 Roston had claimed his wife was killed by Israeli agents in retaliation for a 
book he had written criticizing Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After last year's wildfires, the Los Angeles County Fire Department has 
temporarily added two new weapons to its firefighting arsenal: a pair of 
amphibious aircraft known as Super Scoopers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the planes was used Monday afternoon for the third time on a brush fire 
in the City of Industry near the Crossroads Parkway off-ramp of the Pomona 
Freeway. Flames were moving quickly toward several homes when firefighters 
arrived, but it the aid of the plane it was extinguised in 45 minutes and no 
homes were lost, said County Fire Inspector Mark Savage. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a unique partnership between the county and insurance companies, the 
Canadian-made aircraft have been leased from the Quebec government for a 
three-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The Super Scoopers, based at Van Nuys Airport, are able to carry three times 
as much water as the county's firefighting helicopters fand need not land to 
replenish their water supply. A Look at California's Ties to the Super Scooper 
1970: Canadair, the plane's manufacturer, volunteers a CL-215 to fight Berkeley 
fires. Los Angeles County requests use of the plane to help fight fires in 
Malibu. After three days, the aircraft are returned because of contractual 
disputes with other fixed-wing firefighting aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 1979: Two planes are tested for 2 1/2 months by Los Angeles County Fire 
Department, helping fight Laurel Canyon fire in September. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: Ballot initiative aimed at purchasing two aircrafts fails to get 
required two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 1982: Legislation introduced to authorize state purchase of two CL-215s. In 
October, two aircraft are leased for testing by forestry department. 
</P>
<P>
 1991: After destructive Oakland and Berkeley Hills wildfires, Assemblyman 
Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood) introduces legislation to lease two Super 
Scoopers for 1992-93 fire season. 
</P>
<P>
 1992: Legislation passes state Assembly and Senate, but is vetoed by governor. 
</P>
<P>
 1993: After disastrous wildfires in Los Angeles, Ventura and Orange counties, 
Friedman tries again to get state approval to lease two Super Scoopers for 
1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 June, 1994: Friedman legislation passes Assembly.  
</P>
<P>
 August, 1994: Friedman legislation passes Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 September, 1994: County Board of Supervisors votes to fund leasing of one 
CL-215 for up to three months beginning in October. Gov. Wilson signs law 
enabling state to lease two Super Scoopers for 1995 and 1996 fire seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 October, 1994: Canadair provides two planes for testing and evaluation. 
California insurance industry contributes to funding.  
</P>
<P>
 * * Length 65 feet * Wingspan 94 feet * Weight: 43,850 pounds 
</P>
<P>
 * Fuel capacity: 1,530 gallons, enough to permit four hours of flight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water storage capacity: Two tanks hold 1,410 gallons, about the same as 43 
bathtubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foam storage capacity: Two tanks hold 159 gallons.  
</P>
<P>
 * Crew: Two Canadian pilots and one from L.A. County Fire Department per 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leasing cost: Three months for $719,000 for two crews and mechanics, plus 
$515 an hour in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase price: $16.5 million. * Baffle: Excess water drains through baffle 
</P>
<P>
 * Scoops: Water rushes into tanks through a pair of 3-by-5-inch scoops. * 
Water drop doors: Two doors open to release water. * Fuselage: Like a giant 
pontoon, the unusual shape permits water landings and takeoffs. * Wingtip 
pontoons: Provide added stability. The Scoop 
</P>
<P>
 The county Fire Department has identified up to 15 local bodies of water from 
which the plane can scoop, including the ocean. The body of water must be at 
least 4,000 feet long, 300 feet wide and six feet deep. It can scoop in head 
winds to 45 m.p.h. and waves to five feet. Pilots change technique in high-wave 
conditions, scooping across crest of waves instead of bouncing from wave to 
wave. Here's what takes place: 
</P>
<P>
 1. As plane skims water at 100 m.p.h., pilot lowers the two 3-by-5-inch 
scoops. (A) 
</P>
<P>
 2. Water rushes through scoops into two storage tanks (B). 
</P>
<P>
 3. In about 10 seconds, tank is full and plane rises off water. The Drop 
</P>
<P>
 With small spotter plane leading the way, the Super Scooper begins its drop of 
water or water and foam from as low as 150 feet. Foam is often used ininitial 
attack on a fire. It is a soapy concentrate that helps water "cling" to 
vegetation. 1. Pilot opens water drop doors, releasing water onto fire. 2. If 
foam is used, pilot uses control that injects foam concentrate from its storage 
tank (C) into water tank. Upon release, mixture puffs up to 25 times its 
volume.

<P>
 A Superior Court jury awarded $270,000 Monday to two women who contended they 
were wrongfully fired from their jobs as graphic artists for The Orange County 
Register because of false perceptions about their sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Patt Buchanan and Claudia Piras alleged in their suit that Pinkerton Inc. 
guards at the Register wrote reports and spread rumors that they had seen the 
two women engaged in intimate acts inside a car in the paper's parking lot, 
their attorney, Tom Chun, said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also alleged that they were fired May 11, 1992, without adequate review, 
even though they had received good performance reviews and merit raises. 
</P>
<P>
 After about eight hours of deliberations, the jury found that Pinkerton Inc. 
had defamed the two women and that the Register had discriminated against them 
on the basis of their perceived sexual orientation, Chun said. The jury also 
found that terms of their employment had been violated, Chun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Register Publisher R. David Threshie said in a statement that he was 
"dumbfounded" by the verdict and that their sexual orientation had "absolutely 
nothing to do with the firing." 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper indicated it was considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry J. Cohen, an attorney for Pinkerton, declined comment except to say the 
company is also considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Chun said Buchanan, 39, is married and Piras, 32, has been living with her 
boyfriend for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton was ordered to pay $100,000 of the total award, while Freedom 
Newspapers Inc., the parent company of the Register, was ordered to pay the 
remaining $170,000, Chun said. ANNA CEKOLA

 A former library employee has been sentenced to six months in custody after 
pleading guilty to taking more than $40,000 worth of books, videos, compact 
discs and cassettes from a Garden Grove branch over a four-year period, the 
district attorney's office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin F. Meza, 28, also was ordered to pay full restitution and more than 
$3,400 in administrative fees to the Orange County Library in connection with 
the felony grand-theft case, Deputy Dist. Atty.Mike Fell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, who entered his plea and was sentenced Friday, may possibly 
serve his jail sentence through a home-confinement program, Fell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meza was working at an Orange County Library branch, 11200 Stanford Ave., at 
the time of the thefts, Fell said. Sheriff's deputies investigating the case 
recovered almost all the stolen materials, many of which were stored a rented 
locker in Kansas, he said.ANNA CEKOLA

<P>
 The Weingart Foundation of Los Angeles has presented Orange Coast College with 
$100,000 to help construct a new children's center on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has collected $1.1 million toward the construction of the 
$2-million facility, said Doug Bennett, an executive director of the Orange 
Coast College Foundation.The center will provide affordable child-development 
services to the children of parents enrolled at the college. 
</P>
<P>
 The current children's center consists of trailers and surplus buildings that 
have been acquired over the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Children between 6 months and 5 years are cared for during the fall and spring 
semesters, while 6- to 11-year-olds are taken care of during the summer 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center, expected to be finished by next fall, will be on the southern 
edge of campus just off Merrimac Way, next to the college's Early Childhood Lab 
School. The lab school, which enrolls several hundred children annually, is a 
training laboratory for the college's Early Childhood Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited about the grant. It represents a milestone in our 
campaign to raise the money," said Jeff Hyder, president of Orange Coast 
College's foundation board. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; OFFICIALS PRAISE SCHOOL'S MENTAL HEALTH

<P>
 School officials are hailing a children's mental health clinic that opened at 
Thurston Middle School recently as a positive aftereffect of last year's 
firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 A longstanding plan to establish a permanent counseling center for local youth 
was kicked into high gear after the fire.The blaze, which damaged or destroyed 
441 homes in and around Laguna Beach, created considerable stress for many 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the district established a permanent clinic at Thurston to serve 
the continuing mental health needs of the district's students and their 
families. The Orange County Health Care Agency staffs the clinic in return for 
the donated space. 
</P>
<P>
 "The permanent clinic will serve a variety of counseling needs," said Nancy 
Hubbell, district psychologist and director of special services. "It's not just 
fire-related." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project, district workers plan to create a manual and training 
program for other districts that will detail what Laguna Beach school 
administrators and counselors have discovered about post-disaster counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned some things we'd like to be able to share," Hubbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the building has been in place since the start of the school year, 
the formal opening -- attended by county Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and state 
Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) -- took place Oct. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is being called the John E. Martin Youth and Family Counseling 
Center in honor of the head of Taco Bell Corp., for his ongoing financial 
support of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Local fund-raising efforts generated $57,000 to refurbish the portable 
building for the clinic and move it to the middle school campus. Martin has 
given $12,500 and has pledged to raise $25,000 a year for the next three years.

 A 19-year-old man died Monday morning after losing control of his vehicle on 
the Santa Ana Freeway and swerving into a truck, the California Highway Patrol 
said.

 John Michael McGlone of Laguna Hills was pronounced dead at the scene after 
the left side of his car "hit the front wheel of a big-rig truck and went under 
the rear trailer," CHP Officer Michael Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rear wheels of the truck "went over the top of the car," crushing the left 
side, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was heading south on the freeway north of Lake Forest Drive at 9:45 
a.m. when he apparently lost control, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 No other injuries were reported. The truck driver, who was in the inside lane 
going about 55 m.p.h., was not cited, Lundquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Sabol, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department, said there 
was evidence that a fire had broken out after the collision, possibly due to a 
gasoline spill. But it was under control by the time the firefighters arrived, 
she said. THAO HUA

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CCC TO HIRE 60 FOR QUAKE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Conservation Corps is looking to hire 60 young, out-of-work men 
and women to spend the next six months working on local earthquake recovery 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The CCC's Northridge Earthquake Recovery Program will pay $7 an hour, 40 hours 
a week to qualified applicants who will retrofit quake-damaged structures, 
remove debris, knock down quake-battered chimneys and perform other tasks in 
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for people who have been out of work for a long time," said 
Abby Ybarra, project coordinator. "This experience hopefully will prepare them 
to be more marketable in the job market." 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must be between the ages of 18 and 26 and meet one of two criteria: 
They must be unemployed due to earthquake and plant closures or unemployed for 
15 of the last 26 weeks and unlikely to return to their previous occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective corps members must apply in person at Window C of the Employment 
Development Department office, 1520 San Fernando Road, San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours are Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The deadline to apply 
is Nov. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 If accepted, applicants will begin a two-week training course Dec. 5, followed 
by six months of work in quake-damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Corps members may learn skills such as carpentry, painting and how to use 
heavy machinery in projects for the cities of San Fernando, Burbank, Santa 
Clarita and Santa Monica, Ybarra said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a salary and skills, corps members can earn holiday and medical 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 They also will receive career-planning instruction and have an opportunity to 
pursue a high school diploma or its equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge Earthquake Recovery Program is funded under a one-year, 
$2-million grant from the federal Job Training Partnership Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Ybarra said the program has hired 118 youths since its beginning May 31. JEFF

DRIVER WITH BAD BRAKES CHARGED IN DEATH OF GIRL, 7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Pedro man whose car struck and killed a 7-year-old girl in September 
after careening down a San Pedro hill has been charged with felony vehicular 
manslaughter because he allegedly failed to fix his bad brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The brakes on Gary M. Hartman's car were "badly worn and grossly out of 
adjustment" when the Sept. 26 accident occurred and reportedly had been that 
way for at least two months, Los Angeles Police Detective Jim Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can drive around for a little bit with bad brakes, but two months is way 
beyond what a reasonable person would do," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Hartman told police the car's brakes required repeated pumping 
before the car stopped, Dawson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, 31, who also was charged with misdemeanor reckless driving, has not 
entered a plea in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Ramirez of San Pedro was killed and her sister, Gizelle, 8, suffered 
serious leg injuries when Hartman's 1965 International Travelall struck the 
girls as they waited to cross the street at South Alma and 19th streets on 
their way to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman is being held in lieu of $25,000 bail.

DERAILMENT CLOGS BUSY BOULEVARD; WRECK: CLEANUP BEGINS AFTER SUNDAY NIGHT 
ACCIDENT THAT SPILLED 10 TRAIN CARS ONTO A STREET IN CITY OF INDUSTRY. NO 
INJURIES ARE REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Along a strip of Valley Boulevard in the City of Industry, an army of cranes, 
bulldozers and workers Monday tried to clear away thousands of tons of twisted 
steel left after 10 cars of a 31-car Southern Pacific train derailed Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the derailment remained under investigation. No injuries were 
reported. Officials and onlookers expressed relief that the massive wreck 
seemed to cause only traffic gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
 One block of the busy thoroughfare, between 2nd and Puente avenues, was closed 
while more than 175 workers tried to clear the debris, tying up rush-hour 
traffic and forcing buses to be rerouted. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Southern Pacific said Valley Boulevard should be cleared by 
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Though eight barrels of acid were on-board the freight train, health officials 
said there seemed to be no health risk and no hazardous spills. But they kept 
their eyes on the cloudy skies because four barrels contained powder that 
becomes corrosive when mixed with water. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents, watching workers lift pieces of the mile-long train, said 
things could have been much worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a lot of screeching, a long, forever sound," said Rey Gomez, who 
lives in the Industry Inn, a residential hotel across from where the train 
jumped the tracks. "I remember thinking if this is a train, I hope it's not 
going to hit this hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 The cars derailed about 9:15 p.m. The train was hauling 30 tons of freight 
from Memphis, Tenn., to Long Beach. Michael Irvine, a superintendent at 
Southern Pacific Lines, said its two crew members -- the engineer and conductor 
-- were in the locomotive. He said there was no indication that the derailment 
was caused by human error, and he doubted that the train had a problem because 
it had been previously inspected. The railroad will turn over its inspection 
report to federal transportation safety officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Elma Rangel was at the stoplight at Valley Boulevard and Puente Avenue on 
Sunday night when she heard a loud, pounding sound behind her and saw dust 
filling the air. "The dust was all the way up, like a fire," said the woman, 
who lives across the street from the site. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cars tumbled from the tracks, they sent wheels spinning into the middle 
of Valley Boulevard. No property damage was visible Monday. Although police 
dogs continued to sniff through the wreckage for possible bodies, officials 
said there seemed to be no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup prevented some residents from leaving their homes for work. For 
those going to work in other parts of town, the closing of Valley Boulevard was 
a major headache. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's right up there with when the (Northridge) earthquake hit," said Salvador 
Cardona, whose commuting time from San Gabriel to the City of Industry doubled.

 A Los Angeles firefighter was in good condition Monday after receiving 
second-degree burns while battling a house fire that caused $100,000 in damage 
and left a family of five homeless, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighter, whose name was not released pending notification of 
relatives, was burned on the neck. He was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical 
Center, Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out Sunday night about 8 p.m. at 20220 Arminta St., Wells said, 
and by the time firefighters arrived, they found the one-story family dwelling 
engulfed with flames. The family is believed to be staying with relatives. The 
cause of the blaze is unknown. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PHOTOS CAPTURE CHILDREN'S VIEW OF SHELTER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pictures in a photography exhibit that opened Monday at the Sherman Oaks 
Library are similar to those you'd see at any art show. The images are 
well-composed, capture the mood of their subjects and are technically 
well-executed. 
</P>
<P>
 The only differences are that some of the photographers are as young as 5 
years old and all are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Using black-and-white film, the children captured the lives of their families, 
their friends and employees at the Trudy and Norman Louis Valley Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures, all taken by children 5 to 15 living at the North Hollywood 
shelter, will be on view until Dec. 2 at the library, 14245 Moorpark St. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographers are students in an unusual photography class at the shelter 
conducted by Van Nuys photographer Venida Korda. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a month, Korda hands out automatic cameras to the 15 kids in the 
program, offers a few pointers on how to use them, then sets the children loose 
to take pictures in and around the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter, located on Lankershim Boulevard, provides 80 apartments to those 
in need of emergency housing. Families may stay for up to 90 days.  
</P>
<P>
 The activity gives kids something positive to do and fosters self-esteem, say 
Korda and Allison Lee, an administrator at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often, homeless children don't have a voice in what's going on in their 
lives," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives them a way to express themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 And express themselves they do. 
</P>
<P>
 In one photograph, the lines of a telephone pole and bisecting power lines 
form contrasting angles, with further contrast created by a flat sky and a 
roughly textured wall. In another, a group of smiling children pose with their 
arms around one another. In yet another, a girl of about 5 or 6 stands at a 
gate, looking soberly at her chronicler, who also happens to be a 6-year-old 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because you get to take pictures of whatever you like to take 
pictures of," said Abraham Higuera, 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Korda started the program in July, 1993, with a $2,100 grant from the Los 
Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, which renewed the program for this year. 
Musician Graham Nash, of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young fame, is another sponsor. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Korda used to come by every week on Wednesday afternoons, but since the Los 
Angeles Unified School District discontinued its on-site school at the shelter 
about a month ago, she switched to every other Saturday to accommodate the 
students' tighter schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the project has continued in the same format for more than a year, 
the children still enjoy the activity, Korda said. When she arrives at the 
shelter for her sessions, she feels like "the Pied Piper." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if they know about the impact of their photos," Korda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them they're educating people like me what their life is like in the 
shelter." KAY HWANGBO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; FOUNTAIN DEATH CASE IS SETTLED, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a 4-year-old boy who was killed when part of a concrete fountain 
fell on him settled a wrongful death lawsuit against two companies Monday for 
$975,000, their lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement between the family of John Dutriz and Lloyd's Nursery and 
Landscape Co. and Santi's Fountains came moments before the start of a 
scheduled Orange County Superior Court trial, attorney Thierry Colaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the companies could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was playing an Easter Egg game with his 7-year-old sister and a young 
friend in May, 1991, when part of a heavy, three-tier fountain in the back yard 
of his family's Irvine home fell on him. The boy was apparently trying to 
retrieve a ball that had landed in the fountain when he was crushed by the two 
top sections of the fountain, Colaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy died in the arms of his mother who, except for special occasions, 
didn't even keep water in the fountain because she was afraid the children 
could drown in it, Colaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family contended in the lawsuit that the installer and manufacturer of the 
fountain failed to take steps necessary to properly secure the tiers to prevent 
them from falling, Colaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an issue of consumer safety," he said. ANNA CEKOLA

<P>
 The City Council has approved a total of $100,000 in grants to nine community 
programs aimed at preventing youth crime and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-two organizations vied for the Community Youth Program grants, which are 
intended to provide training for parents of "high-risk" youths and to expand 
recreational programs for those in grades four through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizations were picked by a community services commissioner, a 
child-care committee member and a community services staff member, based on 
recommendations from the Safe Community Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the city's family programs are already "preaching to the choir," 
Councilman Greg Smith said. "We were very frustrated that there was nothing for 
families at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the seven grants, amounting to $31,545, was awarded to the UC 
Irvine Child Development Center. The center will work with the Irvine Unified 
School District to identify 80 high-risk families for parent training to 
prevent delinquency, school dropouts, early parenthood and antisocial behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council gave $21,500 to Community Services Programs Inc., which will 
provide training for parents of high-risk youths between the ages of 12 and 18. 
A $5,000 grant will go to the Orange County Bar Foundation for parent workshops 
on legal rights and responsibilities that will be taught in Spanish, 
Vietnamese, Farsi and Chinese, as well as English. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreational program grants were awarded to the Woodbridge Village Assn., Camp 
Fire, Northwood Productions, Irvine Boys and Girls Club, Irvine Roller Hockey 
Assn. and Team UCI. RUSS LOAR ORANGE COUNTY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; POLL DUE ON BANNING CIGARETTE MACHINES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Costa Mesa substance abuse committee will poll as many 
residents as they can about whether cigarette machines should be banned 
throughout the city or just where minors have access to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members convened last week at City Hall to hammer out the questions 
in the poll, results of which will be sent to the City Council for review after 
today's election, said Karen Ursini, chairwoman of the five-member group. 
</P>
<P>
 "But all this may be a moot point if Proposition 188 passes," said Ursini, 
referring to the initiative that would repeal all local ordinances on smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative does not pass, then cities can enact local smoking 
ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 The substance abuse committee asked the City Council a month ago to consider 
passing an ordinance that would ban tobacco vending machines from the city, 
contending minors too often are able to purchase cigarettes. The council said 
it would study the matter at one of its future study sessions.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; PANEL TO HEAR IDEAS FOR SKATEBOARD PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is considering building a skateboard park where teen-age 
skateboarders could safely practice their twists and turns without bothering 
local merchants and customers by hanging out in parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 An architect will present a concept design for a wooden skateboard park at the 
Parks and Recreation Commission meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The skateboard ramps and tunnels are proposed for Crown Valley Community Park, 
said Kerry Bartelt, the parks and recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the idea is to model the park after a YMCA-managed skateboard park in 
Encinitas, where some Laguna Niguel skateboarders have traveled to hone their 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be exciting things for them to do in a managed situation," 
Bartelt said. Safety is ensured, she added, because "they check if you have 
elbow pads and a helmet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartelt said there is no cost estimate yet for such a park. A concrete 
skateboard park in Huntington Beach cost $80,000, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All teen-age skateboarders are invited to tell the recreation commission what 
they would like to see in a skateboard park. The commission will meet at 7 p.m. 
in the City Council chambers, 27801 La Paz Road.LYNN FRANEY

 The City Council has approved the first phase of a downtown sign program 
designed to show visitors how to find local historic landmarks other than 
Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also includes 10,000 brochures for walking tours of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week approved the program and budgeted $12,400 for the first 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff has proposed that signs be set up at key spots to alert tourists 
and other visitors to particular buildings of note and to the Los Rios Historic 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual signs are envisioned to hold names of several sites and would 
replace a smattering of signs already in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Informational maps will be posted on decorative poles in areas of heavy 
pedestrian traffic. JEFF BEAN

 An opportunity for senior citizens to improve their driving skills and qualify 
for insurance discounts is available through driving courses that will be held 
this month throughout South County. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day course focuses on helping senior citizens compensate for slowing 
reflexes and vision problems, and it informs participants about Department of

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; COMMUNITY JOINS IN TREE-PLANTING EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a new philosophy in many communities these days: If you want 
something done to improve your community, don't expect your fiscally strapped 
city government to do it; raise money and do it yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy guided a group of Agoura Hills residents who wanted to replace 
trees around the city that had died because of lack of maintenance and other 
causes. The residents said they knew that the city, battling a deficit, was in 
no position to help. 
</P>
<P>
 So the residents began a fund-raising campaign that they say has raised 
$1,800. Last week, they held a ceremony for the planting of the first tree on 
Kanan Road near Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way it is going to happen in the future, with the privatization 
of things," said Dan Kuperberg, chairman of the city's Community Services 
Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 For $50, donors can have a tree planted in their names, commemorated with a 
plaque installed on a nearby sidewalk, said Carol Rosenberg, the co-chairwoman 
along with Darlene Ballman of a citizens committee trying to increase the 
number of trees in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward purchasing the trees, which cost about $20 to $30 
each, Rosenberg said. The $50 covers the purchase and planting of the trees and 
purchase of the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree and plaque serve as a fitting memorial to loved ones, said Rosenberg. 
Many of the people who have donated are using the trees as monuments to those 
who have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Gowland of Santa Monica said she and her husband, Peter, will have a 
tree planted in honor of the late Frank Rosenthal, the father of their 
granddaughter, Tracy Rosenthal of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracy was very close to her father," said Gowland. "They got along 
beautifully. She is very much like him in her love of people and her sense of 
humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, a Santa Monica native, moved to South Carolina in 1992, where he 
died Aug. 5 at age 53, said Gowland. The Gowlands' daughter, Ann, was married 
to Rosenthal for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tree is like a connection to Frank," said Gowland. "We very much feel 
that we are all part of the earth. It's like a circle: We came from the earth 
and we are going to return to it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second phase of the program, expected to begin in early spring, trees 
will be planted in the parks as well as along the streets, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trees are London planes, similar to sycamores, growing to about 40 feet, 
with a 30- to 40-foot crown, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions for the tree program can be mailed to TREE, c/o City of Agoura 
Hills, 30101 Agoura Court, Suite 102, Agoura Hills, 91301. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the fund-raising effort has allowed the city to qualify for 
matching grants from the federal government, administered through a state 
program called California Relief, Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it shows how strong the community feels about this," she said. "The 
seeds that we have planted will ensure a beautiful Agoura Hills of the future."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; CITY SAYS IT'S AHEAD OF GOAL, RECYCLING 26% OF 
TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 City officials said in a recent report that the city is more than meeting a 
state law that orders cutbacks in the amount of trash collected and seeks more 
recycling of solid waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law requires that all cities reduce waste disposal by 25% by 1995.In 
the report, city officials said that La Palma is recycling about 26% of its 50 
tons of daily trash. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's report also said that La Palma will be recycling 50% of its trash 
by the year 2000. The state law requires at least a 50% cutback in trash by 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Recycling for the city is accomplished by the city's contract garbage hauler, 
Park Disposal Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask residents to help the process by sorting their recyclable trash when 
they put it out, but whether they do this or not, the city's trash is separated 
on big conveyor belts at a (trash) transfer station in Stanton," said City 
Manager Pamela Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that for the city to reach its goal of recycling 50% of its trash by 
the year 2000, the focus has to be on "green waste." Gibson said green waste 
includes grass clippings, tree limbs, leaves and other refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a residential community such as ours, a great deal of the trash comes from 
green waste, and so this is what is going to be our big challenge in years 
ahead," she said. BILL BILLITER

DOGS TO SNIFF NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL CAMPUSES FOR DRUGS; EDUCATION: COSTA MESA AND 
NEWPORT BEACH POLICE ANIMAL HANDLERS WILL CHECK LOCKERS AND AUTOS. TRUSTEES 
ALSO WENT ON RECORD TO OPPOSE PROPOSITION 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A policy to use drug-sniffing dogs at all high school and middle school 
campuses was adopted Monday on a 5-2 vote in a special meeting of the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District board.  
</P>
<P>
 And by the same ratio, the board passed a resolution opposing Proposition 187, 
the state ballot initiative that would deny state welfare, education and 
non-emergency medical care services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward H. Decker said the move to bring dogs to the schools 
"will, hopefully, keep drugs off the campuses. We do have drugs in the 
community. We have to take action so that the 99.9% of the students who wish 
the campuses to remain drug free can be confident of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Sherry Loofbourrow and Martha Fluor steadfastly opposed the 
policy from its inception, noting the use of dogs could create a climate of 
suspicion at the schools and the policy fails to address the primary 
substance-abuse problems among teen-agers: alcohol and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely believe in holding students accountable, but not in ending the 
message that everyone is suspected of wrongdoing," Loofbourrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan developed from an offer by the Costa Mesa Police Department to 
provide the dogs on campuses in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's meeting came on the eve of an election that will see at least three 
new trustees on the seven-member board. Loofbourrow and Forrest K. Werner 
decided early on not to run again and 28-year veteran Roderick H. MacMillian 
dropped out of the race mid-campaign, citing a heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan will take effect in the spring semester. The board will evaluate the 
program at the end of the school year before deciding whether to make it 
permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 During the spring, Costa Mesa and Newport Beach police dog handlers will bring 
the animals onto each high school and middle school campus once to sniff for 
drugs that may be hidden in lockers and autos on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 If drugs are found, students will be disciplined and offered counseling 
through school district programs rather than arrested, unless the quantity is 
in for-sale quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also voted to oppose Proposition 187, the so-called "Save Our State" 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor said the ballot initiative would fragment families and put an 
unreasonable burden on district employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is forcing our teachers to go above and beyond their duty, which is to 
educate our children and provide role models. It forces them to be reporting 
agents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loofbourrow also opposed Proposition 187, saying the district stands to lose 
$2.5 million in the next school year alone, counting the lost federal funds and 
the cost of student verification. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Jim de Boom and Judith A. Franco said they will vote for the 
initiative and voted against the district's resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we are a nation of laws, and yet nearly 2 million illegal 
immigrants live in California. Every year another 100,000 come," Franco said.  
</P>
<P>
 Franco said 93% of the cost of these immigrants falls to legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 De Boom said the measure would force the federal government's hand at 
controlling the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing that 187 has done so far is to get the federal government to at 
least make an effort at closing the borders," he said.

VIDEO INTERVIEW SYSTEM LINKS INMATES, OFFICIALS ACROSS MILES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Miguel Ibarra was not quite sure what he was looking at. All he saw when he 
was brought from his cell at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho to talk to his 
probation officer for the first time Monday was a booth with a phone handset 
and a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" asked the 18-year-old convicted drug offender, looking dubiously 
at a grainy on-screen image of a woman taking a seat. 
</P>
<P>
 A few moments later, Ibarra picked up the handset and began a 20-minute 
conversation with the probation officer on the Los Angeles County Justice Video 
Interview System. The computerized system -- which county officials said is the 
first to be used by any law enforcement agency in the nation -- allows inmates 
at Pitchess to converse on screen with public defenders and probation officers 
40 miles away in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trip," he said afterward. "I always thought of it as something I would 
see in the future. I guess it's here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Video telephone systems that use traditional television images have been used 
for arraignments and other minor hearings in courtrooms nationwide, including 
those in Glendale, for about 10 years, said James Boyer, division manager for 
the county's Information Technology Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Pitchess system -- which transmits digitalized data over 
telephone lines -- has the potential for cheaper and more widespread use. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities estimate that the computerized system, which cost $250,000, will 
save $500,000 in transportation and related costs at Pitchess next year. 
Inmates will not have to be bused Downtown, and county legal personnel will not 
have to drive to and from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said it is important for probation officers and others to see 
inmates because it helps judge their credibility.

COURT INTERPRETER IS SENTENCED TO JAIL; COURTS: CHONG WOON KIM PLEADED NO 
CONTEST TO MISTRANSLATING A VICTIM'S TESTIMONY IN A DOMESTIC ABUSE CASE. HE IS 
SENTENCED TO 10 DAYS, FINED $2,700.

 A Korean language court interpreter was sentenced to 10 days in jail and 500 
hours of community service Monday after pleading no contest to mistranslating a 
victim's testimony in a domestic abuse case and trying to persuade her to 
testify falsely. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell Block also barred the defendant, Chong 
Woon Kim, 57, from working as an interpreter for the courts or any law 
enforcement agency during the 36 months Kim is on probation. Under terms of the 
probation, Kim must pay $2,700 in fines and make a $1,000 contribution to a 
battered women's program operation by the Center for Asian Pacific Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stemmed from the criminal case of Michael Lim, 20, of Woodland 
Hills, who was charged with the April kidnap, rape and torture of a former 
girlfriend. According to police and prosecutors, Lim abducted the woman from 
the Wilshire district on April 1 and brought her to his apartment, where he 
used a knife to cut off her hair, raped her and beat her with a metal bar for 
two days. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim was arrested when he took the woman to a supermarket to buy food so she 
could cook for him. Instead, she broke free. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Deputy City Atty. Kjehl Johansen, when the woman testified a 
month later at Lim's preliminary hearing, Kim erroneously interpreted her words 
to place the defendant in a more favorable light. 
</P>
<P>
 A Korean-speaking court clerk who happened to be in the courtroom brought the 
bad translation to the attention of court officials. Other witnesses said they 
had seen Kim talking with the defendant's family members, and that they had 
heard Kim tell the victim that she should testify that she had no memory of the 
alleged rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim pleaded guilty Friday to beating the woman, but the more serious charges 
were dismissed under a plea bargain agreement when the victim refused to return 
from Korea to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim received two years in state prison.

GARDENER DENIES SEXUALLY ABUSING DOG

<P>
 A Northridge gardener pleaded not guilty in Van Nuys Municipal Court on Monday 
to charges he sexually abused a German shepherd named Bubu. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Mathias, 46, returns to court Dec. 12 for further hearings in a case in 
which he has been charged with five counts of animal abuse and five counts of 
sexually assaulting an animal, Deputy City Atty.Don Cocek said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cocek, Mathias appeared every Monday at 9 a.m. at the Van Nuys 
apartment complex where Bubu, now about 18 months old, lived with his owner. 
The prosecutor declined to identify the owner, who told police a roommate's 
mother told him in June that she had seen the gardener having sex with the dog. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The owner was disbelieving at first, but became suspicious when his roommate 
also said he had witnessed a sexual encounter between Bubu and the gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocek said the owner witnessed the gardener's sexual activity with the 
100-pound male canine on five consecutive Mondays. On the advice of police, the 
owner videotaped a final incident, and a citizen's arrest was made on Oct. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 After the encounters with Bubu, Cocek said, the gardener would resume working.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; TARZANA WHISTLE BLOWER FINDS VICTORY IN LAWSUIT BITTERSWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1986, Congress amended the federal False Claims Act to encourage more 
"whistle-blower lawsuits," in which workers in defense-related industries 
testify against their employers to root out fraud in government contracts. 
Since then, more than 500 such cases have been filed and more than $500 million 
recovered, much of which was kept by the whistle blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarzana resident Sohrab Haroonian didn't go straight to the government. He 
says he objected when his supervisors at Elmo Semiconductor Corp. in Burbank 
asked him, a senior test engineer, to write false reports saying that 
components had passed inspections when they had not. He told upper management 
he had seen his supervisors change test results to conceal defective parts and 
witnessed the improper disposal of parts that had failed electrical tests. 
</P>
<P>
 After bringing up the discrepancies several times, Haroonian says, he was 
demoted from his $48,000-a-year position to a job in the company's inventory 
department, and in July, 1990, he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month -- more than four years since Haroonian's termination -- a Glendale 
Superior Court jury ordered Elmo Semiconductor to pay him $200,000 in lost 
wages and $150,000 for emotional distress. But Haroonian, 38, says the victory 
is bittersweet. Despite having a degree in electrical engineering and 14 years 
experience in his field, he says the stigma of being a whistle blower who filed 
a wrongful-termination suit has been a major obstacle to finding new work. 
</P>
<P>
 Elmo Semiconductor procures semiconductor parts, tests them for military and 
civilian use and distributes them. It also procures, tests and distributes 
parts for medical devices. Attorneys for the company have said they intend to 
appeal the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Haroonian, who has lived with his parents since losing 
his job, described what he saw taking place at the company and the effect his 
legal action has had on his personal and professional life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: When did you first sense that something illegal was occurring within 
the company?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It was a lot of incidents, not just one or two. Sometime late in 1989 
I realized that people in management were cheating and trying to have the 
engineers falsify documents. I was in charge of the testing in my department, 
and I complained to them that they could not do that, because these parts were 
going to be used for military applications. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first incidents I complained about was a test we conducted on parts 
for General Dynamics. Then there were some more incidents that I confronted 
them with, and finally they transferred me to a position in inventory. And 
later they fired me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What led you to believe you should pursue legal action?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What I did at the beginning, while I was still working for Elmo, was 
consult with an attorney as to what I should do, because I really cared about 
the people out there. These parts were not going to be used for trucks or toys. 
I was especially concerned about the shipping of parts that are used in the 
medical field, for pacemakers and heart valves. I have a good friend whose 
father is like my own father to me, and he had a heart valve. And every time I 
would look at him, I couldn't bear it because one day one of these parts could 
end up in his heart -- I would be responsible. Elmo was shipping these parts 
untested, and it was a really bad feeling. While I was consulting with the 
attorney, I also reported these things to the Department of Defense. I had a 
meeting with one of their agents, and he looked at some of the documents I had 
at the time, but I'm not aware of whether there was any further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did your co-workers view your actions?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I had several engineers reporting to me, and one problem was that the upper 
management would bypass me and tell my engineers to falsify documents. They 
didn't like it, and they were complaining too. And as I said, there were a lot 
of incidents. One day I confronted them and said, "You cannot tell my engineers 
to falsify documents." I think most of them supported me. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a couple of my engineers quit, and one of them came to court and 
actually testified against the company in the trial. He said he saw the 
falsifications, exactly as I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One of the attorneys for Elmo Semiconductor described you as a person who 
"sees a conspiracy behind every bush."  
</P>
<P>
 A: What they're trying to do is cover up what's going on, but I'm 100% sure of 
what I saw. It was my job, and I have a lot of experience in engineering. I've 
worked with RCA Corp.; I've worked with Rockwell International, and I know 
exactly how to test parts, and I know when there's falsification. And that's 
what Elmo was doing -- falsifying documents and cheating, because they wanted 
to ship parts, that's all they wanted to do. And it was wrong to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has becoming a whistle blower affected your personal life?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Because of the lawsuit, I am not able to find an engineering job. Elmo is a 
company that distributes parts to a lot of companies, including other 
contractors, and every single one of them, they know about the case. Prior to 
the lawsuit, when I was still working for Elmo, I had offers every two or three 
weeks. Headhunters called me all the time. But now no one wants to talk 
anymore. And of course the economy is tough now, so it's a combination of the 
job market and the lawsuit.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How have you supported yourself since leaving the company?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My family and my parents have helped me a lot. And I had some savings at 
the beginning, but that's gone now. But if it weren't for my family I could not 
have done it. There were other engineers that had the same feelings, but they 
couldn't do it because they had their families to support.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does the future hold for you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm still looking for an engineering job, believe it or not. I sent out a 
bunch of resumes last week, and I'm hoping something will come of that. Even 
though I have a settlement, I was hoping I would be working again. My life has 
changed, it's not the same anymore.

HERNANDEZ ASSOCIATE GETS PROBATION IN TAX EVASION SCHEME 
</P>

 The former mortgage broker to socialite Danny Hernandez was sentenced Monday 
to two years of probation for bilking the federal government out of almost 
$85,000 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Cassidy, 35, had pleaded guilty in U.S. Federal Court in August to two 
counts of income tax evasion for lying on his tax forms in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Wolfe, who prosecuted the case, called the crimes 
"a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until he committed these offenses, he'd been completely law-abiding and even 
admirable, very hard-working," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 As mortgage broker for Hernandez, of Mission Viejo, Cassidy worked out a 
scheme in which Hernandez understated his taxable income by hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy told the Internal Revenue Service that he paid Hernandez $257,000 in 
commissions for referring mortgage business to him. Hernandez backed up the 
claim to legitimize some of the exorbitant income he was making from stealing 
nearly $8 million from the Santa Fe Springs precious metals company where he 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez received a 71-month prison sentence in April after pleading guilty 
to mail fraud and money laundering. His wife, Susie Hernandez, was sentenced to 
16 months for her role in the scheme.  
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, of Encinitas, had faced up to 10 years in a federal prison and 
$500,000 in fines. Prosecutors were satisfied with his relatively light 
sentence, which included a $100 fine, because of his ready admission that he 
committed the crimes when he was confronted by IRS investigators and his 
agreement to cooperate in the government's case against Hernandez, Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy has since made total restitution, Wolfe said, including tens of 
thousands of dollars in penalties and interest.

2 SUPERVISORS WANT FRIDAY OFFICE CLOSINGS DISCONTINUED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to end the debate over a controversial work plan, two county 
supervisors announced Monday that they support giving employees flexible work 
hours so long as county offices remain open five days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. Stanton stated in a joint news 
release that the 22-month-old work plan, which closes county offices on 
alternate Fridays, is a failure and should be discontinued. They said the plan 
did not reach its proposed cost savings goal of at least $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I object to is the locking of doors every other Friday," Stanton said. 
"Closing the doors is not what the people want." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Stanton and Wieder suggest that county department heads give 
employees the option of working 80 hours for nine days over two weeks, provided 
that they have enough staff on hand to stay open every working weekday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is expected to decide today whether to continue the 
work plan. In addition to Wieder and Stanton, Supervisor William G. Steiner has 
indicated that he favors keeping offices open every weekday but also believes 
employees should have flexible hours if they want them. Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley supports the current plan and Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez has been 
studying the merits of both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current plan, nearly three dozen county facilities, offering 
services such as welfare assistance, health care, building permits and tax 
collection, are shut down every other Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three weeks, Stanton has assailed two county staff reports on the 
plan because he said they were misleading and did not accurately calculate the 
cost savings of the plan. He said his own analysis of the program showed that 
it did not save the county any money and may have actually cost the county as 
much as $500,000.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; VIDEO PHONE IN USE AT PITCHESS; TECHNOLOGY: 
THE COMPUTERIZED DEVICE ALLOWS INMATES AT THE HONOR RANCHO TO SEE AND TALK WITH 
THEIR PUBLIC DEFENDERS AND PROBATION OFFICERS 40 MILES AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel Ibarra wasn't quite sure what he was looking at. All he saw when he was 
brought from his cell at Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho to talk to his 
probation officer for the first time Monday was a booth with a phone handset 
and a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" asked the 18-year-old drug offender, looking dubiously at the 
grainy image of a woman taking a seat directly in front of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 A few moments later, Ibarra picked up the handset and began a 20-minute 
face-to-face conversation with the probation officer on the Los Angeles County 
Justice Video Interview System. The computerized system -- which county 
officials say is the first to be used by a law-enforcement agency -- allows 
Pitchess inmates to converse on screen with public defenders and probation 
officers 40 miles away in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer images weren't perfect. In addition to being grainy, the frames 
were being transmitted at fewer than 30 per second, making the probation 
officer's movements look choppy. But Ibarra settled into a normal conversation 
with her after his first few minutes of uncertainty, focusing more on his legal 
concerns than the novelty of how he was voicing them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trip," he said afterward. "I always thought of it as something I would 
see in the future. I guess it's here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Video telephone systems that use traditional television images have been used 
for arraignments and other minor hearings in courtrooms across the country for 
10 years, including those in Glendale, said James Boyer, division manager for 
the county's Information Technology Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Pitchess system -- which transmits digital, or computerized, 
data over telephone lines -- has the potential for cheaper and more widespread 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect people all over the country will want these," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities estimate that the system, which costs $250,000, will save $500,000 
in transportation and related costs at Pitchess next year. Inmates can be 
interviewed without being bused Downtown, and county legal personnel do not 
have to spend hours driving to and from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said it is important for probation officers and other court 
personnel to see an inmate, rather than merely talk on the phone, because it 
helps to judge their character and credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The verbal part is 20% of it," said Errol Van Horne, operations lieutenant at 
Pitchess. "The person on the other end wants to see the reactions and 
expressions of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who was at Pitchess for a demonstration of 
the system Monday, added that the new system will help cut air pollution by 
keeping county cars and buses off the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horne said up to $2 million a year could be saved if plans to use the 
system are expanded to jails countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is built by a private firm, but because the county helped design 
it, the county treasury will receive 6% of the revenues from sales to other 
law-enforcement agencies nationwide, which could potentially generate millions 
of dollars, Boyer said. He said the money would likely be reinvested in more 
video telephone systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seven video telephones were placed at the Pitchess facility and two at the 
Hall of Records in Downtown Los Angeles for a test that started in April. 
Officials said the system is in constant use between its scheduled hours of 
7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., and they hope it can be expanded to courtrooms and other 
jails within the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is operated from the Hall of Records, where call times are 
scheduled and a computer dials the phones at the jail. The Downtown work 
stations resemble a typical computer desk with a camera lens above the monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pitchess, the units are more rugged. The equipment is enclosed in a thick 
metallic case about 5 feet high and 4 feet wide. Windows on the side of the 
booth are made of bulletproof glass, and a metal phone cord is only 18 inches 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone cord is of a specific length and makeup, so they can't tear it off 
and hurt somebody," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The monitor is at the center of the booth, and the camera above records 
inmates' movements through a small opening. At the lower right side of the 
console is a slot about 9 inches wide through which faxes can be sent and 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 The work stations are on wheels and can be moved to different locations, a 
significant advantage over custom studios that have to be constructed for 
traditional equipment, Van Horne said. 
</P>
<P>
 But like all high-tech equipment, it works best after a little experience. 
Sheriff Sherman Block, using the system for the first time Monday as he 
demonstrated it for reporters, made the mistake of standing in front of the 
Downtown computer terminal as he took a call from Antonovich at Pitchess. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a great stomach," Antonovich told the sheriff. "All I can see is 
your stomach and your coat, which is unbuttoned . . . and your chin."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SHERIFF HONORS ANTI-GANG VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Forty-nine volunteers credited with battling gang activity here were 
recognized Monday in an awards ceremony hosted by Sheriff Sherman Block and 
Santa Clarita officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Block thanked residents who have been involved with the Santa Clarita 
Anti-Gang Task Force, a group created in January, 1991, as part of an overall 
effort by the Sheriff's Department to get the public involved in crime 
awareness and prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised participants for their "recognition of the threat of gangs if left 
unattended" and for continuing their anti-crime efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working on the gang problem can be frustrating, and sometimes we don't see 
the results as quickly as we would like to," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 160 people have participated in activities planned by the Santa 
Clarita task force, ranging from cleaning up graffiti to successfully lobbying 
a clothing store chain to stop carrying T-shirts with logos believed to be 
sympathetic to gang members. Last month, the group promoted Turn Off the 
Violence Day, in which residents were encouraged to avoid violent TV shows and 
other entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers also are credited for quickly cleaning up graffiti this year. 
Residents reported 347 incidents of graffiti from January through June, down 
from 557 during the same six-month span last year, according to Santa Clarita's 
Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The task force has been doing a lot of work, and people don't know who has 
been doing it," said Cecilia Burda, who oversees the volunteer task force on 
behalf of the city. "It's hard to drive around and find graffiti here." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the city's fourth annual Teen Spring Clean, held in May, 
struggled to find enough graffiti to keep dozens of volunteers busy for a few 
hours on a Saturday morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Later that month, the City Council was comfortable enough with anti-gang 
efforts to halve the cash award offered for information about graffiti 
vandalism.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DISMISSAL CLOSER IN MOLESTATION CASE; CRIME: 
PROSECUTORS WON'T CHALLENGE DEFENDANT'S APPEAL OF CHARGES STEMMING FROM 
INCIDENTS THAT ALLEGEDLY OCCURRED BETWEEN 1967 AND 1972. 
</P>

 Prosecutors have decided not to challenge an appeal by a Santa Clarita man who 
claims he was unfairly charged under a new law with molesting four girls more 
than 20 years ago, a move that could lead to the case against him being 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lynch, 64, is awaiting trial in Los Angeles Superior Court on eight 
charges of lewd conduct with a minor. He is being prosecuted under a state law 
that took effect Jan. 1 allowing child molestation suspects to be charged 
within a year of the date the alleged crime is reported to police, regardless 
of when it occurred. Lynch has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 But his attorney, Frank Di Sabatino, appealed to the state's 2nd District 
Court of Appeals, arguing it was unfair to apply the law retroactively to 
Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors with the Los Angeles County district attorney's office sent a 
letter to the appeals court Friday announcing they would not challenge the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that there simply is no legal basis for us to go forward with the 
case at this point in time," said Deputy Dist. Atty. George M. Palmer, acting 
head of the district attorney's appellate division. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court usually grants unchallenged motions, Palmer said. A ruling 
is expected within the next couple of weeks, and charges against Lynch will be 
dropped if his motion is granted, said Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, free on $100,000 bail, said in a telephone interview Monday that he is 
cautious about the chances that the case against him will be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a judge tells me it's dismissed, then I can start feeling relief," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Sabatino was more optimistic, concluding "it is more likely than not" the 
case will be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch was charged in June with molesting three sisters and their childhood 
friend from March, 1967, to July, 1972, when their ages ranged from 7 to 13. He 
often took care of the sisters and prosecutors say he committed the 
molestations at his Van Nuys apartment and a home he later purchased in Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the girls, now an adult, secretly taped telephone and face-to-face 
conversations with him about the alleged incidents at the direction of 
authorities in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Sabatino asked judges during two hearings to dismiss the case, arguing the 
law was being unfairly applied to Lynch. The attorney said a three-year statute 
of limitations existed at the time of the alleged molestations. Both times the 
requests were overturned, leading prosecutors to believe the appeals court 
would uphold an order to make Lynch stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palmer said further research convinced prosecutors the new law could not 
be applied to Lynch, because of previous statute of limitations laws.

 An inmate on a minimum-security work crew escaped from the Peter J. Pitchess 
Honor Rancho Monday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Solis, 26, fled from a field next to the jail's welding shop while he 
was working on a construction crew about 2:15 p.m., said Deputy Brian Jones of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis is described as Latino, 5 feet, 4 inches tall, 140 pounds with black 
hair and brown eyes, Jones said. He was last seen in his prison uniform, a 
light-green jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said Solis was originally arrested in October for furnishing marijuana 
to someone in Huntington Park and was sentenced to a year in County Jail. If 
recaptured, he will be assigned to a high-security unit in the jail, Jones 
said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

HE'S A RAD SCIENTIST; WINNING THE NOBEL WON'T CHANGE USC'S NEW LAUREATE. HE 
PROUDLY SAYS HE'LL CONTINUE TO BE THE GOOD CHEMIST HE WAS BEFORE HE WON FAME 
AND $935,000.

<P>
 There are times when George A. Olah -- USC's new Nobel laureate -- suspects 
that anyone who really wants to understand him needs an advanced degree in 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 That may explain why, one day in 1950, he came home and announced to his new 
wife that he had enrolled her as a chemistry major. He did not think to ask her 
first whether she was actually interested in the bonds that hold the material 
world together. 
</P>
<P>
 And it did not occur to her to refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unexpected experiment in the chemistry of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, it was the biggest shock of my life," says Judith Olah. "He came 
home radiant. 'I enrolled you,' he said. 'In chemistry.' Without asking me. I 
had absolutely no intention, let me assure you, ever of studying chemistry in 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she earned undergraduate and then graduate degrees in chemistry. 
She spent 40 years working in her husband's laboratory, retiring three years 
ago as an adjunct professor of chemistry at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I defend myself?" the imperturbable Hungarian-born researcher asks in his 
accented rumble like distant thunder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The life of a scientist is not a very easy life," he begins. "Once you are 
hooked on science, it takes up so much time. I am not complaining. I am doing 
this with joy. It is not just what you do in the lab or with students. It is 
thinking and writing and so on . . . a hell of a lot of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "An essential part of any happy marriage," he continues, "should be some 
understanding and balance. I think if somebody doesn't understand what the 
other partner is doing, this can cause real difficulty. Our happy marriage, I 
attribute in part to the fact she started to understand what this is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "So," Olah says, "she became a chemist." 
</P>
<P>
 They enjoy the moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is the smartest thing he did," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only on the most pristine days can George and Judith Olah see all the way from 
their patio at the lip of Coldwater Canyon to the Pacific Ocean. Most of the 
time the view is obscured by the curtain of smog common in most American cities 
held captive by the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 In one way or another, the distinguished USC chemist has been trying to clear 
the air all his life. 
</P>
<P>
 To the average person, the most noticeable benefits of his scientific insights 
are lead-free gasoline, cleaner high-octane gas and the promise of other 
non-polluting fuels that might one day reduce the burden of hydrocarbons in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are only a few spinoffs from Olah's exploration of chemical 
reactions involving hydrocarbons -- fundamental building blocks of life -- 
which has revamped basic research in biomedicine and industrial chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 To his peers in the world of advanced chemistry, Olah's work unlocked an 
entire world of previously elusive reactions and unexpected chemical 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the research that most impressed the Nobel Prize committee, Olah showed a 
way to capture and stabilize a class of unusual chemical compounds so fleeting 
that their lifetimes can be measured in millionths of a second. And he created 
a new class of powerfully corrosive acids to stabilize them long enough to 
study in detail. Colleagues said his breakthrough was the fruit of a 
characteristic leap of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really does march to a different drummer," says Stanford University 
chemistry professor John I. Brauman. "He doesn't buy into the conventional 
wisdom. That is what makes his stuff so important. It really is different and, 
it turns out, amazingly interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could actually make new reactions happen that you couldn't get before," 
Brauman says. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years, USC officials and Olah's colleagues at other schools have 
been calling his work "Nobel-class." When he was persuaded to move from Case 
Western Reserve University in Cleveland to USC in 1977, he had already been 
elected to the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the telephone call that announced his 1994 Nobel Prize for 
Chemistry was a shock when it actually arrived Oct. 12 at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Messages from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which makes the Nobel 
Prize selections, are not a normal part of Olah's early-morning routine that 
begins at dawn with a half-hour of laps in the swimming pool, followed by 
yogurt, an English muffin and a 12-hour workday. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize -- and the $935,000 cash award that accompanies it -- brings with it 
almost instant international recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Olah is taking the attention in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take my science exceedingly seriously. It is my life. But I try to keep 
myself in proportion," he says. "I don't believe in stuffy scientists who get 
the feeling because they got a prize that all at once they are exceptional 
people. As much as I appreciate it, I thought I was a pretty good chemist a 
week ago and a month ago." 
</P>
<P>
 At 67, he has reached a point in life when many people have retired, but he 
still actively pursues his research projects, teaching responsibilities and the 
day-to-day direction of the Loker Hydrocarbon Institute at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious chemistry he has done lately, however, is to spike a glass of 
morning orange juice with celebratory champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are the human facts of the Olah equation: 
</P>
<P>
 He was born in 1927 in Budapest amid the faded glory of the Austro-Hungarian 
Empire. He was a child during the Great Depression, a teen-ager during the Nazi 
occupation of Hungary. He turned 18 the year World War II ended and finished 
his Ph.D. four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 He married Judith in 1949, fathered the first of two sons, and, in the years 
of Soviet dominance of Hungary started the experiments that would eventually 
garner him the 1994 Nobel Prize. Then, in the year the Soviet Union sent tanks 
into Budapest to crush a rebellion, Olah fled with his family to London, then 
to Canada and finally to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We survived a long while between East and West," he says. "Then I had a 
chance to restart my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, in their comfortable living room, where original lithographs by Picasso 
and Chagall grace the flagstone mantle and chemistry texts compete for shelf 
space with tomes on Dali and Renoir, Olah and his wife are not inclined to 
reminisce about hardship or privation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in repose, Olah is imposing, so tall -- 6 feet, 5 inches -- that to sit 
comfortably in an armchair he must fold himself up like a jackknife, crossing 
his legs one over the other and tucking his foot behind one ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 If pressed, Olah acknowledges, yes, there was "a darker political side" to 
life in Hungary. Yes, he grudgingly admits, there were weeks of combat for 
control of Budapest. Yes, he arrived in the West "with the shirt on his back." 
His wife recalls, "he was a young guy from nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But other subjects quickly intrude -- their collection of Eskimo sculpture and 
the provenance of their lithograph of Picasso's "California." 
</P>
<P>
 It is for friends and colleagues to pass along the stories of Olah trying to 
survive in war-torn Hungary, doling out a gold chain, one link at a time, to 
buy the potatoes and soybeans that kept his family alive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody in my family ever had any interest in science," Olah says. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was a lawyer. His mother kept house. Only after high school was 
Olah's interest in medieval history and Latin classics preempted by chemistry. 
Not even Olah can say easily what compels him to invest so much of his life and 
energy in an investigation of what makes matter hang together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do what I do because I have great curiosity. Creative science, I think, has 
close relations to art. It is a creative intellectual process," Olah says. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hungary, as in most European countries of the period, a promising student 
apprenticed with a professor. The mentor collected a handsome fee for the 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Olah earned his keep instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was privileged that I wasn't paying my professor. I was his private 
assistant and was privileged to work seven days a week," he says dryly. "Even 
then I had my own ideas, and that did not sit well with my professor." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of earning his keep underpins his attitude toward research today. 
</P>
<P>
 First as an industrial chemist and then as a university-based researcher, Olah 
has been anxious to see his discoveries put into practical application or 
published openly where other chemists could benefit from the work. 
</P>
<P>
 He has taken out more than 100 patents and published more than 950 research 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He believes that any work you start is incomplete until it is peer-reviewed 
and published," says Surya Prakash, Olah's longtime research collaborator at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Olah recalls being irritated by the attitude of his research director at Dow 
Chemical Co., where he worked when he first came to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "His philosophy was that they could afford this fundamental research but I 
shouldn't bother them too much with the results. I thought, maybe naively, that 
they were paying me a good salary and I have some obligation to do something," 
Olah says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not unexpectedly, Olah has strong ideas on the pursuit of scientific truth. 
</P>
<P>
 He is unyielding on the principle that a scientist must submit himself to the 
discipline of what can be measured, observed and openly proven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scientists are there to find out what is there in nature. It is not like 
politics or economics or many other things," he says. "In many ways, we have no 
control about what is there. If nature created a certain molecule or a certain 
compound, you can't change that fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Olah has demonstrated he sometimes sees those facts 
differently than other scientists -- often more clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take pride that my colleagues think I have a rather distinctive individual 
approach to chemistry," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But trying to describe that approach is not so easy. One leading authority on 
organic chemistry at another university is asked to explain Olah's thought 
process. The chemist throws up his hands in mock despair. "Olah is just so 
Hungarian," he says. "He makes these jumps." 
</P>
<P>
 He is alluding to the intimidating reputation earned by a generation of 
Hungarian researchers, such as atomic scientists Leo Szilard and Edward Teller, 
whose intellectual prowess and indomitable energy in post-World War II America 
led them to prominence in the fields of physics, chemistry and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 On more than one occasion, Olah's particular view of the facts put him in 
conflict with the established experts of the day. Caltech chemist John D. 
Roberts says "he's upset a lot of apple carts in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 His clash with Nobel Prize-winning chemist Herbert C. Brown at Purdue 
University is legendary. For 20 years -- in seminars, conferences and in the 
research papers where academic combat is waged -- the two warred over the 
structure of a certain obscure compound called 2-norbornyl cation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very harsh . . . lonely," he says. "I kept a very low profile on some 
research for very many years. I was hoping my chemistry would speak for 
itself." Eventually, the facts proved Olah correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "To accumulate basic knowledge just for the sake of understanding, I think, is 
essential," he says. "You never know when some obscure, completely unimportant 
fact becomes very important. . . . Sometimes the practical results take a long 
time to come, so you must have some faith."

FIXATIONS: FOLLOWING ZOOT; A FULLERTON SHOP SUITS UP CUSTOMERS LOOKING FOR A 
LARGER-THAN-LIFE EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At age 74, Elbert Duran is old enough to have been among the first generation 
of Latinos to sport the stylish zoot suits his daughter Phyllis Estrella now 
carries at her Harbor Boulevard shop, El Pachuco.  
</P>
<P>
 Duran helps his daughter ride herd over some 500 zoot suits there, and when 
people ask him if he was a zoot-suiter, "Of course I tell everybody 'yes,' he 
said. "But, oh, I couldn't afford one. Making $19 a week here in Fullerton 
picking oranges nine hours a day, including Saturdays? In those days my biggest 
concern was just trying to get a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Having just spent some 16 hours in one at a friend's wedding, I think he might 
as well have gone with the suit. The sharply creased baggy pegged pants, 
knee-length jacket with accentuated padded shoulders, ultra-shiny Stacy Adams 
shoes and dangling gold waist chain all conspired to give the impression of 
being in a sleek, solid automobile out on the dance floor. A zoot suit makes 
you feel special, somewhat larger than life, and even my squirrelly head 
popping out of the top of one couldn't entirely gainsay that impression. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran says he didn't even see a zoot suit in his Fullerton hometown until 1938 
and was busy fighting World War II in Europe by the time they became infamous 
in Southern California in the early 1940s. His daughter had never even seen one 
until the family went to see the Luis Valdez play "Zoot Suit" in Hollywood in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The play and subsequent film dealt with two war-era events. The first was the 
1942 "Sleepy Lagoon case" in which a group of zoot-suited Latino youths were 
falsely convicted of murder, in a racially divisive trial at which a Los 
Angeles sheriff's "expert" had testified that people of Mexican descent were 
biologically predisposed to "a desire to kill or at least draw blood." The 
convictions were later overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The second event was the 1943 "Zoot Suit Riots," the name given to several 
days of club- and bottle-wielding off-duty military personnel conducting their 
own little war against young zoot-suiters on the streets of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Duran recalled: "The Marines and the Navy guys used to get off the ships there 
in Long Beach and would come down to the barrios chasing girls. And the boys 
there didn't like that, so they had a conflict." After one sailor was beaten -- 
rumors flew that he'd been blinded -- some 1,000 troops took to the streets. 
Duran said, "The MPs and the police would look the other way, and those guys 
would do anything they wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 As moved as Estrella was by the Valdez play dealing with those events, she was 
also captivated by the costuming, the zoot suit "drapes" effected by the young 
Latino men of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just loved the fashion," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, she and her father were jewelers. Duran had learned the trade on 
the GI Bill, subsequent to taking nine pieces of shrapnel in one leg while in 
the paratroopers in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing the play, they decided to start marketing the dangling waist 
chains worn by zoot-suiters.  
</P>
<P>
 Estrella said: "We advertised in Lowrider magazine and got a great response, 
calls from all over the United States. We did really good selling the zoot suit 
chains, but people kept calling up saying, 'I'll take a zoot suit chain, but 
I'd sure love to have the suit to go with it.' So we thought maybe we had 
something here." 
</P>
<P>
 They were the only ones to think that, though.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was negative about us doing it. They said, 'Do you really think 
you'll be able to pay your rent selling zoot suits?' But I thought so, because 
I figured if I loved the fashion, someone else must. Everybody thought I lost 
my marbles to do something like this," Estrella said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One initial hurdle was just finding a zoot suit they could copy. "We looked 
all over and couldn't find one. We finally went to a costume shop in Hollywood 
and found an old one there, brand new. It was a pink one, which I guess no 
zoot-suiter had wanted to buy," Estrella said. 
</P>
<P>
 They made a pattern from it and began making the suits. Business was initially 
slow, because until 1985 they only sold the suits rather than rented, but they 
eventually found it necessary to farm out work to other county tailors to meet 
their demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrella named her business El Pachuco, after the character played by Edward 
James Olmos in "Zoot Suit," a mythic embodiment of the tough, sharp, in-command 
pachuco image. For Latino youths growing up in a white culture that denied 
their existence, the look had obvious appeal. "El Pachuco is who you become 
when you put the zoot suit on. It is a handsome, brave man, someone with 
character, who turns a lot of heads," Estrella said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Estrella's 20-year-old son Ray, the youngest of three generations 
of family working at El Pachuco, "You put it on and you're supposed to be 
someone who gets respect, like a dancer or a fighter, a zoot-suiter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On an average week they sell half a dozen of the suits (base price $500) and 
typically have 80 on rental at any time. During prom season their entire stock 
of 400 to 500 suits is sometimes cleared out. Rentals usually run $85, although 
they have a student discount because, Estrella said, they want to encourage 
kids to stay in school. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits have also proved popular for weddings, quinceaneras (traditional 
Mexican coming-out parties for 15-year-old girls) and lowrider car shows. 
They've had actor Johnny Depp as a customer and once fitted a 2-month-old baby 
with a zoot suit for his christening. 
</P>
<P>
 They have customers from as far away as Belgium and Japan (where there is a 
burgeoning lowrider culture) but say their customer base is largely local and 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrella said: "The suits are popular with many people now because they're 
good-looking and different. Everybody wore them in the '40s, the blacks, the 
whites. Look how famous Cab Calloway became wearing one.  
</P>
<P>
 "But Mexican Americans tend to think of it as their zoot suit. We get letters 
from people thanking us for keeping up the culture. It's part of their history. 
They look at the old pictures in the family albums and see their father or 
grandfather wearing them, and they want to wear the same thing. Then they put 
that picture next to the grandfather's and see the resemblance." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985 the business has been located in an old Harbor Boulevard building 
they bought and restored in a modestly Deco style. It had previously been a 
restaurant, where Estrella's husband, now a banker, had worked as a dishwasher 
in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success of their business, they still have a virtual monopoly on 
zoot suits; other tux rental shops and tailors still don't carry them. Duran 
says that is partially due to the suits being difficult to make, "but, also, I 
asked one tailor why he didn't make zoot suits and he said: 'You think I want 
those creeps in my store? Forget it.' If they want to think that way, fine. Our 
customers' money is as green as anyone else's." 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'We don't want that element in our store,' " Estrella said. "What 
they mean by that I don't know, though I think they mean they don't want the 
Mexican Americans, the lowriders. To me, everybody is important. Our customers 
are wonderful people. Like this gentleman returning the suit here is a 
policeman." 
</P>
<P>
 As if on cue, a customer walked in the shop, and he was indeed a Ramparts 
Division LAPD officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a haul down here, but it was well worth it," said Julian Munoz. "I got 
nothing but compliments this weekend. I had a Halloween party. My wife was 
thinking I should be a gangster, but that's what I deal with day in and day 
out, putting these knuckleheads in jail. Then I was flipping through Lowrider 
magazine and saw the ad for this place, and that was it. This is my style. This 
stuff has always been in my blood."

TAILHOOK BEHIND HER, SHE STARTS A NEW LIFE; COURTS: HAD SHE KNOWN HOW PAINFUL

<P>
 "My mother always said to me, 'Right makes might.' At last, I can believe 
her." -- Paula Coughlin 
</P>
<P>
 She has lost her career, most of her friends, and nearly a third of her 
weight. She has been called a man-hater and a slut, a disgrace to the Navy and 
a crybaby who should have known better. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, a federal jury said that Paula Coughlin, the woman who blew the 
whistle on Tailhook, was right. She had been hurt and she had been wronged, and 
for that, said the jurors, she should be compensated to the tune of $6.7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I never see one penny, it is worth it," says Coughlin, 32, without 
hesitation, "because for the first time in a very long time, I am proud of 
myself. I'll never forget how really, really bad it was, but I am very 
gratified by the fact that I had the strength to stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating for two hours, a federal jury ruled Oct. 28 that the Las 
Vegas Hilton Hotel and its parent company was guilty of "oppression or malice" 
for its role in the sex-abuse scandal and awarded Coughlin $1.7 million in 
damages. Three days later, the jury returned to award her another $5 million in 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin's suit charged the hotel chain with failing to provide adequate 
security during the notorious 1991 Tailhook aviators convention. Hilton Corp. 
Vice President Mark Grossman said last week that the decision will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first interview since the verdict, Coughlin -- the first of 12 women to 
take Tailhook-related charges to trial -- told The Times that while the 
nightmares continue, she is ready to give herself "the luxury of assuming that 
life will return to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to just daydream about coming home to this," says the former 
helicopter pilot and admiral's aide from her cozy brick home in Virginia Beach, 
Va.  
</P>
<P>
 "All my mums are in full bloom and the pansies are ready to go in and it's a 
beautiful sunny day. I must still be in denial about all that's happened 
because I feel like it is my friend who just got back from Las Vegas and not 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-week trial was an ordeal, she said, but one she had been prepared 
for by years of attacks and counterattacks that preceded it.  
</P>
<P>
 From the morning after Tailhook when she reported the incident to her admiral, 
the Navy, she says, began punishing her for speaking out. Spokesmen for the 
Navy have said Coughlin's subsequent transfers and her ultimate grounding were 
a result of her mental instability, which they agree resulted from the stresses 
of Tailhook.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the trial began, Hilton lawyers asked her to produce every photograph 
taken of her from 1986 to 1993, every piece of clothing she'd worn during the 
three days of the Tailhook convention, and every piece of paper relating to the 
trip, including the receipt for a red silk dress she bought at Neiman Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mental stability was tested and retested at every turn by expert witnesses 
for the court, including a Hilton-hired psychiatrist who reported that Coughlin 
was indeed suffering "severe acute stress" as a result of the Tailhook attack. 
During the convention, she was groped and pawed by a line of men taunting her 
and chanting "Admiral's aide! Admiral's aide!" as they plunged their hands into 
her bra and grabbed her crotch in a Hilton hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dr. Richard Rahe, a Hilton witness, Coughlin's self-image was 
damaged because until Tailhook, she had viewed herself as "a full peer" with 
the Top Gun male aviators who later molested her. Rahe also found that Coughlin 
exhibited paranoia, but conceded that her belief she was being plotted against 
was "likely accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the pressures of Tailhook forced her resignation in May, Coughlin was 
one of a handful of women entrusted by the Navy to pilot its biggest, meanest 
helicopter -- the CH-53 Sea Stallion. Until Tailhook, she was "the best of the 
best," according to her San Diego lawyer Nancy Stagg. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Coughlin says her Navy days are over. She will probably go back to 
college in January to train for a new -- as yet undecided -- career. "There are 
so many misconceptions of who I am and what I am. As much as I wish it weren't 
true, I don't see how I could ever go back. The Paula Coughlin Hate Club is 
still out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her reputation as "the Rosa Parks of the '90s" and "the woman who 
changed the U.S. Navy," Coughlin believes that her victory in civil court may 
not erase the long tradition of military animosity toward women. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a Navy spokesman acknowledged that seven male instructors at a Navy 
school in San Diego are being investigated on charges they demanded sexual 
favors from women students in exchange for passing grades. Most of the 
allegations involve verbal harassment, with some physical abuse such as 
grabbing, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before the Coughlin jury handed down its verdicts, 18 female cadets at 
the U.S. Military Academy at West Point charged that some members of the 
football team had groped their breasts at a pep rally. Three cadets were later 
barred from the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin said she was sorry for the latest victims but was not surprised. 
Attitudes toward women, she predicts, will not change overnight. "First we're 
going to see (men) following the rules against sexual harassment just to stay 
out of trouble -- not because they believe that behavior is wrong, but because 
they don't want to get caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am convinced that you can't change the way a person thinks, but you can 
change their behavior. And eventually, that will change the way they think as 
well . . . eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Coughlin, ever the patriot and loyal daughter of retired career aviator 
Paul Coughlin, says she misses the Navy -- "especially now." She says she was 
saddened that none of her former colleagues called with congratulations on the 
court decision. But her expectations of her fellow officers have never 
recovered from what happened that night in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Never during the seven-week federal trial was there any dispute that Coughlin 
had indeed been groped by drunken male aviators as she was passed along a 
crowded third-floor gantlet.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a 23-month Pentagon investigation concluded that Coughlin wasn't 
the only Tailhook victim -- and named 82 other women who had been assaulted or 
harassed at the annual pilots gathering. Although Secretary of Navy H. Lawrence 
Garrett III was forced to step down and several other high-ranking officers 
pushed into early retirement, no officer was ever disciplined and no 
courts-martial were ever convened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department's failure to punish any of the aviators involved in 
Tailhook fueled a backlash against Coughlin. Her enemies stepped up their smear 
campaign, which for a time, included a newsletter titled "The Gauntlet," 
published by an ex-naval aviator, sometimes under the pseudonym Paul A. Coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hilton lawyers would attempt to do later in court, the newsletter portrayed 
the former Navy lieutenant and admiral's aide as a party girl who only wanted 
money and publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Coughlin says if she had known how painfully public her case would 
become, she might have rethought the whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I was weighing the costs every time I came to a crossroads and 
chose to push on. Maybe it was Irish stubbornness, I don't know. I do know that 
I am grateful that the jury wasn't persuaded by any of the old sexist defenses 
that were thrown out -- that I shouldn't have been there in the first place, 
that I should have known better, that I shouldn't have been dressed the way I 
was dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I am going to stop running six, seven, eight miles a day now. I'm 
going to spend time with my boyfriend, Joe, whom I've known since fourth grade, 
and I'm going to be proud of myself and my lawyer Nancy Stagg and my mother and 
everyone else who never lost sight of what we were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A message has been sent here: You can't allow women to be abused. You just 
can't."

<P>
 The self-absorbed students crowding the walkway to USC's Heritage Hall parted 
before George A. Olah and Katherine Loker like the waters of the Red Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, chatting amiably about USC football, passed beneath a banner that 
urged: "George Olah/Nobel Prize Winner/Fight On." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Loker watched benevolently, as Olah was interviewed there for a campus 
football television program. He firmly reminded the host that Knute Rockne got 
his start as a chemistry teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Loker, heir to the StarKist Tuna fortune, is Olah's most significant patron. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning his Nobel Prize was announced, Loker was the first person Olah 
called with the news. She responded with the vase of yellow roses that now sits 
at the center of his office conference table. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the widow of Donald P. Loker, a Universal Pictures star in the 1930s 
who was an energetic philanthropist. She went to USC. Her husband went to 
Harvard. Consequently, there are certain constants in Loker's charitable 
giving. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, the couple originally donated about $1.8 million for a new building 
to house what is now called the Loker Hydrocarbon Institute -- the year Olah 
came to USC. He now directs the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Lokers endowed a professorship in English at Harvard, followed by a 
professorship in chemistry at USC. Olah holds the chemistry chair. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she gave USC $7 million to expand the chemistry research institute. 
Not long after, she donated $7 million to help renovate Harvard's Memorial 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the new wing of the Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Institute -- as it 
is formally known -- is almost complete. The new wing bears her name alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute has grown to six faculty members, 15 research associates and 
about 50 graduate students. It attracts several million dollars every year from 
the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy and other 
agencies. USC alumnus Harold Moulton also contributed more than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 While some alumni may boast that their college connections get them tickets on 
the 50-yard line at any USC or Harvard football games, only Loker can say that 
her school ties have earned her a front seat at a Nobel Prize ceremony: She has 
been invited to sit with Olah's family when Olah is scheduled to receive the 
award in Stockholm on Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 And the president of Harvard made sure Loker received his handwritten note of 
congratulations. ROBERT LEE HOTZ

 An Election Day Story from Argus Hamilton: 
</P>
<P>
 A lifelong Democrat, 90, on his deathbed and knowing he wouldn't make it to 
Election Day, summoned his family Sunday and announced he was turning 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could you forsake the party of Robert E. Lee and Will Rogers?" cried his 
wife. The man said he just figured it was the right thing to do. His children 
pleaded with him, citing numerous reasons. Again, the man said it was the right 
thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, his granddaughter asked why he was turning Republican just before he 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Election Day Tuesday," the man said with a smile, "I figure it's better 
one of them than one of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, on a poll that claims indicted Illinois congressman Dan Rostenkowski 
is far behind: "He's in big trouble. Even some of the dead voters are leaning 
Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the news: Comedy writer Michael Connor, on troubles at the CIA: "On top of 
everything else, agents are quitting. They can make more money taking photos 
for the Enquirer or doing surveillance for Ross Perot." 
</P>
<P>
 Connor on Clinton at midterm: "He is an optimistic realist and sees the glass 
as half full. He just isn't sure half full of what." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Alan Ray, on the palimony suit against Bob Dylan: "The judge in 
the case has issued a gag order. Anything to keep Dylan from singing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray, on space-shuttle problems: "NASA is unhappy with glitches in a 
$10-billion in-flight computer. For $15 more, they could've gotten a Sega." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the news: A Montana prison official has resigned after taking three 
female inmates, including a convicted killer, out to dinner at Red Lobster. 
Comedy writer Tony Peyser says the official admits that he made a big mistake: 
"If he had to do it over again, he said he would have ordered the shrimp scampi 
instead of the seafood salad." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedy writer Bob Mills says the dinner date came to light, "when one of the 
women was observed hobbling to the salad bar in leg irons." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on Prince Charlie telling L.A. students that he hopes to serve as a 
role model for them: "He is a pretty good role model. One young man said today 
that he doesn't have a job, is living with his parents and has started cheating 
on his wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno, on the Heidi Fleiss trial: "This is scary. . . . I guess one juror 
developed a cold sore on his lip and Heidi was charged with jury tampering." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A 50ish panhandler recently approached Bill Salazar of Long Beach, speaking a 
blend of English and broken Spanish. Salazar said he didn't speak Spanish. The 
man responded, "Well, you should. I speak four languages." Salazar handed him 
some change, then said maybe he would learn a language. 
</P>
<P>
 As the panhandler walked away, he replied: "I doubt it. It's probably too 
late."

BODY WATCH; DOCTOR'S CORNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trip to the doctor's office is usually limited to a discussion of whatever 
ails you -- if you're like most people. Neither doctors nor patients have much 
time to wax philosophical on other things one might do to promote good health. 
So we decided to do this for you -- for free. We invited top health experts 
representing various specialties to give us their best tips for healthy living. 
Women's Health  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Anita Nelson, obstetrician-gynecologist, Women's Health Care Programs, 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance:  
</P>
<P>
 * Preconception health is the wave of the future. Make certain you are in 
optimal health before you become pregnant to ensure the best outcome possible. 
Achieve appropriate weight, eat a balanced diet, stop smoking and drinking and 
get a thorough health evaluation before conception. Folic acid supplements are 
also helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health maintenance beyond the childbearing years should include the crucial 
role that hormone replacement plays in prolonging a woman's life span and in 
improving the quality of her final years. Hormone replacement reduces 
osteoporosis, heart attacks, Alzheimer's disease risk, and controls hot flashes 
and wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Themes throughout the years: Know yourself, participate in your own health 
care; do breast self-examination; commit to a healthy lifestyle and avoid 
smoking; exercise and control your weight, but avoid crash diets and excessive 
exercise; take control; practice safe sex, and don't become a victim of 
domestic violence. Men's Health  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Charles E. Shapiro, urologist, Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center, Los 
Angeles:  
</P>
<P>
 * Males in the 15- to 30-year-old category should be aware of their risk for 
testicular cancer. It can be picked up by doing frequent self-exam -- monthly, 
for example, in the shower. Know what "normal" feels like so that you can 
detect any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Good sexual functioning can be maintained throughout the life span. A 
prescription for good sex function in later ages is to have frequent 
intercourse when you're younger. You can't wear it out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prostate cancer is extremely common with age. But in older age groups the 
vast majority of men who are found to have prostate cancer will die with it 
rather than from it. Therefore, the decision about treatment for prostate 
cancer must be individualized according to your state of health and the 
information your doctor provides you about your options. Prostate cancer is a 
real problem because it's difficult to identify how the disease will progress. 
Watchful waiting is a legitimate and reasonable option for many patients. Make 
yourself as well-informed as possible and take the time to think about the 
advantages and disadvantages of each option available. In general, prostate 
cancer is not an emergency. Children's Health  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Barbara Korsch, professor of pediatrics at USC, attending pediatrician at 
Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles, specializing in child development and 
behavior, advises parents:  
</P>
<P>
 * Trust yourself. You know your child. Don't be frightened by all the advice 
out there. General rules do not apply to everyone. Parents know more about 
their children than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 * Everyone has such high expectations for mothers. Nobody turns into a saint 
just because they become a mother. You may do things when you are tired and 
angry that you regret, but your child will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take care of yourself. Somebody has to be good to you if you are going to be 
good to your child. Eyes  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Daniel Sigband, ophthalmologist in private practice in Huntington Beach 
and assistant clinical professor of ophthalmology at UC Irvine:  
</P>
<P>
 * Eye safety is very important. Wear protective lenses, such as safety 
goggles, when doing anything hazardous, whether it's on the job or around the 
house or even playing some sports, such as racquetball. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear sunglasses that have been certified for protection against ultraviolet 
light. Even young people should wear sunglasses. There is indirect evidence 
that ultraviolet light might produce cataracts and macular degeneration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tailor your vision care to your stage in life: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Families have to be aware that they can go to their pediatrician and have 
their child's vision screened. Many conditions can be caught, such as amblyopia 
or lazy eye, preventing permanent vision loss. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In early adulthood, continue to periodically see your eye-care 
practitioner. The need for glasses or contacts can and should be detected 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Age 40 is an excellent time to see an ophthalmologist for the first time to 
check for eye diseases, cataracts, glaucoma or retinal diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Over age 50, have ophthalmological examinations every two years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- People with a family history of eye diseases as well as people with 
diabetes or high blood pressure are at higher risk for eye disease and should 
get regular examinations. African Americans are at higher risk of glaucoma. 
Teeth and Mouth  
</P>
<P>
 Christine Dumas, dentist in Marina del Rey and spokeswoman for the California 
Dental Assn.:  
</P>
<P>
 * Expect more from dentistry. Americans have raised their expectations for 
their overall health, but their dental-care expectations have lagged. People 
have a 1950s view of what happens when they go to a dentist. A dentist now 
should check for oral cancer and jaw-joint problems, and do a periodontal exam 
and tooth-by-tooth evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lot of Americans avoid the dentist because of their fears of pain. You 
should know that, in 1994, you can expect to have dental care done painlessly 
and comfortably. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get regular dental care. You are not healthy if you are not dentally 
healthy. People in Southern California exercise and eat right, but they think 
their mouth is not connected to the rest of their body. Look for a dentist who 
is going to teach you things to keep you healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watch who you kiss. Dental disease is transmittable. You can catch it from 
someone else. Your loved one may never go to the dentist while you go every 
three months, but his germs are jumping into your mouth. Skin  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Norman Brooks, dermatologist and director of the Skin Cancer Medical 
Center in Encino:  
</P>
<P>
 * Wear sunscreens regularly and avoid excessive exposure to the sun. Although 
sunscreens protect against UV-B rays, they don't protect quite as well against 
UV-A rays, which are linked to melanoma. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use an alpha-hydroxy product. This is a major breakthrough in skin care. The 
main ingredient is glycolic acid. It reverses sun damage, such as the brown 
spots and rough areas that are common. They will disappear, and the skin looks 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 * The skin itself is a reflection of the health of the internal body. Good 
nutrition, regular exercise, perhaps a vitamin supplement can make you 
healthier and make your skin healthier. Feet  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carol Frey, USC assistant clinical professor of orthopedic surgery . 
Director of the foot and ankle program at Orthopedic Hospital, Los Angeles: * 
Buy shoes that fit and know when a shoe fits. Shoes are the only part of your 
wardrobe that can cause health problems. Shop at the end of the day or after 
exercise when your feet are at their biggest. There should be a half-inch space 
from the end of the longest toe to the shoe. Finally, shoes should be 
comfortable the moment you put them on. It's terrible advice when people say 
that shoes will stretch to fit. They only stretch because they have to. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trim your toenails. You only need to trim them once every six to eight 
weeks. Trim them straight across, not curved like fingernails. And don't trim 
them too short. You should see a millimeter of skin when looking down at your 
toenails. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exercise your feet. We don't really need shoes. The only reason we have to 
wear shoes is to protect ourselves from the human environment. But when you 
start wearing shoes, you lose strength in your feet, such as the ability to 
move your toes and keep them in alignment. Walking barefoot on sand is a good 
exercise. Do the marble exercise; pick up 20 marbles a day with your toes. Or 
run your fingers through your toes and spread them apart. Dancers do a lot of 
these things. Heart  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David A. Ciraulo, cardiologist, Daniel Freeman Hospitals, Marina del Rey:  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't smoke, consume a lot of animal fat (especially if your lipid blood 
tests are abnormal) or ignore a high blood pressure problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do eat a more vegetarian diet and engage in regular exercise. As descendants 
of primates, and later, of hunting and gathering nomads, our bodies were 
designed to metabolize a high-fiber, high-starch, principally vegetarian diet, 
which was acquired by days of physically exhausting foraging. In the modern 
world, however, a rich diet is brought to us without physical exertion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do derive pleasure from a more natural way of living. The modern urban 
environment is full of intellectual and emotional demands that tend to drive 
our nervous system to a state of frenetic overload. Type A individuals will 
allow themselves to be driven by such stress, while Type Bs learn to master 
this environmental energy to serve their own interests. The latter behavior 
results in less cardiovascular illness. But no one will give up the old 
lifestyle unless the new one is ultimately more fulfilling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aerobic exercise should be a joy, not a drudgery. Play racquetball with 
friends or take regular walks with your spouse. Choose markets and restaurants 
that feature fresh fruits and vegetables. Take time to create sensible meals 
and then enjoy them leisurely with the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 * Involve your friends and family in your new lifestyle. Make your life and 
theirs a sumptuous feast that all can savor from moment to moment, ignoring the 
fast-food, fast-lane imperatives of modern culture. Nutrition  
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Tribole, consulting nutritionist in Beverly Hills and staff 
nutritionist for "Good Morning America":  
</P>
<P>
 * Remember: Occasional lapses from healthy eating are normal. One food, one 
snack, one meal, one day will not make or break the waistline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut the fat where you don't miss it. For example, if you order a tuna 
sandwich, cut the mayonnaise on the bread. You won't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
 * When you eat fat, sit and savor it. If it's worth having, make it a 
worthwhile experience. You'll have a satisfying eating experience and will not 
be left wanting more. If you are eating a doughnut and are feeling guilty, you 
are not enjoying it and you may still end up feeling deprived. Psyche  
</P>
<P>
 Robert T. Scott, Ph.D., psychologist, Tarzana, president of the Los Angeles 
County Psychological Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 * Learn to manage and control stress. Did you know that three of the 
best-selling drugs in the country are used to treat stress-related illness? 
That 80% to 90% of all visits to health-care professionals are a result of 
stress-related illness and issues? That 70% of all accidents are 
stress-related? We need to take stress seriously. It's killing us. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recognize the fact that you do have options and that you can change yourself 
or things in your environment so that stress doesn't get the best of you. When 
you are getting stressed out, ask yourself: "Is it worth dying over?" Hang 
loose. Learn to meditate, take a yoga class, develop a fun hobby, learn guided 
imagery techniques, get a hot tub -- whatever it takes to elicit the relaxation 
response in you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exercise your mind and body. Physical exercise appears to be the most 
effective way of ventilating, or expressing, the stress response in a 
health-promoting manner. The physiological effects of exercise are talked about 
a great deal. But the psychological effects are also very powerful. The 
hormonal and neurochemical changes that take place after exercise result in a 
powerful psychological enhancement of mood as well as improved self-esteem and 
an enhanced sense of control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exercise your mind and personality in the same way you exercise your body. 
That means trying new ways of being, testing new behaviors, continuing to grow 
-- getting rid of the psychological flab and strengthening weaker areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn to laugh and play. It may sound silly, but as adults we can learn a 
lot from children. They have a superb resiliency -- they're able to bounce back 
so quickly. Oftentimes they go right into their play as a means to cope and 
release stress. Laughter and play are powerful and healing activities. Research 
in this area suggests that laughter releases healing chemicals and hormones 
into our bloodstream and promotes a healthy, positive psycho-physiological 
state of being. Recent research on happy, successful marriages points to the 
use of humor and play as key factors.

OTHERS STILL AWAIT THEIR DAY IN COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former maid at the Las Vegas Hilton has charged that shortly after Paula 
Coughlin was assaulted, she too was dragged through a gantlet of drunken 
aviators and later raped by the man who lured her there. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a lawsuit set for trial in May, the maid -- identified only as 
"Jane Doe" -- became pregnant as a result of the attack and had an abortion 
rather than give birth to a child conceived "in such an awful, violent way." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Hilton said Monday that the woman "never mentioned rape" when 
she was interviewed by hotel security guards the night of the alleged attack. 
And, noted the spokesman, she waited 16 months to file her claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin's case was the first of 12 to go to trial in federal court in Las 
Vegas, where for 19 years, the Hilton hosted the Tailhook Assn.'s annual 
convention of aviators. The Jane Doe suit against the Hilton, the Tailhook 
Assn. and the Navy is among seven filed by San Francisco attorney Melvin Belli. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of two, who now lives in Phoenix, speaking to The Times on the 
condition of anonymity, says she was 22 in the fall of 1991 when she and 
another maid decided to go to a party on the third floor of the hotel after 
finishing their shifts. According to testimony in the Coughlin case, the Hilton 
had barred some female employees from the third-floor Tailhook party suites. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got there, I had a beer and then I lost my friend. A man came along 
and offered to help find her and next thing I knew I was in this one hallway. 
It was wall-to-wall guys and I got a third of the way through and someone 
grabbed me. I turned around and someone else grabbed me and the hands kept 
coming. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I was knocked down on my back and I was crying and kicking and screaming. I 
had to scoot out on my back and I ran to this wall where the same guy was 
waiting. He took me up to his room on the 14th floor and raped me and then 
pushed me naked out into the hallway," she said, adding that she did not file 
charges with police because she was "so drunk" she could not identify her 
attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paula Coughlin was terribly treated," says Kevin McLean, Belli's associate, 
"but other victims also have some very compelling stories. The Hilton's conduct 
was deplorable and (the hotel chain) should understand that these cases are 
worth millions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hilton has denied charges that it failed to provide adequate security 
during Tailhook and plans to appeal the Coughlin decision. 
</P>
<P>
 While she waits for her case to go to trial, Jane Doe says her fits of 
uncontrollable crying and depression continue. "I'm glad it's over for Paula," 
she says. "I hope someday it'll be over for me." PAMELA WARRICK

FINE-TUNING THE WORK OF 'CBS EVENING NEWS' TEAM; TELEVISION: THE NEWSCAST'S 
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, ANDREW HEYWARD, IS WORKING ON THE MECHANICS OF THE ANCHOR 
DUO, WITH AN EYE TOWARD A SMOOTHER SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Andrew Heyward took over recently as executive producer of the "CBS 
Evening News," the speculation at the network was that he was there to devise 
an exit strategy for the co-anchoring of Dan Rather and Connie Chung -- perhaps 
sending them on a string of separate reporting trips that would make viewers 
forget they were ever a team. 
</P>
<P>
 But three weeks into the job, Heyward said that he is determined to make the 
pairing work.

 "CBS is committed to Dan and Connie continuing as co-anchors," he said in an 
interview. "They will travel where it's appropriate, but I'm not here to 
separate the two." 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous TV critics have said that Rather and Chung, despite their efforts, 
have appeared uncomfortable side by side since they were teamed in June, 1993, 
and some have argued that there simply may not be enough for two anchors to do 
in a 22-minute newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More important, CBS had made the move to increase its ratings at a time when 
"NBC Nightly News" was gaining, but instead viewership fell and NBC moved into 
second behind ABC's "World News Tonight," which has been in first place for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, however, the "CBS Evening News" has improved its competitive 
standing and is now running neck and neck with NBC. For the third quarter this 
year, ABC averaged a 9.1 rating while CBS and NBC each had a 7.9. So far this 
fall, ABC has averaged a 9.7 rating, followed by CBS with 8.4 and NBC with 8.3. 
(Each rating point represents 954,000 homes.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the press said the co-anchoring was a mistake and we were 
doomed," said CBS News President Eric Ober. "But we're in second place this 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 (Not so fast, says NBC. "After a year and a half, having Rather and Chung as 
co-anchors has not moved CBS ahead dramatically, as they had expected," said 
NBC News spokeswoman Beth Comstock. "To declare victory at this point is 
misplaced.") 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward, 44, who did a previous stint producing the "CBS Evening News" in 1986 
and '87, has experience with both Chung and Rather, having developed "48 
Hours," the prime-time newsmagazine anchored by Rather, and serving as 
executive producer of Chung's "Eye to Eye" newsmagazine, which premiered two 
weeks after she started on the "Evening News" last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, (the pairing) was criticized as a cosmetics gimmick," Heyward 
said. "We have two experienced journalists and we need to do a program that 
taps into their skills and involves them more in the broadcast they report." 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward is making moves to improve the mechanics of co-anchoring in the studio 
-- for example, having each anchor talk about related stories rather than 
awkwardly splitting the lead story between them. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is planning to better define the roles that Rather and Chung will 
play. "I expect that Dan will do the lion's share of the foreign reporting, 
although Connie is not going to be excluded from that," he said. He cited 
Rather's recent coup of landing interviews with Haitian general Raoul Cedras as 
an example of the newsman's tenacity in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward praised Chung's skills as an interviewer and indicated that she may be 
used to "report on some of the critical issues that come on to the agenda in 
this country, as health care did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But while Chung has been identified with celebrity interviews on "Eye to Eye," 
Heyward said, "We're not talking about bringing newsmagazine elements or 
celebrity interviews" to the CBS newscast. In fact, he said, he plans to 
continue a greater emphasis on hard news, a trend that was begun about a year 
ago by former producer Erik Sorenson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to emphasize enterprise, original reporting and analysis from 
reporters such as (national security correspondent) David Martin or (European 
correspondent) Tom Fenton," Heyward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyward was recently criticized by ABC News President Roone Arledge for airing 
what amounted to a brief promo for Chung's "Eye to Eye" interview with Faye 
Resnick, the author of a controversial book about the late Nicole Brown 
Simpson. Heyward defended his decision, saying, "That was a legitimate news 
story that was made an issue in court that day by Judge (Lance) Ito." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its recent gains in the ratings, the "CBS Evening News" will face 
problems in the coming year as the network's strong affiliates in Atlanta and 
Detroit switch to Fox, and CBS moves to weaker-signal stations that have only 
begun to do local newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in for a rough time in those markets," Heyward acknowledged. Viewers 
can expect to see Rather and Chung traveling to those cities soon to report the 
news and to help the new affiliates, CBS executives said.

 If you have a pint-sized explorer and animal enthusiast at home, don't miss 
"GeoKids," a recently released home video series from National Geographic.

<P>
 Hosted by three winsome puppets -- Sunny Honeypossum, Bobby Bushbaby and 
Balzac de Chameleon, a wise lizard who serves as teacher and storyteller -- 
each 33-minute video features the kind of quality wildlife film footage you 
would expect from National Geographic, plus imaginative, rhyming narration and 
related alphabet and number games led by a comical cartoon flamingo named 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 This innovative new series, created and directed by Emmy-winning Hank Saroyan 
(for "Muppet Babies" and for the film "The Parsley Garden," based on a story by 
his uncle, William Saroyan), is an outstanding marriage of imaginative 
entertainment and real information.

 Dino Tracks: Fads come and go but dinosaur-appeal never seems to fade. For 
T-Rex fans who just can't get enough of the big creatures, Cleval Video has the 
answer. "Dinosaurs Next Exit" takes an off-the-beaten-track tour of a 
remarkable number and variety of North American dinosaur parks, museums and 
prehistoric displays. And this is just Vol. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Jurupa Mountains Cultural Center's Dinosaur Walk in Riverside to the 
oddly serene Dinosaur Haven in Connecticut, from "paleontologically incorrect" 
monsters, as weird and tackily wonderful as imagination can conceive, to real 
fossils and scientific re-creations, dinosaur-seekers can take their pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-filmed travel guide is entertaining social commentary as well -- with 
wry input from dinosaur expert Donald Glut, clips from exhibits of the past and 
a look at today's state-of-the-art animatronic constructions.

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'STARGATE' A BACK-TO-BACK CHAMP

 MGM's surprise autumn hit "Stargate" won the box-office sweepstakes for the 
second weekend in a row, capitalizing on good word-of-mouth, a PG-13 rating 
that pulled in youngsters and a strong allegiance among science-fiction fans 
who communicate their support over the Internet global computer network. Laden 
with special effects, "Stargate" pulled in $12.4 million from Friday through 
Sunday.The film also capitalized on the appeal of Kurt Russell, who has built a 
following among the sci-fi community since his 1981 film "Escape From New 
York," and the presence of James Spader, playing a role unlike those he has 
played in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 TriStar's "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," starring Kenneth Branagh and Robert 
De Niro, had to overcome mixed reviews and an R-rating to take in $11.2 million 
and wind up in second place. Far behind in third place was "The War," starring 
Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner, which grossed $5.2 million. Meanwhile, Paramount 
Pictures' remarkable film, "Forrest Gump," remained in the top 10 for the 18th 
week, coming in ninth place with about $2 million for the weekend. Weekend Box

CHANDLER TO START SUNDAY, KNOX SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox broke from tradition Monday and named Chris Chandler the 
starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Raiders, quashing any talk 
of a quarterback controversy by demoting Chris Miller to a $3 million-a-year 
backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox normally doesn't make personnel decisions on Mondays, but named Chandler 
the starter for the second consecutive week based on his play Sunday in the 
Rams' 27-21 victory over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knox has wavered between Miller and Chandler all season. Is the starting 
job Chandler's to keep, or lose? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything is ever etched in stone," Knox said. "He had a big 
game yesterday and we'll go on from here." 
</P>
<P>
 So he has won the starting job? 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll start this week," Knox said. "What is 'won the job?' I don't know what 
you're talking about. That's a categorical statement." 
</P>
<P>
 Barring injury, has Chandler solidified himself as the starting quarterback 
for the rest of the season? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just said he's starting this week," Knox said. "I don't think I need to put 
it any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are 4-5 and need a victory over the Raiders to keep their slim 
playoff hopes alive. Does having one starter down the stretch give the Rams 
continuity they need on offense? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's obvious that Chandler has got the work," Knox said. "We had the bye 
week and Miller was injured. Chandler got the work and played very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said he thought he won the starting job after filling in Sunday for 
Miller, who was still feeling some effects from his concussion from the New 
Orleans game. Chandler completed 19 of 25 passes for 223 yards and two 
touchdowns against a Denver secondary that's ranked last in the league, and 
improved his record as the Rams' starter to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler suffered a mild concussion when he hit helmet-to-helmet with Denver's 
Steve Atwater on a quarterback sneak. Chandler said Monday that he felt fine. 
Miller said he needs more time to recover from his concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure there's some disappointment," Miller said of his demotion, "but I 
understand why. Chris played well and my head still isn't healed all the way. 
That's no excuse. This just gives me more time to get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also denied a TV report by Atlanta Journal-Constitution writer Len 
Pasquarelli that he was considering retirement because of the concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never talked to Len," Miller said. "I haven't said that to anybody. I don't 
know why Len would (say) that. Maybe he got together with (Chris) Mortensen and 
put that one together." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen reported on ESPN earlier this season that Knox thought Miller was a 
"prima donna" and was upset with his quarterback's play. Knox later denied the 
report, saying he never spoke with Mortensen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knox is known to be a strong Chandler supporter, and is giving Chandler, 
who signed a one-year $600,000 contract last spring, a shot at starting over 
Miller, who's making five times as much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries have kept Miller from starting an entire NFL season, which is why the 
Rams pursued a proven starter in the off-season. The team originally courted 
Chandler as a starter, but brought him in as a backup after signing Miller to 
the three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always liked Chandler," Knox said. "We liked him coming out of college 
at Washington. Our staff had him at the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the off-season, we knew we needed another quarterback to go with Miller. 
We're just glad we got the two guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler lost starting jobs at Tampa Bay and Arizona, but views this situation 
as the perfect opportunity to establish himself as a permanent starter -- and 
land a contract extension with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 He becomes an unrestricted free agent after this season and will be highly 
marketable because expansion teams in Charlotte and Jacksonville will be 
seeking starters and backups. Although Chandler could probably seek more money 
elsewhere, he said he would like to re-sign with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a perfect world, once you're established in this system you really 
wouldn't want to leave it," he said. "I've gotten comfortable with the system. 
I've gotten comfortable with the guys. I feel like I have the guys' respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of quarterbacks in this league move around and it takes a while 
to come in, learn a system and get the respect. I would like to stay here, 
where the grass is already green." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the team decides to move, the grass could be in Baltimore or the 
artificial turf in St. Louis' new domed stadium. No problem, Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The organization is still the organization," he said. "They will still have 
the offensive line. They will still have the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the team moves, it moves . . . but the guys on the team are going to stay 
the same. I would like to stay with this organization. Once you've gained the 
respect of your teammates, it's hard to leave that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler earned that respect Sunday, leading the Rams' offense to three 
touchdowns, the most since Oct. 14 of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chandler was mistake-free," wide receiver Flipper Anderson said. "He had an 
interception, but that was more my fault than his. It just seems with Chris, 
the team has a different attitude. We go down there and get points."

RAMS SELL OUT, COWBOYS-49ERS BUMPED OFF AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in two years, a Ram home game has sold out -- and it means 
Sunday's game between Dallas and San Francisco, billed as the NFL's game of the 
year, won't be televised locally. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram-Raider sellout, announced Monday, lifted the local blackout on a Ram 
home game for the first time since the team played the 49ers on Nov. 22, 
1992.NBC will televise Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials announced they have sold 69,008 tickets, and are anticipating 
the biggest crowd since the team moved to Anaheim Stadium in 1980. The largest 
crowd to see a Ram game in Anaheim was 67,959 for the 49ers' game in 1989, the 
last season the Rams finished above .500 and made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with NFL rules, Fox can't show a doubleheader here because the 
Rams are at home, and it can't show a 1 p.m. game because it can't go up 
against the Ram-Raider telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Fox has to give Los Angeles a 10 a.m. game. So this market gets 
Chicago at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't blame Fox. It's the NFL's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is boxed in by the league's television policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox programming here Sunday afternoon will include such things as WWF 
wrestling, "Gilligan's Island," and "Three's Company." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rules is rules, Gov," said David Hill, Fox sports president. "There's nothing 
we can do about it."

SHAW MAKING FRIENDS AMONG ST. LOUIS HOPEFUL; PRO FOOTBALL: HE CALLS MISSOURI 
FANS, TELLS THEM HE'S SERIOUS ABOUT POSSIBLE MOVE.

 As Ram President John Shaw tries to defuse speculation that the team is 
heading to St. Louis, he's giving fans there all the more reason to be excited 
about a potential move. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine you're a St. Louis football fan who writes a letter to Shaw and, a 
week or two later, Shaw calls you back personally and tells you the Rams "are 
very serious about coming" to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened Friday night to Bryan Herrick, a 31-year-old community college 
counselor from St. Louis, and Monday morning to Jim Rindler, a 45-year-old 
advertising executive from Ballwin, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought it was my brother playing a joke on me," Herrick said. "I 
couldn't believe it was him. He was really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick said a message machine in another room answered Shaw's call as he 
picked up the phone, and he inadvertently recorded the entire 1-minute, 
30-second conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw could not be reached Monday, but Herrick played the tape for three Times 
reporters who regularly cover the Rams and were able to verify Shaw's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw began by thanking Herrick for his letter and all the other letters he's 
received, and telling him the Rams are "serious" about moving. Herrick then 
tells Shaw how St. Louis fans would have a real passion and love for the Rams 
and how excited they are about them possibly coming to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to hear that," Shaw replied. "I'm impressed with your mail support. 
I just wanted to let people know we're grateful for it, and hopefully we'll get 
it done for you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick said reaction has been mixed among the several friends he's played the 
tape for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some think it's awesome and that the Rams are on their way here," Herrick 
said. "Others say, 'Yeah, but he could be calling people in Baltimore and 
Anaheim too.' 
</P>
<P>
 "From my standpoint, it's one thing to say you're considering a city, it's 
another to call the fans of that city and express interest. It's almost like a 
marketing tool -- they want to generate fan interest and sell season tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Rindler, who sent a batch of candy bars to Shaw for Halloween with the 
message: "It will be a real treat for you to come to St. Louis," said he was 
stunned to get a call from the Ram executive Monday. Their conversation lasted 
about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like getting a call from the president of the United States," Rindler 
said. "He said he was coming to town shortly and was going to make a decision 
this month. I was impressed that he opens his own mail. That's the mark of a 
sincere person." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bryant, president of the Rams' booster club and an active member of the 
Orange County group trying to keep the team in Anaheim, said he was not 
surprised -- or disappointed -- that Shaw is calling St. Louis fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt St. Louis was their No. 1 choice and we're a fallback 
position," Bryant said. "I suspect he's trying to get into a position where if 
that's where they want to go, he has some friends, if not, it was nice talking 
to you. It's all public relations on his part. We have a much bigger picture in 
mind than worrying about whether John is calling fans."

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING FOR RAIDERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Unitas had Raymond Berry. Joe Montana had Jerry Rice. Terry Bradshaw had 
Lynn Swann. 
</P>
<P>
 Every great quarterback seems to find a favorite receiver, find him through 
onrushing linemen, through heavy traffic in the secondary, through good games 
and bad games. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it radar. Some call instinct. Some call it magic. 
</P>
<P>
 So it has been since the forward pass was born. So it is with Jeff Hostetler 
and Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's wrong with that? So why are people shaking their heads when 
Hostetler fades back and scans the field, looking for No. 81? 
</P>
<P>
 Because that's all he has done at times this season. Because the Raiders' 
highly publicized receiving corps, a track team in cleats, has become a one-man 
race. Because the best offense in the world will fail if it becomes 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a season in which he caught 80 passes for 1,180 yards, both career 
highs, in his first year with Hostetler, Brown is back on a similar pace this 
season with 50 catches in nine games for 742 yards and six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 But where is everybody else? Where is Rocket Ismail, who didn't get his 
nickname from jogging? Where is Alexander Wright, two-time winner of the NFL's 
Fastest Man race? Where is James Jett, a former gold medal-winning Olympic 
track star? 
</P>
<P>
 This group combined has caught 28 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders were defeated Sunday in Kansas City, 13-3, Brown was the only 
wide receiver who caught a pass. Jett hasn't caught one in five games. Over 
that same span, Wright has caught five and Ismail three. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no disputing the effectiveness of Hostetler and Brown, who have hooked 
up on 130 passes in a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago at the Coliseum, they gave a brilliant demonstration of their 
teamwork. The Raiders, down by four points to the Houston Oilers with two 
minutes to play, had a first down at the Houston 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler faded back and looked for Brown but found him covered in the right 
corner of the end zone. So off Hostetler streaked for the right sideline, 
hoping Brown could shake the coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 And, sure enough, Brown broke loose and cut back across the end zone. 
Hostetler delivered the game-winning touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to get it in Tim's hands," Hostetler said. "Once there, it's 
pretty safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the passing game is ineffective, as it has been much of this season 
with the Raiders falling to 4-5 and possibly to the brink of playoff 
elimination, the answer has to be more than only Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel the Raiders might be looking to him too much? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not when you're completing the pass," Brown said. "When you're completing 
passes, you can never get it thrown to you too much. When things aren't 
working, you want somebody else to get it if they are doubling me. (Sunday), we 
came to the sidelines a couple of times and said, 'Let's go to the other side.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 And they did. It's not as if Hostetler is wearing blinders. He has looked 
elsewhere for receivers on occasion this year, but the results have not been 
satisfactory. Jett has dropped several crucial throws. Ismail has been open, 
only to see passes sail over his head or drop short. Hostetler has not been as 
accurate as he was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell said, "When you've got a great player like Tim Brown, and you 
know that he's working hard to get open, (Jeff) might rely on Tim a whole lot, 
which, of course, he does. Everybody's got to work to get open and Jeff will 
find them." 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't so far.

CLEARLY, HE'S K.J., NOT J.J.; JORDAN GOES OWN ROUTE IN EMERGING AS A FORCE FOR 
UCLA WHILE STOKES BATTLES THROUGH INJURIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.J. Stokes was musing about his place in UCLA lore when he stopped, thought a 
minute and decided that it really didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame is fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'You'll go down in history,' " Stokes said. "But eventually, 
Kevin's going to break all of the records anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Jordan has already begun replacing Stokes in the Bruin record book with 
1,015 yards receiving this season. The overall mark, including postseason play, 
is 1,181 yards, within reach in a year that won't include a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan's 63 receptions are five fewer than Stokes' regular-season record, set 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean LaChapelle holds the school record for catches in a career, 142. Stokes 
is one behind with two games to play. Jordan, a junior, has 126. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' record for yardage is 2,173. Jordan has 1,777. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a quiet pursuit that is really no pursuit at all because if Jordan is 
chipping away at Stokes' fame, you can't hear the hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 A touchdown by Stokes involves a helmet off as an invitation to a camera, 
hands in the air seeking crowd approval. It is theater, a curtain call after a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, each time he broke a record held by LaChapelle, also no stranger 
to the crowd, it was duly acknowledged with an announcement, inviting more 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jordan broke Stokes' record on Oct. 29, you heard about it on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 They are teammates who complement each other and Coach Terry Donahue sees the 
pair as key to the Bruins' 3-6 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have really been interesting to have both of them all season," he 
said, wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins haven't, because of Stokes' leg injury, and that disability has 
overshadowed Jordan's accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 He is comfortable in the shadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "J.J. is a consensus All-American. He was a Heisman Trophy candidate," Jordan 
said. "I love what he's done. It's just the way life is. People are going to 
note his accomplishments more than mine, but that's OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book is going to have my name, and that's nice, but in a few years it's 
going to say somebody else's name. It's just going to be a nice little trivia 
question five or 10 years down the road: Who set the single-season yardage 
record? Nine times out of 10, people are going to say J.J. or Sean. That's 
fine. It doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Little does. Jordan is a throwback to pre-television days when a player caught 
a pass, was tackled, then handed the ball to an official and went off to the 
huddle. A touchdown was only another catch that changed numbers on a 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, UCLA practices post-touchdown celebrations, the procedure involving 
the scorer handing the ball to a lineman and getting out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a part Jordan has had trouble playing after his six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of my character," he said. "I just don't want to draw attention to 
myself. I can score a touchdown and say, 'Yeah, it's me, me, me,' but it's not. 
I had 10 other guys who helped me get into the end zone. It's good when you 
celebrate. I'm not being critical of anyone, but that's just not me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has a work ethic that is paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to UCLA from Beltsville, Md., to join his brother, Al, who had an 
injury-plagued career in Westwood. Kevin Jordan was a 170-pound tight end for a 
High Point High team that only occasionally threw the ball and was better known 
as a defensive back who had 16 interceptions in his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Bruin assistant Rick Neuheisel became Jordan's mentor, teaching him to 
catch the ball and read defenses, and, after missing a season because of an 
injury in a high school all-star game, and another because he was red-shirted, 
Jordan caught 18 passes for 150 yards as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 45 receptions for 612 yards as a sophomore, while Stokes was breaking 
LaChapelle's records. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, they fed off each other. Stokes was the more physically gifted 
at 6 feet 5, 217 pounds, faster and more flamboyant, Jordan less imposing but 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing coaches would talk of Stokes, but warn everyone not to ignore Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jordan caught six passes for 152 yards, scoring on a 52-yard play against 
Tennessee to open this season, hopes were high for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Stokes suffered a thigh bruise that night that has allowed him to 
play only one full game and parts of three others, those hopes were dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has prospered in Stokes' absence, though not because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that J.J. has not been in there as that Kevin has 
blossomed," Donahue said. "He would have had this kind of year even if J.J. had 
been in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people don't realize is that Kevin Jordan was one of the three or four 
hardest workers we had in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
 Physical preparation is one thing. Mental preparation is another. Jordan 
remains uncomfortable and a bit awed by acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 He might be the only one who doesn't know how good he really is. The UCLA 
record book can provide a clue. So do agents, who are beginning to call. The 
NFL might be the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only let time answer that question for me," he said. "I don't know if 
I'm good enough to play in the NFL. . . . People keep asking me if I'm going to 
come out and try to play in the NFL after this year. Where does that come from? 
I'm serious about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he sees himself returning for his senior season. He can graduate this 
spring, but might delay it. Or he can take a second major, to accompany a 
degree in sociology. Or he can go to graduate school. Options abound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in a good situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one for the books, however quickly the pages change. Big Numbers

RAMS SELL OUT, COWBOYS-49ERS BUMPED OFF AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in two years, a Ram home game has sold out, which means 
Sunday's meeting between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers, being 
billed as the NFL's game of the year, won't be televised in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox programming here Sunday afternoon will include professional wrestling, 
"Gilligan's Island" and "Three's Company." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't blame Fox. It's the NFL's doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is bound by the league's television policies. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raider-Ram sellout was announced Monday, that lifted the local 
blackout on a Ram home game for the first time since the team played the 49ers 
on Nov. 22, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will televise Sunday's game at 1 p.m. That happens to be the starting time 
of the 49er-Cowboy game in San Francisco, a Fox telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with NFL rules, Fox can't show a doubleheader in Los Angeles 
because the Rams are at home, and it can't show a 1 p.m. game because it can't 
go up against the Raider-Ram telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Fox has to give Los Angeles a 10 a.m. game. So this market gets 
Chicago at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rules is rules, Gov," said David Hill, Fox sports president, in his English 
brogue. "There's nothing we can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles isn't the only market being deprived of the Cowboy-49er matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of those NFL rules, New York, Boston, Miami, Green Bay-Milwaukee and 
New Orleans also can't get the game -- except, of course, on a satellite dish 
system.

FURNACE CREEK ULTRA-MARATHON GIVES CYCLISTS CHANCE TO TEST ENDURANCE AND WILL, 
BUT . . .; IT'S NO JOY RIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Enquirer would have loved this. 
</P>
<P>
 While crossing the United States on a nonstop bike ride in 1980, John Marino 
came upon flashing lights and police cars late one night in a Kansas pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino pulled over to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers said a UFO had crashed, killing four cows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing so extraordinary happened over 510 grueling miles of the Furnace Creek 
508, an annual 48-hour ultra-marathon bicycle event from Valencia to Twentynine 
Palms one recent weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, an Irvine general contractor who coaches youth soccer, was not among 
the 28 men, four women, three tandems and five four-man teams who embarked on 
this excruciating endurance test. 
</P>
<P>
 But he remains their father-figure as the one who first pedaled into the night 
and simply kept going. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 200 Americans willingly subject themselves to the punishment of 
ultra-distance cycling, and the Furnace Creek 508 is one of their toughest 
two-day events. 
</P>
<P>
 It is so tough that Rick Heiss, 38, of Bakersfield thought he might never 
finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried and failed six times before the '94 race. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say misery loves company. So Heiss, a physician, enlisted the help of 
Tom Davies of Chico, a competitive ultra-rider, as his crew chief. Davies has 
ridden this race six times and has completed it once. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you try something that much you get to the point of, 'Why are you 
there?' " Heiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why indeed? 
</P>
<P>
 That question is pondered in the chill of a quiet morning just off Interstate 
5 as race director Chris Kostman counts down the start before riders and their 
support crews. 
</P>
<P>
 It dogs these determined cyclists through the expanse of the desolate Mojave 
Desert as they inch their way into the coal-black night where, before long, 
they will be fighting fatigue, numbness, hallucinations, dehydration, sleep 
deprivation and aches and pains most others don't know exist. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few spoils for the victors: a finishers' T-shirt, a hand-thrown 
cereal bowl with name and time engraved on the bottom and a pair of hiking 
boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiking, great! Exactly what the riders want to do after this. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few spectators. The cyclists rely on their crews, the other 
competitors and mostly themselves to get through it. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert denizens with craggy faces and windblown hair shake their heads as 
the cycling parade passes their godforsaken backwater haunts such as 
Johannesberg, Trona, Kelso and Amboy. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, they just might call the cyclists in as UFO sightings. Unidentified 
Fatigued Objects. 
</P>
<P>
 The cyclists hardly notice life beyond the long, lonely stretch of pavement 
that snakes to eternity. 
</P>
<P>
 They have miles to go before they sleep. THEY'RE WILTING AWAY IN HEAT OF THE 
NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 After so much failure, Heiss is not sure why he keeps returning to the race. 
His fiancee, Tracy Hicks, has no answers, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, after all, has watched him drop out time after time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made her cry," Heiss says. 
</P>
<P>
 He quit last year after Shoshone, Calif., in the eastern Mojave because of 
fatigue and nausea caused by the broiling sun. In 1992, he developed tendinitis 
in the heel while pedaling through Death Valley National Monument. His cleats 
were too far forward in his pedaling position. 
</P>
<P>
 One year, Heiss had to drop out when a severe dust storm made it impossible to 
see and caused electrical problems with the support vehicle. Other times, Heiss 
suffered nutritional imbalance. This time, leaving nothing to chance, Hicks has 
charted Heiss' caloric intake. 
</P>
<P>
 But all it takes is one tiny problem and it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened to Steve Born last year during the Race Across America, the 
ultimate ultra-distance cycling event. Born, 36, of Ketchum, Ida., is something 
of a folk hero in the sport after finishing three consecutive Races Across 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 But last year he quit, 200 miles into the race, which is like forfeiting the 
seventh game of the World Series in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Born was suffering from who-knows-what in the 120-degree heat in Baker, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "They peeled me off the pavement," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Born, who won an Academy Award for sound for the film "Bram Stoker's Dracula," 
almost died in the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My urine was black," he says. "I felt like I was having convulsions." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not see a doctor. Instead, he sat in a hotel room and talked it out 
with his crew until his body began to function normally. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultra-athletes do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Born notes that the temperature is 54 degrees as he cruises through Baker on 
his way to victory near the end of the Furnace Creek 508.  
</P>
<P>
 He finishes in 31 hours 9 minutes, 31 minutes ahead of the second finisher, 
Rob Murlock of Brookfield, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a triumph of the mind, Born says after bursting past the makeshift 
finish line of generic white toilet paper. He is greeted by the polite applause 
of race officials and his two-member crew. PERCHED ON THE EDGE AND ENJOYING IT 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of tiny problems. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Three miles after the start, Heiss passes his crew and is thrown for a loop. 
Davies is bent over the engine of Heiss' 1970 pink and green VW van. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a bad carburetor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pain," Davies says later, after fixing it. "We went across the whole 
United States without a breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies, 55, is referring to his ride in the Race Across America, pedaled each 
summer from Orange County to Georgia. The Furnace Creek 508 serves as a 
qualifying event for the Race Across America. 
</P>
<P>
 But Furnace Creek is famous within cycling circles because anyone with a bike 
and a $165 entry fee can try it. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is difficult, although some of the Race Across America riders mockingly 
call it a short jaunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The race has been held in sundry forms for 19 years. But the Furnace Creek 
course has been used since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In all that time, only one serious accident has occurred. Henry Kingman, who 
crewed for Eric House of Palo Alto this year, fell in 1991 on the dreaded 
10-mile, 4,900-foot Towne Pass that leads into Death Valley. He lost his 
concentration as a truck passed him at night. He was taken to a Nevada hospital 
and was determined to be OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostman, 27, has been to 17 of these events. It has been a natural progression 
from participant to crewman to race director. For his efforts he earns about 
$3,000, but he's not sure of the exact amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't filed my taxes in two years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostman, working toward a doctorate in Arabian Gulf archeology from UC 
Berkeley, could hold the race during winter, when the desert floor stays cool 
most days, instead of October. But what would be the point? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to make it too easy on them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostman understands the cyclists' pain. He once set some ultra records, one 
from San Francisco to Los Angeles, and another across California. When not 
organizing cycling events, or off on a Persian Gulf research project, he 
competes in 100-mile snowshoe races in Alaska, ultra-swims or 24-hour mountain 
bike rides. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is senior editor of a cult magazine called Over the Edge. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a title that fits him. THE BIG SLEEP IS A DREAM AWAY 
</P>
<P>
 At a pre-race dinner where the race rules are loosely discussed, a 48-year-old 
bug specialist is asked to say a few words. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name is Reed Finfrock and I am a wimp," he starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Finfrock, from the Central Valley farming community of Lindsay, explains how 
he finally finished the race by ordering his crew to not let him in the car, no 
matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to get to Twentynine Palms was either riding or walking," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He rode. 
</P>
<P>
 Finfrock, who raises beneficial insects, becomes one of 20 men to complete the 
race this year. Two women -- Emmy Klassen of Ojai and Stephanie Barry of Marina 
del Rey -- and all of the teams also finish. Usually, the attrition rate is 
50%, but a cloud cover keeps things cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "They scored this year," Kostman says of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Finfrock prepared for the ordeal by taking a holiday. He rode from Everett, 
Wash., to Virginia in an organized tour last summer, averaging 140 miles a day 
for 24 days. On weekends, he rode from Lindsay to Cedar Grove in Kings Canyon 
National Park -- 100 miles up the Sierra Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 If Finfrock, a gray-haired man who wears a ponytail, has learned anything in 
ultra-cycling it is this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us who finish this thing are very rare people." 
</P>
<P>
 Heiss has long wanted to join that group. 
</P>
<P>
 But his family practice takes so much of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks, who runs the office, says he puts as much energy into medicine as he 
does into cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiss rode only 750 miles in three months to prepare for Furnace Creek. Most 
competitors, such as Born, do that in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Finfrock's philosophy sticks with Heiss as he plugs along, inching up the 
grades that put the legendary climbs of the Tour de France to shame: Stay on 
the bike. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are obstacles. His snazzy, $2,500 graphite bike suffered a broken 
spoke. Ordinarily, a broken spoke in a bike wheel is not a serious problem but 
in this case, the spoke is one of only three wide stainless steel supports for 
a steel rim. The wheel in this condition is too dangerous to use. Heiss 
continues on a backup bike as Davies fixes the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could do the same thing on a three-speed Huffy if you were tough enough," 
Heiss says of riding the backup. 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching Furnace Creek, the halfway point, Heiss paces himself through 
the night. Beyond the camp grounds and inn at Furnace Creek, Death Valley is 
silent. Heading toward Badwater and the lowest point in the United States, 
there are specks of light dotting the landscape as the crews illuminate the way 
for their riders. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tortuous, and torturous, Towne Pass to reach Death Valley, there are 
two equally devastating climbs to get out: Jubilee and Salsberry passes. They 
have traditionally been Heiss' Waterloo.  
</P>
<P>
 He has reached this area four other times. In fact, he went 460 miles once 
before his body refused to go another inch. But Heiss knows this is where the 
race really begins. 
</P>
<P>
 He tries not to think about the past and all those failures as the day 
progresses. He keeps pumping. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime around 7 p.m., under the cover of darkness, he reaches the finish, a 
hotel parking lot on the main strip in Twentynine Palms. He is eighth. But he 
has finished. Rick Heiss has finally finished the Furnace Creek 508. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiss receives a small greeting from Kostman and other officials, who remain 
at the finish until 7 the next morning, waiting for stragglers. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiss also makes the qualifying time for the Race Across America, but cannot 
fathom trying that yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he is concerned with returning to Bakersfield. While he was pedaling, 
three of his patients were admitted to Mercy Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a weathered and beaten Dr. Richard Heiss hobbles through the 
hospital corridors, checking his patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they know the extent of my craziness," he says later that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 How could they? A Long Ride 
</P>
<P>
 The Furnace Creek 508, held last month from Valencia to Twentynine Palms, is a 
510-mile ultra-distance bicycle race held annually in the Mojave Desert. 
Twenty-eight men, four women, three tandems and five four-men teams started 
this year's race that Steve Born of Ketchum, Ida., won in 31 hours 9 minutes.

HAWKS TRADE WILLIS AND A NO. 1 PICK TO MIAMI; PRO BASKETBALL: ATLANTA ACQUIRES 
STEVE SMITH, GRANT LONG AND A SECOND-ROUND CHOICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Atlanta Hawks traded one of the NBA's best power forwards Monday, sending 
Kevin Willis and a No. 1 draft pick to the Miami Heat for Steve Smith, Grant 
Long and a second-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on the way to Oakland, and I'll strap on a new uniform tomorrow night," 
Willis said by telephone from Salt Lake International Airport in Salt Lake 
City. "I'm glad (Miami partner) Billy Cunningham and (Coach Kevin) Loughery see 
that I'm a player we can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta has the choice of giving Miami its No. 1 pick in 1995 or 1996. If the 
1996 pick is one of the first five, Atlanta can hold off for another year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something in the back of my mind told me something was brewing," Willis said. 
"This afternoon it came through. It's a weird feeling. I said I could play ball 
anywhere. I have no hard feelings. We got an exciting team (in Miami)." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis was expected to be in uniform for Miami tonight at Golden State. Smith 
and Long were expected to play Wednesday night at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis, 32, averaged 19.1 points and 10.8 rebounds as an All-Star last season, 
helping the Hawks to a 57-25 record and the regular-season Eastern Conference 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 He held out briefly during training camp this fall, looking to have his 
contract renegotiated. Willis said the Heat agreed to restructure his deal, 
although he did not know the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know nobody in Atlanta will believe this, but this had nothing to do with 
Kevin holding out," Atlanta General Manager Pete Babcock said in Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a lot of flexibility in the backcourt, which we desperately 
needed. We needed an influx of offensive energy, and Steve can shoot from the 
perimeter." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 25, was a member of the U.S. world championship team -- also known as 
"Dream Team II" -- last summer. With the Heat last season, he averaged 17.3 
points, 5.1 assists and 4.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, 28, averaged 11.4 points and 7.2 rebounds as a power forward. He could 
take Willis' place in Atlanta's starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grant Long gives us a solid frontcourt player and rebounder. He's got a 
toughness about him, he battles every night and he gets his points -- 11 or 12 
a night," Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Miami traded center Rony Seikaly to Golden State for small forward 
Billy Owens, a trade Smith criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis figures to team with Owens and John Salley on Miami's starting front 
line.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; ACROSS THE NATION; GEORGIA TECH COACH LEWIS 
STEPS DOWN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Georgia Tech football coach Bill Lewis resigned Monday night and the school 
named defensive coordinator George O'Leary to finish out the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Homer Rice said a search committee would be formed to seek a 
permanent replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who is to remain with the program, led the Yellow Jackets to an 11-19 
record in three seasons. They are 1-7 overall and 0-6 in the Atlantic Coast 
Conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, the ninth head coach in Georgia Tech history, signed a five-year 
rollover contract on Jan. 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yellow Jackets were 5-6 in each of Lewis' first two seasons and have not 
beaten a Division 1-A team with a winning record since a 16-13 victory over 
North Carolina State on Oct. 3, 1992.

 Lawyers for a group of University of Washington football players withdrew 
their motion for an injunction to temporarily end the probation that bars the 
Huskies from a bowl game this season. The players said they decided to give up 
their fight for a temporary injunction after their team lost, 46-28, to 
Stanford on Saturday. The loss gave Washington a 6-3 record, making it unlikely 
the team would be asked to a major bowl.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; PLAY-CALLING DRAWS MORE CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Todd Lyght joined in tight end Troy Drayton's frustration about 
the Rams' predictable play-calling at the Denver one-yard line Sunday. The Rams 
ran three consecutive running plays up the middle to tailback Jerome Bettis and 
failed to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get down to the goal line we need to mix it up a little more," Lyght 
said. "Everybody knows we're going with Jerome. We have other guys on offense 
making money. Take the pressure off Jerome and use them. By using them, we can 
open it back up for Jerome." 
</P>
<P>
 A pass had been called on second down, but Ram quarterback Chris Chandler, who 
said the helmet radio wasn't working, misread the coaches' hand signals from 
the sideline and called another running play to Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler complained of problems with his helmet headset during an exhibition 
game. Knox said some NFL teams have chosen not to use the headsets, and that 
the Rams are considering not using them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take a long, hard look at it," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ram linebacker Joe Kelly stays in touch with some of his former Raider 
teammates, but he still harbors some resentment toward the Raider front office 
for cutting him for salary cap reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put it bluntly, I still think it was (messed) up," Kelly said. "It was Al 
Davis' decision, it's his team. But I'm a good player, and I'm still out here 
making plays. It's a decision Al made, and he has to live with it." 
</P>
<P>

 Linebacker Henry Rolling will undergo surgery to repair a fractured eye socket 
and will be out at least two to three weeks. . . . Chandler, cornerback Darryl 
Henley (10 solo tackles) and Lyght were awarded game balls. MIKE REILLEY

CHANDLER TO START AHEAD OF MILLER FOR RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: LINGERING EFFECTS OF 
CONCUSSION ON MILLER ARE CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox broke from tradition Monday and named Chris Chandler the 
starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Raiders, demoting Chris 
Miller to a $3-million-a-year backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox normally doesn't make personnel decisions on Mondays, but named Chandler 
the starter for the second consecutive week based on his play Sunday in the 
Rams' 27-21 victory over Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 But Knox has wavered between Miller and Chandler all season. As late as 
Sunday, Miller was still being bothered by a concussion he suffered in a game 
Oct. 23 at New Orleans. So is the starting job Chandler's to keep, or lose? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anything is ever etched in stone," Knox said. "He had a big 
game yesterday and we'll go on from here." 
</P>
<P>
 So he has won the starting job? 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll start this week," Knox said. "What is 'won the job'? I don't know what 
you're talking about. That's a categorical statement." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are 4-5 and need a victory over the Raiders to keep their slim 
playoff hopes alive. Does having one starter down the stretch give the Rams 
continuity they need on offense? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's obvious that Chandler has got the work," Knox said. "We had the bye 
week and Miller was injured. Chandler got the work and played very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler said he thought he had won the starting job after filling in Sunday 
for Miller. Chandler completed 19 of 25 passes for 223 yards and two touchdowns 
against a Denver secondary that ranks last in the league, and improved his 
record as the Rams' starter to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler suffered a mild concussion himself when he hit, helmet to helmet, 
Denver's Steve Atwater on a quarterback sneak. Chandler said Monday that he 
felt fine, but Miller said he needs more time to recover from his concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure there's some disappointment, but I understand why," Miller said of his 
demotion. "Chris played well and my head still isn't healed all the way. That's 
no excuse. This just gives me more time to get it right." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller denied an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report that he was considering 
retirement because of the concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't said that to anybody," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox is a known to be a strong Chandler supporter, and injuries have kept 
Miller from starting an entire NFL season, which is why the Rams pursued a 
proven starter such as Chandler. The team originally courted Chandler as a 
starter, but brought him back as a backup after signing Miller to the 
three-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always liked Chandler," Knox said. "We liked him coming out of college 
at Washington. Our staff had him at the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler lost previous starting jobs with Tampa Bay and Arizona, but views 
this situation as the perfect opportunity to establish himself as the permanent 
starter -- and land a contract extension with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 He becomes an unrestricted free agent after this season and expansion teams in 
Charlotte and Jacksonville will be seeking experienced quarterbacks. Although 
Chandler could probably seek more money elsewhere, he said he would like to 
re-sign with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a perfect world, once you're established in this system, you really 
wouldn't want to leave it," he said.

SHAW REACHES OUT, TOUCHES FOOTBALL FANS IN ST. LOUIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Ram President John Shaw tries to defuse speculation in Southern California 
that the team is heading to St. Louis, he appears to be giving fans there 
reason to be excited about a potential move. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw apparently has called two St. Louis fans who had written to him and told 
one he hopes he can get the team moved there. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Herrick, a 31-year-old college counselor from St. Louis, said Shaw 
called Friday, and Jim Rindler, a 45-year-old advertising executive from 
Ballwin, Mo., said Shaw called him Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrick said a message machine in another room answered Shaw's call as he 
picked up the phone, and he inadvertently recorded the 90-second conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw could not be reached Monday, but Herrick played the tape for three Times 
reporters who regularly cover the Rams and they identified the voice as Shaw's. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw thanked Herrick for his letter and told him the Rams are serious about 
moving. Herrick then told Shaw how St. Louis fans would have a real passion for 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to hear that," Shaw replied. "I'm impressed with your mail support. 
I just wanted to let people know we're grateful for it, and hopefully we'll get 
it done for you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Rindler, who sent a batch of candy bars to Shaw for Halloween with the 
message, "It will be a real treat for you to come to St. Louis," said he was 
stunned to get a call from the Ram executive Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like getting a call from the president of the United States," Rindler 
said. "He said he was coming to town shortly and was going to make a decision 
this month. I was impressed that he opens his own mail. That's the mark of a 
sincere person."

 Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has had discussions with Raider 
owner Al Davis about moving the team to Baltimore and perhaps selling a piece 
of it to Maryland investors, according to a source close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you is that there were discussions and it wasn't just a 
passing thing," said the source."They were obviously substantive discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has long been believed that Davis would never sell the club, these 
talks have involved the possibility of such a transaction. "It would strictly 
be a piece of the team," the source said. "Not all of it. Al would be reserving 
the right of operating the team."

 It was supposed to be the Raiders versus the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday. But 
during a week of pregame verbal sparring that would have made Don King proud, 
the story turned into Harvey Williams versus Neil Smith.Williams, the Raider 
tailback, talked about the bitterness he felt over his treatment by Coach Marty 
Schottenheimer during Williams' three years with the Chiefs. Smith, a Kansas 
City defensive lineman, sent a message via the media to Williams: Shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened when they met at Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium? 
</P>
<P>
 The first few times they collided, Smith continued his tirade, appearing to 
shove Williams once. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams walked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Don't even try (those tactics),' " Williams said. "After we got 
that out of the way, it was all right. All the guys (from Kansas City) wished 
me well." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams told reporters as he dressed after Sunday's game that he was going to 
pause outside to visit with an old friend -- Neil Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders limped home from Sunday's loss in Kansas City with various bumps 
and bruises, but none appear to be serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive backs Albert Lewis (knee), Derrick Hoskins (ankle) and Patrick Bates 
(shoulder), and offensive lineman Robert Jenkins (ankle) are all hoping to 
practice this week in preparation for Sunday's game against the Rams at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Rob Holmberg suffered a compound fracture of the finger Sunday, but 
finished the game.

when practice resumes. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; PLAY-CALLING DRAWS MORE CRITICISM

 Ram cornerback Todd Lyght joined in tight end Troy Drayton's frustration about 
the Rams' predictable play-calling at the Denver one-yard line Sunday. The Rams 
ran tailback Jerome Bettis up the middle on three consecutive plays and failed 
to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get down to the goal line, we need to mix it up a little more," Lyght 
said. "Everybody knows we're going with Jerome. We have other guys on offense 
making money. Take the pressure off Jerome and use them. By using them, we can 
open it back up for Jerome." 
</P>
<P>
 A pass had been called on second down, but quarterback Chris Chandler, who 
said the helmet radio wasn't working, misread the coaches' hand signals from 
the sideline and called another running play. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler complained of problems with his helmet headset during an exhibition 
game. Coach Chuck Knox said some NFL teams have chosen not to use the helmet 
sets, and that the Rams are considering discontinuing using them. . . . 
Linebacker Henry Rolling will undergo surgery to repair a broken eye socket and 
will be out at least two weeks. MIKE REILLEY

 El Toro, which has won 22 consecutive water polo playoff games, might have a 
tough time reaching 23. In the most intriguing matchup of the Southern Section 
Division I playoffs announced Monday, the Chargers play Villa Park Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro has won the last two Division I titles. The Chargers won Division 3-A 
titles in 1988, '89 and '90, but missed the playoffs in '91. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park also has something extra to play for -- Coach Jeff Erlich's 400th 
career victory. Ehrlich is 399-137 in 21 seasons at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park (20-7) and El Toro (15-11) split two games this season, each 
winning, 8-5. Villa Park was ranked No. 6 in the final Division I poll and El 
Toro No. 8. The game will be played at a site to be determined by Villa Park. 
</P>

Division I, Esperanza (20-6) in Division II and Brea-Olinda (22-4) in Division 
VI.

(24-2) plays host to Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (17-8), an at-large team from the 
Mission League. No. 4 Foothill (20-5) will play host to Mission Viejo (13-13). 
</P>
<P>
 In the all-Orange County Division II, Servite (18-9) is seeded second, Costa 
Mesa (21-5) is seeded third and La Habra (15-4) fourth.

 Alemany High's Samantha Rigley, the Times All-Valley girls basketball player 
of the year in 1994, said Monday she will sign a letter of intent to play 
basketball at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA's weeklong fall signing period begins Wednesday. She considered the 
University of San Francisco and the University of Portland, but made her 
decision after visiting Pepperdine last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley averaged 14.8 points and six rebounds per game as Alemany won the 
Southern Section Division II-A championship. The Indians lost to Irvine 
Woodbridge in the semifinals of the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigley, a 5-foot-11 power forward at Alemany, said she will get a chance to 
start at shooting guard as a freshman for the Waves. MICHAEL LAZARUS

PREP VOLLEYBALL PAIRINGS; SUNSET LEAGUE'S MARINA SHUT OUT OF PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Marina girls' volleyball Coach Jason Bilbruck found out what is worse than a 
bad draw for the Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Vikings finished tied for third in the Sunset League, arguably 
one of the strongest leagues in the section, they weren't invited to the 
playoffs, which begin today. The Vikings (10-7) tied Esperanza (7-7) for third, 
splitting their head-to-head matches. But Esperanza won the tie-breaker because 
it defeated Marina in four games. Marina defeated Esperanza in five. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our league constitution that we don't play a playoff match for 
third-place ties," Bilbruck said. "That's one of the first things I'll bring up 
at our league meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 If Marina was playing in Division II, it could have petitioned for one of the 
two at-large berths. But there were no at-large berths available in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor (21-1), led by Misty May and Melissa Schutz, is the top-seeded 
team in Division I. Manhattan Beach Mira Costa (17-0) is seeded second, Laguna 
Beach (20-3) is third-seeded and Edison (15-1) is fourth-seeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the tougher wild-card matches today feature Capistrano Valley (7-7) at 
Esperanza and South Torrance (12-4) at Huntington Beach (13-3). 
</P>
<P>
 The Capistrano Valley-Esperanza winner plays at Newport Harbor in a 
first-round match Thursday and the South Torrance-Huntington Beach winner plays 
at Corona del Mar (8-6), the two-time defending State Division I champion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel (12-4), the Olympic League champion that won the section 
Division V title last season, is top-seeded in Division IV. Courtney Owens and 
Lynn Lovingier are two of the top returners from last season's championship 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division V, St. Margaret's (9-5) is seeded third. Los Angeles Brentwood is 
top-seeded, North Hills L.A. Baptist is seeded second and Sierra Madre 
Maranatha is seeded fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The pairings: 
</P>
<P>
 Today (Wild-card round) 
</P>

Beach; Thousand Oaks at Mater Dei; University at El Toro.

NHL LABOR; TALKS REPORTEDLY PROGRESSING AMID FEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Under pressure from club owners -- some of whom say they will lose as much as 
$15 million if the season is canceled -- the NHL appears to be softening its 
stance toward its players. A source independent of both sides in the dispute 
said league officials are considering allowing the season to start while they 
continue bargaining with the players' association, a course they have twice 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 An NHL delegation, led by Commissioner Gary Bettman and supplemented by 
general managers Bob Clarke of Philadelphia and Lou Lamoriello of New Jersey, 
met for seven hours Monday in New York with Bob Goodenow, executive director of 
the NHL Players Assn., and Mike Gartner and Ken Baumgartner of the union's 
negotiating committee. It was learned they agreed to temporarily halt 
discussing levies on club payrolls, their greatest source of disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A management source interpreted their willingness to meet again Thursday, 
probably in Toronto, as a positive sign, saying they would not have arranged 
another session if no progress had been made Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is running out for playing a meaningful schedule. The NHL, which has 
canceled 14 games in each club's 84-game schedule, is working on a new, 50-game 
schedule in which teams would play only conference rivals. It would be preceded 
by a training camp of seven to 10 days and one exhibition game. To accomplish 
that, an agreement would have to be reached by the middle or end of December 
and play would have to begin by early January. Bettman has said he will not 
extend the playoffs past June.

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; SAVINIO IS THE STAR ON CLOSING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savinio is more relaxed these days and his connections are enjoying it more. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased by owner Gary Biszantz for about $100,000 in 1992, the 4-year-old 
gelded son of The Minstrel is starting to get his act together and he came up 
with the best performance of his career Monday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-1 second choice in Oak Tree's closing-day feature, the $163,200 Carleton 
F. Burke Handicap, Savinio had a dream trip behind pacesetters Square Cut and 
Newton's Law, then had the right response when called on by Chris McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start at 1 1/4 miles, Savinio rolled home by 4 1/2 lengths in 
2:02 3/5. Square Cut, a 21-1 shot, saved second by a neck over 5-2 favorite Sir 
Mark Sykes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been training great and the big thing is he's starting to relax now," 
trainer Walter Greenman said of Savinio. "That makes a big difference. This is 
a beautiful, well-bred horse that is an absolute pleasure to train. It really 
makes me feel good to see him put it all together and run like he did today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have no idea what his next race will be. I suppose we'll just see 
how he comes out of this one and take it from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Savinio hadn't won either of his two previous starts, he had run 
well. He was second, a length behind Earl Of Barking, at Del Mar, then chased 
Romarin, one of two Brazilian stars in trainer Richard Mandella's barn -- along 
with Sandpit -- in an allowance race on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day, I got overly aggressive with him in the first part of the race 
and I strangled him," McCarron said after his second stakes victory of the 
27-day meeting. "He's a horse that pulls hard and I wanted to get the jump on 
him . . . not let him pull me out of the saddle like he had done with Eddie 
(Delahoussaye) a few times. I got him too far back and I forced him to make up 
too much ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I found a compromise . . . a happy medium with him. I let him break a 
little bit, then I took a hold of him. He rated well. He gave me a nice easy 
ride. I didn't have to let him run until the three-sixteenths pole." 
</P>
<P>
 Square Cut, who began with two victories in five starts on the Santa Anita 
turf course, put away Newton's Law, who wound up last, after some fast 
fractions, and had enough left to hold off Sir Mark Sykes. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third consecutive race Sir Mark Sykes was beaten as the favorite 
and he had no real excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just a little flat in his finish," jockey Corey Black said. "I had a 
good trip following Savinio and I thought I was going to be no worse than 
second at the quarter pole. I couldn't believe I couldn't get by Square Cut, 
the way he went early. But my horse just went even down the lane." 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Following up his title at Del Mar, Corey Nakatani led the Oak Tree jockey 
standings, finishing with 30 victories, three more than Alex Solis. Eddie 
Delahoussaye was third with 25. Kent Desormeaux, with 22, and Laffit Pincay, 
with 20, completed the top five. . . . Gary Jones finished on top with 10 
victories in the trainer standings, two more than Craig Lewis. Sandy Shulman, 
Mel Stute, Charlie Whittingham, Mike Mitchell and Dave Hofmans each had seven. 
The title was the fifth for Jones in the Oak Tree meeting, putting him one 
behind all-time leader Bobby Frankel. . . . The year after hosting the 
Breeders' Cup, the Oak Tree meeting's daily averages were down both from last 
year and 1992. Excluding Breeders' Cup day in 1993 and 1994, the track was down 
8% in daily average on track attendance and 5.2% in total attendance.

MAKING THE GRADE; STUDENT-ATHLETES ARE FINDING THAT BEING NO. 1 IN A SPORT 
ISN'T ENOUGH. THEY MUST ALSO SCORE THE RIGHT NUMBERS IN THE CLASSROOM TO EARN 
COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Doug Gottlieb is the NCAA's Proposition 16 ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin High senior is a point guard with vision. He saw that athletic 
skills were not going to be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play in college, so I had to understand all the academic 
requirements," Gottlieb said. "Every (basketball) camp I went to had an 
academic session. Some people didn't listen. I took it to heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The reward? He will sign a letter of intent with Notre Dame Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb's numbers show he earned it. His scoring: 18.0 per game. His assists: 
8.1 per game. His grade-point average: 3.7. His Scholastic Aptitude Test score: 
1,040. 
</P>
<P>
 He has that student-athlete balance the NCAA pictured when it set out to 
improve academic performance, a mission that continues to evolve with the 
possible institution of Prop. 16 in August. 
</P>
<P>
 An aspiring college student-athlete will need to have a higher grade-point 
average (2.5) in more core classes (13) than he did under Prop. 16's 
predecessor, Prop. 48, which required a 2.0 GPA in 11 core courses. 
</P>
<P>
 An SAT score of 700 out of a possible 1,600 or a 17 out of a possible 36 on 
the American College Test is also required for the student-athlete to receive 
full benefits from an athletic scholarship, and avoid partial-qualifier status. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prop. 16 offers a sliding scale, where a higher GPA in the core classes 
could offset a lower SAT score, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal was to try to establish a national standard at the Division I 
level," said Francis Canavan, the NCAA's group executive director of public 
affairs, "so that the student-athlete would have some reasonable measure of 
preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
 But Prop. 16 has opponents too, including the Black Coaches Assn. Its concern 
is that sports in which many blacks compete, football and basketball, will be 
disproportionately affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 16 will be put to a vote at the NCAA's convention in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how the vote falls, it would behoove high school seniors to have 
their academic houses in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can't pass Prop. 16, you probably won't survive in college," Gottlieb 
said. "It wasn't a problem for me, but a lot of players will be playing at 
junior colleges because of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But is it possible that Prop. 16 will eliminate four-year college 
opportunities for students who could have actually succeeded? 
</P>
<P>
 Is the NCAA really trying to improve preparation of student-athletes for 
college, or is Prop. 16 merely window dressing in an attempt to improve its 
public image? 
</P>
<P>
 Has Prop. 48 raised academic awareness for student-athletes or has it caused 
more damage? 
</P>
<P>
 The effects of Prop. 48 were devastating for some athletes. If they didn't 
meet the requirements, they lost a year of eligibility. They also could not 
work out with the team and could not receive athletic scholarships as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 It caught many student-athletes flat-footed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't aware of the requirements until after I signed a letter of intent," 
said Tes Whitlock, a former Loara basketball standout who signed with Arizona 
State. "It was tough. I had been playing ball for 10-12 years. I didn't know 
how to go to school and not play basketball at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlock did improve his grades and became eligible at Arizona State. But he 
never worked into the Sun Devils' starting lineup. Whitlock equated his 
presence at the school with his sport. When he did not receive playing time, he 
stopped attending classes and his grades slipped. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended Saddleback College, where he still struggled academically. He is 
now playing at Hawaii and is eligible to play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who fall short on Prop. 16 may not face as tough a road. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous amendments to Prop. 16 will also be examined and voted on at the NCAA 
convention. According to Canavan, some of these will help determine whether 
Prop. 16 is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the amendments: 
</P>
<P>
 * A one-year delay on the implementation of Prop. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Adjusting the admission requirements of a partial qualifier and altering the 
potential financial aid benefits and athletic participation rules. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "fourth-year" rule. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the most hotly debated topics, Canavan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-year rule attempts to reinstate the year of eligibility that Prop. 
48 partial qualifiers lost. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Canavan, the amendment would allow a partial qualifier, who has 
shown "satisfactory progress toward completing a degree" during his three years 
of athletic eligibility, to have his fourth year reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't reinstate that fourth year for someone who has shown for three 
or four years that he can achieve academically at that university, then you are 
penalizing him for a test he took four or five years ago," Canavan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to find the balance between the standards and the consequences. If 
you raise the standards, but the consequences aren't as harsh, that will be 
more acceptable to most people. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get into problems when the consequences are considered too severe or 
lenient for the present standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current proposal, Prop. 16 partial qualifiers will receive their 
athletic scholarships and will be allowed to practice with their teams, 
contrary to Prop. 48. Under both propositions, partial qualifiers cannot 
participate in games. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, a Prop. 16 partial qualifier's freshman year would be the 
equivalent of a redshirt season. The only difference: the student-athlete would 
initially lose a year of eligibility but could later regain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people feel Prop. 16 waters down the consequences of Prop. 48 too much," 
Canavan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some athletes who failed to qualify under Prop. 48 may have been denied an 
opportunity to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's Oscar Wilson, The Times Orange County lineman of the year in 1988 
and '89, fell below the standards of Prop. 48. He was a Division I-caliber 
college football player, but was viewed as a subpar student by Prop. 48 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is now a senior at Cal State Northridge and on track to graduate with a 
degree in sociology in 1996. Wilson spent three years at Rancho Santiago 
College before transferring to Northridge in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He preferred community college, where he could play, to a four-year school, 
where he would sit. There, he saw others who never made it to the next level. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "Some guys had trouble getting out of junior college. If they had 
gone straight to a university, it might have pushed them more to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Prop. 16, that risk would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Prop. 48 casualty, Whitlock, who could not practice or play games with 
his teammates, said he lacked his main incentive to succeed academically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing pickup basketball just didn't do it," Whitlock said. "I think that's 
why I had trouble at Arizona State. I was concentrating on school work, but I 
didn't have basketball as a release. Basketball is the reason I was at the 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA sees it a bit differently. Athletes are in school to learn, and not 
just X's and O's. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a study conducted by the NCAA showed that Prop. 48 and Prop. 16 were 
not completely effective and efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 One study explored members of the high school graduating class of 1985, before 
Prop. 48 went into effect, and charted their progress through college. Then, 
the study overlaid the requirements of the propositions onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty percent of all student-athletes admitted to college in 1985 who 
received financial aid did not meet Prop. 16's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 More alarming to Canavan was the number of "false negatives" presented by the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven percent of those entering college in 1985 who did not meet Prop. 16 
standards went on to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've yet to see what Prop. 16 will do to the recruiting field," Nebraska 
football Coach Tom Osborne said in an interview with the Lincoln Journal-Star 
earlier this year. "(Prop. 16) has been predicted to increase the graduation 
rate in colleges by less than two-tenths of one percent, yet reduces the 
recruitment field by a third." 
</P>
<P>
 Russ Gough, an ethics professor at Pepperdine, agreed and had a different 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "After looking at the data, it just seems to me that Props. 48 and 16 
certainly have the veneer of being a quick-fix PR campaign more than anything 
else," Gough recently told The Times. "I don't think 48 or 16 are having any 
impact on restoring academic integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but NCAA officials hope it will shore up athletic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is arguing to limit access to higher education or arguing against 
trying to limit exploitation of student-thletes," Canavan said. "We have to 
find that balance between providing opportunity while avoiding exploitation. 
Hopefully, we'll get it done."

CHRIS FOSTER: THEIR ACTS COULD USE SOME SOAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Take a memo. 
</P>
<P>
 To: Newport -- Mesa Unified School District officials.  
</P>
<P>
 From: A casual observer.  
</P>
<P>
 Subject: Dirty laundry.  
</P>
<P>
 Ugly situation you folks got over there. One high school football coach angry, 
another angrier. Still another tossing in his two cents at inflationary rates 
-- and he's not even involved in the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's that again about molding young men's minds and building character? 
</P>
<P>
 Seems Myron Miller, your coach at Costa Mesa, got somewhat chatty with a 
reporter prior to the Estancia game. Just a few pregame thoughts, little 
ditties like, "We'll win 100-0 if we get the chance." And, "We're also playing 
to recruit kids in our district; they shop around." Oh, and, " . . . so if we 
get a chance to score in the last minute, we'll score." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Nobel Prize for sportsmanship is . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Well, the Mustangs scored with four seconds left to cap a 55-12 thrashing a 
couple Fridays ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there was talk about the Eagles having it coming. Some on the Costa Mesa 
side grumbled about Estancia's "people" tattling on Miller for having a couple 
players living at his house. The district did receive a telephone call from a 
private investigator regarding the "case." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller does have two players in residence. The Southern Section is aware of 
the non-athletic reasons and OK'd it. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of being satisfied with an innocent verdict and a good-deed halo, 
Miller hauled out the incident as a motivational tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess he was saving that turn-the-other-cheek lesson for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems John Liebengood, your coach at Estancia, didn't take too kindly to all 
that. A couple days after the rout, he fired back: "I wouldn't do that to 
anyone, as a head coach, a person or a friend . . . " And, "Maybe I was taught 
differently, but I couldn't do those things." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but make sure your house isn't made by Waterford before chucking 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebengood didn't have a problem trotting out his first-team defense to 
prevent La Quinta from scoring with one second left earlier this season. 
Estancia was leading, 31-0, at the time. Liebengood said afterward that his 
defensive coordinator wanted the shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, as long as he went home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems a blindside came from Mark Schuster, your first-year coach at Corona del 
Mar. He questioned Miller's coaching ethics. Never mind that Costa Mesa hasn't 
played Corona del Mar this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't Mark have enough worries trying to make the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to find a hero, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 But the question is, what lessons are planned? Oh, your district issued a gag 
order on all the verbal shenanigans, but is that enough? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, this little tete-a-tete isn't ripping Orange County apart. Costa Mesa 
and Newport Beach haven't exactly been torn asunder. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yeah, these guys hardly reside at rock bottom. Why just up the road at a 
Huntington Beach high school, there are a couple of assistant coaches whose 
antics toward game officials might lead to a rather ugly incident some day. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is good for high school football. Someone has to cry, enough . It 
can't be boys-will-be-boys and business-as-usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Two points. 
</P>
<P>
 First: Century League officials certainly sent a get-the-message message 
recently by suspending Canyon Coach Bob Hughes two games for disrupting a game 
in progress. Now that might be a little harsh in this case. But a little 
discipline seems appropriate. After all, these coaches would assuredly mete out 
a bit of it had one of their players popped off in such fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Second: Don't forget to pat Newport Harbor's Jeff Brinkley on the back. He's 
your district's only coach who wasn't playing with jacks last week.

MANY OF THE COUNTY'S BEST WILL SIGN IN THE NEXT WEEK 
</P>

<P>
 Marcy Crouch could be Orange County's finest all-around high school athlete. 
Last season, she helped Marina win Southern Section championships in softball 
and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 And she's not a bad student either. Crouch has a 3.96 grade-point average and 
scored 1,250 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford recruited Crouch, who is also a standout on the volleyball team, and 
the senior is expected to sign with the Cardinal this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday is the first day of the early signing period for etters of intent, 
and many of the county's top athletes have made oral commitments and plan to 
sign between Nov. 9-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Crouch, an outside hitter, couldn't help the Vikings secure an 
automatic bid for the volleyball playoffs, she impressed coaches and 
recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcy and our setter, Jessica Lyon, always stepped up in the big matches," 
Marina Coach Jason Bilbruck said. "This is her third sport; that's kind of 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 After earning all-county honors in softball and soccer last season, Crouch, a 
pitcher, will sign a letter of intent to accept a softball scholarship with 
Stanford. She has not decided whether she will play collegiate soccer or 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Pac-10 schools expected to land top Orange County players are Arizona 
(Foothill's Michelle Churnock), Arizona State (Ocean View's Kathy Ponce) and 
UCLA (Cypress' Julie Adams). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wednesday is the first day of the early signing period for most 
sports, the signing period for football is Feb. 1-April 1. The signing period 
for field hockey, soccer, women's volleyball and water polo begins Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six Orange County boys' basketball players are expected to sign early 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, only Arizona's Miles Simon (Mater Dei) signed early. Tony 
Gonzalez (Huntington Beach) could have signed early, but waited to sign in 
February so he could play football and basketball at California. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the boys' basketball players who have made oral commitments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tustin's Doug Gottlieb, Notre Dame. Gottlieb, a 6-foot point guard, was a 
Times first-team all-county selection and Sea View League MVP last season. He 
averaged 18 points and 8.1 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Servite's Mark Seaton, Stanford. Seaton, a 6-foot-9 forward and second-team 
All-Sunset League selection, averaged 10 points last season and helped the 
Friars reach the Southern Section Division III-AA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mater Dei's Clay McKnight, UC Irvine. McKnight, a sharp-shooting guard and 
son of Monarch Coach and Athletic Director Gary McKnight, averaged 14.6 points 
and made 49% of his three-pointers last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Also expected to sign early are Mater Dei's Shaun Jackson (Wyoming), a 6-7 
forward, Sonora's Craig Clark (San Jose State), a 7-foot center, and St. 
Margaret's Damian Raibon (San Francisco), a 6-3 swingman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach's Jeremy Bart, who helped the Oilers win consecutive Southern 
Section championships in boys' volleyball, will sign early with Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Bart, a 6-3 outside hitter, was an All-Sunset League selection last season. He 
was also a first-team All-American selection at the Junior Olympics last 
summer, playing for the Balboa Bay volleyball club. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente's Gabriel Gardner, a 6-9 outside hitter who is also a standout 
water polo goalkeeper, is expected to sign with either UCLA or USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the signing period for women's volleyball doesn't begin until Feb. 8, 
many of the county's top players already have made oral commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's Misty May, The Times Orange County player of the year last 
season, has committed to Long Beach State. May is considered by many to be the 
top recruit in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 May's teammate, Melissa Schutz committed to Colorado. She is one of the 
county's top middle blockers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the county's top players have not made oral commitments, including 
Esperanza's Kristy Kierulff, an outside hitter who also won the State high jump 
championship last season. Orange County High School Commitments

IBM, APPLE AND MOTOROLA UNVEIL STANDARD FOR PCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM and Apple, with an assist from Motorola, set aside their legendary 
differences long enough Monday to formally unveil a new common personal 
computer standard for the PowerPC microprocessor they began developing three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But machines based on the joint specifications and designed to run a variety 
of operating systems won't appear until 1996. In the meantime, computer 
industry watchers say, the IBM-Apple alliance could stumble over technical and 
political hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Many wonder whether the machines will come to market soon enough to make more 
than a dent in the awesome power of industry giants Intel and Microsoft, whose 
chips and operating systems, respectively, appear in 85% of the world's PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another step along the road (IBM and Apple) have been traveling for 
three years," said Richard Shaffer, a principal in the New York consulting firm 
Technologic Partners. Of the prospects for success, he said, "there's still 
considerable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, however, some prominent companies, including Toshiba and Canon, have 
lined up to make the new PC. Canon, for example, funded FirePower Systems, 
based in Menlo Park, Calif., strictly to make PowerPC systems. Software giant 
Novell, the leader in PC networking software, said it will prepare its products 
for the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, developing a compatible design that will allow an array of software 
programs to run seamlessly could prove technically tricky. Moreover, the former 
archrivals can't seem to come to terms on a plan for IBM to license Apple's 
user-friendly operating system, Mac OS, for use on its machines. Analysts view 
such a licensing agreement as pivotal to enlisting software developers to write 
programs for the system. 
</P>
<P>
 A licensing pact, analysts said, would have added heft to the notion of a 
common hardware platform. But at a briefing in New York, executives of IBM, 
Apple and Motorola declined to discuss licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobuo Mii, president of IBM's Power Personal Systems division, inadvertently 
shed some light on the issue, saying IBM would ship a machine with the Mac OS 
in 1996. That would imply that some sort of pact is imminent, but, according to 
industry scuttlebutt, the two companies are quibbling, as usual, over details. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lupatkin, an analyst with Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, noted that 
there is undoubtedly a camp inside IBM that despairs of forcing OS/2, an IBM 
operating system that has proved a costly failure, to take a back seat to Mac 
OS. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, IBM is sending confusing messages by throwing in its lot with 
Apple in an effort to develop a new industry standard while emphasizing that it 
will also continue to make Intel-based machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strategy is schizophrenic," Lupatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can pull off their merged technology, however, the companies could 
conceivably make big gains against Intel and Microsoft -- especially among 
corporate computer buyers who have long shunned Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the degree these companies can indeed deliver one box capable of running 
several operating systems -- the Holy Grail of corporate computer buyers -- 
they'll pick up oodles of market share," Lupatkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as they like the idea, though, corporate buyers seem content to wait and 
see.

CONTINENTAL WILL CLOSE LAX FACILITY BY NEXT WEEK; AIRLINES: THE CARRIER WILL 
ELIMINATE 1,500 JOBS AT ITS MAINTENANCE HANGAR IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE 
EARNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continental Airlines, seeking to shore up weak earnings, said Monday that it 
plans to close its aircraft maintenance base at Los Angeles International 
Airport, eliminating 1,500 jobs by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline also closed a maintenance facility in Denver on Monday, 
eliminating 140 jobs there. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental said it plans to shift the bases' work to outside contractors, 
saving about $30 million a year. Many of those contractors will be located in 
the East, where the airline's routes have increasingly shifted during the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision, while painful because of its impact on our people, is a 
necessary one," George L. Mason, vice president for technical operations, said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The shutdown was not unexpected, because Houston-based Continental had said 
last week that it was considering whether to shift its LAX maintenance 
operations to Eastern locales. The LAX workers, who are not represented by a 
union, earn an average of $31,000 a year, Continental spokesman Ned Walker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Continental mechanic at LAX who asked not to be identified said that 
"everyone (at the base) is furious," because Continental had indicated the work 
might stay within Continental and that the workers might get transfers to 
maintenance bases in Houston or Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "we are all laid off as of Friday," the mechanic said in a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The employees will be paid through Jan. 6 and receive help finding other work 
at Continental or outside the company. Overall, Continental employs 3,300 at 
LAX and 41,800 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The maintenance workers learned of the decision in a memorandum distributed 
early Monday. Continental told them that because of ongoing fare wars in the 
airline industry, "we must continue to reduce costs to the extent that the 
current yields," or average ticket prices, "make us profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the move means layoffs, the memo says, they are necessary if the 
airline is to "focus on what is best for the majority of Continental employees 
and the interests of our shareholders." 
</P>
<P>
 Continental, the nation's fifth-largest airline in terms of passengers flown, 
was based in Los Angeles before moving its headquarters to Houston in 1982. Its 
LAX maintenance work is performed at a 60-acre hangar facility at the west end 
of the airport on property leased from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Airports Department declined to comment on Continental's move, except 
to reiterate remarks made last week by Deputy Executive Director Philip 
Depoian, who said Continental was making a business decision and not reacting 
to any rent dispute with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental, which emerged from its second reorganization under U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court protection in April, 1993, in effect split itself in half last 
year by launching Continental Lite, a low-fare, short-haul service concentrated 
on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new service has yet to break even. And at a time when most airlines 
are reporting their best financial results in years, Continental late last 
month posted only a modest third-quarter profit of $30.6 million on revenue of 
$1.5 billion, including a $23.4-million one-time gain. In the first nine months 
of this year, Continental lost $89.9 million on revenue of $4.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day those results were announced, Robert R. Ferguson III abruptly 
resigned as vice chairman and chief executive, reportedly under pressure 
because of the displeasure of the carrier's board with Continental Lite's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson was succeeded by Gordon Bethune, who said last week that Continental 
Lite would pare its service by at least 20% to help push the operation into the 
black.

 When some people looking to buy a car walk into Tustin Acura, they are 
surprised to encounter Robin M. Saporito, who has been a saleswoman at the 
Orange County dealership for four months. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of them say they didn't know that women sold cars, Saporito said. 
</P>
<P>
 But women are selling a lot of cars these days for a simple reason, according 
to a survey of new car buyers released Monday by J.D. Power & Associates: Women 
are buying more cars -- nearly half of all 1994 models sold in the United 
States -- and they prefer to purchase from other women. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of about 45,000 buyers of 1994 cars found that saleswomen received 
higher overall rankings for customer satisfaction than did their male 
counterparts, said J.D. Power, an Agoura Hills-based marketing information 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Women car buyers say they are more comfortable when negotiating with members 
of their own sex, according to the survey. On the other hand, most male buyers 
surveyed did not express a gender preference, but they gave saleswomen high 
marks in many areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Female salespeople tend to be more caring. . . . They listen more to the 
customer's needs and they show more empathy toward customers," said Dick Hsu, 
general manager at Tustin Acura. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible reason for the higher marks given women in the survey, 
according to authors of the survey, is that saleswomen appear to be adapting 
better to the increased use by automobile dealers of the so-called consultative 
method of sales over the "adversarial method." The consultative method entails 
salespeople cooperating with customers to find a way for them to purchase a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Power estimates that women now make up about 13% of the sales force at 
dealerships across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four percent of dealerships have at least one saleswomen and two-thirds 
have at least one female sales manager, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, men and women who participated in the survey gave women "excellent" 
ratings on "appearance, dress, sincerity and honesty," the survey found. 
However, women received slightly lower marks on "knowledge of models and 
features" and understanding competitors' products. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult for women to overcome customer skepticism about their 
technical knowledge, Saporito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her customers are engineers who know more about cars than she does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men, especially engineers, will start asking questions, hoping to catch me," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Lee, also a Tustin Acura saleswoman, said some customers question her 
expertise, but she said she believes that in most cases, she has been able to 
assure them that she is knowledgeable. Lee said that when she deals with female 
buyers, there is a rapport from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think women appreciate being treated with respect," Saporito said.

MONEY BELT; FOREMAN'S VICTORY IS AN ADVERTISING KNOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was the punch that packed a wallop. 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman's surprising knockout victory Saturday night to regain the 
heavyweight boxing crown appears to have created a new advertising superstar 
out of an aging, rotund athlete, marketing experts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sitting in my office with no less than 150 telephone messages from 
people wanting to make deals with him (Foreman)," said Henry Holmes, a Beverly 
Hills lawyer who has handled celebrity endorsements for the 45-year-old 
Foreman, who took the title from 26-year-old Michael Moorer with a 10th-round 
knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers are offering millions of dollars for Foreman to hawk everything 
from cars to telephone credit cards, Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's even got a German company offering him money to come over for two days 
and do some inspirational speaking to their employees," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Foreman's unlikely win, coupled with his reputation as a 
"clean-cut" family man and ordained minister, are just the ingredients needed 
to make him one of the most successful celebrity product spokesmen -- ranking 
alongside basketball legend Michael Jordan and baseball/football star Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (Foreman) lost in 1991, he still did well (as a celebrity pitchman)," 
said Nova Lanktree, president of Lanktree Sports Celebrity Network, a 
Chicago-based sports marketing consulting firm. "This win just adds to his 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say Foreman, who has already demonstrated an appeal to the huge 
baby boomer generation, is a natural for advertisers looking for an 
inspirational pitchman to sell products to older people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's become an overnight sensation for all the weekend warriors that come 
home sore from playing sports," said Bob Garfield, editor at large for 
Advertising Age magazine. "If (42-year-old tennis star) Jimmy Connors was good 
for Nuprin, George Foreman will be tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
 Although boxing is usually not viewed as a sport that produces superstars with 
the kind of broad appeal of a Jordan or a Jackson, Foreman has been successful 
as a spokesman for products such as Doritos, Thompson Water Sealer and Meineke 
Discount Mufflers. 
</P>
<P>
 "George is warm, he's trustworthy and people like him," said Gene Zhiss, vice 
president of dealer services and communications for Meineke, a muffler repair 
chain that signed up Foreman to a three-year contract as its national 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loves a winner," said Jim Alleborn, vice president of marketing at 
Total Research Corp. "His equity is definitely going to go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, industry insiders say, Foreman's win comes at a time when many 
consumers have lost faith in celebrity endorsers and some sports merchandisers 
are experiencing a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a real crummy year in sports news, what with the fall of a 
hero, athletes beating up other athletes and strikes," Lanktree said. "Then 
along comes this story that is almost a fairy tale." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to celebrity endorsements, analysts say Foreman stands to make a 
lot of money in TV, movie and book deals and possible contracts with companies 
like Sega and Genesis that have marketed successful boxing video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes said Simon & Schuster has tentatively agreed to publish Foreman's 
autobiography early next year. Ads With Punch 
</P>
<P>
 Even before his comeback victory in the ring Saturday, boxer George Foreman 
had amassed an impressive list of commercials since resuming his professional 
career about seven years ago. The list includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kentucky Fried Chicken 
</P>
<P>
 * Oscar Mayer hot dogs 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonald's hamburgers 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike shoes 
</P>
<P>
 * Texaco gasoline 
</P>
<P>
 * Doritos tortilla chips 
</P>
<P>
 According to Henry Holmes, Foreman's Beverly Hills-based attorney, the boxer 
is currently appearing in advertisements for: 
</P>
<P>
 * Meineke mufflers and brakes 
</P>
<P>
 * Thompson's water sealant products 
</P>

DEEP-SIXING CFCS; AS BAN LOOMS, COMPANIES AND CONSUMERS FEEL PINCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As governments around the world intensify their war on chemicals that weaken 
the Earth's vital ozone layer, people like Ron Ford are becoming part of the 
collateral damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford owns an automotive air-conditioning business in Granada Hills that 
depends on Freon, an ozone-eroding gas widely used as a refrigerant. With the 
federal government poised to ban production of Freon next year, the gas's price 
has skyrocketed -- and that is costing Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers can't afford it," he said. "Business is way off. And the average 
customer gets upset at us first, not the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford isn't alone. Around the nation, the drive to flush Freon and other 
chlorofluorocarbons out of American cars, homes and factories is forcing costly 
change on industry and, increasingly, consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 With CFC production tumbling and prices soaring, consumers face higher costs 
to service their cars and home air conditioners. Reports of CFC smuggling have 
surfaced. And industries are converting to a CFC alternative that -- while it 
does no harm to the ozone layer -- is a potent contributor to global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 The objects of all this hubbub were once viewed as among the most useful and 
versatile compounds ever made. CFCs were used in thousands of consumer products 
and industrial processes, from aerosol sprays to sterilizing agents for medical 
instruments. They were best known to consumers as coolants in air conditioners 
and refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists concluded that the chemicals were behind an alarming thinning 
of the stratospheric ozone layer, setting the stage for increases in skin 
cancer and blindness, crop failures and disruptions of the marine food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 130 nations have since signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances 
That Deplete the Ozone Layer, which in 1987 set deadlines for stopping 
production of CFCs and similar chemicals. In the United States, CFC production 
must stop by Dec. 31, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, U.S. industry is retooling on a large scale. And there have been 
striking successes as businesses scramble to rid themselves of CFCs and convert 
to safer substitutes. Makers of fast-food packaging, for example, now use safer 
materials. Electronics firms and other high-tech manufacturers eliminated 
CFC-based solvents. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne, the Canoga Park-based aerospace and defense contractor that 
formerly used CFCs to wash metal parts, now employs a water-vibration technique 
used for years in ultrasonic denture cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, ridding American industry of CFCs remains a monumental task, 
especially in the air-conditioning and refrigeration sectors. CFCs are still 
used in more than 140 million vehicle air conditioners, 160 million home 
refrigerators, 5 million commercial refrigerators and 80,000 air-conditioning 
systems in skyscrapers and other large buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 For owners of that machinery, the impending CFC production ban leaves three 
costly choices: replace the equipment, retrofit it to run on CFC alternatives 
or stick with CFCs and face tightening supplies and rising prices. (Although 
manufacturing CFCs will be outlawed, it will remain legal to use them in air 
conditioners and other products.) 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the cost of cleansing 
the United States of CFCs through 2075 at $45 billion. But that expense will be 
offset many times, the agency said, by the $32 trillion in savings in the form 
of reduced rates of skin cancer, crop damage and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the costs of industrial conversion have been largely absorbed by 
business. But with the federal ban on retail products such as Freon less than 
18 months away, price jumps and the specter of shortages are beginning to hit 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where it's coming down to the pocketbook," said Catherine L. 
Andriadis, a spokeswoman for DuPont Co., one of the world's largest CFC 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Montreal protocol, U.S. production of CFCs has tumbled 62% and Freon 
prices have zoomed -- from less than $1 a pound to $20 or more. And that has 
fostered the reported smuggling of CFCs into the United States from China, 
Russia and other countries.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any direct evidence . . . but our sense is that (smuggled and 
illegally imported CFCs represent) a fairly significant amount that may add up 
to millions or hundreds of thousands of pounds," said James Harris, a spokesman 
for AlliedSignal Inc., another large CFC manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating shortages, many users are stockpiling CFCs. To head off supply 
problems, the Clinton Administration last year persuaded DuPont, which had 
planned to halt production at the end of this year, to keep making CFCs through 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. consumers are most likely to feel rising refrigerant prices when they get 
their car or home air conditioners serviced. While most new cars use a CFC 
substitute, 90 million autos with CFC-filled air conditioners will remain on 
American roads after the production ban takes effect, according to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, who owns Acme Auto Air Conditioning of the West Inc., said that with 
recent Freon price increases, he is charging more than $100 to refill older 
air-conditioning units -- a service that not long ago cost $40. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation may be even more unsettled among owners of high-rises and other 
big buildings with air-conditioning systems that often require several thousand 
pounds of CFCs. So far, owners of only about 25% of the country's 80,000 large 
air conditioners have converted or replaced them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, environmentalists such as the activist group Greenpeace complain 
that U.S. industry, by switching so quickly to a leading CFC substitute known 
as HFC-134a, is trading one serious environmental problem for another. 
</P>
<P>
 HFC-134a does not erode the ozone layer, and manufacturers of autos and air 
conditioners have rushed to redesign their systems to accept it. As of the 1994 
model year, most new cars use HFC-134a. 
</P>
<P>
 But environmentalists say HFC-134a is a potent contributor to the "greenhouse 
effect," a gradual increase in Earth's temperature caused when solar heat is 
trapped by atmospheric gases. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a debate that will only intensify as the economic disruptions caused by 
the CFC phaseout spread. Said F. Sherwood Rowland, a UC Irvine chemistry 
professor who pioneered in CFC research: "People are really in the process of 
conversion, and conversion is going to cost a lot of money."

 Rockwell Says Offer for Reliance Has Cleared Hurdles: The Seal Beach-based 
aerospace company said it has obtained all the regulatory approvals for its 
$30-a-share tender offer for all outstanding stock of Reliance Electric Co. 
Rockwell International Corp. announced the offer last month as it moved to buy 
Cleveland-based Reliance for $1.5 billion in cash. That beats a $1.4-billion 
stock swap offer that General Signal Corp. made for Reliance on Aug. 30.

 Magma Power Gets Inquiries: After rejecting a revised bid by California Energy 
Co., San Diego-based Magma Power Co. has gotten a "substantial number of 
inquiries" since announcing it would meet with interested parties to discuss 
possible business combinations, its chief executive said. In rejecting 
Omaha-based California Energy's offer for a 51% stake in the company and a 
revised bid of $38.50 per share in cash and stock, Magma said it wanted to 
study alternatives benefiting shareholder value, including joint ventures, a 
merger or some other combination. Chief Executive Ralph Boeker declined to 
identify the interested parties.

 TMI Keeps Control of Winery: Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco F. 
Firmat has denied a request by investors that the manager appointed to oversee 
most of the real estate assets of Teachers Management & Investment Corp. also 
take over Parducci Winery Ltd., which is still under the control of the 
$1-billion Newport Beach investment fund. In October, Firmat appointed Dennis 
B. Schmucker to manage more than three-fourths of the partnerships of TMI after 
investors filed a lawsuit alleging that TMI fraudulently lost $100 million, 
most of it money invested by teachers for their retirement.Parducci is one of 
three partnerships the judge allowed to remain under TMI's control. Plaintiffs 
in the lawsuit had complained to the court that winery investors' money was 
going to be used to pay legal fees for TMI's owners.

 Financial markets showed little movement Monday awaiting today's general 
elections and a heavy calendar of new bond issuance. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks closed mixed, with the Dow industrial average inching up 1.35 points to 
3,808.87 after last week's 123-point decline. But the broad market was 
decidedly negative: Losers beat winners by 14 to 8 on the New York Stock 
Exchange in slow trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, yields rose slightly on long-term issues. The 30-year 
Treasury bond yield hit a new 3-year high of 8.16%, up from 8.15% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields had jumped Friday after the government issued a strong October 
employment report, signaling that the economy remains robust despite five 
interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Board this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the employment report virtually assures another rate increase 
when the Fed meets next Tuesday. The only debate is whether the central bank 
will boost rates by half a point, or opt for a bigger increase to try and rein 
in the economy and inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, with no apparent end in sight to the Fed's credit-tightening 
moves, analysts say bond traders have no reason to believe that bond yields are 
ready to stabilize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a bear market, and there's just no question that yields are going to 
keep grinding and grinding and grinding upwards," said Fabio Savoldelli, who 
oversees $1.4 billion in bonds at SBC Portfolio Management International. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, bond traders face a glut of new supply this week. Today, the Treasury 
will sell $17 billion in new three-year notes. On Wednesday it will sell $12 
billion in new 10-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the municipal bond market in particular has been suffering a 
backlash of selling in the wake of rising market yields. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on municipal bonds rose for a sixth day as fund managers found it 
difficult to find buyers. Traders said many muni bond mutual funds appear to be 
experiencing redemptions by investors, forcing fund managers to dump bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Liquidity is the main concern of the market," said Joseph Piraro, who manages 
about $2 billion in tax-exempt bonds for Van Kampen Merritt Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stock investors took to the sidelines despite widespread 
expectations that Republican candidates will sweep today's elections. Many 
analysts have argued in recent weeks that a Republican victory would be bullish 
for the market by promising lower taxes and smaller government. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities, said many 
investors want to wait to see how significant a rate increase the Fed delivers 
next week, rather than speculate on a big Republican victory and what that may 
or may not mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is why not wait it out," Chalasani said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, while corporate earnings growth has been stellar this year, 
"There's some thinking that we may be peaking here soon" if higher interest 
rates begin to clip economic growth, said John Church, chief investment officer 
at Glenmede Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology issues showed some strength. IBM, Apple Computer and 
Motorola said they agreed on a new hardware platform design for computers based 
on the PowerPC chip. IBM rose 3/4 to 71 7/8 and Apple added 3/8 to 40 3/4, but 
Motorola lost 2 to 56 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Dell Computer jumped 2 1/8 to 43 7/8 after it introduced its first 
multiprocessor network servers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler lost 7/8 to 46 1/2 after trading as low as 45 1/2, on speculation 
that investor Kirk Kerkorian will begin selling off his 9.2% stake in the No. 3 
auto maker.

 Treasury Bill Rates Rise to Three-Year Highs: The Treasury Department sold 
$13.7 billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.25%, up 
from 5.07% last week.Another $13.6 billion of new six-month bills were sold at 
an average discount rate of 5.68%, up from 5.51%. The three-month bill rate was 
the highest since they sold for 5.29% on Sept. 9, 1991. The six-month bill rate 
was the highest since they averaged 5.69% on July 29, 1991. The new discount 
rates understate the actual return to investors: 5.39% for three-month bills, 
with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,867.30, and 5.93% for a six-month bill 
selling for $9,712.80.

PEOPLE: DISNEY STORES' CHIEF IS GOING TO DISNEYLAND 
</P>

 Ushering in a new generation of leadership, Walt Disney Co. announced Monday 
that the head of its Disney Stores division has been appointed president of 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pressler, 38, who joined Disney in 1987, will also be in charge of the 
Disneyland Hotel and other resort venues in Anaheim, including the planned 
$3-billion Disneyland Resort. His promotion marks the first time since 
Disneyland opened in 1955 that park operations will be commanded by someone 
other than a protege of founder Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul is a talented, creative business executive," Disney Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner said in a statement. "He is fiscally sophisticated, he nurtures great 
ideas, and he knows how to see them through. I know that Disneyland will thrive 
under his leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler is known for his aggressive expansion of the Disney Stores empire 
from 160 stores to 335 in eight countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm terribly excited," said Pressler, whose official title will be president 
of Disneyland Resort. "I think it's going to be a tremendous decade for 
Disneyland. In a lot of ways I'm in awe because I'll be in the house that Walt 
built." 
</P>
<P>
 James C. Goss, who follows Disney for the brokerage Duff & Phelps in Chicago, 
said the selection of Pressler shows that the company is putting Disneyland's 
future growth in the hands of someone who has engineered vigorous growth in 
another part of the Disney kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler takes over at a time when many Orange County political and business 
leaders are concerned about the direction of the aging theme park and Disney's 
commitment to its much-delayed expansion, which would include 1,800 new hotel 
rooms, a shopping district and a second theme park called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler, who fills the vacancy left last year by the retirement of Jack L. 
Lindquist, was promoted over other high-level park executives including Norm 
Doerges, executive vice president of park operations.

PANEL SAYS JAPAN URGENTLY NEEDS TO OPEN ITS MARKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan needs to urgently open up its markets through sweeping deregulation of 
the economy, an advisory council to Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trade Conference also called on industry to end anti-competitive practices 
to help shrink the nation's huge trade surplus and benefit Japanese consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "To achieve a meaningful reduction in the surplus and make consumers feel they 
are well off by lessening the gap between domestic and overseas prices, it is 
our urgent duty to open our markets further," the council said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to fulfilling diverse import expansion policies, it is vital to 
promote deregulation in order to strengthen the market function of Japan's 
economy," it added. 
</P>
<P>
 The call renewed a plea made a year ago to then-Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, who made deregulation a key slogan when he ended nearly four decades 
of conservative Liberal Democratic Party rule in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the LDP back in power as the main support for Socialist chief 
Murayama's coalition government, proponents of cutting red tape fear the 
momentum for change is slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Murayama told the panel, made up of Cabinet ministers, chief executives of 
Japanese companies and the heads of business lobby groups, that reform and 
deregulation are vital to satisfy consumers and ensure Japan's economy is in 
harmony with the rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "To expand consumers' choice and give them a sense of abundance, it is 
imperative to strengthen the market function in Japan and carry out a sweeping 
reform of regulations and private-sector practices which act as barriers to 
expanding imports," Murayama said in a prepared statement.

WORLD OIL OUTPUT SOARS IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World oil production surged by more than a million barrels a day in October 
from September levels, and the upward climb is expected to continue through 
1995, the West's oil industry watchdog said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Production is growing faster than expected because of enhanced recovery 
methods and other new technology that enables producers to maximize output, and 
it more than offsets higher demand forecasts, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1995, oil production in non-OPEC countries alone is expected to rise by at 
least 500,000 barrels a day to 41.6 million, the Paris-based International 
Energy Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though oil demand continues to grow at a blistering pace -- a 1.5% 
increase, or 1 million barrels a day in 1994 alone, according to the IEA -- the 
world's thirst for oil is being quenched by higher-than-expected exports from 
the former Soviet Union, the North Sea and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Non-OPEC production is constantly going up, and we think forecasts are 
actually underestimating it even now. If the winter is very mild, we're at risk 
of falling prices," said oil analyst Mike Barry of Energy Market Consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest monthly IEA report, most of the October gains were 
posted in nations that are not members of the Organization of Petroleum 
Exporting Countries, especially North Sea producers Norway and Britain.

 AT&T Settles Suit by Bell Atlantic and Nynex: AT&T Corp. has settled an 
antitrust lawsuit with Bell Atlantic Corp. and Nynex Corp. over the telephone 
giant's takeover of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the companies 
said.AT&T, which was already the nation's largest supplier of wireless 
equipment, acquired McCaw for $11.5 billion in September, making it the 
nation's biggest provider of wireless services as well. Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
complained that AT&T was both the sole supplier of wireless equipment to them 
and a mighty competitor in providing mobile-calling services. The three agreed 
on a cost-sharing formula to ensure that AT&T wireless network equipment will 
be compatible with other manufacturers' equipment -- a concept known as "open 
interface."

 Sears Gives Up Ownership of Sears Tower: Sears, Roebuck & Co. said it will 
sell its Sears Tower in Chicago, the world's tallest building, in a 
restructuring of the building's financing. The agreement to transfer ownership 
to a pension fund partnership managed by Boston-based Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch 
will reduce Sears' debt by $850 million, Sears said. Chicago-based Sears will 
record a $195-million gain, after taxes, in the fourth quarter as a result of 
the transaction.

 Fox TV Plans Late-Night Daily Newscast: Fox Television, which has had 
on-again, off-again plans for several years to launch a national news program, 
now says it will develop a late-night daily news program for debut later this 
season.The new program would appear at 11 p.m. on Fox's eight owned TV 
stations, including KTTV-TV (Channel 11) in Los Angeles. The decision 
represents a shift in strategy for Fox, which has spent most of its efforts on 
developing a news magazine program. A spokesman for Fox TV said research has 
indicated that the public's appetite for news magazine shows has waned.

WELLS FARGO EXEC TO RUN NEW B OF A NON-BANK UNIT; FINANCE: STRATEGY SHIFT IS 
AIMED AT RE-ENERGIZING THE FIRM'S INVESTMENT BUSINESS AS THE PUBLIC BECOMES 
MORE SOPHISTICATED.

 In a major strategy shift, BankAmerica Corp. said Monday that it will place 
its mutual fund, investment management and retail brokerage units under one 
umbrella, and it named an outsider to head the new group. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA's move, which comes five months after two of its money market mutual 
funds suffered large derivative-securities-related losses, is aimed at 
re-energizing the investment business and bringing new investment products and 
services to customers through its far-flung branch system. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite BofA's size, it has lagged many of its bank competitors in developing 
mutual funds and other non-bank, higher-risk/higher-return investment options 
for an increasingly sophisticated public. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA chose Alexander Anderson, who had been executive vice president of rival 
Wells Fargo & Co.'s investment management group, to head the new "investment 
management services group." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 45, will oversee BA Investment Services, the firm's brokerage 
subsidiary that sells investment products in 1,500 branches in seven Western 
states; the bank's $30-billion investment management and research unit, and the 
$10-billion Pacific Horizon Funds, BofA's 16 proprietary mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Those operations, and the new umbrella unit Anderson will run, are based in 
Los Angeles, though BofA's headquarters are in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had been at Wells for the past eight years, where he directed the 
bank's personal trust business, private banking, institutional investment 
management and proprietary mutual funds, the Overland and Stagecoach funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Anderson said BofA's extensive branch network and corporate 
banking presence in the West offers "huge potential" for development and 
marketing of in-house investment products. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has the "full commitment" of BofA CEO Richard Rosenberg to expand 
the bank's presence in the investment arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say that until now, Rosenberg had been lukewarm to the idea of 
making BofA a strong player in mutual funds and other non-bank investment 
products, and to the use of BA Investment Services as a distribution system for 
BofA's own products. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest on the part of senior management wasn't" there, said Geoff 
Bobroff, a mutual fund industry consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA's mutual fund assets total $10 billion, with much of that in money market 
funds. Wells Fargo's fund assets, while about equal to BofA's, are spread 
across more than two dozen funds, including a variety of stock and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wells has been innovative in developing new funds," Bobroff said, though he 
said many of those funds are still young and untested. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA's investment business, much of which came to the bank in its 1991 merger 
with Security Pacific Corp., has suffered from a number of management changes 
over the past year, and it endured a black eye in the spring when the bank paid 
$68 million to make up for derivative-securities losses in two of its money 
funds. It was one of many fund sponsors forced to cover derivative losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he feared that he was taking the job at what may be a peak for the 
investment industry -- as stock and bond markets suffer from rising interest 
rates -- Anderson said he considers the current environment just a "cyclical 
slump" in a long-term trend of rising public demand for more sophisticated 
investments.

COMPANY TOWN; BRITISH VISITORS PICK HOLLYWOOD'S BRAIN; FILM: DESPITE A FLOOD OF 
LOCATION WORK, U.K. INDUSTRY IS SHRINKING. GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO TURN THINGS 
AROUND.

 In the country where Shakespeare flourishes, movies don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an overwhelming number of Oscar nominations last year for such 
critical successes as "In the Name of the Father" and "The Remains of the Day," 
and a current flood of big-budget period films set in the United Kingdom, the 
British film industry is flagging at best. 
</P>
<P>
 As indigenous investment in its movies continues to decline, British film is 
shrinking in the shadow of Hollywood productions that are luring away its 
actors, directors and production crews and eating up the lion's share of its 
growing theatrical market. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new effort by the British government to hunt down the Grail of a 
profitable film business, several members of Parliament paid a quiet visit to 
Los Angeles last month to pick Hollywood's brain. 
</P>
<P>
 During the visit, which sharply contrasted with Prince Charles' recent 
whirlwind tour of Los Angeles, the group held a tightly scheduled week of 
private meetings with many of the industry's most influential players -- 
including director Steven Spielberg, International Creative Management Chairman 
Jeff Berg, MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman, Motion Picture Assn. of America 
President Jack Valenti and digital wizard George Lucas in San Rafael. The 
agenda: to learn about everything from movie financing to production and 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group was meeting people in the industry and trying to find the best way 
to revive the U.K. both as a producing country and a country of locations and 
facilities," said Peter Rawley, head of the international department at ICM and 
a chief organizer of the visit, which was timed to coincide with the two-month 
UK/LA festival of British Arts that ends next Monday. Michael Fabricant, one of 
the seven visiting members of the British National Heritage Select Committee, 
whose other tasks include steering the future of the British Broadcasting 
Corp., said he considered the trip a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very, very good and worthwhile visit," he said. "It gave us a huge 
insight into the working of cinema in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group will formally present its findings to the British government early 
next year. Ironically, the trip comes as Britain is enjoying a boom in location 
work with the filming of such big-budget movies as the independent production 
"Judge Dredd," starring Sylvester Stallone; TriStar Pictures' "Mary Reilly," 
co-starring Julia Roberts and John Malkovich, and Columbia Pictures' "First 
Knight," starring Sean Connery. 
</P>
<P>
 Those films will help boost the total investment in British movies to a 
projected $656 million in 1994, more than an 80% increase over 1993, according 
to the London-based British Film Institute. But observers say the figure is 
merely a temporary surge due to current interest in period films. 
</P>
<P>
 Another drag on the industry is the fact that most of the financing for 
British films comes from U.S. or other foreign investors, which means the 
British economy sees very little return. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, U.S. or other non-British financing was either "significantly" or 
entirely behind 37 of the year's 69 British films, representing 82% of the 
year's $361.5 million in film production, according to figures from the British 
Film Institute to be released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 One such film was last summer's blockbuster "Four Weddings and a Funeral," 
which PolyGram says took in $225 million in international box office revenue. 
The film, hailed as a big British success, was actually financed by the German 
unit of Dutch-owned media giant PolyGram, so a significant percentage of the 
revenue went to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the problem is that people in the U.K. have never really taken the 
film industry too seriously," Fabricant said. "I think a major part of our task 
is to create a financial environment wherein the financial industry in England 
realizes that filmmaking isn't just glamour, it can be made into a major export 
earner." 
</P>
<P>
 Such skepticism in the London financial market has meant that film success has 
been sporadic. The occasional box office hit hasn't led to further investment, 
causing critics to scoff at the idea that an "industry" even exists in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Spielberg said to us, you've got all this talent. . . . You'd have a 
marvelous industry if you had an industry," Fabricant said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim, Fabricant said, is to "get away from the idea of producing a series 
of one-offs. We have to produce a portfolio of films just like a stockbroker 
produces a portfolio of shares." 
</P>
<P>
 The building of a healthy indigenous industry is at least a few years off. But 
the parliamentary committee's fact-finding trip has spurred some hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect to see some positive action by the (British) government within 
the next two years," said ICM's Rawley. "I think the visit shows a willingness 
by the government to look at the problem seriously."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SINATRA DUETS: CAPITOL RECORDS' LOVE OF 
THEM IS LOVELIER THE 2ND TIME AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a year when Capitol Records scored with Blind Melon and the comeback album 
by Duran Duran,its biggest success still belonged to a 78-year-old crooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Sinatra Duets," which had "The Chairman" trading lyrics with vocalists 
as far afield as Barbra Streisand and Bono, shipped 5 million copies worldwide 
and revived Sinatra's dormant recording career. It also helped launch the 
tribute genre as an industry unto itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Capitol hopes to hit pay dirt again with "Frank Sinatra Duets II," which 
comes out next week and pairs Sinatra with such diverse performers as Chrissie 
Hynde, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Jimmy Buffet, Neil Diamond and even Frank 
Sinatra Jr., who joins his father on "My Kind of Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Koppelman, chairman of EMI Records Group North America, Capitol's 
parent, says the Sinatra duets have become a franchise. The original "Duets" 
sold heavily to people 25 and older, who are not usually big album buyers. The 
follow-up is being launched with a CBS Thanksgiving special featuring old and 
new footage of Sinatra singing with others. And Capitol has already recorded at 
least one song that could show up on a "Duets III." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's clear to us is that people in general, meaning everyone that likes 
music, really enjoys hearing great singers sing with Frank Sinatra, who is 
certainly the best of the best," Koppelman said. "Plus it clearly has a 
built-in audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra's success aside, some industry executives still view tribute albums as 
novelties just one step removed from true oddities like the famous kazoo 
version of "Louie, Louie." Overall, tribute releases have met with more failure 
than success. And some critics contend that Capitol over-shipped the first 
"Frank Sinatra Duets" to create the appearance of bigger sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But many record companies remain enamored of the genre, in which major stars 
often salute their influences. The most successful recent compilation is Giant 
Records' "Common Thread: Songs of the Eagles," featuring country stars singing 
Eagles classics. The record sold more than 2.4 million copies domestically and 
helped encourage the group's reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring also includes tributes to the Carpenters, Black Sabbath and 
Kiss, as well as "Sweet Relief," a fund-raising album for singer Victoria 
Williams; "You Got Lucky," which salutes Tom Petty; "No Prima Donna: The Songs 
of Van Morrison"; "All Men Are Brothers -- A Tribute to Curtis Mayfield," and 
"Beat the Retreat -- Songs by Richard Thompson." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA may be the tribute champ when it comes to volume. It released "Elton John 
Duets" and "Rhythm Country & Blues," which paired major country stars with 
their rhythm-and-blues counterparts. Its latest efforts are "George Jones: The 
Bradley Barn Sessions" and "Skynyrd Frynds." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Music Entertainment Group Chairman Al Teller says tribute albums have 
always been around but have recently gotten a boost from CD technology, which 
has led record companies to repackage and salute the works of established 
performers. Teller calls the genre "event records." He says they generally 
succeed if they're conceived and executed properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like anything in our business, you have to pick your spot very carefully," he 
said. "The concept has to make sense and the execution has to be of the top 
magnitude. You can't fake one of these. You also count on a lot of good press 
and word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 MCA is looking at other possible salutes, but Teller says there are no firm 
plans as of now. Meanwhile, Capitol/EMI has high expectations for its Sinatra 
sequel. The singing legend recorded his vocals in one session at Capitol's 
Hollywood studio about nine months ago. Like the time before, his duet partners 
added their vocals to the existing tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Koppelman says "Duets II" could outperform the first, due to the high 
recognition factor. The smorgasbord of singers joining him also includes Linda 
Ronstadt, Lena Horne, Patti LaBelle, Lorrie Morgan, Willie Nelson, John Secada 
and international stars Luis Miguel and Antonio Carlos Jobim. 
</P>
<P>
 Koppelman says he got most of the people on his wish list. Two holdouts were 
Madonna, who was busy recording her own album, and Luciano Pavarotti, who 
recorded "My Way" too late to make the "Duets II" deadline. Koppelman says it 
will show up on a later album. 
</P>
<P>
 Like MCA, Capitol has no other major duet projects planned. But Koppelman says 
it's easy to explain their appeal. "People love duets," he said. "It's easier 
for people to listen to two singers for 3 1/2 minutes than one."

PROPERTY VALUES: A WEEKLY COLUMN BY RON GALPERIN: FINDING THE FUNDS TO FIX 
QUAKE DAMAGE; RECOVERY: THERE ARE A RANGE OF LOAN OPTIONS TO CONSIDER, 
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS CAUGHT IN AN EQUITY BIND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For many homeowners who suffered damage from the January earthquake, money 
from federal and state governments and from insurance companies isn't enough to 
rebuild -- especially for owners who have a bigger mortgage obligation than 
their home is worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public funding is just not enough for many homeowners and their problems 
haven't been addressed," charged Toby Lieberman, project manager at Kosmont & 
Associates Inc., a real estate consulting company in Sherman Oaks. Many 
homeowners want to get a loan to do the needed repair work, she said, "but how 
do you get anyone to help you out when your mortgage is higher than what your 
property is worth?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are options out there, however: 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Los Angeles administers six earthquake emergency loan programs. 
These programs are available as a last resort when funds available through 
other federal or state agencies, and from private insurance, are insufficient 
to repair all of a property's earthquake damage. There's a Single-Family Home 
Program that will provide loans of up to $50,000. Deferred payment loans are 
available to lower-income families, and in some cases the principal amount is 
lent with no interest; in other cases the interest rate runs as high as 7%, 
depending on borrower income. Another loan program for condominium owners makes 
available up to $35,000 at no interest, with the principal to be repaid over 30 
years. Information about these loans is available by calling the Los Angeles 
Housing Department at (800) 994-4444. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Community Development Commission of Los Angeles County also has 
emergency repair grants of up to $4,000 available and low-interest loans with 
no monthly payments. These loans of up to $30,000 are due and payable only when 
homeowners sell or transfer their homes There are many income and use 
restrictions, but some funds are available to families earning as much as 
$58,200. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat for Humanity has raised $2 million for repairing damaged homes and 
building new ones in the San Fernando Valley, reported Nanci Mavar, earthquake 
recovery program manager for the nonprofit organization's local offices in 
North Hollywood. Families earning up to the high-$20,000 range can apply for 
loans and grants to buy building materials. Homeowners then contribute their 
own "sweat equity" to help in rebuilding -- along with the help of volunteers. 
Elderly and handicapped residents who may not be able to get out and hammer 
nails can contribute sweat equity by helping out Habitat in its office or even 
baking cookies and cooking spaghetti for the volunteers. No-interest loans of 
up to 20 years are available through Habitat for chimney demolition, roof 
repair and replacement, new windows, walls, etc. One resident in Northridge 
recently got a $1,700 redwood fence built by Habitat volunteers. The homeowner 
will pay $25 a month until the debt is satisfied. More information is available 
by calling Habitat at (800) 266-7047. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Southern California Gas Co. is making available about $5 million to 
Southland residents who suffered earthquake damage and need to make minor home 
repairs. The money is offered through the gas company in conjunction with 
several public agencies, including the California Department of Economic 
Opportunities and the California Conservation Corps. More information about the 
program is available by calling (800) 427-2200. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Calabasas is making available up to $35,000 per household for 
earthquake repair grants. The money comes from U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development community development block grants. These funds are 
eventually funneled to Calabasas. To qualify for grants, homeowners must have 
already filed claims with any insurance carrier they may have, the SBA for 
disaster loans and the state's Individual and Family Grant Program. If these 
various money sources fail to cover all the damage, a homeowner can apply to 
the city of Calabasas for a grant. Many other cities also have loan and grant 
programs. Culver City, for example has grants of up to $2,000 available for 
owners of homes damaged by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * Various religious organizations are offering help to earthquake victims. 
This includes the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles as well as Catholic, 
Mennonite and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many contractors are willing to finance the work they are doing over time, 
said Lynette Findlay, president of Aberdeen Management Co. Inc. in Burbank and 
Santa Clarita. She advised home and condo owners to try to find a local vendor 
who will agree to stretch out payment for construction and repair work over a 
period of a year or more. "A contractor couldn't ask for better PR." 
</P>
<P>
 * FHA Title 1 home-improvement loans are a good option for many borrowers who 
are short on equity. These government-backed loans are made through a select 
group of Federal Housing Administration-approved lenders. With these loans, a 
borrower can get up to $25,000 for acceptable home improvements, and borrowers 
who want less than $15,000 can get it without even getting their property 
appraised. 
</P>
<P>
 Title 1 lenders are generally in second position -- that is, behind a superior 
first lender. Borrowers can use a Title 1 loan to mortgage their house up to 
100%. With several points up front as a fee to the lender and interest rates of 
up to 14%, these are not cheap loans, however. It's not as good as a 
conventional second mortgage, but it's generally better than a credit card. 
Another limitation to keep in mind is that these FHA loans can't be used on 
luxuries such as a pool or spa. More information about Title 1 loans is 
available by calling the FHA toll-free at (800) 733-4663.

TECHNOLOGY BEHIND OUR ANGST, FUTURIST SAYS; COMMUNICATIONS: AMERICAN SOCIETY IS 
UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE CHANGING FROM AN INDUSTRIAL TO AN INFORMATIONAL SOCIETY, 
TOFFLER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The paradox of the 1994 election -- that voters are grumpy and pessimistic 
despite the nation's strong and growing economy -- comes from the uncertainty 
people feel about the change to an information-driven society, futurist Alvin 
Toffler said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That uncertainty is not likely to end soon because few of the nation's leaders 
understand what is happening, Toffler said at a conference of technology and 
media industry executives. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted the simultaneous troubles the United States and other industrial 
nations are having in their justice, health, education, urban and family 
systems, all of which were adapted more than a century ago for the era of mass 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 None are ready for the change away from mass production and distribution of 
goods, services and information, Toffler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most politicians rail against this or that crisis without understanding the 
larger crisis that these are all parts of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toffler's books call the move to the information age the "third wave" in 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we so worried? The reason is the old industrial-style systems are 
crashing and the new third-wave social and political structures are not yet in 
place," Toffler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on communications, Toffler noted that the systems used in agrarian 
society, the "first wave" in his model, were inadequate for the industrial age, 
or "second wave." Now second-wave systems are trying to adapt for the third 
wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the weaknesses companies are trying to fix in communications: inadequate 
interactivity, inadequate mobility, inability to simply convert information 
between text and speech, and poor access around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 But as that transition happens and gets a lot of attention, Toffler said, 
politics is being quietly divided between people committed to second-wave 
civilization and others ready to move to the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "One is tenaciously dedicated to preserving the core institutions of 
industrial mass society, including the nuclear family, mass education system, 
giant corporations, mass trade unions, centralized nation-state and politics of 
pseudo-representation," Toffler said. "The other recognizes that most of 
today's urgent problems -- energy, poverty, ecological degradation and 
breakdown of familial relationships -- can no longer be stopped within the 
framework of industrial civilization."

SEARS MAKES A TOWERING DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's tallest building is getting a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, Roebuck & Co. said Monday it will transfer ownership of the 110-story 
Sears Tower through a trust to a pension fund partnership managed by 
Boston-based Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch, which currently holds a mortgage on the 
landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will reduce Sears' debt by $850 million and resolve a financial 
dilemma caused by a drop in commercial property values since Sears remortgaged 
the tower nearly five years ago. Chicago-based Sears will record an after-tax 
gain of $195 million, or 50 cents per share, in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The black steel-and-glass monolith was designed by American architect Fazlur 
Khan and completed in 1973. It is 1,454 feet tall, topping the World Trade 
Center in New York by 86 feet. Sears said the building will continue to be 
named Sears Tower, and its corporate headquarters will remain there, in leased 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is worth about $400 million based on current and expected office 
lease rates in Chicago, according to Jim Dorsey, Midwest regional president of 
Koll Inc., a commercial real-estate company based in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears will transfer ownership of the tower and its related mortgages to a 
trust, under which the pension fund partnership AEW Partners will become the 
building's owner in 2003. The trust will repay Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 
which holds $600 million of the $850-million mortgage under a deal struck in

<P>
 The printer and software, which will sell for less than $500, are aimed at 
both business and personal users, said Peter Bergman, Canon's vice president of 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the programs will allow users to choose colors for invitations based on 
the type of occasion, such as Thanksgiving or New Year's, and the setting of

WINERY LEFT UNDER INVESTMENT FUND'S CONTROL; LITIGATION: PLAINTIFFS HAD ASKED 
THAT FIRM'S AFFAIRS BE PUT IN HANDS OF COURT-APPOINTED MANAGER OVERSEEING TMI, 
WHICH THEY ACCUSE OF FRAUDULENTLY LOSING $100 MILLION.

 A judge on Monday denied a request that the manager appointed to oversee most 
of the real estate assets of Teachers Management & Investment Corp. also take 
over a winery still under control of the Newport Beach investment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco F. Firmat appointed 
Dennis B. Schmucker, a veteran Southern California real estate trouble-shooter, 
to manage more than three-fourths of the partnerships of TMI, a $1-billion 
Newport Beach investment fund.That action came after investors filed a lawsuit 
alleging that TMI fraudulently lost $100 million, most of it money invested by 
teachers for their retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Parducci Winery Ltd., which owns and operates a winery in Mendocino County, is 
one of three partnerships the judge allowed to remain under TMI's control. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's ruling, Firmat denied a request by investors that Schmucker also 
take over management of Parducci, which is one of more than 40 TMI 
partnerships. Plaintiffs in the lawsuit had complained to the court that winery 
investors' money was going to be used to pay legal fees for TMI's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI lawyers said in court Monday that the company does plan to use some winery 
partnership profit to reimburse a general fund for payments to lawyers and a 
public relations executive, but they maintained that such a use of funds would 
not be improper. 
</P>
<P>
 Firmat ordered company officials to bring in a witness by Friday who would be 
able to disclose details of the company's reimbursement plan. He also ordered 
Schmucker to present his findings and recommendations on the other real estate 
partnerships to the court at a hearing scheduled for Nov. 16.

ROCKWELL SAYS WAY IS CLEAR FOR RELIANCE MERGER; ACQUISITION: DEFENSE GIANT HAS 
BID $1.5 BILLION FOR THE INDUSTRIAL AUTOMATION COMPANY, WHICH HAD ACCEPTED A 
LOWER COMPETING OFFER. 
</P>

<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. said Monday that there are no longer any 
antitrust questions about its proposed buyout of Reliance Electric Co. and 
pushed the company to sign a merger agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance, which has already agreed to a deal with General Signal Corp., issued 
a statement saying it is studying Rockwell's higher offer but has concerns 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 General Signal is offering about $26 worth of its own stock for each Reliance 
share, a bid valued at about $1.4 billion. Rockwell is offering $30 a share in 
cash, or $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are totally committed to acquiring Reliance. We hope you will cooperate 
with us promptly," Donald R. Beall, Rockwell's chairman and chief executive 
officer, wrote in a letter to top Reliance officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell wants to build its presence in the industrial automation business 
with the Reliance acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell said there are no longer U.S. antitrust regulatory approvals needed 
for its proposed deal to go through. The Justice Department has not made a 
second request for information under the Hart-Scott Rodino Act, which Rockwell 
says lifts any uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell said Cleveland-based Reliance should redeem its "poison pill" hostile 
takeover defense and pay General Signal the $50-million fee for calling off 
their merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the day, Reliance's president and chief executive officer said the 
company will complete its review of the Rockwell merger offer soon. But John C. 
Morley said in a statement that an initial review found that "the draft merger 
agreement contains many uncertainties regarding Rockwell's obligation to close 
the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 He said "these uncertainties do not justify the risk" of talking with 
Rockwell, a dialogue that could lead to an end to Reliance's deal with General 
Signal and the $50-million termination fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell wants to acquire Reliance to help build up its electronics and 
industrial-equipment business. It says it would merge Reliance Electric with 
its Allen-Bradley division, a move that analysts say would position Rockwell to 
make smarter industrial automation products. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of Allen-Bradley and Reliance has powerful strategic 
significance in creating an organization that will compete effectively with 
formidable European and Japanese competitors in addressing the global 
automation markets," Beall said in his letter to Reliance officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Reliance Electric's stock 
rose 75 cents to close at $30.75. General Signal closed at $35.63, up 63 cents, 
while Rockwell ended the day at $35.38, down 25 cents.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: GENISCO TECHNOLOGY TO SELL UNPROFITABLE ELECTRONICS 
DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Genisco Technology Corp. said Monday it will sell its electronic products 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Anaheim maker of computer workstation products would not 
identify the potential buyer or disclose the terms of the sale, except to say 
that it will result in a $520,000 charge against Genisco's earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's electronics division, which produces filters for electronic 
equipment, lost $312,816 on revenue of $1.82 million for the first nine months 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unrelated to the sale of the electronics division, the company said it has 
undertaken several moves aimed at keeping the company's listing on the American 
Stock Exchange. Company shareholders have approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock 
split, which will push the current stock price to about $1 a share. Genisco 
said it also has plans to sell $5.5 million of debt and 8 million preferred 
shares to an investor group. 
</P>
<P>
 Genisco does not currently meet American Stock Exchange capital guidelines for 
continued listing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's market trading, Genisco's stock closed at 9 cents a share, 
unchanged.

BRIEFCASE: TRAVEL AND TOURISM; NEW MAGAZINE FROM SAN FRANCISCO DETAILS THE 
ATTRACTIONS OF VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A San Francisco firm has started publishing a travel magazine that could find 
a ready readership in Orange County's large Vietnamese community. It's called 
Destination: Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The glossy, 48-page premiere issue has typical travel magazine features: 
colorful photos, shopping tips, lists of restaurants and sights. Atypical is 
that it describes a place that until recently had been closed to Americans for 
more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The first issue includes a story about the former North Vietnam capital of 
Hanoi, as well as articles on less-publicized spots such as the scenery of 
Halong Bay. About four hours by car from Hanoi, the bay was the site for 
filming much of the 1992 movie "Indochine," starring Catherine Deneuve. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to readers, publishers Lisa Spivey and Albert Wen say their idea 
came from the realization that little travel information exists about Vietnam. 
Their office, they wrote, has received many requests for such information since 
a U.S. embargo against Vietnam was lifted earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Their company, Global Directions Inc., serves as the U.S. bureau of the 
3-year-old business magazine Vietnam Today, published in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 A copy of the first issue of Destination: Vietnam is available free upon 
request to Global Directions, 58 Genebern Way, San Francisco, Calif. 94112.

 Knott's to the Rescue: When a radio station promotion at Disneyland resulted 
in a throng of visitors who jammed the streets around the park at the peak of 
morning rush hour on Halloween, Knott's Berry Farm pitched in to salvage the 
day for many park-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 The KIIS-FM promotion offered a chance for a free day at Disneyland for 
listeners who showed up Halloween morning in costume.Thousands took up the 
offer -- so many that the Santa Ana Freeway and some streets were gridlocked. 
(One local motel manager reported that it took him an hour to move a single 
block on Katella Avenue in Anaheim.) 
</P>
<P>
 A Disneyland spokesman acknowledged that carloads of KIIS fans were turned 
away because they could not reach the Magic Kingdom in time. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 of the costumed mob decided to try Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park 
instead. Not only did Knott's waive its customary rule against allowing guests 
to wear costumes into the park, it gave the fun seekers a special low rate of 
$15.95 admission for adults. 
</P>
<P>
 A throng of goblins and ghouls wasn't all that unusual at Knott's. The park 
dresses hundreds of its own workers in costumes every year for its Halloween 
Haunt.

 Extra Day for a Dollar: Business travelers staying at the Marriott in Irvine 
don't have to worry about the cost if they have to stay an extra night. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel is offering a second night's stay for $1 when a guest pays the usual 
corporate rate of $119. Though known primarily as a business destination, the 
hotel is using the promotion to entice traveling executives to stay on for an 
extra day and unwind. The hotel offers swimming, tennis, a health club and a 
nearby golf course.

AD AGENCIES HOPE PROJECTED 3-D IMAGES WILL SELL; MARKETING: TECHNOLOGY COMBINES 
OPTICS AND PROGRAMMING TO PRODUCE HOLOGRAPH-LIKE IMAGES IN DAYLIGHT FOR USE IN

 Those eye-catching window displays at fancy department stores are moving out 
of the window. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A New York company has created a device that projects three-dimensional images 
sharply enough to be seen in daylight and without special glasses. It uses a 
combination of optics and computer programming to achieve the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The device, given the techno-sounding name "High-Definition Volumetric 
Display," was recently scheduled for its first public demonstration in the 
entrance and on the sidewalk of the new Bradlees department store in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows holograph-like, moving images of products including jeans, snow boots 
and personal stereos that seemed to spin in the air in front of moving stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, Dimensional Media Associates, hopes the technology behind the 
projection device will eventually be used in all sizes of machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a new form of media," said Jonathan Prince, president of Dimension 
Media. "We've also got the wherewithal and the backing to get out there in a 
very big way." 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Media's first big partner is Interpublic Group, a holding company of 
several large advertising agencies. In addition to the department stores, they 
are working on using the device for retail displays in grocery stores, malls, 
airports and movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives would not disclose how much the machine at Bradlees cost but said 
the technology would soon be affordable enough for use in consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Media was started by Susan Kasen Summer, who led designer florists 
that catered big events. She said she came up with the idea "just thinking 
about special effects and how you can apply 3-D imaging to big events." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer worked with engineers in Germany and the United States and the company 
now holds several dozen patents on the ideas behind the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The system collects and re-creates light from images on videotape, CD-ROM, 
laser disc and other digital video sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The farther an image is projected, however, the narrower viewing range it has. 
At Bradlees, the image appears several feet in front of the window but can only 
be seen by viewers either directly in front of it or 30 degrees to each side. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimension Media is experimenting with full 360-degree imaging, Prince said.

SMALL SAWMILL OPERATORS VENTURING TO SIBERIA; TIMBER: AS U.S. SUPPLIES DECLINE 
AMID ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, A PACIFIC NORTHWEST GROUP HOPES TO LOG THE VAST 
FORESTS OF EASTERN RUSSIA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of small family-owned sawmills in the Pacific Northwest has entered 
into a joint venture to log the vast forests of eastern Russia, hoping to 
secure supplies as U.S. logging declines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Global Forestry Management Group, or GFMG, made up of 10 small, 
independent forest products companies in Oregon, Washington and California, is 
shipping $3 million in heavy logging equipment to Russia's Khabarovsk region. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment is part of a $9-million investment by the U.S. mills. They 
announced a joint venture late last month with two Russian partners based in 
Khabarovsk: Exprales and SovGavan Lespromhoz Joint Stock Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The two private Russian companies were formed to develop a forest-products 
industry in Khabarovsk, a part of Siberia lying along the Russian border with 
China, said Mike Haglund, an attorney representing Portland-based GFMG. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint venture includes the construction of a log-export facility at 
Sovetskaya Gavan, a former Russian naval base, and the leasing of about one 
million acres of Russian timberland. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the venture could involve the investment of $40 million to $70 
million, Haglund said in an interview with Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the U.S. mills depend heavily on timber from federal land in the 
Pacific Northwest, where harvesting has been curtailed to protect endangered 
species such as the northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope Russian forests will eventually provide a new source of either logs 
or rough sawed lumber that can be turned into finished lumber products in the 
U.S. mills, Haglund said. GFMG negotiated the deal with help of a Russian 
attorney who came to the United States in 1990 to attend law school in Portland 
as part of an exchange program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian people are quite excited about this," said attorney Larisa 
Rasskazova, who made five trips to Russia to aid in the negotiations. "They 
have small harvesting enterprises but they are on the verge of collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Haglund's firm hired Rasskazova before she finished her studies at Lewis and 
Clark Law School because of her expertise with the Russian legal system. She 
had worked as a trial advocate and criminal lawyer in Leningrad, now St. 
Petersburg, before coming to the United States to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been a very important player on the negotiating team," Haglund said. 
"If you are going to deal in Russia, the deal must be crafted in both 
languages." 
</P>
<P>
 Weyerhaeuser Co., based in Tacoma, Wash., has also been attempting to start a 
timber venture near Sovetskaya Gavan. But the company has run into repeated 
difficulties with the Russian bureaucracy, said spokesman Frank Mendizabal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendizabal told the Portland Oregonian he wished the consortium luck with 
their joint venture, but he warned that "Russia is a difficult place to do 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasskazova said Weyerhaeuser may have run into difficulty because it tried to 
move too quickly and expected immediate profits. "They try to capture too much, 
too soon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that while Russian business people tend to be tough negotiators, the 
reason it takes a long time to complete deals is that they lack experience in 
modern business management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them still believe that capitalists are out to rip them off," she 
said. "We try to convince them that what we are proposing is good for both 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
 The first goal of the GFMG venture is to establish a working logging industry 
that first will sell timber to markets in China, Japan and Korea to raise 
capital, Haglund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money from those sales will then be invested in construction of modern mills 
in Russia, which could produce rough sawed lumber for export to the United 
States, where it would be turned into finished lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 The import of raw logs from Russia to the United States is currently 
prohibited unless the logs are heat-treated to kill moths and other pests. No 
plants exist yet to heat-treat the lumber, Haglund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rasskazova said the group plans to introduce modern, selective-cutting 
forestry techniques to Russia to replace traditional clear-cutting. The 
techniques include helicopter logging and other methods designed to protect the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. partners include the lumber companies and two trading companies. They 
are Avison Lumber Co., Croman Corp., Lyons Hanel Lumber Co., Ochoco Lumber Co., 
Sun Studs Inc. and S.L. Vollen Co., all based in Oregon; Jones International 
Services Co., S.D.S. Lumber Co. and Columbia Vista Corp. of Washington, and 
Hi-Ridge Lumber Co. and Sierra Forest Products of Northern California.

</P>

narrowed its loss to $816,000 from $1.3 million for the third quarter that 
ended Sept. 30, compared to the same period last year.Third-quarter revenue was 
$4.36 million, down 6% from $4.64 million the previous year.

<P>
 The company said its loss decreased in the third quarter due to cuts in 
administrative and other costs. In other news, the company said it opened its 
first factory outlet store in September in Milpitas, Calif., and will consider 
opening more factory outlets if that store proves successful.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: INCOMNET POSTS RECORD QUARTERLY SALES, EARNINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Incomnet Inc., a Woodland Hills telecommunications company, reported its 
fourth consecutive quarter of record sales and earnings in the third quarter 
that ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The company posted profit of $1.06 million in the third quarter, compared with 
a year-earlier loss of $68,118.Revenues surged to $12.8 million from $2.7 
million in the third quarter of 1993. The company said it gained more revenue 
in the third quarter than in all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of the year, Incomnet reported net income of $2.63 
million on sales of $30.7 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.27 
million on sales of $6.23 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company attributed the improved results to continued sales growth in its 
National Telephone & Communications Inc. unit, a subsidiary that buys excess 
capacity on fiber-optic cable lines from major telephone companies, then sells 
it at discount prices through a network of independent salespeople. 
</P>
<P>

REGIONAL EARNINGS: IWERKS REPORTS LOSS OF $785,645 IN 1ST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank-based producer of specialty theaters and 
virtual-reality technologies, reported a net loss of $785,645 in its fiscal 
first quarter that ended Sept. 30, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues rose 67% to $11 million in the latest quarter from $6.62 million in 
the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks has had trouble finding investors for its Cinetropolis complexes, 
mini-theme parks that offer attractions such as theaters with moving seats and 
dance floors surrounded by 360-degree movie screens. The company initially had 
high hopes for the concept, but Cinetropolis-related revenues dropped from 
$2.41 million in the first quarter of 1993 to $975,148 in the latest quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said recent revenue gains were due to increased theater sales, a 
larger number of portable motion simulator attractions and increased film 
license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The company recently laid off 35 of its 260 employees as part of a 
reorganization designed to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency. 
Iwerks Chief Executive Stanley Kinsey said the impact of these steps will begin 
to be felt in the company's fiscal third quarter.

HOME LISTINGS ARE SPARSE IN BUYER'S MARKET; REAL ESTATE: EARTHQUAKE AND 
RECESSION HAVE HAD IMPACT ON WHAT IS UP FOR SALE. MANY WOULD-BE BUYERS CANNOT 
FIND HOMES FREE OF QUAKE DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley real estate market may still be a buyer's market, but 
these days it's getting harder to find something to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many would-be sellers have mothballed their "For Sale" signs to wait for 
prices to rise, and perhaps thousands of properties have been scratched from 
the market after sustaining damage in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the inventory of existing single-family homes and condominiums 
for sale in the Valley area has shrunk to its lowest level in six years, 
according to the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. Listings totaled 7,742 
in October, down 32% from a year earlier, and 48% below the peak set in July, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The myth is that it's very difficult to sell houses right now," said Karin 
Basin Miller, an agent with the Bob Miller Real Estate Co. in Studio City. 
"It's difficult to find a house." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason homeowners are reluctant to put their properties on the market, 
agents said, is that Valley prices are still scraping bottom. The average 
single-family home sale price in October was $227,300, about $41,600 below the 
average price in 1988. Even though the number of sales in the Valley has 
recently surged as much as 20% over a year ago, many of these are quake-damaged 
or foreclosed properties going for discounted prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said she now represents 10 potential buyers, including one couple that 
has been looking for over a year for a four-bedroom home with a swimming pool 
in Sherman Oaks. They are willing to spend $500,000, Miller said, but they 
don't want anything that needs quake or other repair work, and that has been a 
considerable obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want something that's done, but there are very few done houses," Miller 
said. "It's tough for somebody to think they have half a million dollars and 
can't find what they need." 
</P>
<P>
 Few shoppers are required to be as patient as the couple Miller described, 
especially in the lower-priced end of the market, where supply is said to be 
more plentiful. Still, agents throughout the Valley say pickings are slim. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fred Sands Realtors office in Woodland Hills, the inventory of homes 
and condominiums they have listed for sale has dwindled from 275 last year to 
160 currently, said Todd Shapiro, associate manager of the office. "We're not 
down to the point where there's 15 people fighting for one listing," Shapiro 
said. "But choices are limited." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents who a year ago were desperately unloading listings are now clamoring 
for more. "Brokers didn't want listings because they were not selling," said 
Jerry Berns, an agent with Re/Max On the Boulevard in Sherman Oaks. "If you 
take a listing now, the chances are that it's going to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 With inventory once again at a premium, agents have resurrected the marketing 
ploys brokers have used for decades to compete for listings. In a recent 
newspaper advertisement, Berns promised that if he couldn't sell a property 
within eight weeks, he would forgo his share of the sales commission agents 
typically collect. (Generally, the company that lists a property for sale gets 
a 3% commission, and the brokerage finding a buyer gets the other 3%. Both 
commissions are paid by the seller.) 
</P>
<P>
 In other ads, inventory-hungry brokers have offered trips to Hawaii or 1,000 
lottery tickets at the close of escrow. Some agents even offer cellular phones 
or $100 travel coupons just for interviews with potential sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, the number of real estate agents in the Valley has shrunk 30%, the 
realtors group said, but some brokers say that hasn't made it any easier to get 
listings. In another recent newspaper ad, Marsha Swiller, an agent with 
Bradbury & Co. in Studio City, offered $500 in cash at the close of escrow. The 
response to the ad? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Not one call," said Swiller, who has watched her inventory dwindle from eight 
properties to two over the past year. "I would love to have listings, but 
people are not running out to put their houses on the market." 
</P>
<P>
 How long homeowners will have to wait for prices to start climbing is 
anybody's guess in a market that lately has seemed to defy logic. Even though 
supply is down and demand is up -- a combination that would ordinarily push 
prices higher -- average sale prices have tumbled 5% to 10% since last year, 
according to the Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has contributed to the confusion. While many properties were 
pulled off the market after the quake, hundreds of others have been sold with 
damage at bargain prices that are difficult for undamaged homes to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the lingering effects of the recession have created turmoil, as banks 
continue to sell foreclosed properties at deep discounts. Foreclosures in Los 
Angeles County totaled 17,381 in 1993, but through August of this year 
foreclosures had already exceeded last year's total by 19%, according to TRW 
REDI Property Data in Riverside. In the Valley, agents said, foreclosures and 
other problem properties account for at least 30% of the properties now for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Steinhauer, a broker with King Realty in Sherman Oaks, said his office 
made 20 sales in October. Of those, 10 were foreclosures and two were so-called 
"short pays," properties sold by owners who owed more on their mortgages than 
their properties were worth. "If you took away the (foreclosures) and the short 
pays, it would be a disastrous month," Steinhauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if all the problem properties suddenly disappeared, it is unlikely that 
prices and inventories of healthy properties would start a rapid climb. With 
interest rates rising and local job growth stagnant, housing demand remains 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing from brokers that good new listings are moving pretty fast," said 
Jim Link, executive vice president of the Valley Assn. of Realtors. "But it's 
not like a buyer frenzy. Right now everything is very price-sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Inventory may begin to rise again in the first quarter of next year, Link 
said, as earthquake repairs are completed and owners gear up for the 
traditionally active markets of the spring and summer. But prices may not climb 
significantly for years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Clarence Senger, an agent at the James R. Gary Co. in 
Woodland Hills, said brokers ought to be careful what they wish for. "If I had 
more listings, that would be great," Senger said. "But if we all doubled our 
inventory, we'd be in a buyer's market worse than it is."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: CHEROKEE FILES 2ND CHAPTER 11 PETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cherokee Inc. said it filed its prepackaged Chapter 11 reorganization petition 
Monday in federal Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
 It was reported that the Sunland apparel maker listed $107.1 million in assets 
and $122.8 million in debts.It is the second Chapter 11 filing for the company, 
which has been burdened by debt from a 1989 leveraged buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously announced, Cherokee's bankruptcy plan calls for swapping all its 
11% senior subordinated notes due in 1999 for about 89.9% of the common stock 
of the reorganized Cherokee. All outstanding trade debt would be exchanged for 
about 8.3% of the common stock of the reorganized company, and existing 
Cherokee stock would be converted to about 1.8% of the common stock in the 
post-bankruptcy company. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is expected to reduce Cherokee's long-term debt from about $100 
million to $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherokee entered and emerged from another prepackaged bankruptcy last year. In 
the fiscal year that ended May 28, it lost $24.8 million on $114.1 million in 
sales. The company has recently been streamlining its apparel selection to 
focus on casual clothes.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: LIVE ENTERTAINMENT TRADING ON OTC BULLETIN BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live Entertainment Inc., a Van Nuys videocassette distributor suspended from 
trading its stock on the New York Stock Exchange last month because it fell 
below certain minimum financial criteria, said its common stock has begun 
trading on the National Assn. of Securities Dealers' OTC Bulletin Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said its board of directors approved a one-for-five reverse 
stock split, a move that companies take to boost the value of individual 
shares.Live's closing bid price Nov. 1, the day it made the announcement, was 
50 cents a share. Live said it intends to apply for its common stock to be 
listed on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market, which requires a minimum bid price of $3 
a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Live's Series B preferred stock is now listed on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of Live's common stockholders and holders of its Series C preferred 
stock must approve the reverse stock split for it to take effect. Live said 
Pioneer LDCA Inc., which owns more than 50% of the combined voting interest of 
Live's common stock and Series C preferred stock, has indicated that it will 
support the reverse stock split.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: IHOP POSTS RECORD EARNINGS IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IHOP Corp., the Glendale developer and operator of pancake restaurants, said 
it had record earnings of $3.78 million for the third quarter that ended Sept. 
30, up 9% from $3.46 million last year. Sales for the quarter were $37.3 
million, down 2% from $38.2 million the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine months, the company said earnings were $9.73 million, up 55% from 
$6.2 million in the first nine months last year. Revenues for same period were 
$107.2 million, up 3% from $103.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the results for the nine-month period were attributable to 
healthy patronage at both company-owned and franchised restaurants, and a 
decline in the number of new franchise agreements, which dampened sales 
somewhat compared with last year. Twenty-three IHOP restaurants were franchised 
last year compared with 14 this year.

BRISK HOUSING SALES POSTPONE SEASONAL LULL, BUT VALUES FALL; REAL ESTATE: TOTAL 
OF 880 SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES CHANGE HANDS, A FIVE-YEAR HIGH FOR THE MONTH OF 
OCTOBER. AVERAGE PRICE DROPS 9% FROM A YEAR EARLIER. 
</P>

<P>
 The San Fernando Valley housing market may be easing into its seasonal winter 
slumber, but hibernation was postponed for at least another month as sales of 
single-family homes hit a five-year high for the month of October. Prices, 
however, continued to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of single-family homes totaled 880 last month, down 6% from September, 
but up 7% from October, 1993, according to the San Fernando Valley Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, average sale prices tumbled to $227,300 in October, down 9% from a 
year earlier, and 4% below the average sales price in September. The median 
sale price for a house was $178,500, down 5% from a year ago, and $1,500 below 
September's median. The median price means half the houses sold for more than 
$178,500 and half sold for less. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Link, executive vice president of the association, said sinking prices 
reflect heavy activity in the lower-priced market segments. "Most of the buyers 
are first-time buyers, many of whom had been frozen out of the market by the 
dramatic spike in resale prices that occurred from 1988 to 1991," Link said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices have also been deflated by an abundance of foreclosed properties -- 
remnants of the region's deep recession -- as well as those being sold with 
damage sustained in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. The market has been 
recovering slowly since the fall of 1993, when sales began to accelerate, but 
Link said the market's health remains fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recovery has continued despite nine hikes in home-loan interest rates," 
Link said. "But any further increases could shut the market down." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 1,012 single-family homes and condominiums were sold in October, up 
6% from October, 1993, when 954 properties changed hands, and 6% below the 
volume posted in September of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The average sales price of a condominium was $116,400 in October, down 11% 
from the same month in 1993, but up 2% from September. The median sales price 
of a condominium last month was $103,500, down 19% from a year earlier, and 7% 
below the median sales price in September.

HARBORING GREAT DREAMS; TRADE: THE PORT OF HUENEME IS DINKY NEXT TO MEGA-PORTS 
IN LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH, BUT IT'S GROWING NICELY THANKS TO A FOCUS ON 
FRESH FRUIT AND AUTOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the tiny Port of Hueneme tried to persuade Cool Carriers, a Swedish 
shipping concern that hauls Sunkist Growers' fruit overseas, to use its docks. 
For years, Cool Carriers said no.  
</P>
<P>
 The line had comfortably berthed at the Port of Long Beach, the biggest port 
on the West Coast, for 22 years. Besides, Gerry Fountain, president of Cool 
Carriers USA Inc., thought the Port of Hueneme was just too small. 
</P>
<P>
 But Port of Hueneme executives "never let go," Fountain said. "They 
continually came after me. They showed me they could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 So Cool Carriers switched its Sunkist shipping business to Hueneme last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly what the Port of Hueneme did is build an $11-million dockside 
refrigeration facility for Cool Carriers. The warehouse -- the largest and most 
modern of its kind on the West Coast, port officials boast -- keeps Sunkist 
citrus fruit fresh while awaiting shipment overseas. That's a crucial 
competitive and marketing advantage for Sunkist; at Long Beach, the oranges 
would sit up to four days in open-air sheds. Fountain had asked for a new 
storage facility at the Port of Long Beach, but couldn't strike a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Cool Carriers brought back former Hueneme customer Turbana Corp., 
which uses the new warehouse to store its own imported bananas. The Hueneme 
port also receives bananas and melons for Del Monte Foods, a longtime customer, 
and to keep Del Monte happy the port is lending the money to build another 
$3-million refrigerated facility to be finished next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the 54-year-old Port of Hueneme, with its 70 acres and five berths 
nestled next to a Navy facility, is still a lily pond compared with the mighty 
expanses of the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hueneme is the only deep water port between San Francisco and Los Angeles, 
and in its fiscal year ended June 30 it handled 790,700 revenue tons of cargo, 
up 26% from the year before. But that's dinky compared with the 83 million 
metric revenue tons at Long Beach in fiscal 1994 and 65 million at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Small as it is, Hueneme isn't the smallest of the state's 20 ports -- those in 
Redwood City, Alameda and Eureka are even tinier. But for decades the port here 
languished, bound by its small acreage and its location in laid-back Ventura 
County. Meanwhile, those in Los Angeles and Long Beach grew into giants, thanks 
to the booming Los Angeles metropolitan area, access to rail lines and 
investments in equipment and facilities needed by big shipping lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Port of Hueneme's pond is filling up nicely with its 
successful specialty in fresh fruit and autos. The amount of cargo passing 
through has increased by a third over the past decade, and its operating 
revenues are expected to grow to a record $6.1 million in the current fiscal 
year, up from $4 million in fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The port consistently reports a surplus over its annual budget and has been 
paying off debt early. In a recently released report, the Port of Hueneme 
estimated that it directly or indirectly generated $275 million in sales and 
2,553 jobs in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for the once-sleepy port's awakening goes largely to Anthony Taormina, 
the aggressive executive director of the Oxnard Harbor District, which owns and 
runs the port. A former Port of San Francisco deputy director of planning and 
research, Taormina moved south in 1985 to run, figuratively speaking, his own 
ship, and he is now paid an annual salary of $99,960. 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina saw that the mega-ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach were 
concentrating increasingly on the flourishing containerized cargo trade -- 
which includes everything from shoes to VCRs that is shipped in 20-foot or 
40-foot metal boxes. Long Beach now is the nation's largest container port; Los 
Angeles the second-largest. At the same time, Taormina didn't want to continue 
relying on the Port of Hueneme's biggest business then of supplying equipment 
to offshore oil platforms, given the volatility of the oil market. 
</P>
<P>
 So he and his staff of 20 focused on the other two industries Hueneme had 
traditionally served: fresh fruit and cars. And they lured customers who felt 
lost at sea in Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina learned how large ports can get afflicted with nearsightedness at the 
Port of San Francisco, which for more than a decade has lost business to 
Oakland's port. "One of the failures of San Francisco was it felt that it was 
the port, and no one could take cargo away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 To bring new business to Hueneme, Taormina said, he used the "sleepy little 
port" image to his advantage by quietly negotiating deals that the crowded 
ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach couldn't match. The fees charged on cargo 
and ships are generally uniform port to port. But prices for renting or owning 
facilities at or near a port can vary widely, and therein lies an advantage for 
Hueneme, which has much relatively cheap land available nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider BMW, which has delivered all its cars for 12 western states to 
Hueneme since 1988. The German auto maker had wanted to build a facility near 
the Port of Los Angeles, its old delivery spot, where it could put the 
finishing touches and accessories on the imports. But that proved impossible 
because land near the harbor is at a premium. BMW would have had to rent an old 
building there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was easier to come to a new and emerging port like Port Hueneme where we 
could get the acreage close to the port and build our own facility," said Tom 
McGurn, a spokesman for BMW of North America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then other European auto makers, including Land Rover (which also makes 
Range Rover), Jaguar and Volvo, have followed BMW and their common shipping 
line, Wallenius of Sweden, to Hueneme. Keven Beirne, regional manager for 
Wallenius Lines North America Inc., said the auto industry has been left 
somewhat on the sidelines at Los Angeles and Long Beach as those ports devote 
more space to containerized cargo. Wallenius turned to Hueneme after growing 
frustrated with the larger ports' congestion and high rates for using the port 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallenius ships about 50,000 cars a year to Hueneme. Three times a month, one 
of Wallenius' giant floating parking lots, big enough to house 5,800 cars nose 
to nose on 13 decks, nestles up to Hueneme docks. Longshoremen working for 
stevedore companies drive the cars down ramps and park them in an adjacent lot. 
The cars are driven a mile down a sparsely traveled road, past strawberry 
fields, to the finishing facilities and are then trucked to dealers throughout 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wallenius, Cool Carriers and a third fruit-shipping line, J. Lauritzen of 
Denmark, are the biggest shipping customers at the Port of Hueneme. On a 
typical day, two ships pull into dock. Recently, Wallenius' Madame Butterfly -- 
all the company's ships are named after operas -- began its voyage in Sweden 
and picked up cars at various places in Europe. After docking at Hueneme, it 
was bound for ports up the Pacific Coast and then to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another auto maker, Mitsubishi of Japan, moved its California car 
shipments to Hueneme in January, after the Port of Los Angeles told the 
Japanese company it would have to move to a smaller dockside facility to make 
room for incoming coal shipments and pay a higher rental rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't feel the Port of Los Angeles was as committed to the auto 
business," said Katy Bremer, director of corporate logistics at Mitsubishi 
Motor Sales Inc. "We needed to be someplace where autos were a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the deal with Sherman Oaks-based Sunkist and its Cool Carriers 
shipping line that Taormina considers his biggest coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunkist had long wanted a refrigerated facility to increase the shelf life of 
its oranges and lemons. The Oxnard Harbor District offered to sell tax-exempt 
bonds to pay for the 70% of the facility that the port would own, and Cool 
Carriers agreed to pay for the remaining 30%. After that, "the only thing we 
needed to know is that we could get our vessels in there," said Sunkist 
spokesman Bill Quarles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunkist now ships 60% of its member packinghouses' fruit out of Hueneme in 
pallets, bound for Japan and other Pacific Rim countries. The rest of Sunkist's 
exports still go out of Long Beach and Los Angeles because they are packed in 
containers that require those ports' specialized container operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing business to Hueneme hasn't gone unnoticed at Los Angeles and Long 
Beach, although any injury to the bigger ports is more like a pinprick than a 
body blow. "We're in a competitive industry, and we certainly don't like losing 
any accounts," said Port of Los Angeles spokesman Jeff Leong. "But it would 
hurt more if we lost one of the major container shipping lines." Indeed, some 
observers say the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports are just as glad to see 
non-containerized cargo go elsewhere so they can expand on their lucrative 
container business. 
</P>
<P>
 And Taormina is well aware that the Port of Hueneme still has many 
limitations. He has tried and failed, for instance, to lure the nation's 
largest banana companies, Dole Food Co. and Chiquita Brands International, to 
his port. The companies now ship through Los Angeles and Long Beach and they 
consider Hueneme too small for their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched in 1940 by local farmers, the Port of Hueneme was operating for only 
two years before the Navy took it over during World War II. In the 1960s and 
1970s, the Harbor District bought back about 70 acres from the Navy and resumed 
commercial port operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Taormina is now looking at ways to keep the port growing. He's close to a deal 
to lease another berth and 25 acres from the Navy on a part-time basis, an 
achievement that would allow another shipping line to come in. He's also hoping 
to capture more business from BMW as the auto maker increases production at its 
first U.S. plant in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, the Port of Hueneme won another victory when it was approved by 
the Department of Commerce as a foreign trade zone. The new status gives import 
companies an advantage by allowing them to forgo paying customs duties until 
their goods leave the port. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly Taormina sees the port growing along with expanding Pacific Rim 
trade and the opening of markets under the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and other trade pacts. If China ever opened its market to citrus imports, he 
said, Hueneme would be one busy little port. "We have really established a 
niche," he said. "We now have to look at how do we enhance that niche."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: AMERSCAN GLOBAL AIDS NORWEGIAN INVESTORS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County is as good a place as any to operate a Scandinavian venture 
capital fund. 
</P>
<P>
 For that, you can take the word of Marty Albert, president of AmerScan Global 
Partners, a Thousand Oaks concern that operates a $10-million, Oslo-based fund 
that's helped Norwegians launch three high-tech concerns in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert, 62, is an ex-engineer and longtime high-tech entrepreneur. In 1989, he 
was taking part in a business colloquium at Cal Lutheran University. A 
Norwegian transfer student in the audience, Erik Tiller, suggested he try 
lecturing in Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took his advice and found that Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Norway have 
extremely high per-capita rates of engineers," Albert recalls. "These countries 
give strong support to research and development, but beyond that, it's hard for 
a small company to get funding." 
</P>
<P>
 With Tiller and two other Scandinavians as his partners, Albert raised enough 
money to start AmerScan I, which has helped Norwegians launch three companies. 
He's president of one, Dolphin Interconnect Solutions, a producer of 
computer-clustering systems. The firm recently moved from Santa Clara to 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert sees nothing unusual in operating a fund thousands of miles away from 
its official headquarters. He even enjoys being far removed from Wall Street 
and other Eastern money centers. "They're a bunch of snobs back there. Who 
needs them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Albert and his partners hope to raise $40 million to $50 million for 
another fund, AmerScan II, to provide even more backing for Scandinavian 
entrepreneurs.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES: SIEMENS' SOLAR-LIGHTING BUSINESS SOLD TO 
HONG KONG FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Siemens Solar Industries, a Camarillo firm that for years has claimed to be 
the world's leading supplier of solar-energy products, has sold its 
solar-lighting business to a Hong Kong company that formerly manufactured 
outdoor lights and other items for Siemens. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the sale weren't disclosed, but a Siemens Solar spokeswoman said the 
Hong Kong firm, Alpan Products Ltd., has acquired about 10% of Siemens' 
business. Alpan was joined by an unnamed Hong Kong investor in purchasing the 
rights to manufacture and market Siemens' solar-lighting products. As part of 
the deal, Siemens Solar will supply solar cells that will be used to power 
Alpan's products. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpan has established a U.S. subsidiary, Alpan Inc., that will operate the 
newly acquired unit. The new firm is headquartered on Constitution Avenue in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Siemens Solar representative said no jobs will be lost as a result of the 
transaction. Siemens Solar is part of the international solar operations of 
Siemens AG, the German electronics giant. The Camarillo firm has about 325 
employees, down from 400 several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The local Siemens unit, which in recent years has upgraded its production 
systems in an effort to improve profitability, will retain its core business -- 
the production and worldwide marketing of solar cells and modules. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultra-thin units collect the sun's energy to power outdoor lights, 
lanterns, security lighting systems and other consumer items. The units also 
are used in supplying power to communities worldwide that are not part of 
traditional grids. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens prefers to concentrate on improving its cells and modules and on 
developing its solar-power delivery systems, said Siemens spokeswoman Susan 
Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Alpan manufactured some of Siemens' lights and lanterns in 
factories in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and other Far East locations. Alpan 
also markets its own brand of solar-powered lights worldwide. Alpan has hired 
the managers and other employees of Siemens' retail products group, including 
former Siemens sales manager Phil Lerch and former marketing executive Marilyn 
Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer said she and her co-workers will conduct worldwide marketing and 
distribution of the former Siemens products from Camarillo. As part of the 
purchase, the Hong Kong company also acquired a Siemens warehouse in San 
Fernando, she reported.  
</P>
<P>
 "Since Alpan already was producing many of Siemens' products, its factories 
will simply continue turning them out as they have in the past," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Siemens purchased its Camarillo plant from Atlantic Richfield Co. in 1990. 
Less than three years later, Siemens filed a lawsuit charging that Arco had 
fraudulently misrepresented the operation's commercial viability. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit has not yet been resolved, Shaw said.

ITO APPROVES A TELEVISED TRIAL; SIMPSON CASE: JUDGE SAYS CAMERA IN COURTROOM 
WAS NOT TO BLAME FOR ERRONEOUS DNA REPORT. HE FINDS 'HIGHER LEVEL OF 
RESPONSIBILITY' AMONG MEDIA IN PAST FIVE WEEKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearing the way for viewers across the country to tune in to the O.J. Simpson 
murder trial, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito ruled Monday that a television 
camera may stay in the courtroom, a decision that at least temporarily ends a 
legal dispute that has dogged the case for more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 As the session began Monday, Ito displayed 21 boxes containing 12,468 letters 
from people who urged him to cut off the camera. But Ito later declined to 
carry out his longstanding threat to curtail courtroom television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's decision ended a debate that has raged since Sept. 30, when he formally 
notified news organizations that he was considering ending the television 
coverage of the court proceedings. That threat came after the airing of an 
erroneous report about DNA evidence and the broadcast of close-up shots of 
jurors from a different trial. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past five weeks, however, Ito has observed a "higher level of 
responsibility" in reporting on the case, he said Monday. More important, the 
judge added, he has concluded that the camera in the courtroom was not to blame 
for the earlier problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "What caused the court its initial concern . . . happened outside of this 
courtroom," Ito said, noting that he has taken several steps to curtail 
publicity in the case since the broadcast of the inaccurate DNA story, 
initially aired by KNBC Channel 4 and repeated by other news organizations. 
"The bottom line is whether or not the transgressions that caused the court to 
set this hearing took place within the confines of the court. . . . I find that 
they did not. The court's previous ruling allowing television coverage stands." 
</P>
<P>
 The only condition Ito imposed was that Court TV, which provides the courtroom 
coverage, set up a remote control camera on the wall above the jury. Because 
the camera would be inconspicuous, it would minimize the potential for witness 
intimidation, he said. Its placement would also ensure that the jurors' faces 
are not televised. Court TV's president said the camera could be installed 
within a day or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito ruled in favor of the continued television coverage, he first 
spent about two hours grilling attorneys for The Times and other news 
organizations about the camera and its potential effect on the trial of 
Simpson, who is charged with the June 12 killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and 
Ronald Lyle Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Monday, Ito gestured theatrically to the cardboard boxes full of 
letters urging him to cut off the courtroom camera.  
</P>
<P>
 He then asked Kelli L. Sager, an attorney representing The Times and more than 
a dozen other organizations, how she could maintain that the public had an 
interest in continued television coverage when so many people had written 
asking him to end it. Those letters came in response to an article by a 
syndicated columnist urging them to write Ito favoring the camera ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients would be happy to organize a letter-writing campaign if that were 
the way the court were to decide issues in this case," Sager responded. "But I 
would urge the court not to make rulings . . . based on public opinion. If 
20,000 people wrote in and said: 'We think the DNA evidence should come in,' 
I'm sure the court would not then make a decision based on the fact that the 
public has spoken." 
</P>
<P>
 Sager, who has appeared before Ito a number of times during the Simpson case, 
told the judge that court hearings should be open to as many people as 
possible, in part to reassure the public that the process is fair and that the 
verdicts are supported by the evidence. Intense public interest in the Simpson 
case also makes it a useful vehicle to educate millions of people about the 
legal system, Sager added. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comments were seconded by Floyd Abrams, an attorney from New York who 
represented Court TV at Monday's hearing and who opened his remarks by saying 
he was arguing on behalf of the courtroom camera itself. Abrams, echoing 
Simpson's famous proclamation of innocence, said that although some of the 
reporting on the case has been reckless and irresponsible, "the camera pleads 
absolutely, 100% not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't do anything wrong," Abrams added. "It hasn't shown anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Sager and Abrams, just two of more than a dozen media lawyers who gathered in 
Ito's courtroom for Monday's hearing, were followed by others who also urged 
the judge to keep the camera rolling. Simpson's attorneys and prosecutors 
joined in saying they too favored keeping the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Simpson's lead lawyers, Robert L. Shapiro, said wide public attention 
to the case will help Simpson reclaim his name at the end of the trial. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark said it will allow "the world to see what the jury 
sees" and improve the accuracy of reporting on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 That left Ito in the relatively rare position of facing a united front that 
included the media, defense and prosecution. But the judge used the session to 
elicit from the attorneys their endorsement of the steps he has taken so far to 
counteract publicity in the case -- a tactic that legal experts said was 
significant because in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court in Sheppard vs. Maxwell 
reversed a conviction after finding that the judge had failed to do enough to 
protect Dr. Sam Sheppard's right to a fair trial on charges that he murdered 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito wants to establish a clear record that he has done everything in 
his power to ensure Mr. Simpson's right to a fair trial so that no appellate 
court could say of him what the Supreme Court said of the irresponsible 
behavior of the trial court in the Sheppard case," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA 
law professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has undertaken a probing jury selection process, has directed that all 
test results of evidence be forwarded directly to him and has cautioned 
attorneys about their public comments in the case. In addition, he is 
considering sequestering the jury. All those are attempts to protect a fair 
trial for Simpson, and all make his handling of this case different from the 
way the judge proceeded in the Sheppard case, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito's ruling clears the way for the celebrated murder trial to be 
televised, Simpson's lawyers said they will ask for the camera to be barred 
from hearings that are scheduled to take place between now and opening 
statements in the trial. The expected date for opening statements to begin has 
been pushed back time and again, but most observers now expect them to start 
after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Cochran said the defense wants Ito to remove the camera for 
the upcoming hearings and may seek to close some sessions to keep jurors from 
hearing of disputed evidence. The hearings at issue are expected to deal with 
defense objections to certain prosecution evidence. DNA samples will be the 
focus of the most closely watched hearing, but another controversy may erupt if 
prosecutors seek to introduce evidence that Simpson beat his ex-wife or stalked 
her after their divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also have made clear that they consider Simpson's initial failure 
to surrender as evidence that he was fleeing prosecution. If they seek to 
introduce evidence about the low-speed pursuit involving Simpson and his friend 
Al Cowlings -- which ended when Simpson was persuaded to put down a loaded gun 
and turn himself in -- defense attorneys would likely object. They view that 
same incident as evidence of Simpson's distress at the death of his ex-wife, 
not of a guilty conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said prosecutors would oppose curtailing the camera for any hearing open 
to the public but would join with the defense in proposing to close certain 
hearings altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 With his ruling Monday, Ito did not directly address the defense request to 
close some hearings, but American Civil Liberties Union attorneys broke with 
their media allies in urging that the camera be barred from those sessions. Ito 
warned Sager that "I think this means you'll be writing briefs over 
Thanksgiving." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do that if we need to, your honor," Sager responded. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to voicing their views about the television camera in the 
courtroom, prosecutors and defense attorneys used Monday's session to redouble 
their arguments on another hot topic in the case: whether the jury and 
alternates should be sequestered for all or part of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers hammered that issue with particular vigor, saying they 
supported keeping the camera in the courtroom but not if the price for that was 
that Ito would sequester the jury in order to shield jurors from the coverage 
the camera supplies. Some studies have shown that sequestered juries may be 
more inclined to convict defendants, and Simpson's lawyers have vigorously 
opposed sequestration at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the evidence or lack of evidence will show that Mr. Simpson 
is not guilty of these crimes," Shapiro said. "For Mr. Simpson to have a life 
after this case, with his children, it will require the American public to have 
an understanding that his acquittal was based on what was presented in the 
courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Shapiro added: "If your honor is inclined to allow cameras in the 
courtroom at the cost of jury sequestration, we are firmly against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran characterized the defense position on sequestration in terms of a 
philosophical difference with prosecutors about how much trust each side puts 
in the jurors selected last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fundamental difference in how we perceive the jurors. . . . We 
perceive them as people of good faith who want to dedicate their time, who to a 
person said: 'The reason we are here is because we believe in our oaths as 
jurors and we will not defile or defame that oath,' " Cochran said. "I think 
they take this task as a higher calling." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito warned Simpson's attorneys that he believed sequestration for all or part 
of the trial was a strong possibility, but he added that he has not made up his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection has been under way since Sept. 26 and is to resume this morning 
as the judge and attorneys search for 15 alternate jurors. Unlike other 
hearings in the case, the selection process is not being televised.

 "Come quickly to New York. Our mother is on the verge of dying," read the fax 
to 59-year-old professor Georgy Grigorenko. "A brain hemorrhage has left her in 
a coma, and the doctors say she has only a few days left." 
</P>
<P>
 Fax in hand, Grigorenko, whose late father was one of the most heroic of 
Soviet dissidents, rushed recently to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow for a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 There, as he recalls, a consular official behind a glass window asked him his 
profession (professor), how much he earned (about $40 a month), how much his 
wife earned (the same) and who would cover his expenses (his brother in New 
York). 
</P>
<P>
 Then the official said: "Sir, I reject you. First of all, because you've never 
been to America and it's hard to be sure you'll come back. Secondly, because 
you earn too little, and thirdly, because you have too many relatives in the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was not unique. And though Grigorenko later got an apology and a 
visa in time for his mother's funeral, the embassy's attitude toward the case 
fired such outrage in President Boris N. Yeltsin's human rights chief that he 
picketed the building, then swore never to set foot there again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (visitors' visa) system is absolutely unjust," said Sergei Kovalev, a 
comrade of the late Nobel laureate Andrei D. Sakharov and now Russia's main 
voice of conscience. "To insult the dignity of every person who wants to travel 
to New York or Los Angeles is simply not permissible. And to limit them in that 
right is not permissible." 
</P>
<P>
 But it happens often. In contrast to the beefy warm embraces exchanged by 
their presidents, Russia and the United States remain cool to each other when 
it comes to letting in visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War is over and the White House is pushing American investment in 
Russia. But travel between the countries, now reaching a brisk traffic of more 
than 100,000 visits each way annually, remains rife with rancor and 
bureaucratic barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials defend their procedures here as conforming to U.S. consular 
practices around the globe and with U.S. laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Moscow, Russians' complaints that U.S. consular officials humiliate 
them and hold up their visas arbitrarily have reached the point that the 
leading daily Izvestia carried a blistering piece on "The manners of U.S. 
consular workers in Moscow." Human rights groups issue public protests and 
Russian diplomats asked about the problem lose their diplomatic restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iron Curtain that came down has now been put up from the other side," 
fumed Vasily Vinogradov, chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry's consular 
service. "For a citizen who wants to leave, it's the same Iron Curtain. Before, 
he clashed with our Soviet bureaucracy and totalitarianism. Now he clashes with 
Western bureaucracy and totalitarianism." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, for their part, often get a nasty dose of Soviet-style red tape 
when they try to obtain visas they need to go to Russia -- including embassy 
workers who slam down phones on information-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a cultural difference, especially given the U.S. Embassy system 
of trying to decide in an interview of five minutes or less whether a would-be 
visitor will stay on illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans get annoyed; Russians get insulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Those very Russians acknowledge that the United States must protect itself 
against bad foreigners. They can see that the Moscow consular section is 
struggling under a backbreaking workload, issuing more than 500 visas per day 
and guaranteeing same-day service to all. And all in all, the U.S. Embassy 
turns down only about 20% of applicants for guest and business visas -- for 
which applicants are charged a $20 fee -- giving Russians far better odds than 
their neighbors in Poland, Romania and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the visa procedures nonetheless evoke a supercharged emotional response -- 
a mix of hurt superpower pride, the accumulated outrage of decades of 
repression, shattered illusions about America and quashed hopes of truly free 
travel at last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to think this, but they seem to want to demonstrate that they 
consider me scum," said Lera, a psychologist whose first visa application was 
denied. "We're prepared to be checked, submit documents and all necessary 
information, but you have to do it in a civilized way." 
</P>
<P>
 Visa problems also tend to inhibit development of the very U.S.-Russian 
business partnership that both presidents expend so much breath touting. 
Russian officials commented that it is as if one arm of government promotes 
cooperation while the other writes visa rules, and the two never talk.  
</P>
<P>
 "They make business unpredictable," the head of a small New York-based 
telecommunications company said. "What do we do if we have a Russian subsidiary 
that does 95% of our business, and we can't summon its general director when we 
need him?" 
</P>
<P>
 The historical irony of Russians' visa travails is inescapable. The United 
States was a top critic of Soviet travel restrictions in the old Cold War days, 
and Congress linked tariffs on Soviet goods to free emigration of Soviet Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with American public opinion leaning toward get-tough rules on illegal 
immigration, many Russians are finding that Moscow no longer brands them "no 
exit" but Washington considers them "no entry." 
</P>
<P>
 They are the new refuseniks, and Moscow human rights groups protest their 
plight just as they used to defend Jews and others refused exit visas. 
</P>
<P>
 But America's push for freer Soviet travel "didn't mean that each country had 
to receive the people of the sending nation," said a U.S. Embassy official, 
who, following protocol, declined to be identified. "It just meant that you 
should be able to travel freely." 
</P>
<P>
 Each country has the sovereign right to decide its own rules for letting in 
foreign nationals, another U.S. Embassy official said, and international human 
rights treaties guarantee a person's right to leave his country and return to 
it, but not to go absolutely anywhere he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is far from alone in its cool welcome to would-be Russian 
visitors. Complaints abound from applicants for Canadian, British and other 
visas; it takes 40 days here to get an Italian visa; would-be visitors to 
Germany can wait for up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, the American system of same-day service, even if it means 
getting in line at 7 a.m., looks almost idyllic. And although visa applicants 
may freeze for hours in line, and some of the processing is done in cramped, 
no-frills quarters, the physical conditions draw only expressions of light 
surprise that the richest country in the world cannot present a better face. In 
any case, a $40,000 remodeling for the consular section is planned soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The real problems, however, arise when an applicant approaches a consular 
official behind a glass window for "the interview." Many of the suspicious 
questions posed by harried workers come across as horribly rude, said more than 
a dozen Russians interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mikhail, a businessman who heads the Russian subsidiary of the New 
York-based telecommunications company, presented his invitation to America from 
his parent company, the consular clerk snapped: "How do I know you didn't just 
buy this on the street outside the embassy for $100?" 
</P>
<P>
 The American chief of an aid program in Moscow said when she has gone in to 
help Russian employees get visas for business trips to America, consular 
officials "treated me as rudely as if I was a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 American officials say they believe no consular employees have been 
reprimanded for their manners and dismiss many of the Russian complaints as 
coming from "a culture clash." One senior official quipped that Russians 
"should be connoisseurs of rudeness." 
</P>
<P>
 To Kovalev, however, consular officials' behavior is not to be accepted so 
lightly. One of the most respected people in Russia and a member of Yeltsin's 
administration, he said he was dismissed by a vice consul whom he had called 
about the Grigorenko case with the words: "I don't have time to chatter with 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "The arrogance, self-importance and stupidity of these people are simply 
amazing. How can you have such workers in an embassy so important to America?" 
Kovalev wondered. "They came here as if to a country populated with savages." 
</P>
<P>
 Kovalev said he was also appalled by consular officials' ignorance of Soviet 
history. He compared not knowing about Gen. Pyotr Grigorenko, a courageous 
human rights advocate who was tortured in a psychiatric prison and ultimately 
expelled from the Soviet Union, to a Russian working in America who never had 
heard of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the interview goes smoothly, the fact that it is required about half 
the time brings Russian Foreign Ministry officials to the point of tearing 
their hair. It is they who must take the flak when the embassy refuses to take 
the ministry's word that an applicant is a Russian bigwig and should not be 
required to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinogradov said the vice president of Gazprom, the giant Russian gas company 
worth billions, was required to appear for an interview; a mini-scandal arose 
this summer when a Foreign Ministry diplomat was called in. The embassy later 
said that case was an error. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always bring the example of what would happen if we started calling in 
(former Chrysler Chairman) Lee Iacocca for an interview and asked him to 
explain what his salary is and to prove that he wants to return to the United 
States," Vinogradov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian officials argue that when the U.S. Embassy offends important 
Russians right and left, it is playing into the hands of anti-Western political 
forces that would rather see Russia proud than at peace. Some say they are also 
turning off America's greatest natural supporters here -- the enterprising 
young New Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes a political question, for President Yeltsin and for the government 
and for our ministry," Vinogradov said. "We try to explain to our colleagues: 
'What are you doing? You're weakening the position of the government you 
support.' " 
</P>
<P>
 For consular workers, however, the issue is mainly practical. According to an 
informal survey they made, 15% to 20% of Russians who go to the United States 
on guest or business visas overstay. They are also concerned about the growing 
Russian organized crime presence in the United States and are required by U.S. 
law to assume would-be visitors intend to stay illegally unless they can prove 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many European countries that require foreigners to register with 
police, the United States has no good means to keep track of Russian visitors 
once they land. "Once you're through the point of entry, it's over," the 
embassy official said. "The point of no return is us. It forces us to be the 
heavies." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the official said, "We keep trying to figure out, within the 
constraints of limited space and so many applications, what we can do to make 
this clearer, easier, nicer." 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian Foreign Ministry suggests that the consulate shift to a system of 
invitations, placing more responsibility on Americans who invite Russians and 
perhaps even fining hosts of guests who overstay.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But embassy officials say figuring out who had overstayed would involve hiring 
hordes of new immigration officers to check the 22 million foreigners who visit 
the United States annually as they leave or track them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they are working to whittle the number of Russian visa applicants who 
must undergo the interview. They also hope to farm out some of the visa process 
to selected travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the consulate is likely to keep alienating Russian visitors before 
they can even get on the plane. Or keeping them off the plane altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei, a Moscow professional who got a visa for his son to attend a U.S. 
summer camp, said the experience made him decide against going to visit 
himself. "I just don't want to go through another humiliation," he said. "I'd 
rather go without America."

SENATE RIVALS FINISH BITTER, COSTLY RACE WITH FINAL BLITZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN and DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The costliest -- and among the nastiest -- congressional campaigns in recent 
U.S. history concluded Monday with Sen. Dianne Feinstein insisting that voters 
cannot allow a Senate seat to be bought and her opponent, Mike Huffington, 
saying that Feinstein's record does not merit her reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls suggesting a slight lead for Feinstein, the Democratic incumbent 
implored her supporters to make it to the polls today and return her to a full 
six-year term; she was elected to a partial term in 1992. "The difference 
between victory and defeat is in your hands," Feinstein told cheering 
supporters at a Monday morning rally in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington embarked on the most exhaustive single-day schedule of his 
campaign, barnstorming to six cities before returning home to Santa Barbara. He 
repeatedly portrayed Feinstein as a tax-and-spend incumbent beholden to special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman congressman, who has broken national expenditure records by 
spending more than $28 million of his own money to unseat Feinstein, also 
released a final television ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding the candidates' last-minute barbs, there were no revelations 
on the final day of the bitter Senate race. In that regard, it was a departure 
from the closing weeks of campaigning, when Huffington disclosed that he broke 
federal law by hiring an illegal immigrant as a nanny and the INS released 
records showing that in the early 1980s a former housekeeper for Feinstein did 
not hold a work permit for private employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The immigration issue dominated the final days of the campaign, which was 
largely fought over the airwaves in an unprecedented media blitz. Huffington 
has spent more than twice as much as Feinstein, and both sides have spent the 
bulk of their resources on ads attacking the other. Campaign officials expected 
that Feinstein and Huffington each would spend about $1.5 million on television 
commercials in the race's final week. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ads continued, the candidates sought to shore up support with 
last-minute public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending the weekend in voter-rich Southern California, Feinstein made 
one last visit to her West Los Angeles headquarters before campaigning before 
large crowds at UC Davis and at the Embarcadero in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein told supporters that if reelected she would continue to press for 
more crime-fighting legislation and bills involving two other issues that have 
figured prominently in the Senate race: illegal immigration and campaign 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message I have tried to bring is that a United States Senate seat cannot 
be bought; a United States Senate seat must be earned," she said several times 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now know this. We can win this race," Feinstein said. "We have been going up 
and down this state and Republicans and Democrats have been coming out, people 
that didn't have to have been coming out and endorsing this candidacy, saying 
that I have earned a six-year seat" in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein called attention to her record by ticking off her support of the 
federal crime bill, the ban on military assault rifles and authorship of the 
Desert Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a series of commitments two years ago. I have kept every single 
commitment I made," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this last day of this campaign, I want to make this additional pledge: I 
will bring the same perseverance, the same tenacity, the same craftsmanship 
that I brought to the issue of assault weapons to campaign spending reform," 
Feinstein said. "Because if anything has taught me that campaigns are not right 
in this land, it has been this campaign. I am a walking, talking case in point 
for campaign spending reform," she said, referring to Huffington's financing 
his campaign from his personal fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Feinstein added what has been obvious to anyone following her vitriolic 
battle with Huffington: "This is the worst campaign I have ever been in. I 
never thought I would be in a campaign like this," she told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ugliness -- or perhaps because of it -- Feinstein seemed confident 
and relieved that the campaign was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can win this race. Obviously, it depends on people who turn out," she 
said. "But I think the choice is a clear one: one who doesn't believe 
government should work for people and one who does believe government can and 
should and will work for people." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaigned Monday at a breakneck clip, hoping to reel in the 
undecided voters who could mean the difference between victory and defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also released his campaign's final commercial. "It's time for a new 
beginning. A new generation of leaders, a new vision for our country," 
Huffington says in the commercial, which shows images of him and his family. 
"Do we dare break trust with our children and leave them a country that has 
lost direction? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running for Senate to change the system, to make it work for you -- not 
the special interests. And to restore the values of faith, family, hard work 
and responsibility that have made this country great. I'm Mike Huffington and I 
need your vote," he says in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his election eve appearances, including a big rally in San Diego 
with Gov. Pete Wilson, Huffington attacked Feinstein's record and promised that 
if elected he would move to cut the federal bureaucracy to make it more 
efficient and responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 After morning rallies with supporters in San Luis Obispo and Redding, 
Huffington told reporters in Sacramento that his efforts at a meaningful debate 
with Feinstein have been foiled by her negative campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "For months, I talked about the issues, such as higher taxes, higher spending. 
. . . I've talked about defense, defense cuts. . . . I've talked about crime, 
the fact I was chairman of the 'three strikes and you're out' (initiative)," he 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein, Huffington charged, has talked only about his nanny and other 
issues irrelevant to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Feinstein has lied, lied, lied, lied, lied," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he owes no state taxes, took responsibility for the nanny and 
did not have a racially restrictive covenant deed on his house, as claimed by 
Feinstein. The senator, he charged, forged the document that she claimed 
implicated him on the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Feinstein's own illegal immigrant problem, Huffington urged the senator 
to ask President Clinton to clear the INS to release all relevant documents in 
the case. He said he believed that a 1993 letter written by Feinstein would 
confirm his charge that she knew that the housekeeper she had employed a decade 
earlier was an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Feinstein's character is on the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Monday, Huffington's campaign held a teleconference where a person 
purporting to work for the INS claimed to have seen a 1988 letter -- disavowed 
by Feinstein -- that indicates that the senator knew her former housekeeper had 
immigration problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Van Nuys Airport -- one of his last campaign stops of the day -- 
Huffington said he agreed with predictions of a strong voter turnout but 
downplayed the assumption that that would be good news for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I foresee a lot of people coming out to vote for me who otherwise wouldn't 
have voted," he said.

DISNEY STORES CHIEF TO RULE MAGIC KINGDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ushering in a new generation of leadership, Walt Disney Co. announced Monday 
that the head of its Disney Stores division has been appointed president of 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pressler, who joined Disney in 1987, also will be in charge of the 
Disneyland Hotel and other resort venues in Anaheim, including the planned 
$3-billion Disneyland Resort. The 38-year-old executive's promotion marks the 
first time since Disneyland opened in 1955 that park operations will be 
commanded by someone other than a protege of founder Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner said supporters of the expansion 
"should be encouraged" by Pressler's promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are connected at the hip to Anaheim," Eisner said. "I decided to put one 
of our best people there to get done what has to get done." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that even though Pressler comes from the retail side of the 
corporation and not the park side, Pressler is a "star executive" within the 
company. "He has impressed me and the company in many different areas," Eisner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler's promotion continues two Disney corporate customs: promoting from 
within and moving people up several rungs on the corporate ladder at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Within Disney, Pressler is known for his aggressive expansion of the 
successful Disney Stores empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm terribly excited," said Pressler, whose official title will be president 
of Disneyland Resort. "I think it's going to be a tremendous decade for 
Disneyland. In a lot of ways I'm in awe because I'll be in the house that Walt 
built." 
</P>
<P>
 James C. Goss, who follows Disney for the brokerage Duff & Phelps in Chicago, 
said the selection of Pressler shows that the company is putting Disneyland's 
future growth in the hands of someone who has engineered vigorous growth in 
another part of the Disney kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're trying to expand the park, that may be a different challenge than 
managing what's already there," Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler takes over at a time when many Orange County political and business 
leaders are concerned about the direction of the aging theme park and Disney's 
commitment to its much-delayed expansion, which would include 1,800 new hotel 
rooms, a shopping district and a second theme park called Westcot. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler, who fills the vacancy left last year by the retirement of Jack L. 
Lindquist, was promoted over other high-level park executives, including Norm 
Doerges, executive vice president of park operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul is a talented, creative business executive," Eisner said. "He is 
fiscally sophisticated, he nurtures great ideas, and he knows how to see them 
through. I know that Disneyland will thrive under his leadership. He is one of 
the many talented young executives at the Walt Disney Co." 
</P>
<P>
 As president of the Disney Stores, Pressler was responsible for their overall 
operation and business strategy. Under his leadership, the stores grew from 160 
to 335 in eight countries. And, Disney officials said, there are plans to 
increase that number to more than 600. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul's expertise as a strategic thinker, marketer and operator, combined with 
his entertainment sense and knowledge of Disney, gives us the perfect executive 
to grow our West Coast attractions and lead them into the next century," said 
Judson Green, president of Walt Disney Attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly pronounced the selection of Pressler as good news for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another indication that the Disney company views Disneyland and 
everything around as a true resort area," Daly said. "I think it's a very 
positive message." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, to some city and business officials in area, who cultivated close 
relationships with the Walt-era leaders, Pressler is relatively unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is he?" asked Councilman Irv Pickler. "It's a new name to me. We all knew 
that change was coming, and they seem to be going to the younger core. I guess 
it's the end of an era." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob D. Simpson said, "I've never heard of the guy in my entire 
life." Simpson said his "biggest surprise is that it's not somebody from within 
Disneyland. I'm not trying to second-guess Mr. Eisner, but I thought it would 
be somebody from within the ranks of the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Green said that although Pressler does not come from the park side of the 
corporation, he is "very aware of the Disney Culture" and has tremendous 
"entrepreneur instincts" that will help move the resort project along. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his accomplishments, Green said, was last week's opening of the first 
Disney Gallery, in MainPlace/Santa Ana mall. The store sells upscale Disney 
arts and memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the gallery works, they want to expand it pretty aggressively," analyst 
Goss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressler, who lives in Pacific Palisades, is a New York native and father of 
two who joined Disney in 1987 as senior vice president of Disney Licensing and 
became senior vice president of Consumer Products before moving to Disney 
Stores as executive vice president and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to his Disney employment, he had been vice president of marketing and 
design for Kenner-Parker Toys from 1982 to 1987. Paul Pressler

TRIAL IN FATAL DOWNING HAS WIDE IMPACT FOR MILITARY; DEFENSE: FRIENDLY FIRE 
DEATHS OF 26 IN IRAQ HAUNT THE ARMED FORCES. MANY SAY THE PENTAGON IS BEING 
OVERZEALOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 For Lt. Col. Randy W. May, a career U.S. Air Force pilot, who in the flicker 
of a moment made a tragic mistake and shot down a U.S. helicopter over Iraq 
last spring, the legal case that opened in Germany on Monday could mean 
dismissal from the service and 26 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 For American servicemen and women around the globe, the case carries equally 
profound consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 May, a decorated Air Force flier with almost 20 years of service to his 
country, is charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide for mistakenly 
blasting one of two helicopters in the no-fly zone over Iraq earlier this year. 
Twenty-six people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Public outrage was intense. The Pentagon vowed to bring those responsible to 
justice, arguing that such strong measures were necessary to uphold the high 
standards of military professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 With the armed forces continuing to shrink, competition for military jobs is 
growing fierce. Like many private businesses, the Pentagon is seeking to show 
that it has no room for incompetence and will no longer tolerate those who 
blunder, no matter how innocently. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the military believe that May is being overzealously prosecuted by 
a Pentagon too eager to boost its public image. They worry that if the military 
continues to take such unprecedented hard lines against friendly fire mistakes, 
troops will be reluctant to take risks or act aggressively in combat situations 
for fear of being second-guessed. Their hesitation, in turn, could lead to loss 
of life from enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Combat fighter pilots are a very close group," said John Norton of Las Vegas, 
a retired Army pilot from the Vietnam War era who is trying to raise a legal 
defense fund for May. "And if you see somebody get creamed for a mistake such 
as his, you're going to be hesitant in everything you do in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McMonagle, a former soldier imprisoned for more than three years for 
mistakenly shooting a civilian during the 1989 invasion of Panama, said that 
military leaders are eager to pass the buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone makes a mistake anymore, they put it on the lowest ranking guy," 
McMonagle said. "Someone has to be the scapegoat. They know the American public 
will be outraged over what happened, so they just throw it on somebody else. It 
shows they are cowards." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Gen. David Brahms, once the Marine Corps' top attorney, said that the 
harsh penalty May is facing is indicative of a new "zero-defect mentality" in 
the military. 
</P>
<P>
 As the armed services grow smaller, he said, Pentagon leaders expect the 
caliber of its members to rise. They also are pushing a public persona of being 
tougher on soldiers who trip up. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "friendly fire" is becoming an oxymoron, he said. "I'm absolutely 
certain that in the 1990s, if they find any reasonable basis for faulting 
anyone, they're going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of guts to stand up and say to the next of kin that, 'look, 
there are mistakes and problems, but this is the price of freedom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, mid-level military commanders, concerned about their own 
career advancement, are less willing to defend subordinates, and that in turn 
creates a "chilling effect" on the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more you see that every minor mistake tends to be magnified and 
memorialized," he said. "People who make mistakes in today's Army don't stay 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 No one, least of all May, is dismissing his case as minor. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, he and another pilot, Capt. Eric A. Wickson, shot down two U.S. 
Army Black Hawk helicopters that they thought were Iraqi Hinds violating a 
no-fly zone over Iraq. Killed were 15 U.S. citizens, five Kurds working for the 
United States and six military officials from Britain, France and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall, the service's highest civilian authority, 
said in an interview that May is not being singled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith in the people making these calls," Widnall said. "They hold to a 
high state of professionalism. And the decision to shoot down any aircraft at 
any time is always a very serious matter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that she does not believe "this has a chilling effect" on others 
in the military. Rather, she said, the accident will get a full public airing, 
and others in the armed forces will be able to decide for themselves whether 
any of the accused were being prosecuted unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Oelrich, a national defense consultant in Washington who last year wrote 
a report for Congress' Office of Technology Assessment on friendly fire cases 
in the Persian Gulf War, said that military leaders handling friendly fire 
cases are correct in weighing their potential for undermining public goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American public is extremely cautious about military intervention," he 
said. "So you can imagine how tough they're going to be on mistakes. One 
accident and public support can vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walk the halls of the Pentagon. Talk to officers. They know how thin public 
support for military intervention is and how it can evaporate very quickly if 
there are unnecessary losses." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to May, five members of a U.S. Airborne Warning and Control System 
crew were charged with various counts of dereliction of duty and could be 
dismissed if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, three of the AWACS crew members were given hearings at Tinker Air 
Force Base in Oklahoma, and a decision is pending on whether they should be 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others waived their rights to preliminary hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wickson, who has not been charged in the incident, testified against the AWACS 
officers and bolstered the Air Force's allegations that they failed to properly 
notify the F-15 pilots that the helicopters were friendly aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 May's preliminary hearing began Monday at the U.S. Air Force base in Sembach, 
Germany. Unlike the Tinker hearings, May's proceedings are closed to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force prosecutors declined to comment, but May's defense attorney, Capt. 
Earl Martin, said in a telephone interview that he does not expect the hearing 
to lead to a court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin suggested that the AWACS crew sent erroneous information to May that 
the Black Hawks were hostile aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to put the case and the event itself in its proper 
perspective," Martin said. "We're going to show that the mistake made by Col. 
May and the flight lead (Wickson) was indeed the final mistake in a long line 
of errors. And each of these errors played a very significant role in this 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 For May's part, the mission was one of more than a dozen he has flown over the 
no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, during Operation Desert Storm against Iraq, he downed an Iraqi Hind in 
the same area and received a Distinguished Flying Cross for his "professional 
competence, aerial skill and devotion to duty." 
</P>
<P>
 May declined to be interviewed about the pending charges. But in a statement, 
he strongly denied any purposeful negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission we flew was not conducted haphazardly but was performed in a 
disciplined manner as planned and briefed," he said. "Human error did occur and 
it resulted in a fatal mistake which will never leave my thoughts."

WILSON AND BROWN CAP LONG, GRUELING RACE; POLITICS: CONFIDENT GOVERNOR 
CAMPAIGNS FOR FELLOW REPUBLICANS. OPPONENT PRESSES FOR DEFEAT OF PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The long and often contentious battle for governor ended Monday with Democrat 
Kathleen Brown urging Californians to cast aside the negativity and 
divisiveness she said was symbolized by Gov. Pete Wilson, and the Republican 
incumbent asking voters to give him four more years to lead a sprawling and 
troubled state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, while maintaining a cautious public visage, was confident enough to 
spend the day before the election campaigning for other Republicans, stopping 
off in several key legislative districts to help buttress get-out-the-vote 
efforts and taking along with him members of the state GOP ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal campaigning followed a $525,000 donation from Wilson's campaign 
treasury to a united Republican effort that bought television commercials on 
behalf of several party candidates -- a gesture which also underscored Wilson's 
belief that his own victory is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 So confident was the governor at a Bellflower rally that he did not even 
mention Brown's name, instead firing at President Clinton as though he were 
Wilson's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor specifically slammed Clinton for opposing controversial 
Proposition 187, which would deny public education and non-emergency state 
services to illegal immigrants. Clinton campaigned against the measure -- and 
for state Democratic candidates -- Friday in Los Angeles and Saturday in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's attack was laced with the kind of rhetoric that Democrats often have 
used this year against the governor himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has given us a new reason for California to distrust him: Anyone 
who will stoop so low as to deliberately be a demagogue and inject race into a 
proposition that is instead about fairness -- that we do not need," the 
governor said in Bellflower at the second of four rallies that culminated in 
his traditional election eve party in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, spent most of her day pressing voters to turn back 
Proposition 187 and its most prominent supporter, Wilson. As she has in recent 
weeks, Brown exuded a new-found assurance and drew the cheers of hundreds of 
supporters at each of her stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the most marvelous opportunity . . . to send a message that says we 
understand that in diversity is our strength and in unity we will find power," 
Brown declared at an open-air rally held under cloudy skies at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These politicians who have the gall to repeat our history," she said, 
referring to past incidents of discrimination against ethnic groups in 
California, "will feel our wrath because we will say no to them and we will say 
no to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Brown capped her campaign on a surreal note, being pelted 
with catcalls as she appeared live on the "Geraldo" television show to lobby 
against the anti-illegal immigration proposition. She later described the 
interlude as "wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what Proposition 187 unleashes," she said. "It unleashes anger and 
passion. It unleashes them in a way that I think is risky for California." 
</P>
<P>
 For both candidates, Monday was the final exhausting day of years-long efforts 
to capture the governor's office, grueling enough to make victory especially 
sweet to whoever manages to win today. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they had collected more than $47.5 million in donations by Oct. 22 
-- before additional millions were spent on television ads -- and they have 
spent virtually all of it. In Brown's case, she apparently has spent herself 
into debt, and a lack of money forced her to take commercials off the air over 
the weekend. She had only a small presence on the airwaves on Monday, campaign 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, a victory today would cap a remarkable come-back that began more 
than a year ago when he was more than 20 points down in the polls, blamed by 
voters for the state's foundering economy and a sense of foreboding about 
California's once-limitless future. Victory would place him on the short list 
for Republican presidential candidates for 1996 -- a race he said he will not 
enter, even if he did sound surprisingly like a Clinton opponent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown success would make her the third star in a family triumvirate 
unprecedented in American politics, joining her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr., and her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., as occupants of the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It would vault her into national political orbit as well, and mean that she 
achieved the prize under the most difficult of circumstances, with a 
come-from-behind win over a crafty and well-financed incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson closed out his campaign with appearances in key legislative districts 
in San Jose, Bellflower, Orange County and San Diego. In Bellflower, where he 
sought to hike the chances of Republican Assembly candidate Phil Hawkins, he 
was greeted with chants of "Pete, Pete!" and "Four more years!" 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's address there was crafted, in his words, to "run up the score" 
against Democrats. He went so far as to suggest that "enlightened Democrats" 
change parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a particular message for those who are Democrats," he said. "You are 
welcome. You are welcome not just in this headquarters, you are welcome in this 
party because in fact there are a lot of right-thinking Democrats who reject 
the kind of liberal nonsense which for two decades has cost California dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has meant that instead of being a safe and civilized society, we've had 
people not safe in their own homes and their own places of work. That is 
dangerous nonsense and we are going to end it. And we are going to continue the 
change that we have begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson joked later that Clinton "seems obsessed about California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I predict that he will lose it in 1996," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown traveled to two college rallies, and closed out her final day of more 
than two years of campaigning with a visit to a Reseda Jewish home for the 
aging and the appearance on "Geraldo." In between the events, she chatted with 
talk show hosts in seven California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 To one, she expressed optimism about today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle goes well," she said. "I feel very positive. It is too close to 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Geraldo" show, among other things, tested Brown's calm under fire as the 
treasurer was insulted right and left during the program. It got so bad at one 
point that host Geraldo Rivera cautioned, "This is a debate. This is not a 
rumble." 
</P>
<P>
 One white man rose and told Brown his son-in-law was denied a job as a police 
officer because he does not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about discrimination, Kathleen! What are you going to do about it?" he 
screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown told the audience that she believes illegal immigrants come to 
California for jobs -- and thus sanctions against their employers would be 
helpful -- some screamed, "Welfare, welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "Proposition 187 simply unleashes these emotions that are very 
hard to put back into the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, at calmer venues, Brown continued her effort to persuade 
voters that Wilson represents a negative approach to governing, and that his 
endorsement of Proposition 187 has emotionally split the state that both of 
them wish to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so tired of politicians who play on hate, who play on fear, who play on 
frustration," she said. "We will prevail tomorrow and we will take back 
California." Inside the Ads 
</P>
<P>
 GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown ran two final television 
commercials Monday dealing with her Republican opponent, Gov. Pete Wilson, and 
Proposition 187, the controversial ballot measure Wilson supports that would 
deny state-financed health, education and social benefits to foreign nationals 
living in California illegally. Brown opposes the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS: 
</P>
<P>
 One ad urges voters to take a second look "at the politician behind" 
Proposition 187. It says that as a U.S. senator, Wilson "took $600,000 (from) 
corporations that wanted illegal labor, then protected them from INS raids." 
The commercial goes on to allege that Wilson voted to make Californians finance 
health care for illegal immigrants and "wrote the law that let 1.3 million 
illegals across the border." ' A number of the statements are credited to an 
article in the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 The second ad contends that "Pete Wilson has a scary plan" to force all 
Americans to carry "mandatory" ID cards. It says Wilson wants doctors, nurses 
and teachers to turn in students who do not have cards "and neighbors to report 
on neighbors." The commercial continues: "Brown says Wilson's ID cards are 
un-American." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has made Proposition 187 a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, but 
was not an originator of the initiative. The Mercury News article said Wilson 
election committees received $600,000 in campaign contributions from 
agribusinesses and other interests that may have benefited from low-cost 
foreign workers. Wilson sponsored legislation in 1986 that provided for the 
legal entry of foreign farm workers, but also required them to return to their 
home countries. The bill was amended in the U.S. House to allow them to achieve 
legal residence -- a provision Wilson now says he opposed, but was forced to 
accept. The law allowed about 1.3 million immigrants to work in the United 
States, about half of them in California. They did not enter the country 
illegally. Since 1990, when Wilson said that his amendment assured California 
growers a continuing supply of legal workers to harvest crops, Wilson has 
become a sharp critic of the costs to the state of illegal immigrants. Wilson 
says his position has evolved as more and more illegal immigrants have come 
into California and the cost of providing services to them has increased, in 
part because of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the second ad, the idea of some sort of a national identification card 
has been proposed for a variety of uses over the years and generally was 
opposed by civil libertarians as smacking too much of a police state. Wilson 
has said, however, that some sort of identification system would be required if 
Proposition 187 passed because only legal residents of the United States would 
be eligible for non-emergency health care, public schooling and other social 
services. Wilson once answered that everyone would have to carry an ID card, 
but later said he had not heard the word "carry" in the question. He then said 
everyone would have to have a card, but would only need to possess it on 
occasions such as applying for a job or being admitted to a school. Brown has 
said that everyone must have a "tamper-proof" Social Security card to present 
as evidence of citizenship or legal residence when applying for a job. Wilson 
has insisted that he does not "want" doctors, teachers and others to turn in 
suspected illegal residents. However, the language of the initiative would 
require those officials to report an illegal immigrant or suspected illegal 
immigrant to authorities. The initiative itself does not establish an 
identification card or other means of identity, but says verification of legal 
status "may include, but shall not be limited to, questioning the person 
regarding his or her date and place of birth, and entry into the United States, 
and demanding documentation to indicate his or her legal status." The proposed 
law requires certain officials to report suspected illegal immigrants to 
authorities in the course of their jobs, but says nothing about requiring 
"neighbors to report neighbors."

 SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington released a new television 
commercial late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial features Huffington speaking to a camera. He says, "It's time 
for a new beginning. A new generation of leaders, a new vision for our country. 
Do we dare break trust with our children and leave them a country that has lost 
direction? I'm running for Senate to change the system, to make it work for you 
-- not the special interests. And to restore the values of faith, family, hard 
work and responsibility that have made this country great. I'm Mike Huffington 
and I need your vote." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers say it is rare for a candidate to release a new commercial 
on election eve. This one continues a theme that Huffington has tried to 
emphasize on television in the last week, offering voters a brief vision of the 
candidate's hopes and concerns. The Senate race has been dominated by nasty 
attack television commercials in which both candidates have tried to tell 
voters why they should not support their opponent. This new ad seeks to give 
voters a reason to favor Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, the Republican candidate for insurance 
commissioner, began airing a new television commercial at the end of last week. 
Most of the ad is devoted to criticism of Sen. Art Torres, the Democrat in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Quackenbush. In the Legislature, he authored the "insurance consumers' 
bill of rights" and as insurance commissioner, he'll enforce it. His opponent, 
Art Torres, 20 years in the Legislature. He's the king of special interests, 
lavish travel paid for by lobbyists. And he's taken hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from unions and criminal defense lawyers. He's taken over $200,000 from 
insurance industry sources. After he said he wouldn't. For insurance 
commissioner, the choice is clear." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush's bill for an ombudsman -- a consumer watchdog -- in the state 
Insurance Department died in committee. When Torres sponsored a separate 
ombudsman bill, Quackenbush voted against it. It was vetoed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson. Quackenbush says he will have an ombudsman with or without legislation. 
Torres says that without legislation, there is no money for one in the 
departmental budget. The Quackenbush campaign says Torres received $231,000 in 
gifts, travel and speaking engagement honorariums over a 17-year period in the 
Legislature, or a little less than $13,600 a year. This does not make Torres 
"the king of special interests," since others have received more. As for 
contributions from unions, it is common for Democrats such as Torres to receive 
contributions from unions, which in any case are not regulated by the insurance 
commissioner. The charge that contributions come from "criminal defense 
lawyers" refers to "California Trial Lawyers," campaign aides say. Trial 
lawyers, in fact, are generally plaintiffs' lawyers and not criminal defense 
attorneys. The Torres campaign acknowledges that it has accepted more than 
$200,000 from "insurance industry sources," but points out that almost all the 
money comes from lawyers and others who are not regulated by the department. 
What the Quackenbush ad does not mention is that Quackenbush has received at 
least $2 million in industry money, and mainly from insurance companies, agents 
and brokers, who are regulated by the commissioner. Political Scorecard

O.C. RESIDENTS PAY NATION'S HIGHEST RENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renters pay more in Orange County than in any other major metropolitan area in 
the nation, according to a Census Bureau study released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At $790 a month, the median rent here took a 29% bite out of average household 
earnings, according to census figures. And it was $12 more than in the upscale 
Nassau-Suffolk area of Long Island, N.Y., which came in at No. 2, and $164 more 
than in Los Angeles, ranked fourth. The figures include apartments and houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we'd probably prefer not to be No. 1 in," said Ken Moore, 
president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, though he quickly added, 
"There is a wonderful quality of life in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau study confirmed what housing analysts and renters have 
thought for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me," said Bill Gayk, Orange County's demographer. "Orange 
County has had the reputation. Housing has tended to be much more expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau study used data from the 1990 census. Rents in Orange County 
have changed little during the recession and regional housing slump that have 
occurred since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Gobar, a housing economist in Fullerton, said that if people are paying 
more than 27% of their household income for rent, "they're being strained." 
</P>
<P>
 Gobar said rents in Orange County have historically been high because the 
property on which apartments are built has been expensive. Since the recession 
of the 1990s, he said, land prices have fallen dramatically, which is one 
reason rents have not gone up in recent years. But incomes haven't risen much 
either, figures show, which means that the affordability index is not likely to 
have changed significantly in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The census study did not break down figures for cities within Orange County, 
but a recent survey by Research Network of Laguna Hills shows that Seal Beach 
has the most expensive rents, averaging $1,319 a month, with Newport Beach 
second at $1,010 and Irvine third at about $960. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 Census found about 330,000 households renting in Orange County, 
compared to about 497,000 in owner-occupied properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Salazar, who works for a public relations firm in Tustin, says high 
apartment rents are why she shares a house with two others in Irvine. "Oh, God, 
I think they're very high. I would love to rent an apartment," she said, if she 
could afford to do so on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Census Bureau study looked at the median rents for 46 metropolitan areas 
of 1 million or more people. (The median is the middle number in a series, with 
as many numbers above it as below.) The study found that there were only two 
other areas with median rents above San Jose at $773 and San Francisco at $709. 
</P>
<P>
 The area with the lowest rent was Pittsburgh, at $366 a month, followed 
closely by Cincinnati, $367, and Salt Lake City, $379. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the median rent was $447 in 1990, said Myra Washington, the 
statistician who put together the report. That was up from $243 in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new Census study also ranked the large metropolitan areas by how much of a 
renter's household income went for shelter -- a kind of affordability index in 
which Orange County and other California areas were near the top of the chart. 
</P>
<P>
 In that category, Miami was ranked No. 1. Renters there were spending 31.3% of 
their household income for rent and utility costs. The study used income data 
for 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego area was second, with rental costs accounting for 29.8% of 
household income. That was followed by Riverside-San Bernardino, 29.7%; then 
Los Angeles-Long Beach, 29.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's 29% figure put the area at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. metropolitan area with the lowest percentage of income going for rent 
was Houston, with a figure of just 23.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide for all renters, 26.4% of household income went to the landlord in 
1990. That was up from 25% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>

BIDDING WAR OVER TAX CUTS SEEN AS LIKELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter which party controls Congress after today's elections, Washington 
appears poised for an expensive bidding war over middle-class and business tax 
cuts. And Clinton Administration officials and outside analysts are warning 
that if the bidding gets out of control, the nation could lose control of the 
federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 To address the economic frustration expressed by many middle-class Americans, 
Democrats and Republicans alike seem certain to introduce an array of tax-cut 
plans in the next few months to relieve the tax burden on working families with 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Republicans are now vowing to push for big new tax cuts for 
business as well as a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax, and Democrats 
may quickly follow suit with their own proposed tax breaks for business. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, if Republicans gain control of either the Senate or the House, 
the conservative wing of the party almost certainly will push aggressively for 
even sharper individual and corporate tax cuts rooted in "supply side" economic 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Those cuts in turn could open the door for Democrats to call for still deeper 
cuts in a contest to see which party can outdo the other -- returning American 
economic policy to the heady days of the early Ronald Reagan era, when tax cuts 
led to massive increases in the budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican control of the House would mean that Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) 
would become chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, while Rep. 
Dick Armey (R-Tex.), an advocate of supply-side economics, would be in position 
to become House majority leader. Archer and Armey said in interviews Monday 
that they believe their party will push hard for both a capital gains tax cut 
and broad reductions in middle-class taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The result could be intense pressure on the budget constraints imposed in last 
year's deficit-reduction plan, which generally requires offsetting any tax cuts 
with cuts in spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts believe that those budget limits ultimately would stop tax 
cutting from getting out of control and Administration officials stressed that 
the White House will not propose any tax-cut plan that busts the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not do anything that is not fully paid for under the President's 
deficit-reduction package," said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who chairs the Council 
of Economic Advisers at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a strong anti-incumbent tide in the elections could wipe away such 
constraints. When tax-cut fever strikes, it is likely to strike equally in both 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Democrats and Republicans in Congress rapidly expanded the Reagan 
corporate and individual tax-cut proposals. Indeed, Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen, then a Democratic senator from Texas, was a prime mover in expanding 
the Reagan tax bill to provide more corporate tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House may even set the stage for a new round of tax-cutting. 
While the Administration has been criticizing Republicans for issuing 
outlandish campaign promises on economic policy, officials have been quietly 
working on their own proposals for a middle-class tax cut -- though they 
stressed that no decisions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton does push for a tax cut next year, Administration officials and 
outside analysts said that it most likely will be a per-child tax credit for 
moderate-income families, which he proposed during his 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Shapiro, an economist at the Progressive Policy Institute and a former 
campaign adviser to Clinton, calculated that the Administration could offer a 
$325 per child tax credit for families earning less than $50,000 a year and pay 
for it with $12 billion in cuts in tax subsidies for industry and special 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of tax cut for working families appeals to Clinton and his political 
advisers, who believe it is important to live up to his 1992 promise to ease 
the tax burden on the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen would like to combine a tax credit for children with an expansion of 
tax benefits from individual retirement accounts -- a proposal echoed by 
conservative Republicans.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, many senior Administration economic policy-makers are not sure that 
they can persuade Congress to cut spending enough to pay for such broad tax 
cuts without eroding the Administration's commitment to deficit reduction. 
Still other liberal advisers would like to see any money earmarked for a tax 
cut go instead to fund Clinton's "investment" agenda, such as job training and 
education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers in both parties increasingly acknowledge that they are chafing under 
budget constraints and would like to modify them so that they can cut taxes and 
increase spending. 
</P>
<P>
 House Appropriations Committee Chairman David R. Obey (D-Wis.), for example, 
plans to reintroduce legislation early next year that would give the President 
the right to suspend the budget rules whenever the economy begins to lag so 
that taxes can be cut for low- and middle-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Armey said that if the Republicans take control of the House and Senate, the 
party will quickly fire Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional 
Budget Office who is a hawk on deficit reduction, and install a director who 
will accept supply-side economic theory. 
</P>
<P>
 A sympathetic CBO director would be important to Republicans, because the 
office issues the official budget rules to determine whether changes in tax law 
will increase the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 A supply-side director almost certainly would rule that tax cuts would 
increase federal revenues -- and thus would not worsen the deficit.

COWLINGS WON'T BE PROSECUTED, D.A. DECIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Cowlings, O.J. Simpson's best friend who was at the wheel during the famous 
low-speed pursuit preceding the football great's arrest, will not be prosecuted 
for his role in the flight, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-line statement, prosecutors explained that "the evidence available to 
us at this time is insufficient to warrant prosecution" of Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested on suspicion of aiding a fugitive on the same day as Simpson's 
capture, and a grand jury has exhaustively examined witnesses in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings and Simpson disappeared on the afternoon of June 17, minutes before 
police arrived at the Encino home of Robert Kardashian, another friend of 
Simpson, to take the celebrity athlete into custody on charges of killing his 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman.  
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings and Simpson were spotted late that afternoon headed north on 
Interstate 5 in Orange County and led police on a slow chase back to Simpson's 
Brentwood home. As an estimated 95 million people watched on live television, 
Los Angeles Police Department SWAT officers talked to Simpson over a cellular 
phone, persuading him to put down a loaded pistol and give himself up. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later recovered about $8,000 and Simpson's passport from the white Ford 
Bronco in which the two men were traveling. Simpson's lawyers have said it was 
not unusual for him to carry large amounts of cash; they have added that at the 
time, Simpson was distraught and contemplating suicide, and gave the money to 
Cowlings with instructions that he use it to care for Simpson's two young 
children after his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources close to the former football player have said his passport was 
in the vehicle because he had gathered some personal papers, including the 
document, in preparation for his surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Re, Cowlings' attorney, said he was pleased by the decision not to 
prosecute his client, which had been anticipated but not made official until 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's entirely appropriate that they not charge this man," Re said. 
"I'm glad that they finally came to that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Re said the threat of charges has been distracting to Cowlings, whose 
intention all along has only been to help his lifelong friend. In fact, Re has 
said, Cowlings' overriding concern on the day of the pursuit was to prevent 
Simpson from harming himself. Cowlngs' main objective now, the lawyer added, 
will be to help Simpson battle the murder charges that could send him to prison 
for the rest of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Cowlings investigation effectively concluded, one of the prosecutors 
handling it, Christopher A. Darden, will shift to the Simpson case, becoming 
the sixth deputy district attorney to join the government team. 
</P>
<P>
 Darden, 38, is considered one of the office's most highly regarded 
prosecutors: He has taken 19 homicide cases to juries and has handled a number 
of delicate police investigations.

WILSON AND BROWN CAP LONG, GRUELING RACE; POLITICS: CONFIDENT GOVERNOR 
CAMPAIGNS FOR FELLOW REPUBLICANS. OPPONENT PRESSES FOR DEFEAT OF PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The long and often contentious battle for governor ended Monday with Democrat 
Kathleen Brown urging Californians to cast aside the negativity and 
divisiveness she said was symbolized by Gov. Pete Wilson, and the Republican 
incumbent asking voters to give him four more years to lead a sprawling and 
troubled state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, while maintaining a cautious public visage, was confident enough to 
spend the day before the election campaigning for other Republicans, stopping 
off in several key legislative districts to help buttress get-out-the-vote 
efforts and taking along with him members of the state GOP ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal campaigning followed a $525,000 donation from Wilson's campaign 
treasury to a united Republican effort that bought television commercials on 
behalf of several party candidates -- underscoring Wilson's belief that his own 
victory is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 So confident was the governor at several rallies that he did not even mention 
Brown's name, instead firing at President Clinton as though he were Wilson's 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor specifically slammed Clinton for opposing Proposition 187, which 
would deny public education and non-emergency state services to illegal 
immigrants. Clinton campaigned against the measure -- and for state Democratic 
candidates -- Friday in Los Angeles and Saturday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have seen the President come out and pretend he's doing an adequate 
job on illegal immigration," Wilson told a rally at the Newport Harbor 
Republican Women's Headquarters in Newport Beach. Washington, he said "is 
sticking California for the cost of their failure of controlling the border." 
</P>
<P>
 At a later rally in Bellflower, Wilson's attack was laced with the kind of 
rhetoric that Democrats often have used this year against the governor himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Clinton) has given us a new reason for California to distrust him: 
Anyone who will stoop so low as to deliberately be a demagogue and inject race 
into a proposition that is instead about fairness -- that we do not need," the 
governor said in Bellflower, at the second of four rallies that culminated in 
his traditional election eve party in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, spent most of her day pressing voters to turn back 
Proposition 187 and its most prominent supporter, Wilson. As she has in recent 
weeks, Brown exuded a new-found assurance and drew cheers at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the most marvelous opportunity . . . to send a message that says we 
understand that in diversity is our strength and in unity we will find power," 
Brown declared at an open-air rally at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These politicians who have the gall to repeat our history," she said, 
referring to past incidents of discrimination against ethnic groups in 
California, "will feel our wrath because we will say no to them and we will say 
no to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Brown capped her campaign on a surreal note, being pelted 
with catcalls as she appeared live on the "Geraldo" television show to lobby 
against Proposition 187. She later described the interlude as "wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what Proposition 187 unleashes," she said. "It unleashes anger and 
passion. It unleashes them in a way that I think is risky for California." 
</P>
<P>
 For both candidates, Monday was the final exhausting day of years-long efforts 
to capture the governor's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Together, they had collected more than $47.5 million in donations by Oct. 22 
-- before additional millions were spent on television ads -- and they have 
spent virtually all of it. In Brown's case, she apparently has spent herself 
into debt, and a lack of money forced her to take commercials off the air over 
the weekend. She had only a small presence on the airwaves on Monday, campaign 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, a victory today would cap a remarkable come-back that began more 
than a year ago when he was more than 20 points down in the polls, blamed by 
voters for the state's foundering economy and a sense of foreboding about 
California's once-limitless future. Victory would place him on the short list 
for Republican presidential candidates for 1996 -- a race he said he will not 
enter, even if he did sound surprisingly like a Clinton opponent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown success would make her the third star in a family triumvirate 
unprecedented in American politics, joining her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr., and her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., as occupants of the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It would vault her into national political orbit as well, and mean that she 
achieved the prize under the most difficult of circumstances, with a 
come-from-behind win over a crafty and well-financed incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson closed out his campaign with appearances in key legislative districts 
in San Jose, Bellflower, Orange County and San Diego. In Bellflower, where he 
sought to hike the chances of Republican Assembly candidate Phil Hawkins, he 
was greeted with chants of "Pete, Pete!" and "Four more years!" 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's address there was crafted, in his words, to "run up the score" 
against Democrats. He went so far as to suggest that "enlightened Democrats" 
change parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a particular message for those who are Democrats," he said. "You are 
welcome. You are welcome not just in this headquarters, you are welcome in this 
party because in fact there are a lot of right-thinking Democrats who reject 
the kind of liberal nonsense which for two decades has cost California dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has meant that instead of being a safe and civilized society, we've had 
people not safe in their own homes and their own places of work. That is 
dangerous nonsense and we are going to end it. And we are going to continue the 
change that we have begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson joked later that Clinton "seems obsessed about California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I predict that he will lose it in 1996," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown traveled to two college rallies, and closed out her final day of more 
than two years of campaigning with a visit to a Reseda Jewish home for the 
aging and the "Geraldo" appearance. In between the events, she chatted with 
talk show hosts in seven California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 To one, she expressed optimism about today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle goes well," she said. "I feel very positive. It is too close to 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Geraldo" show, among other things, tested Brown's calm under fire as the 
treasurer was insulted right and left during the program. It got so bad at one 
point that host Geraldo Rivera cautioned, "This is a debate. This is not a 
rumble." 
</P>
<P>
 One white man rose and told Brown his son-in-law was denied a job as a police 
officer because he does not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about discrimination, Kathleen! What are you going to do about it?" he 
screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown told the audience that she believes illegal immigrants come to 
California for jobs -- and thus sanctions against their employers would be 
helpful -- some screamed, "Welfare, welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "Proposition 187 simply unleashes these emotions that are very 
hard to put back into the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, at calmer venues, Brown continued her effort to persuade 
voters that Wilson represents a negative approach to governing, and that his 
endorsement of Proposition 187 has emotionally split the state.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so tired of politicians who play on hate, who play on fear, who play on 
frustration," she said. "We will prevail tomorrow and we will take back 
California."

 GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown ran two final television 
commercials Monday dealing with her Republican opponent, Gov. Pete Wilson, and 
Proposition 187, the controversial ballot measure Wilson supports that would 
deny state-financed health, education and social benefits to foreign nationals 
living in California illegally. Brown opposes the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ADS: 
</P>
<P>
 One ad urges voters to take a second look "at the politician behind" 
Proposition 187. It says that as a U.S. senator, Wilson "took $600,000 (from) 
corporations that wanted illegal labor, then protected them from INS raids." 
The commercial goes on to allege that Wilson voted to make Californians finance 
health care for illegal immigrants and "wrote the law that let 1.3 million 
illegals across the border." ' A number of the statements are credited to an 
article in the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
 The second ad contends that "Pete Wilson has a scary plan" to force all 
Americans to carry "mandatory" ID cards. It says Wilson wants doctors, nurses 
and teachers to turn in students who do not have cards "and neighbors to report 
on neighbors." The commercial continues: "Brown says Wilson's ID cards are 
un-American." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has made Proposition 187 a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, but 
was not an originator of the initiative. The Mercury News article said Wilson 
election committees received $600,000 in campaign contributions from 
agribusinesses and other interests that may have benefited from low-cost 
foreign workers. Wilson sponsored legislation in 1986 that provided for the 
legal entry of foreign farm workers, but also required them to return to their 
home countries. The bill was amended in the U.S. House to allow them to achieve 
legal residence -- a provision Wilson now says he opposed, but was forced to 
accept. The law allowed about 1.3 million immigrants to work in the United 
States, about half of them in California. They did not enter the country 
illegally. Since 1990, when Wilson said that his amendment assured California 
growers a continuing supply of legal workers to harvest crops, Wilson has 
become a sharp critic of the costs to the state of illegal immigrants. Wilson 
says his position has evolved as more and more illegal immigrants have come 
into California and the cost of providing services to them has increased, in 
part because of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the second ad, the idea of some sort of a national identification card 
has been proposed for a variety of uses over the years and generally was 
opposed by civil libertarians as smacking too much of a police state. Wilson 
has said, however, that some sort of identification system would be required if 
Proposition 187 passed because only legal residents of the United States would 
be eligible for non-emergency health care, public schooling and other social 
services. Wilson once answered that everyone would have to carry an ID card, 
but later said he had not heard the word "carry" in the question. He then said 
everyone would have to have a card, but would only need to possess it on 
occasions such as applying for a job or being admitted to a school. Brown has 
said that everyone must have a "tamper-proof" Social Security card to present 
as evidence of citizenship or legal residence when applying for a job. Wilson 
has insisted that he does not "want" doctors, teachers and others to turn in 
suspected illegal residents. However, the language of the initiative would 
require those officials to report an illegal immigrant or suspected illegal 
immigrant to authorities. The initiative itself does not establish an 
identification card or other means of identity, but says verification of legal 
status "may include, but shall not be limited to, questioning the person 
regarding his or her date and place of birth, and entry into the United States, 
and demanding documentation to indicate his or her legal status." The proposed 
law requires certain officials to report suspected illegal immigrants to 
authorities in the course of their jobs, but says nothing about requiring 
"neighbors to report neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington released a new television 
commercial late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial features Huffington speaking to a camera. He says, "It's time 
for a new beginning. A new generation of leaders, a new vision for our country. 
Do we dare break trust with our children and leave them a country that has lost 
direction? I'm running for Senate to change the system, to make it work for you 
-- not the special interests. And to restore the values of faith, family, hard 
work and responsibility that have made this country great. I'm Mike Huffington 
and I need your vote." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers say it is rare for a candidate to release a new commercial 
on election eve. This one continues a theme that Huffington has tried to 
emphasize on television in the last week, offering voters a brief vision of the 
candidate's hopes and concerns. The Senate race has been dominated by nasty 
attack television commercials in which both candidates have tried to tell 
voters why they should not support their opponent. This new ad seeks to give 
voters a reason to favor Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 INSURANCE COMMISSIONER 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, the Republican candidate for insurance 
commissioner, began airing a new television commercial at the end of last week. 
Most of the ad is devoted to criticism of Sen. Art Torres, the Democrat in the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck Quackenbush. In the Legislature, he authored the "insurance consumers' 
bill of rights" and as insurance commissioner, he'll enforce it. His opponent, 
Art Torres, 20 years in the Legislature. He's the king of special interests, 
lavish travel paid for by lobbyists. And he's taken hundreds of thousands of 
dollars from unions and criminal defense lawyers. He's taken over $200,000 from 
insurance industry sources. After he said he wouldn't. For insurance 
commissioner, the choice is clear." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush's bill for an ombudsman -- a consumer watchdog -- in the state 
Insurance Department died in committee. When Torres sponsored a separate 
ombudsman bill, Quackenbush voted against it. It was vetoed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson. Quackenbush says he will have an ombudsman with or without legislation. 
Torres says that without legislation, there is no money for one in the 
departmental budget. The Quackenbush campaign says Torres received $231,000 in 
gifts, travel and speaking engagement honorariums over a 17-year period in the 
Legislature, or a little less than $13,600 a year. This does not make Torres 
"the king of special interests," since others have received more. As for 
contributions from unions, it is common for Democrats such as Torres to receive 
contributions from unions, which in any case are not regulated by the insurance 
commissioner. The charge that contributions come from "criminal defense 
lawyers" refers to "California Trial Lawyers," campaign aides say. Trial 
lawyers, in fact, are generally plaintiffs' lawyers and not criminal defense 
attorneys. The Torres campaign acknowledges that it has accepted more than 
$200,000 from "insurance industry sources," but points out that almost all the 
money comes from lawyers and others who are not regulated by the department. 
What the Quackenbush ad does not mention is that Quackenbush has received at 
least $2 million in industry money, and mainly from insurance companies, agents 
and brokers, who are regulated by the commissioner. Political Scorecard

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; TV NETWORK CALLS MOLINA DEMAND FOR AID 
'BLACKMAIL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, the region's most influential 
Latino officeholder, threatened to call for an "immediate boycott" of the 
Spanish-language Telemundo television network and its advertisers if executives 
did not provide a substantial contribution to the campaign against Proposition 
187, it was learned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joaquin F. Blaya, president and chief executive officer of the Miami-based 
Telemundo Group, responded Monday in a letter to Molina, denouncing the 
supervisor's action as a "senseless threat" and "political blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am truly appalled that a public official in the United States has the 
audacity to do something like that," Blaya said Monday evening in a telephone 
interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina, reached at home late Monday, said there was nothing illegal or 
improper about her action and added that she will pursue plans for a boycott 
against Telemundo once the election is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly about it, and anybody who wants to take me to task for 
it can do it," said the supervisor, who has already begun refusing interview 
requests from Telemundo reporters. "They're going to have to face the 
consequences of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What particularly annoyed her, Molina said, was Telemundo's recent "cheap 
shot" at rival Spanish-language network Univision, a major contributor to the 
anti-187 cause. Telemundo last week broadcast the fact that Univision's 
president and chief executive officer, Andrew Jerrold Perenchio, a Hollywood 
investor, kicked in $151,000 to the reelection campaign of Gov. Pete Wilson, 
the chief standard-bearer for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "You allowed petty competition to divide our cause," Molina wrote to the 
Telemundo president in her letter, written on Board of Supervisors stationery 
and sent out on Friday. "I find this action to be an affront to our community." 
</P>
<P>
 But Telemundo's Blaya responded that the network had learned of Perenchio's 
contribution through a Los Angeles Times report and that it was a legitimate 
item for news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Univision's Perenchio, a registered Republican, said in a statement that he 
"vehemently opposes" Proposition 187, despite his contribution to Wilson. 
Records show that the Univision executive also pitched in $56,000 to the 
campaign of Wilson's Democratic rival, Kathleen Brown, who opposes the 
proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotly disputed California ballot initiative would deny public schooling 
and tax-supported services to illegal immigrants. Debate on the proposition has 
taken center stage in today's California elections, particularly in the eyes of 
many Latinos who say they will be victims of discrimination it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 In her letter, Molina said she was "deeply disappointed" that Telemundo had 
not responded to a previous request that the network match the $300,000 donated 
by Univision, the nation's dominant Spanish-language network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep in mind that Telemundo is in business because of the Latino community," 
Molina, who was extremely active in anti-187 fund-raising efforts, told the 
Telemundo president. "Without this base, you would not be making millions of 
dollars in profit every year from advertisers trying to reach our market." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Telemundo made a "positive response" by Monday, Molina wrote, she would 
call for an "immediate boycott" of the network, its advertisers and KVEA-TV 
Channel 52, the Glendale-based station owned and operated by Telemundo. Channel 
52's chief competition in Los Angeles is Univision's KMEX-TV Channel 34. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several experts on campaign and election law called Molina's action tough but 
not illegal. Chuck Bell, a Sacramento attorney, labeled Molina's letter 
"hardball stuff," but probably not a law violation. There was no indication of 
any official action that Molina could take -- such as a vote at the supervisor 
level -- that would punish Telemundo for not making the contribution, Bell 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold W. Ezell, a co-author of Proposition 187, called Molina's action 
outrageous, adding: "I think that a grand jury ought to check into it." 
</P>
<P>
 In his written response, Telemundo President Blaya rejected Molina's request 
and called it "an egregious affront to the trust your supporters have placed in 
you to be a leader in bringing our community together." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of a boycott was particularly sensitive, Blaya noted, because Telemundo 
-- which owns and operates seven television stations nationwide -- is in 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Blaya said that Telemundo had used the airwaves and other resources 
to promote marches, fund-raisers and other efforts aimed a defeating 
Proposition 187. In addition, KVEA-Channel 52 set up 900-prefix telephone lines 
to solicit anti-187 donations and promoted them with free advertising spots, 
one of which featured Molina.

RUSSIAN ULTRANATIONALIST TELLS S.F. AUDIENCE HE'S A DOVE; SPEECH: IN ADDRESS TO 
WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL, VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY SAYS HE HAS BEEN THE VICTIM OF 
LIES. UNCONVINCED DEMONSTRATORS DENOUNCE HIM AS A BIGOT. 
</P>

<P>
 Never has a man been so woefully misquoted. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian ultranationalist legislator Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, a flamboyant 
demagogue on his first visit to the United States, delivered a fiery speech 
Monday before the nonprofit World Affairs Council with one simple message: None 
of it is true. 
</P>
<P>
 The vow to annex Alaska? Slander. The accusations of anti-Semitism? Lies. The 
threats to create a dictatorship, shoot 100,000 citizens, deploy nuclear 
weapons? Bald falsehoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a disbelieving audience, including scores of Russian immigrants, 
Zhirinovsky described himself as a moderate, a dove, a friend to all ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand here before you to tell the world that our party believes in 
multi-party democracy. We support no discrimination on ethnic, social, racial 
or religious grounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Unconvinced, several hundred demonstrators gathered outside to distribute some 
of his most shocking quotes and denounce him as a bigot. "We want to expose the 
real Zhirinovsky -- his virulent anti-Semitism, his fascism," said Rabbi 
Douglas Kahn, who helped organize the demonstration. "We want to make him 
understand how repugnant the people of San Francisco find his message." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as Russian immigrant Yelena Bilyak said: "He's the monster of the 
century." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky first railed his way to prominence in 1991, when his harangues and 
pandering promises of cheap vodka helped him snatch nearly 8% of the votes in 
Russia's first presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 His raw confidence in Russia's prowess and his visions of military triumph and 
economic dominance gained further appeal over the next few years, as Russia 
slipped swiftly from superpower status. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's misleadingly named Liberal Democratic Party captured an 
astounding 25% of the votes in the December, 1993, parliamentary election. 
Zhirinovsky entered the lower house of Parliament in triumph -- already 
brazenly preparing a run for the presidency in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps in preparation for that campaign, Zhirinovsky on Monday tested a stump 
speech that could have passed muster in most American districts: He promised to 
fight crime, banish ethnic conflict and boost the economy through tax reform. 
He even pledged goodies for the local audience: strong trade links between San 
Francisco and Russia's eastern towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky repeatedly warned that unless his party captures the presidency, 
Russia will collapse into anarchic civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worsening of conditions in Russia would bring big conflict over the 
entire Eurasian continent. It would come close to the United States," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an indication of his country's instability, Zhirinovsky asserted that 
Russian soldiers educated at Harvard University are poised to overthrow their 
military command as part of an ongoing American attempt to meddle in Russian 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 A master conspiracy theorist who has blamed the AIDS epidemic on the United 
States, Zhirinovsky said he believes that the U.S. media are attempting to 
discredit him by misquoting his inflammatory rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "Again -- lies, false information," he said. And later he added, "Please 
listen to me, not to those papers that make special reports on me to diminish 
my popularity." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky even sought to distance himself from the bombastic jingoism of his 
autobiography, "The Last Dash to the South."  
</P>
<P>
 His vision of Russian soldiers bathing their feet in the Indian Ocean -- 
interpreted as a call to conquest -- represents merely a "prediction," 
Zhirinovsky said, and not a goal. "Why does this book always interest you?" he 
asked reporters with evident irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's antics appear to have cost him some support in Russia. But polls 
show that he maintains a core backing of 5% to 10% -- not enough, perhaps, to 
win the presidency, but an indication that his hard-line views appeal to 
millions of voters.  
</P>
<P>
 Showcasing the deep frustration that Zhirinovsky taps into, thousands of 
demonstrators in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities marched Monday 
in nostalgic commemoration of the 77th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution. 
While the mostly elderly demonstrators would probably not back Zhirinovsky -- 
who has blasted communism at every opportunity -- many held anti-reform 
placards that echo some of his platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the demonstrators, Zhirinovsky has harshly criticized Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin's reformist government. On Monday, he called it "100% 
Communist," accused it of establishing a "totalitarian regime" and said it had 
"given property to the former Communists, the mafia and criminal elements." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly aware that his denunciation of Yeltsin did not sway many audience 
members his way, Zhirinovsky sought to spin the hostility to his advantage.  
</P>
<P>
 "I do not need your support," he said, predicting that his party will sweep 
90% of the vote in Russia's next presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please do not praise our party," he exhorted. "We would like you and your 
press to describe us with the worst words -- then we will get a lot of votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's two-week tour of the United States will take him to New York and 
Miami.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; EMOTIONS HIGH AT LAST-MINUTE PROTESTS; 
SEVERAL DEMONSTRATIONS ARE HELD AROUND DOWNTOWN AND THE OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN 
HEATS UP WITH $1 MILLION IN NEW DONATIONS. L.A. SCHOOLS CHIEF URGES PUNISHING 
STUDENTS WHO WALK OUT.

<P>
 With emotions over Proposition 187 surging toward an Election Day peak, foes 
of the measure continued to mount protest rallies around Southern California on 
Monday and stepped up their media advertising with the help of a last-ditch 
$1-million infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the anti-illegal immigration ballot measure, meanwhile, continued 
their radio ads and get-out-the-vote efforts, remaining relatively quiet but 
strongly confident. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the protest activity continued to focus on student walkouts, with more 
than 2,500 leaving school. But the Los Angeles Unified School District's top 
official cast off his tolerant tone to issue a stern warning that any further 
truancy will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we (taking a harder line) now? Because obviously the emotion is now," 
Supt. Sidney A. Thompson said. "This is the election. This is precisely the 
time to save young people, even from themselves. . . . We gave you a chance, 
now we want you on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 In past weeks, the district has recommended punishment for only those students 
involved in vandalism or violence while off campus, although some schools did 
prescribe detention or suspensions. Under Monday's stricter stand, Thompson 
said, specific punishments would be left to school principals, but they will 
include parent conferences and suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students said such proclamations would not deter them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a right to be heard," said Monique Holguin, a ninth-grader in the El 
Rancho Unified School District in Pico Rivera, who walked more than 10 miles to 
Los Angeles City Hall on Monday. "We are just trying to get our message across. 
To say we can't do that is dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the ballot initiative continued a stepped-up media campaign using 
about $1 million in contributions received in the past week that nearly doubled 
the amount raised previously in the campaign. "It's significant and part of the 
momentum that's been happening," said Joel Maliniak, a campaign spokesman for 
Taxpayers Against 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn. continued to be the largest single donor to the 
opposition, pitching in an additional $100,000 to supplement the $443,000 it 
had already contributed. Univision, the parent company of KMEX-TV in Los 
Angeles and 10 other stations nationwide, pumped in $200,000 in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Spanish-language Univision network is a U.S. corporation based in 
New Jersey, its minority shareholders include Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media 
conglomerate headed by Mexican press baron Emilio Azcarraga. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas computer magnate John Moores, who with his wife, Rebecca, has been the 
largest individual contributor to the gubernatorial campaign of Kathleen Brown, 
sank $100,000 in last-minute funds into the 'no' campaign. And David Gelbaum of 
Sierra Partners in Newport Beach made a last-minute contribution of $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio ads in support of Proposition 187, sponsored by the Washington-based 
Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Orange County-based 
California Coalition for Immigration Reform, also continued Monday. And 
coalition Chairwoman Barbara Coe expressed optimism that the pro-187 forces 
would prove victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing anything, if you will, organized," Coe said. "But we feel 
very good. We feel that loyal Americans will come forward and support" 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe predicted that the continuing rallies against the measure could backfire 
for anti-187 forces. "If they've been like some in the past, if you're a loyal 
American and you love your country, they will hurt them real bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall shortly before 1 p.m., more than 1,000 demonstrators, many of 
them workers from Los Angeles' Downtown garment district, converged in a 
boisterous -- and somewhat heated -- rally against the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past demonstrations, protesters carried "No on 187" signs along with 
American, Salvadoran and Mexican flags. But this time, the demonstration took 
on a harder edge, with some protesters carrying a U.S. flag upside down and 
others a sign containing profanities directed at Gov. Pete Wilson, the 
measure's leading proponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The peaceful demonstration lasted about an hour. But several groups of 
students left early, saying they did not want to have any part of a protest in 
which the American flag was displayed upside down. "We are supposed to show 
respect," said Angel Barajas, a student at Belmont High School. "This is 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the day, a convoy of hundreds of mainly Latino truckers registered 
their opposition to Proposition 187 by driving their big rigs down Los Angeles 
freeways and Downtown streets, horns blaring. Late in the afternoon, the 
caravan circled City Hall, prompting columns of motorcycle officers to mobilize 
in an effort to keep traffic moving, an LAPD spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only joint appearance of pro- and anti-187 advocates Monday was on a 
spirited live edition of the "Geraldo" show on KCBS-TV Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to remain strong in this country, we have to take care of our 
own (people) first," asserted former Border Patrol official Bill King, vice 
president of Americans Against Illegal Immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the show, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, a 
vocal opponent of the measure, strode into the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking loudly at times to be heard above the din of the studio audience, 
Brown declared, "Proposition 187 is not about combatting illegal immigration, 
Proposition 187 is about discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 As law enforcement officials braced for the possibility of problems today, 
sheriff's deputies Monday patrolled neighborhoods in one of the walkout hot 
spots, Lawndale, where last Friday's student protest provoked a brawl between 
Latino and African American students. Leuzinger High School, where that fight 
occurred, was locked down for several hours Monday to prevent further problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On campuses such as Leuzinger, where tension already is high, the walkouts 
against Proposition 187 have crystallized hostility between Latinos and African 
Americans. In some cases, Latinos see their black classmates as gleefully 
waiting for them to be kicked out of school. Some black students, meanwhile, 
say their Latino classmates taunt them and blame them for the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative to walkouts went off smoothly Monday afternoon at Plaza de la 
Raza in Lincoln Park, where Chicano youth icons Culture Clash and Chicano 
Secret Service and representatives from Pocho Magazine came, they said, to 
support young activists while discouraging violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes your presence can make the difference," Richard Montoya of Culture 
Clash said hours before the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the rally caused controversy last week because organizers originally 
wanted to stage a massive 15-school walkout that would end at Plaza de la Raza. 
But after Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina and other community 
leaders objected to more walkouts, the rally was rescheduled to begin after 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, a coalition of elected officials, child welfare 
workers and religious leaders Monday urged the defeat of Proposition 187, 
contending that it would hamper the county's ability to serve abused and 
neglected children if they or their parents are undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is intolerable and unacceptable and I would appeal to all Californians to 
put children in the front of their hearts and minds and oppose this measure," 
said Los Angeles County Children's Commissioner Nancy Daly. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Digre, director of the county department of Children's Services, said 
the measure's passage would result in conflicting laws concerning 
confidentiality and treatment of abused children. 
</P>

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; LUNGREN BACKS PROP. 187; LATE STANCE 
ASSAILED; THOUGH CITING CONCERNS, ATTORNEY GENERAL CALLS MEASURE THE RIGHT 
VEHICLE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL TEST. ELECTION RIVAL TOM UMBERG ACCUSES HIM OF 
CAVING IN TO SUPPORTERS OF THE MEASURE. 
</P>

<P>
 After holding out for months, Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren declared his 
support for Proposition 187 on Monday, one day before the measure aimed at 
denying services to illegal immigrants will be decided by voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign of Lungren's Democratic opponent, Tom Umberg, immediately 
assailed the late call, charging the attorney general with caving in to 
adherents on a measure that an Umberg aide said was unconstitutional and close 
to being racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, in a detailed, two-page written statement, said the ballot measure is 
"an imperfect answer" and contains "certain shortcomings," but is the right 
vehicle to carry the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court to decide its 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney general said he "shares a concern" about the possibility of 
Proposition 187 driving children out of schools. But he also expressed worries 
about "the continuation of large-scale defiance of the immigration laws of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the attorney general said he was "particularly disturbed" by 
suggestions, which he said emerged in the debates over Proposition 187, that 
"there is no essential difference between the status of one who is here legally 
and one who is here illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 expressed surprise and regret over Lungren's 
decision. "I think Dan Lungren is just toeing the party line," said Scott 
Macdonald, spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187. "It could have had a large 
impact if he had come out against it. But this way, he's just falling in line 
like another domino." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's boosters meanwhile voiced relief that the attorney general 
had belatedly jumped aboard. "I felt Dan was going to come around," said Robert 
Kiley, political strategist for the pro-187 campaign committee. "Why he held 
out for so long I don't know. But we're glad that he's on board." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren has been attacked repeatedly by election rival Umberg -- an opponent 
of the ballot measure -- for failing to take a stand on Proposition 187.  
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager, said Lungren was exhibiting poor 
leadership "to finally take a position on an important issue just hours before 
the polls open and 136 days after the initiative finally qualified for the 
ballot. It's also unfortunate he reached the wrong conclusion. The initiative 
is clearly unconstitutional, will create additional public safety problems for 
the state and borders on being racist." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's stance on Proposition 187 has been eagerly awaited because the 
attorney general's office would play a crucial role in enforcing and defending 
the measure, which is expected to prompt a blizzard of lawsuits if it passes.

 The ballot measure would bar illegal immigrants from receiving most government 
services and calls for local educational, health care and law enforcement 
officials to report suspected illegal immigrants to state and federal 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some political analysts suggested that Lungren succumbed to internal GOP 
pressure. Republican candidates by and large are staunch backers of Proposition 
187, which is a centerpiece of Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Dan Lungren positioning himself as a rock-solid conservative," said 
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe of the Center for Politics and Economics at Claremont 
Graduate School. "This proposal has long been a litmus test for the hard right 
in this state. It's another indication of the ongoing battle for the heart and 
soul of the Republican Party." 
</P>
<P>
 But she also suggested that Lungren's announcement would have little dramatic 
impact on either the outcome of the attorney general's race or the vote on 
Proposition 187. "It just reconfirms the battle lines and comes so late that 
any impact that might have come doesn't have time to build momentum," Jeffe 
said.PROPOSITION 187 (ILLEGAL IMMIGRA

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; EMOTIONS RUN HIGH AT LAST-DITCH 
PROTESTS; DEMONSTRATIONS ARE HELD DOWNTOWN AND TWO STUDENTS ARE TAKEN INTO 
CUSTODY BRIEFLY AT A SMALLER NORTH HOLLYWOOD RALLY. OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN HEATS 
UP WITH NEW FUNDING.

 With emotions over Proposition 187 surging toward an Election Day crescendo, 
foes of the measure continued to mount protest rallies around Southern 
California on Monday and stepped up their media advertising with the help of a 
last-ditch $1-million infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the anti-illegal immigration ballot measure, meanwhile, continued 
their radio ads and get-out-the-vote efforts, remaining relatively quiet but 
strongly confident. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the protest activity continued to focus on student walkouts, with more 
than 2,500 leaving school. But the Los Angeles Unified School District's top 
official cast off his tolerant tone to issue a stern warning that any further 
truancy will be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are we (taking a harder line) now? Because obviously the emotion is now," 
Supt. Sidney A. Thompson said. "This is the election. This is precisely the 
time to save young people, even from themselves. . . . We gave you a chance, 
now we want you on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 In past weeks, the district has recommended punishment for only those students 
involved in vandalism or violence while off campus, although some schools did 
prescribe detention or suspensions. Under Monday's stricter stand, Thompson 
said, specific punishments would be left to school principals, but they will 
include parent conferences and suspensions. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said such proclamations would not deter them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a right to be heard," said Monique Holguin, a ninth-grader in the El 
Rancho Unified School District in Pico Rivera, who walked more than 10 miles to 
Los Angeles City Hall on Monday to attend a rally that drew more than 1,000 
people. "We are just trying to get our message across. To say we can't do that 
is dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, about 60 teens spent the better part of Monday 
enthusiastically marching around North Hollywood and trying to lure other 
students away from classes -- to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- chanting "Walkout! Walkout!" -- was composed of students from 
North Hollywood and John H. Francis Polytechnic high schools and met at Valley 
Plaza Park. It finally disbanded outside North Hollywood High when city police 
took two demonstrators into custody and confiscated their Mexican flag. 
</P>
<P>
 The detained North Hollywood High students, ages 17 and 18, were released 
without charge. The flag they had been carrying, confiscated because it was 
mounted on a metal pipe in violation of city law, was returned to them, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 younger teen-agers from Walter E. Reed Middle School briefly joined 
the group outside North Hollywood High. Earlier in the day, fewer than 20 
students left the campus of Francisco F. Sepulveda Middle School before they 
were herded back to class without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ulysses S. Grant High School in Van Nuys, City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
urged a peaceful lunchtime crowd on the campus' main quadrangle to vote against 
the measure if they were old enough and to get their friends, relatives and 
neighbors to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, though, Goldberg told the students to defy the backers of 
Proposition 187 by remaining in class. "Their whole point is to kick you out of 
school," said Goldberg, who taught at Grant for two years before she was 
elected to the City Council. "Please, don't kick yourself out voluntarily." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the ballot initiative, meanwhile, continued a stepped-up media 
campaign using about $1 million in contributions received in the past week that 
nearly doubled the amount raised previously in the campaign. "It's significant 
and part of the momentum that's been happening," said Joel Maliniak, a campaign 
spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn. continued to be the largest single donor to the 
opposition, pitching in an additional $100,000 to supplement the $443,000 it 
had already contributed. Univision, the parent company of KMEX-TV in Los 
Angeles and 10 other stations nationwide, pumped in $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Spanish-language Univision network is a U.S. corporation, its 
minority shareholders include Grupo Televisa, the Mexican media conglomerate 
headed by Mexican press baron Emilio Azcarraga. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas computer magnate John Moores, who with his wife, Rebecca, has been the 
largest individual contributor to the gubernatorial campaign of Kathleen Brown, 
sank $100,000 in last-minute funds into the 'no' campaign. And David Gelbaum of 
Sierra Partners in Newport Beach contributed $180,000 in last-minute funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio ads in support of Proposition 187, sponsored by the Washington-based 
Federation for American Immigration Reform and Orange County-based California 
Coalition for Immigration Reform, also continued Monday. And coalition 
Chairwoman Barbara Coe expressed optimism that the pro-187 forces would prove 
victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not doing anything, if you will, organized," Coe said. "But we feel 
very good. We feel that loyal Americans will come forward and support" 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Coe predicted that the continuing rallies against the measure could backfire 
for anti-187 forces. "If they've been like some in the past, if you're a loyal 
American and you love your country, they will hurt them real bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall shortly before 1 p.m., more than 1,000 demonstrators, many of 
them workers from Los Angeles' Downtown garment district, converged in a 
boisterous -- and somewhat heated -- rally against the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past demonstrations, protesters carried "No on 187" signs along with 
American, Salvadoran and Mexican flags. But this time, the demonstration took 
on a harder edge, with some protesters carrying a U.S. flag upside down and 
others a sign containing profanities directed at Gov. Pete Wilson, the 
measure's leading proponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The peaceful demonstration lasted about an hour. But several groups of 
students left early, saying they did not want to have any part of a protest in 
which the American flag was displayed upside down. "We are supposed to show 
respect," said Angel Barajas, a student at Belmont High School. "This is 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the day, a convoy of hundreds of mainly Latino truckers registered 
their opposition to Proposition 187 by driving their big rigs down Los Angeles 
freeways and Downtown streets, horns blaring. Late in the afternoon, the 
caravan circled City Hall prompting columns of motorcycle officers to mobilize 
in an effort to keep traffic moving, an LAPD spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, nearly 100 protesters gathered in front of the Ronald W. Reagan State 
Office Building, chanting and bearing signs declaring their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The only joint appearance of pro- and anti-187 advocates Monday was on a 
spirited live edition of the "Geraldo" show on KCBS-TV Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to remain strong in this country, we have to take care of our 
own (people) first," asserted former Border Patrol official Bill King, vice 
president of Americans Against Illegal Immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the show, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown, a 
vocal opponent of the measure, strode into the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking loudly at times to be heard above the din of the studio audience, 
Brown declared, "Proposition 187 is not about combatting illegal immigration, 
Proposition 187 is about discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 An alternative to walkouts went off smoothly Monday afternoon at Plaza de la 
Raza in Lincoln Park, where Chicano youth icons Culture Clash and Chicano 
Secret Service and representatives from Pocho Magazine came, they said, to 
support young activists while discouraging violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes your presence can make the difference," Richard Montoya of Culture 
Clash, said hours before the Eastside demonstration.

INDONESIAN LABOR LEADER GETS 3-YEAR PRISON TERM; ASIA: OFFICIAL ALLEGEDLY 
INCITED WORKER VIOLENCE. CLINTON TO DISCUSS HUMAN RIGHTS ON UPCOMING VISIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A week before a state visit by President Clinton, an Indonesian court Monday 
sentenced the leader of the country's largest independent labor union to three 
years in prison for allegedly inciting workers to violence earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Muchtar Pakpahan was the fourth senior official of the Indonesian Prosperous 
Labor Union to be sentenced to prison in connection with riots in the Sumatran 
city of Medan in April. Another 10 union leaders remain on trial for fomenting 
the disturbances, which left one ethnic Chinese factory owner dead and caused 
extensive property damage before being suppressed by army troops. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement released by the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta said the Clinton 
Administration regrets Pakpahan's conviction. "We believe that he should not be 
held accountable for unintended violence in connection with protests over 
legitimate labor demands," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Lord, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific 
affairs, acknowledged last week that the United States and Indonesia "have 
problems in the human rights area" and said Clinton plans to discuss them with 
Indonesia's President Suharto on Nov. 16 during a state visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will be in Indonesia, the largest country in Southeast Asia, next week 
attending a summit of leaders from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) 
group. The leaders are expected to adopt steps making the Asian region a free 
trade area early in the next century, but the Americans have ruled out 
discussing labor issues at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a group of 74 members of Congress called on Clinton to use his 
talks with the 73-year-old Suharto, who like many Javans uses only one name, to 
discuss "severe labor rights violations" in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suharto regime has been accused recently of abandoning a policy of 
relative openness and cracking down on dissent and freedom of the press. Three 
of the country's most popular newspapers were closed earlier this year after 
printing articles considered embarrassing to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued before Pakpahan's conviction, the human rights group 
Amnesty International called on the United States to issue a clear declaration 
stressing the importance of human rights in its relations with Asian nations. 
The Administration was widely chided in June for bowing to Chinese threats and 
granting Beijing renewed most-favored-nation trade status despite a renewed 
crackdown on human rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amnesty International is concerned that the pre-APEC crackdown has resulted 
in serious human rights violations, including: the arbitrary arrest, and in 
some cases, torture and ill-treatment, of political detainees; the unfair trial 
and arbitrary imprisonment of labor activists and workers, and the unlawful 
execution of alleged criminals," the group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amnesty said it was particularly concerned about the use of special police 
forces to arrest people in Jakarta in an effort to spruce up the capital's 
image before the APEC meeting. While APEC officials will hold talks in Jakarta, 
Suharto has invited Clinton and leaders from 17 Asian countries to hold a 
retreat with him next Tuesday in the foothill resort of Bogor, 30 miles to the 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Embassy said the conviction of Pakpahan would be one element that 
will be taken into consideration as the Administration deliberates whether to 
revoke Indonesia's trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences 
(GSP). The benefits cover about $650 million worth of trade, or 14% of 
Indonesian goods shipped to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. trade representative is investigating charges that Indonesia denies 
its workers the right to freedom of association. If the charges are upheld, the 
Administration can revoke the GSP benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration has placed the investigation on hold since August, 
ostensibly while a "dialogue" is taking place on the controversy. Labor groups 
have accused the Administration of seeking to avoid embarrassing Suharto before 
the APEC meeting, which the Indonesian leader is said by diplomats to regard as 
his defining moment as a statesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The court convictions in Medan appear to deal a life-threatening blow to the 
free labor movement in Indonesia. Union officials said that their operations 
have been severely curtailed since Pakpahan's arrest and that the group's 
350,000 members have been afraid to express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakpahan has denied inciting the workers to violence. At the time of the 
strike in Medan in April, he was in eastern Java.

U.S. BACKS TRADE BOOST FOR N. KOREA; COMMERCE: SUPPORT COMES AS SEOUL SAYS IT 
WILL LIFT ITS BAN ON BUSINESS CONTACTS WITH PYONGYANG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Extending a new olive branch to North Korea, the Clinton Administration 
indicated Monday it is prepared to support the development of economic ties 
between the Pyongyang regime and the rest of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher gave U.S. backing to a new initiative by 
South Korean President Kim Young Sam, who said in a speech Monday that he will 
lift the ban on South Korean business contacts with North Korea. The South 
Korean president also said he will give the green light for Pyongyang to 
develop economic ties with the rest of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a long-term goal, it is entirely appropriate," Christopher told reporters 
aboard his plane on the first leg of an 11-day trip to Asia. He said the United 
States hopes to bring North Korea "into the company of civilized nations and to 
show them the opportunities . . . that go with better relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that North Korea may eventually get membership in regionwide 
organizations marks a new step for the Administration, which had agreed in the 
past only to exchange diplomatic liaison offices with the Pyongyang regime. 
North Korea is not now a member of any of the regional organizations set up for 
East Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until very recently, the United States had been denouncing North Korea as a 
terrorist state and criticizing it for selling dangerous missiles around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher acknowledged Monday that the United States has many outstanding 
problems with North Korea, including those related to terrorism and weapons 
proliferation. "Reaping full benefits (of participating in regional 
organizations) depends on their change in stance, not only on nuclear issues 
but on other issues as well," he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary's remarks were part of a new effort by the Administration to 
manage the aftereffects of the nuclear agreement it signed with North Korea 
last month. Christopher is scheduled to visit Seoul today and Wednesday to 
confer with South Korean leaders. Under the deal reached in Geneva, North Korea 
must freeze its nuclear program in exchange for diplomatic and economic 
concessions from the United States and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is now trying to make sure that North Korea implements the 
first part of the multistaged agreement. For that purpose, holding out the lure 
of future economic links between North Korea and the rest of Asia is important. 
Pyongyang desperately needs foreign investment to help its ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's new overture comes at a time when North Korea is in the midst of 
trying to settle on its future leadership and policies in the wake of the death 
of its leader and founder, Kim Il Sung. 
</P>
<P>
 His son Kim Jong Il is being called North Korea's new "supreme leader," but he 
has not been given the titles yet of president of his country or head of the 
ruling party. And many Western analysts believe that North Korea has not yet 
decided whether, or how much, it should change its economic and foreign 
policies by opening up the long-isolated nation to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the United States also wants to provide assurances to South 
Korea that it will not be left behind as the United States steps up its 
contacts with North Korea. Christopher told reporters that Kim Young Sam's 
decision to permit South Korean businesses to have contact with North Korea was 
"in line with what we have been talking about together."  
</P>
<P>
 He stressed that the United States does not intend to draw down its 37,000 
troops in South Korea. Asked whether there might be some reductions if the 
nuclear agreement with North Korea proceeds smoothly, he replied: "I do not 
foresee that. Not in the foreseeable future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the United States is prepared, specifically, to consider 
North Korea's membership in the fledgling Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
(APEC) group, the 18-member organization of countries on both sides of the 
Pacific.  
</P>
<P>
 "As this (nuclear) agreement is implemented, as the talks (between North and 
South Korea) move forward . . . it would be entirely appropriate to consider 
North Korea's membership in APEC and the other regional institutions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state pointed out that APEC in 1993 imposed a three-year 
moratorium on new members, so that the reality of North Korea joining the group 
will be at least two years off. The delay will give the United States and its 
allies time to see whether Pyongyang is living up to the nuclear agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the mere talk of North Korean membership in APEC is significant. 
Vietnam is not yet a member, and a number of other countries in the 
neighborhood of East Asia -- including Russia, India and Pakistan -- are all 
standing in line, eager to be invited in, in hopes of sharing in at least some 
part of East Asia's prosperity.

REPUBLICAN HEAD OF GSA PLANS TO STAY; GOVERNMENT: ORANGE COUNTY MAN ADMITS 
BREAKING RULES. BUT ETHICS CHARGES AGAINST HIM STEM FROM HIS EFFORTS TO CUT 
WASTE, HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With allegations of ethics violations continuing to swirl around him, Roger W. 
Johnson says he is determined to stay on as head of the General Services 
Administration, even stepping up the changes he believes have caused him to be 
"treated like a virus" in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, former CEO of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine and the highest-ranking 
Republican in the Clinton Administration, has repeatedly acknowledged he broke 
some government ethics rules since coming to Washington in 1993. But he has 
argued that the vigorous scrutiny given his actions has less to do with ethics 
than with derailing his attempts to reorganize a $60-billion agency long seen 
as the epitome of wasteful bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say to those narrow-minded few who want to stop us is that if they 
thought their sacred cows were in trouble over the past year and one half, then 
they don't know what trouble really is," an angry Johnson, 60, said in an 
interview in his Washington, D.C., office last week, awaiting the results of 
the second inspector general's investigation launched since he took over the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 Since coming to Washington, Johnson has been accused by the news media and 
critics inside the troubled agency he inherited of using government mail and 
phones for personal use, of asking his government secretary to await the 
arrival of furniture being moved from his Laguna Beach house to his Georgetown 
home and of using his government chauffeur for personal trips to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Washington Post reported that he failed to inform the Office of 
Government Ethics when certain terms of his severance agreement with Western 
Digital changed. Although it appears no disclosure laws were violated, such has 
been the stuff of Page 1 news, leading Johnson to question whether public 
service is worth all the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I am under the ethics cloud. I take that very personally. I have never 
done anything unethical in my life. I have certainly done things that are 
stupid . . . but where I come from, (violating) ethics involves some sort of 
intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's office estimates he has saved the government nearly $2 billion by 
trimming the fat out of courthouse construction projects and reorganizing other 
GSA programs. But bigger news was made of his decision to repay the government 
$1,062 in questionable expenses, even though an inspector general's inquiry 
concluded he owed just $73. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson thought he had survived the turmoil last spring by making peace with 
lawmakers his cost-cutting programs had offended. But enemies inside GSA have 
continued to assail him in a newsletter called "Crosswind -- GSA News From a 
Democratic Perspective," which has called Johnson "arrogant, cocky and stupid," 
and suggested he is "a mole" secretly raising money for Republican 
congressional candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and his aides attribute much of the anger to a renegade union official 
bent on running Johnson back to Orange County. Johnson's experience may be 
testimony to how difficult it is for a powerful CEO to make the transition to 
public life. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these regulations cause the federal employee to do stupid things," he 
said. "My secretary offers to go home and wait for the furniture. In the 
alternative, I could have gone home and the government would have let me sit 
there for the whole day. That, in my view, is dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The intensive scrutiny has already led Johnson to hire an attorney -- veteran 
Washingtonian Albert Beveridge III. He now pays for all trips to California -- 
even those that are business related -- out of his pocket and is using a 
personal credit card to charge most phone calls out of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get in the position of defending it, so I'm just not going to bother 
with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the violations have been serious enough to warrant Johnson's 
resignation in the eyes of the White House, and President Clinton singled him 
out for "a special word of thanks" during a campaign stop last weekend in 
Anaheim.

 Parliament's lower house overwhelmingly endorsed President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide's new government in a vote of confidence late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A swearing-in ceremony for Prime Minister Smarck Michel and his 17-member 
Cabinet was scheduled for today at the Presidential Palace.The Cabinet's task 
will be to restore elected rule after three years of military repression. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so the country can move in a new direction," Randall Pierre Canal, a 
pro-Aristide deputy from the Port-au-Prince suburb of Carrefour, said before 
the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel, 57, was ratified over the weekend by both houses. He outlined his 
policies before the Senate on Sunday. They include an economic recovery program 
based on reduced tariffs, increased exports and privatization of unprofitable 
state enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday's 54-2 vote, Michel thanked the Chamber of Deputies and said he 
hoped lawmakers will be able to work well with Aristide. The lower house has 83 
seats, but not all members were present.

 Defense Minister Joe Modise said Monday that more than 2,200 former guerrillas 
had been dismissed from South Africa's post-apartheid forces for failing to 
meet a midnight deadline to report for duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who were not back by midnight last night are out.They're no longer 
part of the process," a Modise spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Modise said there would be no last-minute reprieve for those who quit the 
Walmansthal base near Pretoria last week in protest against conditions, pay and 
the pace of integration into the South African National Defense Force. 
</P>
<P>
 He said any attempt to set up an underground movement of former soldiers of 
the African National Congress would be countered, adding: "We will mobilize the 
nation to ensure they don't cause trouble."

ISRAEL REOPENS SITE OF MOSQUE MASSACRE IN HEBRON; MIDEAST: ONLY A FEW COME TO 
WORSHIP AT THE CAVE OF THE PATRIARCHS. MUSLIMS OBSERVE AN UNOFFICIAL BOYCOTT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A faithful few braved frigid rain, elaborate security measures and a heavy 
army presence Monday to pray at the Cave of the Patriarchs, reopened for the 
first time since a Jewish settler shot dead about 30 Muslim worshipers there in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslims, who accused Israel of desecrating a holy site because its security 
arrangements separate Jews and Muslims who come to pray there, observed an 
unofficial boycott of the mosque. Only a trickle of worshipers ventured through 
the metal detectors to kneel in prayer in the newly whitewashed halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim officials said they will appeal to international organizations to 
reverse the measures. "The Palestinian Authority will take this up with high 
Israeli officials and world organizations," said Hassan Tahboub, minister of 
Islamic affairs in the Palestinian Authority. "The mosque cannot be divided." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials said Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser 
Arafat will bring the matter up today with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
when the two men meet at the Erez checkpoint separating the 
Palestinian-governed Gaza Strip from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mosque is a Muslim holy site, only Muslim," said Azzam Muhtasab, 
secretary general of the Hebron municipality. "Never could there be a holy 
place claimed by two different religions." Both Muslims and Jews complained 
bitterly about the government's decision to separate them and divide the 
structure -- called the Ibrahim mosque by Muslims -- between them. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, Jews and Arabs made it clear that neither the army's ubiquitous 
presence nor the passage of time has eased the enmity between the communities, 
who live unhappily alongside one another in this mostly Palestinian town. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cave of the Patriarchs is a Jewish place," said Orit Stroock, a Jewish 
settler who lives in Hebron. "Avraham, our father, bought this place for 400 
shekels. It is written in the Bible. This is a Jewish place. It was built as a 
Jewish place before Muslims existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Stroock spoke in the portion of the site designated for Jews. Under the army's 
new arrangements, Jewish worshipers will enter from one gate and Muslims from 
another. Two sets of metal detectors are set up at each entrance, and the site 
is surveyed by cameras. Metal doors that soldiers can automatically swing open 
for easy access separate the Jewish and Muslim sides. 
</P>
<P>
 On 10 separate days of the year, each religion will be granted exclusive 
access to the entire site. The rest of the time, the army hopes, adherents of 
the two faiths will come and go without seeing each other. Only officials of 
the Islamic Waqf, the Islamic trust that administers Muslim holy sites, have 
free access to all parts of the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish side of the site consists of the Jacob and Abraham halls, the 
Covenant Hall and an inner courtyard the army has now roofed with canvas. Jews 
claim this represents only about 20% of the total space available at the site, 
and that they are prevented from praying in the Yitzhak Hall, the mosque where 
Baruch Goldstein trained his automatic weapon on Muslim worshipers in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two Muslims were in the newly whitewashed Yitzhak Hall when reporters 
came through on an army tour Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't go and pray in such a situation," said Issa al Mukhtasib, 38, outside 
the site. "I don't want to enter a military fortress. We can pray in the 
desert. We don't have to pray in a mosque. If they put limitations on access 
and on the number of people who are allowed to pray, then we don't need to go 
there at all."  
</P>
<P>
 During the two-day trial opening, the army is restricting the number of 
worshipers from each faith to 300, hoping to avoid mass demonstrations. If all 
goes well, the army plans to reopen the mosque permanently next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the Jewish side of the site Monday morning, a dozen men prayed in the tiny 
Abraham Hall. Children bundled in winter clothes ran in the courtyard, where 
the canvas roof failed to keep rain from washing across the stone floor. A 
handful of women gathered in another small hall to pray opposite the Abraham 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a happy day for all the people of Israel," Stroock said, "because we 
are here. But it is a sad day because we didn't get all our rights, and because 
our government -- a Jewish government -- gave our place to another people." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught between the acrimonious claims being made by adherents of each faith is 
the newly trained Israeli army unit charged with ensuring that no further 
disasters occur at the site. The February massacre temporarily derailed 
Arab-Israeli peace talks and triggered a series of revenge attacks against Jews 
by Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting also raised questions about Israel's ability to ensure free and 
safe access for all religions at all holy sites, and about the future of the 
community of 450 Jewish militants living in the heart of Hebron, the West 
Bank's second-largest city. Some members of Israel's government have publicly 
spoken of the need to consider relocating the settlers, who say they are only 
reclaiming land that belonged to Jews in ancient times. 
</P>
<P>
 An unhappy-looking Israeli colonel, Benny Gantz, commander of the Hebron area, 
pointed out newly installed security cameras to a crowd of journalists he was 
guiding through the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 16 cameras, inside and out," said Gantz, who has been at his post 
four months. "I hope we will not need to use them, not for security reasons nor 
for any kind of legal aspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Gantz emphasized that no one will be allowed to carry arms into the site 
except soldiers. At the time that Goldstein carried out his attack, Jewish 
settlers were commonly allowed to carry their weapons into the site. Soldiers 
have also been given a list of militant Jewish settlers -- Gantz said about a 
dozen names appear on the list -- who will be denied access to the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 In an embarrassing incident for the army on Monday, Avishai Raviv, an activist 
with the extremist Kach movement whose name appears on the security list, 
boasted to reporters that he slipped inside the site to pray without anyone 
checking his identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Gantz attributed the security lapse to the need for the security force to 
settle in at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're focusing on security checks right now," said Gantz, who described the 
overall situation in Hebron as one of "high tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran told Israel Radio that army intelligence has information 
that attacks are planned against the site. Militant Islamic groups have 
threatened revenge attacks against the cave.

EX-COMMUNIST DECLARED VICTOR IN DISPUTED TAJIK RACE; CENTRAL ASIA: OPPONENT 
SAYS RESULTS FALSIFIED. VOTE DOES NOTHING TO ADVANCE TALKS WITH EXILED 
GUERRILLAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Emamali Rakhmonov, who came to power by force two years ago in one of the 
former Soviet Union's bloodiest civil wars, was declared the winner Monday of a 
controversial presidential election in this Central Asian republic. 
</P>
<P>
 An electoral commission picked by Rakhmonov's government gave the 42-year-old 
former Communist 60% of the vote in Sunday's two-man race. His former prime 
minister, Abdulmalik Abdulajanov, was given 35% and charged that the result had 
been falsified. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest between two former allies on the winning side of the war did 
nothing to advance peace negotiations between the government and a 
still-outlawed coalition of exiled Islamists and democrats, whose guerrillas 
have kept up sporadic, crippling attacks from bases in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 It came a day after the guerrillas failed to show up at a border town with 27 
captured government soldiers for a scheduled prisoner exchange, prompting the 
government to take an equal number of opposition activists back to jail in 
Dushanbe. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rakhmonov and the exiled coalition, which opposed holding the elections, 
called for continuing the peace talks and a temporary cease-fire that has been 
in force since Oct. 20. "There is no alternative," Rakhmonov said after casting 
his ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting, which erupted after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, is a 
power struggle among ethnic Tajiks divided into regional factions by 
mountainous geography. At its peak the fighting turned a tenth of the country's 
5.2 million people into refugees; it has killed more than 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, Communist warriors of Rakhmonov's southern rural Kulyabi 
faction, backed by the Russian army, drove the Islamic-democratic coalition 
from power, along with its fighters from the Garm and Pamir mountain regions. 
At first the well-armed Kulyabis shared the government with Abdulajanov and 
figures from his northern, industrial Khodjent region, then muscled them aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials in Russia, whose 25,000 troops defend the Tajik-Afghan border 
from rebel attacks, appeared to favor Abdulajanov. The wealthy 45-year-old 
businessman, who is ambassador to Moscow, was viewed as more of a peacemaker 
than Rakhmonov, whose regime stands accused by international human rights 
groups of murdering opposition leaders and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the final month of the campaign, the Russian government delivered 15 
billion rubles, or about $5 million, to help Rakhmonov's bankrupt government 
pay long-delayed wages, undermining his opponent's strongest campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Four bombs exploded at government buildings here Friday in an apparent attempt 
to intimidate voters, but election officials reported a 95% turnout. People ate 
free servings of plov , a traditional rice dish, at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters gave 90% approval to a new constitution creating the presidency, with 
power to appoint and dismiss government ministers and judges. Rakhmonov had 
been chairman of Parliament, the most powerful post under the old constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Official observers from Russia, four other former Soviet republics and Turkey 
told reporters Monday, after visiting 120 of the 2,469 polling stations, that 
they had detected no irregularities in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 But journalists and Western diplomats here noted that Rakhmonov's campaign had 
dominated state television and was openly supported by the armed security 
forces, who tacked up his campaign posters and often spoke in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 One diplomat said that armed men visited a camp for returning war refugees and 
threatened to kill anyone who voted against Rakhmonov. 
</P>
<P>
 "All government machinery was mobilized in favor of one candidate," said 
Friederike Adlung, who represents the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe here. That group and the United Nations declined to send observers 
because of the ban on most opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Rakhmonov, who campaigned as the man who brought peace, said the election 
outcome had turned "a new page for Tajikistan" by showing it to be "really 
democratic." 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Tajikistan still have a totalitarian psychology," countered Otakhon 
Latifi, a spokesman for the exiled opposition. "They vote for whomever they are 
told to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abdulajanov asserted that some ballots were distributed without his name on 
them and that his partisans were beaten up at one polling station. He accused 
the government of falsifying returns from districts where his supporters, 
bowing to threats, did not show up as observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rakhmonov simply took advantage of the fact that we have no armed units at 
our beck and call and decided to win by force," said Babajan Ikramov, a 
spokesman for the runner-up.

SILICONE OIL OKD FOR TREATMENT OF DETACHED RETINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A silicone oil product has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for treatment of detached retina, an eye condition that can cause blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA announced Monday that the product, marketed as Adatomed Silicone Oil, 
successfully treated 60% to 75% of patients participating in clinical trials in 
the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Detached retina is a disorder in which the transmission of light signals to 
the brain is interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Injury and disease, including AIDS, can cause a detached retina. About 18,000 
to 30,000 Americans develop this condition each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard treatment for the disorder is surgery, but FDA Commissioner David A. 
Kessler said that for some people, including many with AIDS, the surgery is not 
successful. Silicone oil could save their sight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said the oil is approved for treatment of complicated retinal 
detachments not corrected with standard surgery.

NTSB ISSUES PLANE GROUNDING ADVISORY; AVIATION: THE RECOMMENDATION COVERS THE 
TYPE OF COMMUTER CRAFT THAT CRASHED IN INDIANA. IT COULD NOT TAKE OFF WHEN 
ICING EXISTS OR IS FORECAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board on Monday issued an emergency 
recommendation that the type of commuter plane that crashed in Indiana a week 
ago be grounded whenever icing conditions exist or are forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for a Federal Aviation Administration directive ordering the 
grounding is advisory only, "but we feel it needs immediate attention," said 
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB. "They have 90 days to respond, but 
with recommendations like this, they usually respond much sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials were not immediately available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle Flight 4184 -- a European-built, twin-turboprop ATR72 -- 
suddenly rolled over and plunged nose-first into a bean field near Roselawn, 
Ind., after circling on autopilot for more than 30 minutes in subfreezing 
temperatures and steady rain while awaiting clearance to land at Chicago's 
O'Hare International Airport. The crash killed all 68 on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NTSB has yet to determine the cause of the crash, attention 
focused from the outset on the possibility that ice had built up, overburdening 
the aircraft, reducing the lift provided by the wings and crippling the 
ailerons -- hinged plates on the wings' trailing edges that move up and down to 
bank and turn the airliner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recommendations issued Monday, the NTSB noted similarities between the 
American Eagle crash and an incident in Wisconsin in December, 1988, involving 
an ATR42, a smaller version of the ATR72. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR42 over Wisconsin was flying on autopilot in icing conditions when it, 
too, began to roll over, but the pilot was able to recover and the plane landed 
without incident. Icing has been blamed in the 1987 crash of an ATR42 in the 
Italian Alps. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety board is concerned that an amount of ice that can be accumulated 
under some flight conditions during winter operations may be more critical to 
the flying quality of the ATR42 and ATR72 airplanes than to other airplanes," 
the board said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ATR planes are mainstays of commuter aviation, and grounding all of them 
during inclement weather would have a disruptive effect on the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250 ATR42s and about 130 ATR72s are currently being flown throughout 
the world -- most of them in the United States. American Eagle -- a subsidiary 
of the AMR Co., which also operates American Airlines -- currently flies 25 
ATR72s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if the FAA issues an order, we will comply with it," said Al 
Becker, a spokesman for American Eagle. "We will cooperate fully." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, three days after the crash in Indiana, American Eagle's parent 
firm -- the AMR Co. -- issued a bulletin prohibiting use of the autopilots on 
ATR72s and ATR42s whenever icing conditions exist. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the firm ordered that the flaps on both planes be fully retracted 
whenever circling in a holding pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Flaps are flat metal slabs that can be extended back from the wings to 
increase their lift. Flight 4184 was circling over Roselawn at about 210 m.p.h. 
with its flaps extended at a 15-degree angle when an alarm sounded, warning the 
pilot that flap damage could occur at that high a speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources believe that when the pilot retracted the flaps in response to the 
alarm, Flight 4184's problems intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources believe the wings already were losing lift because of accumulating 
ice, and retracting the flaps reduced that lift even more, leaving the plane 
perilously close to a stall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circumstances of this accident . . . indicate that the use of the 
autopilot can mask the onset of lateral instability," the NTSB said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said that ice apparently built up on the ailerons, crippling them 
so that they could no longer keep the wings level despite repeated commands 
from the autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching its preset limits, the autopilot apparently disengaged, the NTSB 
said, leaving the pilots with a plane that started to roll out of control 
before stalling and plunging nose-first toward the ground.

BOSNIAN CITY MIRRORS CROAT-MUSLIM SUSPICIONS; BALKANS: MOSTAR IS STILL DIVIDED, 
BUT SERB SHELLING MAY BOLSTER THE TWO GROUPS' FRAGILE ALLIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maja Tomic shrugged with feigned disinterest when asked why this city's 
Muslims and Croats remain divided by the Neretva River, despite two rebuilt 
bridges and seven months of reconciliation talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a heavy artillery shell fired from Serbian positions crashed somewhere to 
the north, startling her out of the pose of indifference and twisting her 
fuchsia-lined mouth into a worried frown. Suddenly, the 19-year-old waitress 
found the words to describe her city's lingering discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Serbs we're worried about," said Tomic, fretfully glancing at the 
rebel-held highland overlooking the east bank of physically and ethnically 
divided Mostar. "We don't have so many problems with the Muslims anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 With each artillery round Bosnian Serb fighters lob on the population of 
Mostar -- a seam in the former Yugoslav republic's ethnic patchwork that has 
already been ripped open three times in this war -- the rebels may be doing 
more to strengthen the fragile Muslim-Croatian alliance than to destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. military observers believe a recent resumption of random shelling in 
Mostar and intensified efforts to strangle the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo are 
aimed at undermining the fledgling federation proclaimed in March when Bosnia's 
Muslims and Croats laid down their arms after a vicious, yearlong war. 
</P>
<P>
 But the renewed Serbian attacks have also served to remind the divided people 
of Mostar that the nationalist rebels who first sparked Bosnia-Herzegovina's 
spiraling bloodshed are a common enemy and should be regarded as the greater 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-month-old cease-fire between Bosnian Muslims and Croats remains 
vulnerable to unscrupulous politicians and the paralysis afflicting Balkan 
peace talks more than three years into the former Yugoslav federation's roiling 
conflict poses the risk of disillusioning both populations as they struggle to 
put the recent bloodletting behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 But an expanding European Union presence to oversee reconciliation and the 
Serbs' ill-timed reminders that another Muslim-Croatian divide could end in 
their conquest seems to be shoring up what has been a shaky and reluctant 
alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslims and Croats of Bosnia, who made up two-thirds of the prewar 
population, had jointly campaigned for salvaging the former Yugoslav federation 
as conflict in Croatia brewed four years ago. Together they opted for 
independence from bellicose Serbia after all efforts to save the federation had 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 When local Serbs rebelled against Bosnia's April, 1992, vote for independence, 
they shelled the historic Turkish bazaar quarter of this riverfront city into 
rubble before being driven back over the east ridge two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostar's ancient architectural monuments suffered an even more devastating 
assault when Croatian nationalists turned on this city's Muslim population, 
herding 55,000 townsmen into the bombed-out wreckage of the east bank and 
firing their own artillery at the captive enclave. Even Mostar's namesake Stari 
Most -- Old Bridge, in Serbo-Croatian -- crashed into the teal-blue waters of 
the Neretva when Croatian artillery destroyed the historical treasure deemed by 
the nationalists a "military object." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S.-brokered agreement in March allegedly reunited these divided 
communities and set out the foundation for a new Bosnian federation that would 
ensure Muslims and Croats rule over more than half of the original Bosnian 
republic once a peace treaty with the Serbs was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Serbs steadfastly refusing to accept a split of Bosnia giving 
them only 49%, instead of the 72% of territory they have overrun, officials 
here and in Sarajevo concede the reconciliation has been tough going. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a U.N. Security Council resolution passed last spring with the 
expectation of a negotiated resolution of the war by now, the 12-nation 
European Union has taken over administration of Mostar to oversee its recovery 
and re-integration for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, the troubled city has become a much-watched bellwether of the 
delicate Croatian-Muslim reconciliation across Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is a microcosm of the whole problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina," said 
Martin Garrod, the EU administration's British chief of staff. "If we can 
succeed in bringing people together here, it will provide a good example for 
the whole federation." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrod pointed proudly to the hundreds of people who now make day trips into 
what was once enemy territory. But he acknowledged that not a single displaced 
family has been allowed to return home, nor is one likely to make such a move 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of bitterness left over from those who lost mothers, fathers 
and brothers," he said. "It's not going to happen overnight that we get rid of 
the situation we have now, which is two cities -- one on the left bank and one 
on the right." 
</P>
<P>
 The European administrators are counting on daily meetings of city officials 
from the two segregated communities to gradually repair the rift dividing 
Mostar, at first by inching forward with token accomplishments. Both sides are 
talking about fixing up schools and hospitals and perhaps opening a nearby rail 
line, but so far they've agreed only to allow limited foot and vehicle traffic 
across the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's happening bit by bit and we have to be patient with that," said Garrod, 
a retired Royal Air Force officer. "If you try to rush it, we're going to end 
up back at Square One." 
</P>
<P>
 To nudge the process along, 200 European police are deploying alongside 
Muslims and Croats patrolling their respective sides of the city with the aim 
of gradually merging the law officers into a single, united force. 
</P>
<P>
 EU officials themselves have been targets of hostility, including an incident 
in late September when Croatian soldiers fired a shell through the 
administration's offices on the second floor of a requisitioned hotel. Garrod 
and U.N. military observers patrolling Mostar say that late-night attack had 
the same boomerang effect as the more recent Serbian shelling in reminding the 
city's war-weary inhabitants of the heavy price to be paid if they fall to 
fighting each other again. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are sick to death of war. That is one thing I can say unites 
them," said Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who plans a joint Asian 
visit with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic next month to drum up 
contracts that both hope will give substance to what so far has been an airy 
political agreement already showing signs of fraying. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalist instigators on both sides of the river have tried to sabotage the 
fragile alliance and the leadership in Sarajevo fears that extremist elements 
still hold far too much power. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two months ago, Bosnian Croat fighters forcibly moved 5,000 people from 
ethnically mixed territory along the Neretva to bolster the Croatian presence 
in two central Bosnian provinces where they hope to gain power over what is now 
a Muslim minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian nationalists opposed to the federation are also reported to be 
supplying the Serbs with occasional caches of fuel and ammunition on condition 
they be used to attack the Muslim side, according to U.N. and Bosnian 
government sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a sign of the Serbs' discomfort with their increasing isolation in the 
world, they have launched a two-pronged campaign of disinformation aimed at 
convincing Muslims and Croats they are still vulnerable to each other's 
attacks.

GUNFIRE ERUPTS IN SARAJEVO; NATO JETS BUZZ THE CAPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mortar and gun fire erupted in Sarajevo near the U.N.-controlled airport 
Monday night, and NATO jets buzzed low over the besieged capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The fighting came as the Muslim-led government prepared new offensives against 
its Bosnian Serb foes.In central Bosnia-Herzegovina, the government bused more 
soldiers Monday toward the site of one of its best advances in the 2 1/2-year 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian commanders have threatened to retaliate with a major counterattack or 
renewed bombardment of Sarajevo, which they have under siege. The capital is 
one of six U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia, and any attack on it could 
provoke NATO air strikes in response. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in The Hague, the first international war crimes tribunal since the 
Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals indicted a Bosnian Serb detention camp commander 
Monday on charges of murder, torture and other atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal, formed by the United Nations a year ago, 
issued a warrant against Dragan Nikolic, accused of killing eight Muslim 
prisoners. Nikolic was commander of the Susica Camp set up by Bosnian Serb 
forces after they took over the Bosnian city of Vlasenica on April 21, 1992.

STUDY FINDS NO PROOF OF CHILD ABUSE BY SATANISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A study of alleged child abuse by satanists found no evidence that any 
organized cults ritually abuse or kill children, and experts say the federally 
funded review raises questions about the stories of survivors who say they are 
drawing on recovered memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was evidence of individual acts of extreme abuse with religious 
connections, but absolutely no evidence about large satanic cults -- nothing," 
said co-author Phillip Shaver, chairman of the UC Davis psychology department. 
</P>
<P>
 The study of 12,000 accusations is the first attempt to catalogue and assess 
cases of ritual abuse nationwide. It "should make people even more cautious 
about the vagaries of memory," said Pamela Freyd, executive director of the 
Philadelphia-based False Memory Syndrome Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers mailed 45,000 questionnaires to law enforcement groups, 
psychiatrists and psychologists. They found that 2% of the therapists were 
treating most of the alleged ritual abuse survivors, including one psychologist 
who reported 2,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know where they're getting all these cases," Shaver said. "Either 
everyone in the community knows that they are willing to deal with this sort of 
case . . . (or) they are helping to create those cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Believers in organized satanic cults -- alleged survivors and their healers -- 
scoffed at the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthropology has thousands of cases on record of spiritual sacrificial 
groups," said Craig Lockwood, author of a book on ritual abuse. "Why would this 
human impulse come to a grinding halt in the 20th Century here in the United 
States?"

NETWORKS WILL NOT COVER CASE GAVEL-TO-GAVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON and JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television viewers hoping to see gavel-to-gavel coverage of the O.J. Simpson 
murder trial on ABC, CBS and NBC -- as they did during Simpson's preliminary 
hearing -- will have to settle mainly for hourly updates. 
</P>
<P>
 The networks, concerned about significant loss of ad revenue and about 
incurring soap opera fans' wrath over the preemption of their daily dramas, 
have opted for the hourly updates during most days of the trial.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the networks still plan to preempt their daytime schedules to go live 
during important days of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS and NBC said the time for the Simpson news breaks will come out of network 
promotional time and from shortening soap operas by a few seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 An ABC News spokesman said the network will provide regular updates, although 
it has not committed to them on the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 When ABC, CBS and NBC preempted their soap opera schedules for a week to cover 
the Simpson preliminary hearings last summer, they each lost an estimated $1 
million in advertising revenue and alienated many soap opera fans. 
</P>
<P>
 After the preliminary hearing, there was talk at the networks about providing 
gavel-to-gavel coverage. However, network officials now say the strategy never 
was seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers seeking gavel-to-gavel coverage may turn to CNN, which will devote six 
hours a day to the trial, and to Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the Simpson story merits such a commitment of air time, CNN 
spokesman Steve Haworth said: "We obviously feel it's warranted. If there is a 
development in a news story or a major story breaks in the world, we will break 
in to cover it."  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a plan by several local stations to rotate the coverage is up in 
the air, after the withdrawal of KNBC-TV Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Black, the station's general manager, said: "We've had very favorable 
response to hourly updates during the pretrial hearings." KABC-TV Channel 7 and 
KCOP-TV Channel 13 also have said they will not participate in the rotation.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: THE MISUSE OF JURY CONSULTANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's money has allowed him to play something denied most criminal 
case defendants: the jury manipulation game. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, defendants' attorneys pick jurors by a much speedier 
process, operating mostly by instinct. The Simpson defense team has hired an 
expensive jury consultant and undoubtedly has conducted polls and analyzed each 
prospective juror for pro and anti feelings toward Simpson. During the actual 
trial, the defense team may even create a "shadow jury," a mock jury through 
which his attorneys can measure the effectiveness of their strategies and 
arguments. And, of course, the prosecution will have to match these efforts to 
remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 This use of polling and focus groups was developed by political campaign 
managers and advertising agencies. Their introduction to the courtroom more 
than 20 years ago was a major development in the law and, according to some 
legal scholars, has tilted the legal system toward those who can afford a jury 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a new book, "The Jury," by Stephen J. Adler, puts it: 
</P>
<P>
 "Jurors who might once have served proudly and well are being excluded in voir 
dire, not just on a hunch, but on the analysis of a data driven scientist," 
Adler writes. "Ironically, just as jury service laws have been changed to allow 
a broader cross-section of people into the jury room, technology has evolved to 
exclude new groups on the basis of their demographic characteristics, values 
and psyches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Juries are thus rendered less representative of their communities. And many 
well-qualified individuals become disappointed in a system that, despite its 
promise of inclusion, rejects them as jurors precisely because they would be 
fair and thoughtful decision makers." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection has never been a job for idealists. Adler recalled a 1936 
Esquire magazine article on the subject by Clarence Darrow, the famous defense 
lawyer. Working by the seat of his pants, long before today's jury consultants, 
Darrow used his instincts, often bigoted, to file peremptory challenges, which 
can oust a prospective juror from the panel without a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrow said he got rid of "the cold as the grave" Presbyterian, the "almost 
always sure to convict" Scandinavian, the "solemn" Christian Scientist and the 
very rich. "Next to the Board of Trade, for him, the penitentiary is the most 
important of all public buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 As Darrow saw it, "the lawyer's idea of justice is a verdict for his client 
and really this is the sole end for which he aims." 
</P>
<P>
 Gut instinct was supplemented by social science in the early 1970s when 
academics offered to help the defense teams of Vietnam War protesters on trial 
for civil disobedience.  
</P>
<P>
 Their tools were the public opinion poll, the in-depth interview and the 
sample audience, which became, in their parlance, the shadow jury. "The idea 
was to leave little to chance," Adler writes. "The jury could be shaped through 
peremptory challenges and trial strategy could be refined on the basis of a 
consultant's pretrial analysis of how various approaches would be likely to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-'70s, the tools, nurtured by the left, were adopted by corporate 
America in complex antitrust and liability cases. This moved jury consultants 
into the mainstream of the law -- and into a lucrative business. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they're part of every big civil trial and in criminal trials where the 
defendants have money. Both the prosecution and the defense have hired them, 
and they participate in every jury selection move. Defense consultant Jo Ellan 
Dimitrius is at Simpson's side during questioning of prospective jurors, going 
over the list with the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The professionals who are part of the system say there's nothing wrong with 
this. Attorneys are 
</P>
<P>
 supposed to win for their clients, and anything goes, as long as it is legal.  
</P>
<P>
 On one level, I agree with them. If you're in a fight, you try to win. But on 
another level, I'm offended by a practice that smacks of stealth rather than 
the openness we hope for in government institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand how they feel. Usually, I write about politics, something I've 
done for many years. In the arena of politics, I tend to be an insider myself. 
I accept what political consultants do and view them as a necessary part of the 
system. I trade war stories with them about past campaigns and admire their 
skill at polling, getting out the vote and making commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, uninvolved with campaign coverage, I am much more aware of 
their negative force. They can use their polls and analyses to prepare 
advertisements that can switch votes and tip an election if the timing is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a misuse of powerful techniques, treating voters like puppets on strings. 
Such games help make people cynical about politics, and about the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A clarification: In a column last month, I incorrectly said that Judge Lance 
A. Ito banned cameras from the Simpson jury selection. Cameras are prohibited 
from covering jury selection by Rule 980 of the California rules of the court 
and the judge has no discretion in the matter. The Simpson Case

S. CAROLINA CASE OF DECEPTIONS ALSO A CASE OF PERCEPTIONS; CRIME: A MOTHER'S 
TALE OF A CARJACKER IS NOW SEEN AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF VILIFYING BLACK MEN. BUT 
IN THE TIGHT-KNIT TOWN, CRIES OF RACISM ARE TEMPERED.

<P>
 As a barber in this small community -- and before that a mail carrier for 21 
years -- Modest Keenan likes to say he knows everybody in Union. 
</P>
<P>
 So when he stopped in at a convenience store almost two weeks ago and the 
clerk showed him a sketch of a man accused of kidnaping two little boys, Keenan 
could say with authority: "This doesn't look like anybody in Union." 
</P>
<P>
 He immediately suspected a hoax. Others here, too, found Susan Smith's tale of 
a black gunman who stole her car and her children unbelievable, but they were 
in the minority. For nine days, first the county and then the nation was caught 
up in the anguish and the drama as a massive manhunt ensued. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the aftermath of Smith's confession to drowning her sons Oct. 25 and 
fabricating the carjacking, many local residents are furious. But nowhere has 
the anger and sense of betrayal been greater than in the African American 
community.  
</P>
<P>
 Sucked into Smith's terrible lie, many black people here had eyed their black 
neighbors with suspicion for more than a week. They had wept along with whites 
for the boys while they were missing.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the lie had been about them. And some in Union's African American 
community seem as livid about that as they are about the crime itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Their anger is directed both at Smith and more generally at the cultural and 
political climate that so often demonizes African Americans, portraying the 
black male as the personification of evil. Few here criticize the authorities 
for the way they handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a racial situation," said the Rev. James W. Richards, a Baptist 
minister who lives in Union and leads two churches in a neighboring county. 
"Two boys were murdered. The mother told a lie. The same sick mind that killed 
the children put it on a black person. . . . If she had described a Chinese, 
(the police) would've had to look for a Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the similarities were striking between the case and an 
infamous murder in Boston in 1989. Almost five years to the day before 
3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander Smith died, a white Boston man 
named Charles Stuart sparked a massive manhunt with a tale of a black gunman 
whom he said had killed his pregnant wife. Police reacted by storming into 
nearby housing projects, questioning numerous black men. Eventually, a black 
man was charged with the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart committed suicide after his brother told police that Stuart himself had 
committed the murder. Boston still is recovering from the damage done to race 
relations there.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in Union, authorities were more restrained, closely examining Smith's 
story even as they instigated a nationwide manhunt for the two boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of those blacks most upset over Smith's false accusation concede 
that the police probably would have handled the case no differently had the 
fictitious carjacker been white.  
</P>
<P>
 Keenan, for one, believes the community was so consumed by the disappearance 
of the children, not because of the race of the suspect, but because "in this 
rural community people value the life of a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Where he sees racial differentiation is in the response of the media: He 
doesn't imagine there would have been such massive nationwide coverage had the 
missing boys been black.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference in Atlanta, praised the local and state law enforcement authorities 
"for their calm and professional conduct" in handling a case that could have 
been racially explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton last week also phoned Union County Sheriff Howard Wells to 
praise him. And, at a forum held Sunday at a black Baptist church at which 
Wells and his wife were the only white people in attendance, Richards said 
"people were receptive to him and the way he handled things during the whole 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Some African Americans remain upset. After Smith's arrest Thursday, local 
radio airwaves were filled with talk about the case, with some black men saying 
they felt increased tension from whites. And it is easy to find people here who 
say you don't have look as far as Boston for other examples of black men being 
falsely accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Hattie Mae Thomas says it has happened to her husband and her son. And Keenan 
claims to know of a man falsely accused of kidnaping and robbing a white woman 
within the past year. In that case, he said, the woman was later found to have 
concocted the tale to cover up for a gambling loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Sunday's forum, Richards said a panel of mostly black professionals 
were in agreement that the biggest stereotypers of black males are no longer 
whites but blacks themselves. Citing gangsta rap and the work of some young 
filmmakers, he said: "If we don't want to be stereotyped, we need to stop 
stereotyping ourselves."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richards acknowledged that there are racial problems in Union. He cited the 
lack of black teachers in the high school, saying black leaders have discussed 
staging a boycott of the schools if education officials don't do more to 
integrate the teaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "Just because we can get a lot of press, it would not be right 
for us to try to turn (the Smith case) into something that it's not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids are dead." Referring to Smith's estranged husband, he added: 
"David lost his children and his ex-wife in one fell swoop. . . . David stood 
with his arm around a woman he trusted only to find out that she was the 
culprit. To add insult to injury by trying to call this a racial incident would 
be obscene."  
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders in Union County closely monitored the investigation while it was 
under way and talked to one African American man who was picked up for 
questioning, he said. The man said he was treated well, asked some questions 
and then released. 
</P>
<P>
 The only people reported to have been given polygraph tests were white -- 
Smith and a male friend she said she was going to visit when the children 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Smith's attorney, David Bruck, on Monday confirmed reports that 
Smith was being held under suicide watch in prison. Friends say she has in the 
past attempted suicide and suffered depressions during breakups with her 
husband. Citing adultery, she filed for divorce last month and sought custody 
of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the children's death, she reportedly received a "Dear John" 
letter from a man she had been seeing. The presence of her children was one 
reason he cited for wanting to break off the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN reported Sunday that she'd said in her written confession that she'd 
intended to kill herself Oct 25. "I wanted to end my life so bad and was in my 
car, ready to go down that ramp into the water, and I did go part way, but I 
stopped," Mrs. Smith said in the written confession, CNN reported. "I went 
again and I stopped. Then I got out of the car a nervous wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dropped to the lowest when I allowed my children to go down that ramp into 
the water without me. I took off running and screaming, 'Oh, God. Oh, God, no. 
What have I done?"

POLLUTED HYDRAULIC FLUID RULED OUT AS CAUSE OF USAIR JET CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rudder on USAir Flight 427 that crashed near Pittsburgh, Pa., apparently 
operated normally despite contaminated hydraulic fluid found in the rudder 
mechanism, federal air safety officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudder problems had originally been considered a possible cause of the Sept. 8 
accident in which 132 died. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Thomas, director of the Federal Aviation Administration office of 
accident investigation, said investigators are no longer concentrating on the 
contaminated fluid in the Boeing 737. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a portion of the investigation we are putting aside," said Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of the contamination did not have an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 But FAA officials stressed that the National Transportation Safety Board is 
conducting the probe and has not yet ruled out any possible cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said his office was assisting the independent National Transportation 
Safety Board in its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that the crash was caused by a rudder malfunction came up early in 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet rolled sharply to the left before nose-diving as it approached 
Pittsburgh International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Federal Aviation Administrator David R. Hinson noted that the 
government is moving toward imposing tighter regulations on small, regional 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those airlines have come under some criticism for their safety records, a 
focus heightened after the crash last week of an American Eagle plane in 
Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony J. Broderick, associate administrator for regulation and 
certification, explained that the first step will be to require regional 
airlines to meet the same crew training rules as larger operators, and similar 
flight and duty time rules will follow.

BOY, 14, SENTENCED TO 9 YEARS IN PRISON FOR KILLING CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heeding a heartbroken father's plea, a judge sentenced a 14-year-old boy 
Monday to nine years to life in prison -- the maximum possible -- for luring a 
4-year-old boy into the woods and crushing his skull with a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer, Eric Smith, cast his eyes downward but showed no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, 13 at the time of the slaying, was tried on the murder charge as an 
adult. He had confessed in 1993 to leading Derrick Robie on a supposed shortcut 
to a day camp they attended in the western New York village of Savona. In an 
overgrown lot, Eric choked the boy and bashed his head with a 26-pound rock. He 
then sodomized the body with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Derrick came into this world I cried and when Derrick left this world I 
cried," Dale Robie, his voice trembling, said in asking the court for the 
maximum sentence. "I have felt the whole realm of loving and losing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I pray that this person will never have the opportunity to take the life of 
another child," Robie told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense had argued unsuccessfully that Eric suffers from "intermittent 
explosive disorder," characterized by uncontrollable violent impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Kevin Bradley, Monday described his young client as "a sick boy in 
need of treatment." Eric will serve at least the first part of his sentence at 
a lockup for juveniles; he could be transferred to prison at 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric could be free by age 22 and "back among us at some point in his 20s," 
prosecutor John Tunney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the rural community at first believed that a stranger was 
responsible for the murder until a relative of Eric Smith found inconsistencies 
in his recollection of events and brought him to the attention of 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, a child as young as 13 can be tried as an adult for murder 
but faces a more lenient sentence. An adult convicted of murder can get 25 
years to life.

WILSON AND BROWN CAP LONG, GRUELING RACE; POLITICS: CONFIDENT GOVERNOR 
CAMPAIGNS FOR FELLOW REPUBLICANS. OPPONENT PRESSES FOR DEFEAT OF PROP. 187. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The long and often contentious battle for governor ended Monday with Democrat 
Kathleen Brown urging Californians to cast aside the negativity and 
divisiveness she said was symbolized by Gov. Pete Wilson, and the Republican 
incumbent asking voters to give him four more years to lead a sprawling and 
troubled state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, while maintaining a cautious public visage, was confident enough to 
spend the day before the election campaigning for other Republicans, stopping 
off in several key legislative districts to help buttress get-out-the-vote 
efforts and taking along with him members of the state GOP ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The personal campaigning followed a $525,000 donation from Wilson's campaign 
treasury to a united Republican effort that bought television commercials on 
behalf of several party candidates -- a gesture which also underscored Wilson's 
belief that his own victory is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 So confident was the governor at a Bellflower rally that he did not even 
mention Brown's name, instead firing at President Clinton as though he were 
Wilson's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor specifically slammed Clinton for opposing controversial 
Proposition 187, which would deny public education and non-emergency state 
services to illegal immigrants. Clinton campaigned against the measure -- and 
for state Democratic candidates -- Friday in Los Angeles and Saturday in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's attack was laced with the kind of rhetoric that Democrats often have 
used this year against the governor himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has given us a new reason for California to distrust him: Anyone 
who will stoop so low as to deliberately be a demagogue and inject race into a 
proposition that is instead about fairness -- that we do not need," the 
governor said in Bellflower at the second of four rallies that culminated in 
his traditional election eve party in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, spent most of her day pressing voters to turn back 
Proposition 187 and its most prominent supporter, Wilson. As she has in recent 
weeks, Brown exuded a new-found assurance and drew the cheers of hundreds of 
supporters at each of her stops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the most marvelous opportunity . . . to send a message that says we 
understand that in diversity is our strength and in unity we will find power," 
Brown declared at an open-air rally held under cloudy skies at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These politicians who have the gall to repeat our history," she said, 
referring to past incidents of discrimination against ethnic groups in 
California, "will feel our wrath because we will say no to them and we will say 
no to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Brown capped her campaign on a surreal note, being pelted 
with catcalls as she appeared live on the "Geraldo" television show to lobby 
against the anti-illegal immigration proposition. She later described the 
interlude as "wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what Proposition 187 unleashes," she said. "It unleashes anger and 
passion. It unleashes them in a way that I think is risky for California." 
</P>
<P>
 For both candidates, Monday was the final exhausting day of years-long efforts 
to capture the governor's office, grueling enough to make victory especially 
sweet to whoever manages to win today. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they had collected more than $47.5 million in donations by Oct. 22 
-- before additional millions were spent on television ads -- and they have 
spent virtually all of it. In Brown's case, she apparently has spent herself 
into debt, and a lack of money forced her to take commercials off the air over 
the weekend. She had only a small presence on the airwaves on Monday, campaign 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, a victory today would cap a remarkable come-back that began more 
than a year ago when he was more than 20 points down in the polls, blamed by 
voters for the state's foundering economy and a sense of foreboding about 
California's once-limitless future. Victory would place him on the short list 
for Republican presidential candidates for 1996 -- a race he said he will not 
enter, even if he did sound surprisingly like a Clinton opponent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown success would make her the third star in a family triumvirate 
unprecedented in American politics, joining her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr., and her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., as occupants of the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It would vault her into national political orbit as well, and mean that she 
achieved the prize under the most difficult of circumstances, with a 
come-from-behind win over a crafty and well-financed incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson closed out his campaign with appearances in key legislative districts 
in San Jose, Bellflower, Orange County and San Diego. In Bellflower, where he 
sought to hike the chances of Republican Assembly candidate Phil Hawkins, he 
was greeted with chants of "Pete, Pete!" and "Four more years!" 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's address there was crafted, in his words, to "run up the score" 
against Democrats. He went so far as to suggest that "enlightened Democrats" 
change parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a particular message for those who are Democrats," he said. "You are 
welcome. You are welcome not just in this headquarters, you are welcome in this 
party because in fact there are a lot of right-thinking Democrats who reject 
the kind of liberal nonsense which for two decades has cost California dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has meant that instead of being a safe and civilized society, we've had 
people not safe in their own homes and their own places of work. That is 
dangerous nonsense and we are going to end it. And we are going to continue the 
change that we have begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson joked later that Clinton "seems obsessed about California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I predict that he will lose it in 1996," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown traveled to two college rallies, and closed out her final day of more 
than two years of campaigning with a visit to a Reseda Jewish home for the 
aging and the appearance on "Geraldo." In between the events, she chatted with 
talk show hosts in seven California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 To one, she expressed optimism about today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle goes well," she said. "I feel very positive. It is too close to 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Geraldo" show, among other things, tested Brown's calm under fire as the 
treasurer was insulted right and left during the program. It got so bad at one 
point that host Geraldo Rivera cautioned, "This is a debate. This is not a 
rumble." 
</P>
<P>
 One white man rose and told Brown his son-in-law was denied a job as a police 
officer because he does not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about discrimination, Kathleen! What are you going to do about it?" he 
screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown told the audience that she believes illegal immigrants come to 
California for jobs -- and thus sanctions against their employers would be 
helpful -- some screamed, "Welfare, welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "Proposition 187 simply unleashes these emotions that are very 
hard to put back into the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, at calmer venues, Brown continued her effort to persuade 
voters that Wilson represents a negative approach to governing, and that his 
endorsement of Proposition 187 has emotionally split the state that both of 
them wish to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so tired of politicians who play on hate, who play on fear, who play on 
frustration," she said. "We will prevail tomorrow and we will take back 
California." More Election News

</P>
<P>
 The personal campaigning followed a $525,000 donation from Wilson's campaign 
treasury to a united Republican effort that bought television commercials on 
behalf of several party candidates -- underscoring Wilson's belief that his own 
victory is assured. 
</P>
<P>
 So confident was the governor at several rallies that he did not even mention 
Brown's name, instead firing at President Clinton as though he were Wilson's 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor specifically slammed Clinton for opposing Proposition 187, which 
would deny public education and non-emergency state services to illegal 
immigrants. Clinton campaigned against the measure -- and for state Democratic 
candidates -- Friday in Los Angeles and Saturday in Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have seen the President come out and pretend he's doing an adequate 
job on illegal immigration," Wilson told a rally at the Newport Harbor 
Republican Women's Headquarters in Newport Beach. Washington, he said "is 
sticking California for the cost of their failure of controlling the border." 
</P>
<P>
 At a later rally in Bellflower, Wilson's attack was laced with the kind of 
rhetoric that Democrats often have used this year against the governor himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Clinton) has given us a new reason for California to distrust him: 
Anyone who will stoop so low as to deliberately be a demagogue and inject race 
into a proposition that is instead about fairness -- that we do not need," the 
governor said in Bellflower, at the second of four rallies that culminated in 
his traditional election eve party in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the state treasurer, spent most of her day pressing voters to turn back 
Proposition 187 and its most prominent supporter, Wilson. As she has in recent 
weeks, Brown exuded a new-found assurance and drew cheers at each stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the most marvelous opportunity . . . to send a message that says we 
understand that in diversity is our strength and in unity we will find power," 
Brown declared at an open-air rally at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These politicians who have the gall to repeat our history," she said, 
referring to past incidents of discrimination against ethnic groups in 
California, "will feel our wrath because we will say no to them and we will say 
no to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Brown capped her campaign on a surreal note, being pelted 
with catcalls as she appeared live on the "Geraldo" television show to lobby 
against Proposition 187. She later described the interlude as "wild." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what Proposition 187 unleashes," she said. "It unleashes anger and 
passion. It unleashes them in a way that I think is risky for California." 
</P>
<P>
 For both candidates, Monday was the final exhausting day of years-long efforts 
to capture the governor's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Together, they had collected more than $47.5 million in donations by Oct. 22 
-- before additional millions were spent on television ads -- and they have 
spent virtually all of it. In Brown's case, she apparently has spent herself 
into debt, and a lack of money forced her to take commercials off the air over 
the weekend. She had only a small presence on the airwaves on Monday, campaign 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wilson, a victory today would cap a remarkable come-back that began more 
than a year ago when he was more than 20 points down in the polls, blamed by 
voters for the state's foundering economy and a sense of foreboding about 
California's once-limitless future. Victory would place him on the short list 
for Republican presidential candidates for 1996 -- a race he said he will not 
enter, even if he did sound surprisingly like a Clinton opponent on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown success would make her the third star in a family triumvirate 
unprecedented in American politics, joining her father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
Sr., and her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., as occupants of the 
governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It would vault her into national political orbit as well, and mean that she 
achieved the prize under the most difficult of circumstances, with a 
come-from-behind win over a crafty and well-financed incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson closed out his campaign with appearances in key legislative districts 
in San Jose, Bellflower, Orange County and San Diego. In Bellflower, where he 
sought to hike the chances of Republican Assembly candidate Phil Hawkins, he 
was greeted with chants of "Pete, Pete!" and "Four more years!" 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's address there was crafted, in his words, to "run up the score" 
against Democrats. He went so far as to suggest that "enlightened Democrats" 
change parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a particular message for those who are Democrats," he said. "You are 
welcome. You are welcome not just in this headquarters, you are welcome in this 
party because in fact there are a lot of right-thinking Democrats who reject 
the kind of liberal nonsense which for two decades has cost California dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has meant that instead of being a safe and civilized society, we've had 
people not safe in their own homes and their own places of work. That is 
dangerous nonsense and we are going to end it. And we are going to continue the 
change that we have begun." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson joked later that Clinton "seems obsessed about California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I predict that he will lose it in 1996," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown traveled to two college rallies, and closed out her final day of more 
than two years of campaigning with a visit to a Reseda Jewish home for the 
aging and the "Geraldo" appearance. In between the events, she chatted with 
talk show hosts in seven California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 To one, she expressed optimism about today's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The battle goes well," she said. "I feel very positive. It is too close to 
call." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Geraldo" show, among other things, tested Brown's calm under fire as the 
treasurer was insulted right and left during the program. It got so bad at one 
point that host Geraldo Rivera cautioned, "This is a debate. This is not a 
rumble." 
</P>
<P>
 One white man rose and told Brown his son-in-law was denied a job as a police 
officer because he does not speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about discrimination, Kathleen! What are you going to do about it?" he 
screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown told the audience that she believes illegal immigrants come to 
California for jobs -- and thus sanctions against their employers would be 
helpful -- some screamed, "Welfare, welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown: "Proposition 187 simply unleashes these emotions that are very 
hard to put back into the bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, at calmer venues, Brown continued her effort to persuade 
voters that Wilson represents a negative approach to governing, and that his 
endorsement of Proposition 187 has emotionally split the state.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so tired of politicians who play on hate, who play on fear, who play on 
frustration," she said. "We will prevail tomorrow and we will take back 
California."
