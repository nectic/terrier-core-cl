BREYER HEARINGS: NOT JUST A STROLL; APPROVAL LIKELY, BUT THERE ARE ISSUES TO BE 
PROBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So likely is Stephen G. Breyer's confirmation as an associate justice that his 
confirmation hearings, which begin today, have occasioned more talk of the U.S. 
Supreme Court's current direction and evolving coalitions than of the nominee 
himself.  
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's nomination of Breyer, the chief judge of the U.S. Court of 
Appeals in Boston, has generated none of the impassioned opposition from the 
left or the right that characterized hearings for some other recent court 
nominees. Breyer is no Clarence Thomas, no Robert H. Bork. Unlike Justice 
Thomas, appointed by President Bush in 1991, Breyer has a top-drawer record as 
a jurist and legal scholar. Unlike Bork, defeated in 1987 after an intense 
partisan battle, Breyer is a careful pragmatist and a deliberate centrist. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee promise to be erudite and 
genteel -- and confirmation by the committee and, indeed, the full Senate, 
close to a slam-dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding Breyer's strong bipartisan support, senators should question 
him closely about his financial investments. Breyer, who had invested as much 
as $500,000 in the insurance conglomerate Lloyds of London in the 1980s, 
reportedly ruled in several cases that may have affected the firm's exposure to 
liability for the cleanup of Superfund sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members would also be well-advised to push Breyer for his views on 
the fundamental and emotional principles that animate this nation's system of 
laws and that frequently arise in Supreme Court cases -- principles like due 
process, fairness, equality and privacy. Breyer has said he does not believe in 
"judicial activism," hoping, perhaps, to deflect questions about his views on 
hot issues like racial quotas and abortion that have threatened previous 
nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed as expected, Stephen Breyer promises to add more intellectual 
heft to the court's coalescing, moderate majority. He is a match, in intellect 
and personal presence, for Justice Antonin Scalia. Breyer's experience and 
knowledge could defuse some of the bitter disagreements now apparent among the 
members of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer has a formidable reputation for burrowing into the narrow, technical 
questions in cases before him. In focusing on such important questions as the 
legality of cost-benefit analysis in the drafting of regulations, he often has 
sought to light a path for his court, but in so doing, some argue, he also has 
sidestepped the important philosophical dilemmas that frequently lurk at the 
heart of appellate cases. The Supreme Court, of course, is far from just 
another appellate court. Its justices have a higher obligation: to lead the 
nation on the tough constitutional issues of the day by addressing them 
directly.

HEALTH WATCH; JERK THE PERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would be an understatement to say that many in Congress cannot go along 
with major elements of President Clinton's complex and controversial health 
care reform proposal. But there is one small part of the measure that even the 
most jaded observers must concede has wide popular appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Adminstration's health care plan takes direct aim at smokers on Capitol 
Hill. It would hit nicotine addicts in the wallet by eliminating the federal 
tax break on cigarettes sold in the House and Senate. A pack costs less on the 
Hill, according to the Roll Call newspaper, because the Internal Revenue 
Service doesn't tax cigarettes sold there. That subsidy shaves nearly a quarter 
off the price of a pack, and diverts thousands of dollars from public coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The version of health care reform that passed the House Ways and Means 
Committee also would eliminate that exemption, and would tack an additional 45 
cents in tax onto every pack of cigarettes to help underwrite the cost of 
health care for Americans who lack insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bargain smokes are a popular purchase at House tobacco counters. At least 
175,000 packs were sold there last year, according to government records. That 
should have produced more than $40,000 in federal cigarette taxes. No such 
records are available on the Senate side. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating this tiny perk may seem like much ado about nothing. But those 
quarters add up. It's also a matter of equity. If legislators and others on 
Capitol Hill must buy cigarettes, they should have to pay as much there as they 
do elsewhere.

NORPLANT FOR AFDC MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a teacher of biology, I found Alexander Cockburn's "Eugenics Nuts Would 
Have Loved Norplant" (Column Left, June 30) very interesting. However, I think 
Cockburn missed the point of Norplant for Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of Norplant for AFDC mothers is one of responsibility. That 
responsibility is for the AFDC mother, having had one child at a child's age, 
to ensure she not have another as long as she and the child are the 
responsibility of the state. One can even support the argument that a mistake 
having been made -- once -- that the child and mother should be supported so 
that the mother can rear the child. 
</P>
<P>
 It is bad judgment, and perhaps forgivable for her to have the first child. 
Subsequent children show a complete lack of responsibility and poor judgment on 
her part, and should be prevented by the most humane means available. Norplant 
sounds like a good idea to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Note that Norplant is not inhumane, it is not sterilization, and if policy is 
applied equitability irrespective of race or ethnicity, the policy is fair. 
Enough is enough. Statistics aside, one child supported by the public is 
enough. Somewhere, somehow the parents of children have to take responsibility 
for conceiving children. Norplant sounds like an acceptable approach to me. 
</P>

 * Frankly, I don't care how many children a woman chooses to have. However, I 
do care how my tax dollars are spent. A woman can chose to have as many 
children as she wants, as long as I don't have to support them. People who 
think as Cockburn does that there should be no limit to the number of children 
a woman has on welfare should pay the welfare costs and not expect the burden 
to be borne by taxpayers.

 Next year, after all the hoopla has subsided here in this country, interest in 
a sport that uses only half the human body will probably have died like the

living room television no bigger than a bloodstain.

LIQUOR AND VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times' recent editorial on breaking the cycle of domestic violence (June 
24) came up far short in naming the root cause of this social disease. The 
numbers are mind-boggling but one need only to read the newspapers to know that 
alcohol abuse is involved in the majority of cases.The shooting death of a 
pregnant 14-year-old by her drunken 17-year-old boyfriend in Santa Ana recently 
is a tragic example. 
</P>
<P>
 Glamorized by our entertainment and athletic "heroes," Tailhook-type beer 
drinking is now the norm for high school students.  
</P>
<P>
 The solution is a Prop. 99-like measure that helped reduce the use of nicotine 
and saved lives. Millions must be raised to save our children from the reptiles 
that are targeting them to perpetuate this curse on our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Our judges and politicians who have received political payoffs from the liquor 
industry must now become responsible for their actions. Who better to pay for 
these sins than the people who are committing them?

VISTA SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's too bad John J. Pitney Jr. didn't do his homework before writing "Left's 
Muddled Assault on the Religious Right" (Column Right, June 30). He cites an 
ACLU warning against the conservative "Christian" school board in Vista as an 
attack on the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm here to tell you it's not the ACLU who is doing the attacking in Vista. 
Since coming to power, the conservative board majority has begun an assault on 
anyone who does not share their narrow religious views. They actively 
campaigned for the voucher initiative, which would have given public money to 
religious schools. They forbade the school district to apply for a grant which 
would have helped poor children receive medical services. They tried to place 
"creation science" into the curriculum. They have placed "Sex Respect," an 
antiquated and most likely illegal program, into the sex education curriculum. 
They axed bus services affecting less affluent areas of town, while building a 
new school in an affluent area which will house only 180 students.  
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether the political agenda of the religious right 
reflects the true spirit of Christianity, but I have my doubts. Meanwhile, 
anyone who disagrees with them is labeled godless. This kind of religious 
intimidation serves no one, and it needs to be stopped.

REPARATIONS FOR SLAVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Demanding Repayment for Slavery," July 6: 
</P>
<P>
 As a second-generation American whose ancestors were starving in Ireland, de 
facto slaves of British absentee landlords, at a time when Valena Conley's 
ancestors were slaves of American plantation owners, I heartily support her 
desire for reparations. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, since my ancestors had nothing to do with her ancestors' 
enslavement, being enslaved themselves in Ireland at the time, it's hardly fair 
I be asked to help pay those reparations. Still, I'd be willing to kick in a 
share with one caveat: Let's make this a quit-claim, once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's pay off those who blame the history of 100 years ago for the 
difficulties they face in the present day, and then let's be done with it. 
Let's treat it like any legal settlement. Agree on an amount, say $10 billion 
or $20 billion or a $100 billion, whatever they want. But make it final. One 
last dip in the well of collective white guilt. And then, that's the end. No 
more apologies. No more excuses. No more social blackmail. 
</P>
<P>
 And when we're done, maybe you can help the British pay me. 
</P>

 * The article included comments from Walter Williams of George Mason 
University and Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for 
Neighborhood Enterprise, that deserve to be responded to. Williams objects to 
reparations on "moral grounds." Slavery was a morally repugnant institution 
that stripped blacks of their knowledge of self and kind, but this doesn't 
outrage Williams. Where was the moral outrage of the ancestors of that poor 
white coal miner's son when Africans were brought to this country in chains 
against their will? Why did the ancestors of this kid in West Virginia not 
protest? Instead, they went along with this institution, benefiting from the 
privileges of white supremacy. The masses of our people today still suffer from 
the effects of the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson gets his reparations annually from conservative political action 
committees. Black people in America have been the hardest worked, the lowest 
paid and the most maligned people in this country. Williams and Woodson, if you 
do not want any reparations, then don't accept them. There is no such thing as 
a 200-year mugging, Mr. Woodson. A mugging lasts a short while and it is over; 
its victims leave with their language, history and culture. Slavery was no 
mugging, and I find that comparison highly offensive. Slavery was a total 
assassination of the essence of black people. Until black people re-educate 
themselves to their pre-slavery, pre-colonial African selves, we will continue 
to languish in the morass of so-called Western civilization.

 * I, too, would like reparations because many of my ancestors died in the 
Civil War fighting to free the slaves. My family were Kansas farmers and I 
blame no one for being poor. My mother used to cut up inner tubes for elastic 
for my brothers' pants that she made by hand. We all worked hard and we were 
never on welfare, even though there were 12 in the family. Reparations indeed! 
Our whole family worked the fields. When we moved farther west, we all picked 
berries, beans, and did whatever we could to survive. So, because my family was 
poor and because my ancestors fought and died to free the slaves, I want to be 
paid for that!

 I can certainly validate that the mail is getting slower and slower (June

 The second began 10 days later, on July 13, in New York City. It was sparked 
by the imposition of a military draft and the provision that allowed a draftee 
to buy his way out for $300 -- the equivalent of a workingman's annual wage. 
The several days that followed of street fighting, arson and murder remain the 
deadliest and most destructive riot in American history. This year, as in 
former ones, the conflict at Gettysburg was re-enacted by Civil War buffs. 
About the other battle, the one that took place in New York, little will be 
said. There will be no military pantomimes, no cannons in the streets, no 
enthusiasts dressed as immigrant laborers firing from rooftops at police and 
soldiers, no simulated mobs hunting down victims, no pretended looting of homes 
and businesses or burning of orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 Except among professional historians, knowledge about the draft riots is 
scant. Few recall that the protagonists of the country's worst riot were white 
and Irish, part of the massive influx that flooded America's cities in the wake 
of the famine that devastated Ireland little more than a decade before. 
</P>
<P>
 Impoverished, unskilled, reviled by the Anglo-Saxon Protestant upper classes 
and riddled with all the social pathologies that are still commonly associated 
with the poor, the Irish added to the innate distrust Americans have always had 
for their cities. Indeed, the numbers, behavior and supposedly ineradicable 
foreignness of the Irish caused many observers to despair over the fate of New 
York. "The town is taken by its rats," Herman Melville wrote after the riots, 
"shiprats and rats of the wharves." 
</P>
<P>
 The faces of the urban poor have changed since 1863. After a protracted period 
of struggle and assimilation, the descendants of the Irish are no longer poor, 
oppressed or even largely urban. But the labels once hung on them -- 
"ignorant," "lazy," "uneducable," "violent," "disease infested" -- continue to 
be applied to those who have taken their place. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, unlike Gettysburg, we have no need to memorialize that week of 
bloodshed in New York. The draft riots are within our experience, part of the 
Civil War that didn't end at Appomattox but rages to this day. We've seen their 
ghastly images of racial hatred, ethnic conflict and mob violence mirrored in 
our time, most recently in the conflicts that wracked Brooklyn's Crown Heights 
and overwhelmed Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cities remain places where different races and immigrant groups claw at 
one another to pull their way out of poverty. The issue of race, so brutally 
reflected during the draft riots by mobs that assaulted and murdered African 
Americans, is still central and inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, our cities are closer to what they were in the 1860s than in the 
1940s or 1950s. Home to large populations of people who feel isolated and 
hopeless, they struggle with problems of crime, health, public squalor, with 
worn, inadequate infrastructure and inferior schools. And if no one can be sure 
when and in which city the next battle will erupt, unless we begin to find 
answers to these problems, who doubts that it will? 
</P>
<P>
 The War Between the States is over. Its battlefields are green and quiet. But 
the war in our cities goes on. Here, amid the tensions and rivalries, the 
question posed by Lincoln on the hallowed ground of Gettysburg -- whether a 
nation such as ours "or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long 
endure" -- is alive and unanswered.

PERSPECTIVE ON BLACK-JEWISH RELATIONS; RECOVERING A SENSE OF COMMUNITY; BLACK 
ANTI-SEMITISM HAS ROOTS PREDATING LOUIS FARRAKHAN, INCLUDING CHRISTIAN 
TEACHINGS AND AFROCENTRISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By XANDRA KAYDEN and MADISON T. SHOCKLEY II, Xandra Kayden is a senior fellow 
at the Institute for Leadership Studies at Loyola-Marymount University; she is 
Jewish. The Rev. Madison T. Shockley II is pastor of the Church of Christian 
Fellowship, United Church of Christ, Los Angeles, and chairman of religious 
affairs for the Los Angeles board of the NAACP.

<P>
 One of the most controversial subjects facing the national convention of the 
NAACP in Chicago this week is the challenge to the relationship between the 
African American and Jewish communities posed by the association of Ben Chavis, 
the NAACP's executive director, and Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a good deal of miscommunication between the two communities 
lately, and some clarification of what is happening is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue began last fall with a "covenant" formed between the National Assn. 
for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congressional Black Caucus and the 
Nation of Islam, amid reports that Farrakhan was "moderating" his 
anti-Semitism. The issue escalated when Farrakhan aide Khallid Abdul Muhammad 
spoke at a New Jersey college and excerpts were published by the 
Anti-Defamation League, drawing attention to the virulent anti-Semitism that 
Muhammad was espousing. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan held a press conference and waffled on whether he was chastising or 
endorsing Muhammad's views. The Black Caucus withdrew from the covenant. But a 
summit of black leadership in June, planned long before by Chavis, was put on 
the defensive for still giving Farrakhan a seat at the table.  
</P>
<P>
 On the Jewish side, the issue was black toleration of anti-Semitism and its 
supporters; on the African American side, it was interference in internal 
matters. From our perspective, it is clear that both sides have misunderstood 
what happened, why it happened and what the real issues are. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation of Islam, whether represented by Farrakhan or Muhammad, is not the 
primary source of black anti-Semitism, and American Jews need to understand 
that. There are three roots to black anti-Semitism: the Christian religion, 
economic and political conflict and, more recently, Afrocentrism. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us who grew up after World War II remember the efforts of mainline 
Protestants and Catholics to reach out to the Jewish community. The National 
Conference of Christians and Jews taught tolerance, appreciation and 
understanding. The problem is that a new generation has come up with weaker 
links to the mainline churches. The Roman Catholic Church has only recently 
recognized its historic role in fostering anti-Semitism and is seeking to build 
bridges between the two religions. The point is that unless a bridge is 
actively sought and maintained -- and if the traditional interpretation is not 
balanced -- anti-Semitism is a plausible outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Afrocentrism grew out of the need of the black community to understand its 
history and place in the world based on its own research, rather than the 
interpretation of whites who treated Africans as savages, figuratively if not 
literally. Afrocentrism overlooks the history of common domestic struggle of 
Jews and blacks and draws attention to several points of divergence between the 
two communities, such as support of the Palestinians vs. support for Israel and 
opposition to the former apartheid government of South Africa and its 
political, military and economic alliance with Israel (especially in regard to 
the Jewish involvement in the international diamond trade). Domestically, 
Afrocentrism is concerned with African American images in the media, in which 
Jewish investment is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 The intellectuals in the academic community who are seeking to clear away the 
consequences of a history written by white historians carry their arguments to 
extremes, as intellectuals are frequently wont to do, but they are influencing 
a generation of middle-class African American students. 
</P>
<P>
 The third cause of black anti-Semitism reflects interest-group conflicts: Jews 
dominated the teaching profession in the public schools, especially in New York 
at the end of the 1960s. When African Americans moved into Jewish ghettos, the 
Jews moved out but their stores and their ownership of property remained. So, 
over time, it became clear that money flowed only one way. 
</P>
<P>
 The linkages that fostered understanding have declined in the past 30 years. 
We are more segregated now than we were before. Black and Jewish children 
rarely go to school together today. The old leaders lost contact. The new 
generation never had any. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 27, the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council said that 
"the African American community is dealing with problems it must address and 
has a right to build effective coalitions to advance those efforts," that it is 
"up to that community to decide who comes to their meetings . . . " and that 
"it is hoped that those who attend will develop strategies enabling the 
traditional coalition of conscience to continue working together in addressing 
an agenda of shared domestic concerns." The council urged continuation of the 
historic support by the Jewish community for the NAACP at the national and 
local levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this message of respect was overwhelmed by attempts by the 
media to shame the NAACP and Chavis into rejecting a segment of the African 
American community. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit that Chavis called to bring together all the leaders of the African 
American community was planned well before Muhammad was ever heard of outside 
the Nation of Islam. It was not planned as a structure akin to the Jewish 
Federation, which has pointedly rejected the extremist Jewish Defense League 
from its membership. It may be that such a coalition of black organizations 
will emerge out of the summit's meetings (the next one is planned for August), 
but at this point the African American community is engaged in a process of 
self-exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that mainstream black organizations do now -- and have 
always -- rejected the extremist views of Farrakhan and his ilk. But there is 
also no question that a lot of work needs to be done between Jews and blacks to 
understand each other at the organizational and community levels and to rebuild 
the strength these two communities have when they work together.

COLUMN RIGHT/ PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS: IS THE COURT BECOMING THE POLITBURO?; 
FOLLOWING THE LOGIC OF RECENT RULINGS, ACTS OF CONGRESS WOULD HAVE TO BE 
RACIALLY PROPORTIONAL, WITH QUOTAS GUARANTEEING BLACKS THEIR FAIR SHARE OF 
LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts, former assistant Treasury secretary, 
is chairman of the Institute for Political Economy in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before long, it will be illegal for blacks to lose elections. This is the 
logicaloutcome of the Supreme Court's misinterpretation of the Voting Rights 
Act to require racially proportionate electoral results. 
</P>
<P>
 Passed in 1965, the Voting Rights Act was intended to eliminate literacy 
tests, which were seen as barriers to black voting. However, the courts have 
permitted civil-rights activists to turn the law into an instrument that 
requires that blacks win their share of elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Americans are finding that their right to elect their own 
leaders or to abide by majority rule may be challenged unless it produces 
racially proportionate results. Whenever majority rule fails to result in 
minority electoral successes, courts are stepping in and imposing remedies in 
the form of racially gerrymandered districts, cumulative voting schemes 
designed to guarantee the election of blacks and other circumventions of 
majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In two voting-rights decisions handed down June 30, the Supreme Court stuck to 
its proportional-results baseline. Justice Clarence Thomas, in an opinion 
joined by Justice Antonin Scalia, set out in clear language what the 
proportionality standard means for our future. 
</P>
<P>
 "In construing the act to cover claims of vote dilution, we have converted the 
act into a device for regulating, rationing and apportioning political power 
among racial and ethnic groups." This, Justice Thomas said, requires the 
Supreme Court to become "a centralized politburo appointed for life to dictate 
to the provinces the 'correct' theories of democratic representation, the 
'best' electoral systems for securing truly 'representative' government, the 
'fairest' proportions of minority political influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Thomas and Scalia don't think the court has claims to any such role 
in the political life of our country. Others, however, do, and as the court's 
dictatorial power grows, quotas in elections are as certain as they are in 
hiring, promotions and university admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as the result of court cases, many electoral jurisdictions already 
have quotas. For example, in Jackson, Tenn., and Crenshaw County, Ala., the 
chairmanships of the city and county commissions, respectively, are required to 
rotate racially regardless of election outcomes in order to guarantee that 
preferred minorities will share the top job equally with other commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Justice Thomas succeeds in persuading a majority of his colleagues to 
stick to the statutory language of the Voting Rights Act and cease construing 
the act to require proportional results, it is only a matter of time before the 
court must rule that the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader, and 
the chief justice must be racially rotating positions in order to avoid 
diluting black votes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the logic unfolds, acts of Congress will have to be racially proportional 
with quotas guaranteeing blacks their fair share of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that the court's pernicious misinterpretation of the Voting Rights 
Act is "an enterprise of segregating the races into political homelands that 
amounts, in truth, to nothing short of a system of political apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas admonished his colleagues that "our current practice should not 
continue. Not for another term, not until the next case, not for another day. 
The disastrous implications of the policies we have adopted under the act are 
too grave; the dissembling in our approach to the act too damaging to the 
credibility of the federal judiciary." 
</P>
<P>
 The court's sole black justice says that by misconstruing the act to require 
racially proportional results, the court is fostering racial balkanization and 
exacerbating racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach taken to civil rights in the postwar period is problematic, 
because it assumes that ideas and interests are race- based. Since whites are 
believed incapable of representing any interest other than that of their own 
race, blacks must be allotted a proportional share of electoral outcomes or go 
underrepresented. Few have realized that this assumption that ideas and values 
are race-specific means that there is no common ground for resolving 
differences through the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 This logical impasse is why the court is taking on the politburo role that 
Justice Thomas decries.

 BIG STAKES: State authorities insist that electronic slot machines are illegal 
in California, even on Native American reservations. But that hasn't stopped 
thousands of them from popping up across the state (A1). . . . One attempt to 
halt the spread of the one-armed bandits took place in Ventura County in March. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin G. DeNoce helped the LAPD obtain a search warrant for 
slot machine manufacturers in Moorpark and Chatsworth. Said DeNoce: "We seized 
thousands of pages of business documents and computer boards and shut down 
their business." 
</P>
<P>
 CITY SLICKERS: It's fascinating how cities promote themselves to attract 
tourists. Take Oxnard's slick brochure. . . . It has a photo of a 
not-too-tanned couple lolling on rafts in a sparkling pool. It has a picture of 
another white couple on the beach, and yet another white couple reclined on the 
deck of a yacht. . . . The all-white modeling crew didn't sit well with the 
Latino chamber and NAACP. After all, two-thirds of the city's residents are 
Latinos, black or Asian (B1). The city has agreed to use different pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 DESIGNING MEN: Auto makers have finally figured out who sets the trends in the 
world of the automobile. . . . They're sending Charles Ellwood and other car 
designers here to glean what they can from Southern California's car culture. 
(Valley Business, Page 10). Ellwood's in the driver's seat at Volkswagen's 
design studio in Simi Valley. Volvo's got a design center in Camarillo and 
General Motors has one in Newbury Park.

 NO RAMBO: Larry Chambers vividly remembers slipping into Viet Cong territory 
in 1968. "We didn't look like Rambo," said Chambers, who was with an Army Long 
Range Reconnaissance patrol. Nor did they act like him. Donning green 
tiger-striped fatigues, the stealthy patrol would infiltrate for five days in 
silence. The mission: Sneak a peak and get out alive. "I was scared out of my 
wits," said Chambers, a free-lance writer in Ojai. Tonight at 7 at Barnes & 
Noble in Ventura, he talks about those days and signs copies of his book 
"Recondo."

IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER?; MYSTERIOUS KIM JONG IL'S ASCENSION POSES QUESTIONS 
FOR KOREAS, AND WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a society as closed and as antediluvian as North Korea, it is difficult to 
believe that the death of the maximum leader will be without significant 
consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung -- the mysterious dictator of a country that time seems to have 
forgotten in some ways -- leaves as his legacy a society all but closed to the 
outside world and all but strangled by its mindless adherence to a communist 
orthodoxy that is extreme and bizarre even by the standards of the bygone 
communist world. And he bequeathed to his countrymen Kim Jong Il, his even more 
mysterious son, whom official Pyongyang radio was quick to describe as his 
father's rightful successor. 
</P>
<P>
 For South Korea, with its energetic and entrepreneurial economy, the hope is 
that at the very least Kim Jong Il will prove no more erratic or menacing than 
his father. The South Koreans have done a remarkable job of getting on with 
their destiny in recent years -- building up their economy and moving, however 
slowly, toward true democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 From Seoul's perspective, overnight reunification is not to be desired; 
instead, South Korea prefers slow, cautious and carefully plotted moves toward 
normalization and then maybe -- well down the road -- talks about some form of 
unification. 
</P>
<P>
 For the United States, the death of Kim Il Sung came just as talks over 
Pyongyang's nuclear program had begun in Geneva. U.S. and North Korean 
officials have agreed that the talks be interrupted, with the expectation that 
they will be resumed. Also postponed is the unprecedented meeting between the 
North and South Korean heads of state, which had been scheduled for July 25 in 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung died just as U.S.-North Korean relations appeared to be moving off 
dead center. The history of the U.S.-North Korean dialogue hardly encourages an 
abundance of confidence in Pyonyang's commitment to resolving the crisis it 
precipitated with its ambiguous but alarming experimental nuclear reactor. Now 
the son follows the father. Will North Korea revert to the Dark Ages? Or is it 
ready to begin remaking itself and become a full member of the international 
community -- and a more modern economy that can better serve its long-deprived 
people?

DOLLAR FALLS AGAINST MARK, YEN; DOW OFF; MARKETS: ANALYSTS BLAME G-7 INACTION 
FOR THE WEAKNESS IN U.S. CURRENCY. YIELDS ON 30-YEAR TREASURY BONDS RISE TO 
7.73%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The dollar plunged Monday to its lowest level against the German mark since 
late 1992 and hit a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen after the 
United States and its allies failed to devise a plan to stabilize the 
greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Treasury bond yields rose, forcing prices lower amid expectations 
that the economic reports due out this week will show faster growth and rising 
inflation, leading to higher interest rates. Stocks followed the dollar and 
bonds lower. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted in late trading at 1.530 marks, down from 
1.563 on Friday. The U.S. currency fell to 97.75 yen, the lowest close since 
the late 1940s, from 98.05. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dipped for the first time below 97 yen around midday, but it 
recovered later on concerns about the leadership succession in North Korea and 
Japan's uncertain political situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed the weakness in the dollar, which also fell sharply 
against other major currencies, to the apparent lack of concern for its 
persistent slide shown by leaders of the Group of Seven at their weekend summit 
in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although traders had not expected any coordinated G-7 action to support the 
dollar -- such as adjusting official interest rates to favor the U.S. currency 
or the nations directing their central banks to intervene -- the failure to 
even mention exchange rates in the group's final statement was taken as a sign 
that the economic powers are leaving the dollar's fate to the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers said trading volume was fairly light as few large banks entered the 
market, exacerbating the dollar's downward trajectory against European 
currencies. Much of the activity was speculative, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's key 30-year bond rose to 7.73% 
from 7.69% on Friday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 
11/32 point, or $3.44 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts described bond trading as light, with many participants taking a 
breather after Friday's heavy activity as they awaited government reports on 
producer inflation today and on consumer inflation Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices plunged and yields soared Friday after the government reported 
stronger-than-expected job growth last month. The report sparked fears that 
strong economic growth will fuel inflation, which erodes the value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The falling dollar Monday added to those worries, since a drop in the 
greenback's value tends to lead to higher prices for products imported into the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Laughlin, an economist at the Sanwa Securities unit of Tokyo-based 
Sanwa Bank Ltd., said market participants worldwide are worried that the 
Federal Reserve Board has not raised interest rates fast enough this year to 
try to curb inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All market indexes right now signal a Fed policy that's too accommodative," 
Laughlin said. "The Fed is behind the curve in fighting inflation. We have 
produced more dollars than individuals desire to hold." 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors do not like rising interest rates because they increase 
corporate costs and make fixed-income investments relatively more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the dollar's slide pulled blue chip stocks lower, ending a 
five-session advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended 6.15 points lower at 3,702.99, 
recovering on late buying from a session low of 3,681. Declining issues 
outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange on light 
Big Board volume of 222.97 million shares. On Friday, 236.52 million shares 
changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes fell. The NYSE composite index fell 0.61 to 247.50. The 
Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller companies fell 0.63 to 706.83. The 
Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 1.49 to 448.06. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eli Lilly said it will buy McKesson Corp.'s PSC Health Systems Inc unit. 
Lilly, which said it will probably have to borrow about $2.5 billion as part of 
the planned $4-billion purchase, shrank 7 3/8 to 50. McKesson soared 24 3/4 to 
98. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Cyanamid rose 1 3/8 to 57, aided by an upgrade from Lehman Bros. to 
"buy" from "outperform." 
</P>
<P>
 * First USA dropped 2 3/4 to 37 1/2. The company said it had acquired the 
contracts and most of the assets of Electronic Processing Source Inc. for First 
USA common stock. 
</P>

O.C. ART; BUDDHISM SHOW: WHERE'S THE BIG PICTURE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gleaming in gilded brass, several dozen Buddhist sculptures -- made in China 
between the 13th and 17th centuries -- are spending the summer (through Sept. 
18) at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretive little smiles on many of the faces encapsulate the serene ultimate 
wisdom of Buddhism. In fact, each of the figures' anatomical oddities, poses 
and accouterments (multiple arms, crossed legs, open-palm gestures, elaborate 
headdresses, swords, books, lotuses) is in some way emblematic of the vigilance 
and virtues needed to acquire the highest level of enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it takes some extracurricular digging to begin to get a grip on 
the bigger picture -- the significance of these figures and their relevance to 
the larger cultural milieu of the Ming and Qing dynasties. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of wall labels or an explanatory brochure is not satisfactorily 
remedied for the lay viewer by a rapid-fire summary of historical and 
iconographic material packed into two pages of the catalogue ($10 in the 
bookstore). It was issued by the Chang Foundation in Taipei, which loaned all 
the pieces in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Bowers has given education chief Janet Baker the additional title 
of curator of Asian art, one hopes that such major information gaps will be 
remedied in future exhibitions loaned by outside institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these sculptures are idealized images of the historical Buddha -- 
Siddhartha Gautama -- identifiable by his distinctive hairstyle (a knob of 
tight curls) and extra-long earlobes (stretched by the heavy jewelry he wore 
during his princely youth). 
</P>
<P>
 Siddhartha was a wealthy, pampered 29-year-old Indian who left his wife and 
child one fine day in 594 BC, in search of the meaning of existence. How, he 
wondered, could humankind escape from the endless cycle of rebirth that 
(according to Hinduism) was the destiny of all living things? For six years, he 
fasted, meditated and consulted wise men. Eventually, he achieved enlightenment 
in profound meditation while seated under a bodhi tree. 
</P>
<P>
 The following morning a revelation came to him: that life involves continuous 
suffering caused by craving, lust and desire, but it is possible to break out 
of the karmic cycle and merge with the eternal spirit by dint of proper 
conduct, belief and meditation. He preached and acquired disciples during the 
final 45 years of his life. During the following centuries, Buddhism spread to 
Tibet, China, Korea and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the Buddha was represented only in the form of symbols, such as 
footprints (representing his wandering teachings) or the bodhi tree. But once 
Buddhism became accepted by the Indian masses (in the early 1st Century), a 
demand apparently arose for more human-looking devotional images, similar to 
those used by Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, while Indian artists concentrated on building up the 
vibrantly modeled, three-dimensional qualities of the figure, Chinese artists 
stressed the rhythmic qualities of line in the flow of drapery and ornamental 
detail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sexy little Indian-style twist in the torsos of some of the sculptures can 
be explained by their distinctive purpose: They were imperial gifts to a 
Tibetan Buddhist sect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sculptures of Buddha symbolize the style and content of his teachings (such as 
preaching, meditating, giving gifts and reassuring humankind) by means of 
distinctive hand gestures as well as the symmetrical equilibrium and serenity 
of his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few variants: One Buddha image in the show portrays him as a 
big-bellied monk with a cloth sack supposedly containing enough money and 
jewels to satisfy the entire world. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sculptures depict bodhisattvas, androgynous personages who postpone 
their own enlightenment in order to bring aid and comfort to humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is Guanyin, a goddess of mercy, whose appearance apparently 
evolved from a combination of the popular Indian god Avalokitesvara, his 
feminine counterpart, Tara, and the ancient Chinese mother goddess. In one 
17th-Century sculpture in the show, the goddess wears an elaborate headdress 
and holds a willow branch and a vase for ambrosia. 
</P>
<P>
 The bumptious exceptions to the calm pantheon of Buddha images and 
bodhisattvas in this show are the fierce-looking Heavenly Kings. These minor 
divinities, who are said to defend the four frontiers of Buddhism, include the 
popeyed, armor-clad figure of Vaisravana, controller of heavenly wealth, and 
Virudhaka, whose flaming sword keeps evil at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as something of a shock to realize that the time frame represented by 
this show encompasses late medieval, Renaissance and Baroque periods. In 
Europe, dramatic changes in the expressivity and plastic form of sculpture 
during these centuries mirrored equally dramatic changes in society and 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in China, where imitation was the highest form of flattery, centuries of 
political upheaval and intellectual ferment touched art in relatively subtle 
ways. In any case, the attributes of devotional figures like the ones in this 
exhibition were highly codified, permitting little variation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the catalogue essay points out, the works on view are either well-crafted 
objects with an imperial pedigree or standardized popular images. The stable, 
affluent Ming dynasty (1368-1644) is known for producing elaborate goods suited 
to the taste of the court and wealthy patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Qing dynasty (1644-1912), technical refinement was the most prized 
attribute of art -- a restrictive state of affairs for painting, but a boon to 
the production of lacquer and metal wares, porcelain and carved jade. 
</P>
<P>
 Qing emperor Qianlong (1737-96) was particularly addicted to decorative 
opulence. It gives one pause to read in the catalogue that the Amitayus figure 
enclosed in a halo of fire in the exhibition was one of a mostly identical 
series of more than 9,000 mostly identical images he presented to his mother 
for her 70th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 So it comes as no surprise that the objects in the show are not "masterpieces" 
or even prime examples of the long and distinguished history of Chinese art -- 
and there's nothing wrong with that. The world of art embraces far more than 
isolated examples of greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 But for that very reason, the most fruitful way to deal with such objects is 
in the context of Chinese culture, society and religion. The Bowers' frequent 
habit of showcasing objects as if they were ineffable treasures obscures their 
true value as windows onto another world.

THEATER REVIEW; LA JOLLA'S 'THERESE RAQUIN': MORAL LESSONS A LA ZOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1867 novel "Therese Raquin," Emile Zola depicted what happens when a 
swaggering male enters a repressed French household. Therese, a young woman 
living with her sickly milquetoast husband and his doting mama, has sex with 
her husband's friend, the peasant painter Laurent, almost as soon as they are 
left alone together. 
</P>
<P>
 Zola's clinical descriptions of their insatiable and reckless copulation and 
the murder it leads them to commit shocked French readers. But scandal only 
reinforces the fact that we live in a terribly moral universe. In this case, 
Therese and Laurent are condemned by their consciences to live in a circle of 
hell horrible enough to satisfy any fire-and-brimstone preacher. In fact, it 
was the search for any signs of internal punishment that kept most people glued 
to the TV screen last week, absorbing each clenching of the jaw by the accused 
O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of Simpson, though, is never invoked in playwright Neal Bell's 
nevertheless contemporary adaptation now at the La Jolla Playhouse. With the 
same terrific ensemble simultaneously performing Marivaux's "Triumph of Love" 
in repertory at the Mandell Weiss Forum, "Therese Raquin" retains many of the 
novel's fascinations, particularly the ones referred to in a warning about 
"strong language and mature subject matter" at the theater entrance. The 
on-stage sex of Therese (Angie Phillips) and Laurent (David Hunt), occurring 
with other characters within earshot, is as frank and voyeuristic as anything 
Zola attempted. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are two problems in this polished production, directed by Michael 
Greif, who at the end of this season will become the next artistic director at 
the Playhouse. The play's first half is gripping -- it tells the story of how 
Therese came to marry Camille (Paul Giamatti) and be wooed by Laurent in the 
presence of her husband. Halfway through, once the lovers plot and the pivotal 
event has taken place, the story loses tension. The second half of the play, 
and the novel for that matter, is undramatic. In fact, Greif works to find a 
note on which to end the play so the audience knows it is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to offset this problem, Bell has modernized and brightened up a fairly 
morbid novel. Particularly for the more active first act, Bell has written 
short scenes that end with a punch and a black-out. He has also laced the play 
with a flat, almost cynical humor, so that Madame Raquin (Beth Dixon), 
Therese's mother-in-law, has several biting asides that make her sound almost 
like David Letterman. But Bell pays a price for these liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bell has set "Therese Raquin" in a world where it is difficult to understand 
why the murder would have to be committed, why the heroine and her lover could 
not simply run off together. The impossibility of divorce is never felt in this 
world, despite the bustles and corsets that Mark Wendland has designed for a 
suffocating Therese. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina Draghici's sets, which feature a heavy plastic curtain and suggestions 
of rooms, grimy shops and riverbanks, hint evocatively at the play's full 
setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasure of seeing a cast in repertory is to watch a deck reshuffle and 
see familiar actors play off of one another in new ways. The biggest surprise 
here is David Hunt, who plays an effete and unworthy love interest to Angie 
Phillip's glorious heroine in "Triumph." As Laurent his lumbering, brutish 
peasant lust is exactly what would send Therese immediately down on the floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Phillips responds provocatively, balancing a mature woman's sexuality with her 
musical girl's voice and uninhibited physicality. As the kind of man who can 
only inspire his mother to rapturous emotion, Paul Giamatti doesn't allow 
Camille to be too pathetic, and gives him a sweet awareness of his considerable 
shortcomings. As she did in "Triumph," Dixon pulls off a difficult assignment 
-- she brings dignity and some salty good sense to a woman who should be very 
easily dismissed as foolish.  
</P>
<P>
 The actors in the smaller roles get no chance to play anything beyond a single 
trait; this is a narrow, internal story that belongs to the three leads. Bell 
has opened up the claustrophobic atmosphere somewhat by allowing Therese some 
shocking internal monologues in the middle of a stuffy domino game. Still, no 
dramatic device can supply tension where none exists. Since there is very 
little question of the lovers getting caught, the only question is whether they 
will kill themselves or each other, and oddly or not, that is not very 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how intense, prolonged self-torture is tedious to watch. If we knew 
for certain that O.J. Simpson was guilty, would we still hang on to every 
expression?

 Poised for Prime Time: Two new half-hour comedies, both from folks previously 
associated with Fox-TV, were announced Monday as "prime examples" of upcoming 
programming on the Warner Bros. Television Network, a new youth-oriented cable 
channel scheduled to launch in January. The first, "Unhappily Ever After," is 
from "Married . . . With Children" executive producers Ron Leavitt and Arthur 
Silver and deals with the tribulations of a recently divorced father struggling 
to make ends meet after paying child support, alimony and taxes. The second, a 
not-yet-titled show featuring former "In Living Color" regulars Shawn and 
Marlon Wayans, focuses on two brothers living on their own for the first time 
-- in New York City.

<P>
 * King in Unidentified Territory: Larry King will host "The UFO Cover-Up: Live 
From Area 51 -- A TNT Larry King Special" for cable's Turner Network 
Television. The Oct. 1 interactive special will be telecast live from Rachel, 
Nev., in the shadow of what locals say is a secret U.S. military installation 
hidden deep in the Nevada desert. The Pentagon won't confirm the existence of 
the purported base, known as "Area 51." RADIO

<P>
 Taking On the Mantle: Mike Kasem, whose father, Casey Kasem, has long counted 
down the top pop tunes over radio airwaves, is following in his father's 
footsteps with his own pop music program, a celebrity interview show called 
"Inside Track." Although the 20-year-old's show is produced and distributed by 
radio programmer Westwood One, his voice won't be heard on the radio airwaves 
like his dad's. Instead, the program will be distributed on audiocassettes and 
sold in record stores, in what is being billed as the world's first "audio 
fanzine." The first edition, on sale at selected record stores now, includes 
interviews with Swedish pop group Ace of Base, singer Toni Braxton and actor 
Jonathan Brandis. THE ARTS

 They Won't Strike: Concertgoers attending Saturday's "Encore! The Three 
Tenors" event at Dodger Stadium no longer need worry about a possible picket 
line. The show's producer, the Rudas Organization, and Local 33 of the 
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees have settled their 
differences regarding stagehands working on the show, which stars world-class 
tenors Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti with Zubin Mehta 
conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Union lawyer Bob Cantore said the 
agreement was amicable, giving dozens of stagehands and others wages and 
benefits "in line with theaters all around town." 
</P>
<P>
 * See You in Court: Andrew Lloyd Webber simultaneously welcomes and regrets 
Faye Dunaway's decision to sue him over her dismissal from the 
producer-composer's "Sunset Boulevard," according to a statement released 
Monday. "No sane man" would close a show that was grossing more than $900,000 a 
week "unless there was a very, very good reason," Lloyd Webber said. "I believe 
this will become apparent at any trial, but I really deeply regret that the 
issues will have to be aired in public." The statement also implied that Lloyd 
Webber did not make every decision in the Dunaway brouhaha. In his publicist's 
words, "Whilst accepting that . . . all actions taken by the management of the 
company are attributed to him whether they were taken by him or not, Sir Andrew 
is satisfied after exhaustive inquiries that his management has acted with not 
only the utmost propriety but also with great sympathy at all stages in this 
sorry saga."

 * Louvre Theft: Paris' Louvre museum, shaken by the theft of a 17th-Century 
French drawing, tightened security Monday and appealed to the robber to treat 
the fragile work delicately. The thief cut the 1660 pastel drawing "Portrait of 
Jean Dorieu" by court artist Robert Nanteuil from its frame Sunday afternoon 
during a gap between security rounds, authorities said. At the time, the museum 
had an estimated 27,000 visitors in its Sully wing. The stolen work is valued 
at between $75,000 and $100,000. QUICK TAKES

 Mike Newell, who directed this year's surprise box-office hit "Four Weddings 
and a Funeral," as well as 1992's multiple Academy Award nominee "Enchanted 
April," has entered into an overall producing/directing deal with Disney's 
Touchstone Pictures. . . . Five concertgoers, including three Los Angeles men, 
have filed a $185-million lawsuit against Ticketmaster, accusing the giant 
ticket vendor of violating antitrust laws and charging exorbitant fees. The 
suit follows similar accusations by the band Pearl Jam and several other 
antitrust suits against the ticket distributor. . . . Barbra Streisand will

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; JAZZLESS JAZZ FESTIVAL AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hollywood Bowl hosted another largely jazzless jazz festival on Sunday -- 
this one sponsored by JVC rather than Playboy. In the performances of Buddy 
Guy, Patti Austin, Lou Rawls and Stanley Jordan, jazz took a back seat to 
blues, R&B, rock and pop. 
</P>
<P>
 The nearly four-hour show was mostly routine, offering few surprises and just 
a smattering of breathtaking moments. Headliner Guy, the Chicago blues singer 
and guitarist, was easily the class of the field, though sound problems blunted 
the impact of his set. Sometimes he sizzled -- as on "Feels Like Rain" and 
"Mustang Sally." At times, though, he turned pure ham, dipping into his bag of 
crowd-pleasing, show-biz tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep-voiced crooner Rawls offered his typical package of standards and 
pop-blues tunes, including "Stormy Monday" and "Tobacco Road." After all these 
years, he knows how to manipulate an audience -- and he pushed all the right 
buttons. But a lounge-act slickness enveloped most of his songs. All traces of 
the heartfelt singer of the '60s seem to have vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop-soul singer Austin's set was at best passably pleasant. Her problem -- 
especially evident Sunday -- has always been a lack of appealing material. As a 
technician she ranks with the best, but most of her repertoire is flat-out 
dull.  
</P>
<P>
 Guitarist Jordan opened the show with a mostly instrumental set that was 
partly fun and partly dismaying. He's a master at dazzling mainstream audiences 
with his commercial mixture of rock, funk and soft jazz tunes. But it's 
irritating to watch Jordan the showman squash Jordan the master technician. 
He's a great guitarist mired in musical muck. In his solos there are always 
some startling, original runs that remind you of what might have been. DENNIS

MUSIC REVIEW; AN EAR-OPENING 'CONCIERTO' AT LACMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the older, thriving traditions in our musical community is the series 
of admission-free chamber concerts at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 This series is, of course, much older than LACMA, which opened in 1965. It 
goes back decades, to beginnings at the Museum of Natural History in Exposition 
Park, when the concerts were broadcast live on the still-lamented KFAC. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the Sunday afternoon events are given in Bing Theater at LACMA. They 
usually last one hour and are sent through the ether via KUSC-FM. They now 
include performances by touring artists from both the United States and abroad. 
And, half a century later, they are still worth hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 More than worthwhile -- ear-opening, actually -- was the unusual, double 
program titled "Concierto Latinoamericano," given Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 With music by Villa-Lobos, Enrique Gonzalez Medina, Roger Boutry, Gernot 
Wolfgang, A. Jo Duell-Gonzalez, Miguel del Aguila and Sergio Ramirez Cardenas, 
this agenda may have exceeded its category, but not its fascination. Six of the 
seven works presented -- there were four premiere performances -- were played 
by the trio of flutist Diane Alancraig, bassoonist Judith Farmer and pianist 
Miguel del Aguila. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Aguila became the hero of the afternoon, and not just for 
his many and comprehensive keyboard skills. His new piece for bassoon and 
piano, "Sunsetsong," revealed a poetic and dramatic bent, showed off both 
instruments to best advantage and gave Farmer and himself many opportunities 
for virtuoso display. Most important, the quarter-hour work engages the 
listener constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez Medina's four-part "Ritmicas," for flute and piano, also in its world 
premiere, held the ear through a series of mood swings often contradicting its 
own title; nevertheless, idiomatic instrumental writing and long, lyrical lines 
sustained one's interest. Ramirez Cardenas' "Three Fast Breakfasts," proved an 
homage, a very facile one, to Poulenc. 
</P>
<P>
 Guest pianist Susan High was the soloist in Duell-Gonzalez's Messiaenic "The 
Holy Trinity," a nine-minute series of meditations accompanied by paintings 
projected onto a screen next to the piano. Neither the Yamaha grand piano nor 
Jeff Kowatch's splashy paintings seemed to connect closely with the three 
slow-motion movements. 
</P>
<P>
 As they had in Villa-Lobos' "Bachianas Brasileiras" No. 6, Alancraig and 
Farmer excelled in the aerobic displays of Wolfgang's breezy Duo (1992). The 
piece may indeed be, as the composer claims, stylistically "between jazz and 
funk," but to one listener it seemed, with all its charms, highly legit. 
Classical, even.

DANCE REVIEW; 'FLAMENCO' PUTS ACCENT ON GRANDIOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If "Fuego Flamenco" truly capitalized on the intimacy of the Fountain Theatre 
in Hollywood, the series would be invaluable for presenting Spanish Gypsy music 
and dance in something like its original context. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with amplified accompaniment and dancers projecting to an imaginary 
fifth balcony, the season's inaugural performance on Sunday scarcely offered 
flamenco at human scale.Led as always by Roberto Amaral, the program began 
appropriately with "Un Amor Inmenso," a trio full of over-the-top theatricality 
and hyper-aggressive technical flamboyance. Inmenso indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Solos provided comparatively down-to-earth showcases, with Amaral employing a 
cane or walking stick for exciting three-legged rhythmic effects at the start 
of "Alegrias de Cadiz" and later performing an impressive array of complex, 
high-speed percussive steps before the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 Executing Amaral's choreography, Antonia Lopez could seem rushed or forced in 
bravura, but in other challenges she brought warmth and a mastery of expressive 
detail. Linda Vega looked prosaic and out of her effective range when trying 
for a sense of emotional weight and sculptural grandeur in her Seguiriya solo. 
But "Guajira" allowed her to cut loose with electrifying slave-of-impulse 
gambits and to display her prowess on the castanets. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, the fine accompanists -- singer Antonio de Jerez, 
guitarists Bruce Patterson and Antonio Triana, percussionist Patric Hetzinger 
-- were almost as welcome for their humility as their expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Fuego Flamenco" runs Sundays at 3 p.m. through Aug. 28 in the Fountain 
Theatre, 5060 Fountain Ave., Hollywood. Tickets: $20-$22.50. Information: (213)

THEATER REVIEW; 'NANETTE' BRINGS FRIVOLITY TO LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in "No, No, Nanette," the title character is warned to avoid flappers 
"who think life is one long giggle." 
</P>
<P>
 Those flapper girls have nothing on "No, No, Nanette," the 1920s musical so 
light and frothy it makes "42nd Street" look like Greek tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 High kicks and soft-shoe, lame jokes and "Tea for Two" -- these foolish things 
have sustained Vincent Youmans' three-act lollipop, off and on, for the past 70 
years. It is not the oldest musical in American theater history, but at times 
it certainly feels that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Civic Light Opera has mounted a lavishly appointed, cheerfully 
acted revival of Burt Shevelove's celebrated adaptation, an improbable hit on 
Broadway in the early '70s. Revised or not, "Nanette" feels very out of step 
with the dark, literary musicals of the Sondheim era. Whether that's welcome 
depends on one's need for one long giggle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blind optimism reigns supreme in Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel's book, a 
high-pitched Jazz Age farce that wasn't embarrassed by its own fixation on the 
high life. "Go out and spend some money foolishly," advises rich Bible 
publisher Jimmy Smith (Gavin MacLeod of "Love Boat" fame). "Then you'll be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 As with everything else in "Nanette," Smith's comment is not meant ironically. 
The piece, the program notes inform us, is about "what was (in the 1920s) 
topical, slightly racy and mostly sheer fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, teen-age Nanette (Elna Marie Binckes) grows restless under the 
tutelage of her guardians, the tycoon Smith and his frugal wife, Sue (Nanette 
Fabray). "I want to raise a family," the girl tells her suitor, a dull lawyer 
named Tom (Michael Dotson), "but I want to raise a little hell first." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, meanwhile, has been making some mischief of his own, giving cash gifts 
to attractive young women who imagine his interest in them is more than 
platonic (it isn't). For no very good reason, everyone winds up at the beach in 
Atlantic City as the show gives new meaning to the term "light opera." 
</P>
<P>
 Director and choreographer David Thome has staged this nonsense with the right 
amount of pluck, even if the show never quite reaches "Hellzapoppin" levels of 
giddiness. Due to the immense size of the Terrace Theater, the action is broad 
and heavily amplified. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is at its best when the cast members shut up and dance. The superb 
tap routine for "I Want to Be Happy," with Fabray and chorus, almost brings 
down the house; likewise the elaborate soft-shoe for the immortal "Tea for 
Two." Sean McMullin's period costumes -- flapper hats, pleated skirts, golf 
sweaters -- are definite pluses. 
</P>
<P>
 As a wisecracking maid, Kaye Ballard gets a lot of comic mileage out of a 
stock role. Fabray puts the right addled, oblivious spin on her aristocratic 
East Coast matron. MacLeod, who has an endearing way of talk-singing through 
numbers, is completely unconvincing as a slightly daffy tycoon. Which means, of 
course, that he's perfect for the part. 
</P>

ART REVIEW; WEST MEETS EAST IN MILESTONE AT THE SIMON; LACMA COLLABORATION 
MIXES THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF INDIA AND NEPAL IN 'A TALE OF THREE MUSES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sad fact of life at the Norton Simon Museum is that many visitors don't 
bother to go downstairs after seeing the Old Masters, French Impressionist 
paintings and Asian artworks on the main floor. Of those who do, few venture 
beyond the Degas display at the base of the spiral staircase and still fewer 
wander as far as the final gallery of Southeast Asian art -- except to gaze 
through a window at a stone Buddha in a sunken garden. 
</P>
<P>
 But life goes on at the Simon, and facts change. The museum's last outpost now 
lures visitors with seductive sights and sounds. Fresh rose-colored paint warms 
the gallery's walls, Ravi Shankar's recorded music fills the air and classical 
Indian musical instruments sit on a red carpet in front of the window. All this 
is a backdrop for a new exhibition, "A Tale of Three Muses: Music, Poetry and 
Art in India and Nepal," which qualifies as a genuine milestone in the museum's 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is the Simon's first collaboration with another museum, in this case 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Simon curator Gloria Williams and 
Pratapaditya Pal, LACMA's senior curator of Indian and Southeast Asian art, 
have drawn on the two institutions' resources to show off little-known 
treasures and explore a multidisciplinary theme.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Simon had a great admiration for the art of India and Nepal," said Sara 
Campbell, director of the Simon Museum. "This exhibition is both a tribute to 
his interest and a chance for Southern California's two great collections of 
South Asian art to share their riches." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Indian and Southeast Asian artworks comprise one of the greatest -- 
though largely unsung -- strengths of LACMA's collection. The Simon Museum is 
generally celebrated for its European art, but Simon became a passionate 
collector of Asian art in the 1970s -- after his marriage to actress Jennifer 
Jones, who had studied Eastern philosophy and persuaded him to take his first 
trip to India. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the landmark exhibition is a rare album of 36 paintings from 
Nepal, purchased in 1979 by Simon. They are accompanied by eight paintings from 
an addendum to the album, acquired in 1973 by LACMA. As to why, when and where 
the loose-leaf album was separated, little is known, but the fact that the two 
parts ended up in Southern California paved the way to reuniting the paintings 
for the first time since they were divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel-like paintings -- each measuring about 7 by 5 1/2 inches -- come 
from a genre that flourished during the 17th Century, Williams said. Deriving 
their name, ragamala, from the Indian term for a garland of melodies, or ragas, 
the paintings epitomize a tradition of giving music a visual form. Musicians 
conceived of musical modes as having divine and human forms. Poets interpreted 
the melodies as verses and artists painted the verses, often including Sanskrit 
text with their pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains the "Three Muses" in the show's title, but deciphering the 
paintings can be difficult. The exhibition's text panels and labels help, but 
they also reveal unsuspected subtleties. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors learn, for example, that ragas not only have musical and human form, 
they refer to colors, passions, seasons and times of day. While musical ragas 
could be used for religious purposes, pictorial ragas were secular and earthy 
-- typically portraying Hindu gods, princes and beautiful women in an eternal 
cycle of love and longing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the paintings in the album presents figures in an architectural 
framework, with poetry at the top of the sheet. The paintings are displayed in 
groups of six, with a portrayal of a male figure surrounded by five depictions 
of women who either await his arrival or greet him in various states of 
emotion. The women -- who sprinkle flower petals on their beds or amuse 
themselves in gardens -- appear to have nothing better to do than prepare for 
trysts and pout when their lovers are tardy, but their task in these paintings 
is to evoke erotic moods and amorous situations. They are archetypes rather 
than personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although little is known of how ragamala paintings were used, they were 
produced for Hindu and Muslim noblemen and regarded as prestigious gifts, 
Williams said. The work owned by the Simon and County museums is thought to 
have been commissioned by a king who presided over Bhaktapur, in the Kathmandu 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the dark, predominantly red Nepali works, several Indian 
ragamala paintings from LACMA's collection portray figures and cross-sections 
of buildings in a varied palette of pastels and bright hues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musically themed stone and metal sculptures from the two museums' and Jennifer 
Jones Simon's collections provide a counterpoint of art-in-the-round. Unlike 
the paintings, which secret erotic details in tiny spaces, the sculptures 
flaunt sensuousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Muscular gods and voluptuous goddesses play flutes and stringed instruments, 
while a group of five celestial musicians -- some with an 'imals heads -- 
compose an orches 'tra along one wall. This sculptural group joined LACMA's 
collection more than a year ago, but it is making its Southern California debut 
at the Simon Museum.

POOLMART CEO OFFERS NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I feel compelled to respond to the letter by Philip Leslie published June 21. 
His letter referenced your June 7 article on Leslie's Poolmart, a company 
purchased from Phil and his partner in 1988. In his letter, Mr. Leslie has 
mischaracterized, whether knowingly or unwittingly, the performance, status and 
expressed goals of Leslie's Poolmart. To clarify: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Our growth plan does not call for 63 new stores each year. It instead calls 
for a yearly unit growth rate of 15% to 20% -- numbers we have actually met or 
exceeded over the last four years. At a 20% increase per year, assuming we open 
40 stores for 1995, we would have 554 stores open for the year 2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Due to our success and rapid growth, Forbes Magazine recently published an 
article on Leslie's. Apparently, Phil misread the article. We have not stated 
to Forbes, or anyone else, that our 500 stores will gross $500 million. We have 
two sizable non-store businesses, which we have expanded and for which we have 
substantial additional growth goals. We believe that these will be significant 
contributors to our overall sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
 3. The stated figures on our new store sales are simply inaccurate, which is 
perhaps not surprising, since these numbers have not been made available to the 
public. Further, Mr. Leslie's attempted comparison of sales at older, mature 
stores to brand-new ones is inappropriate and misleading at best. I can tell 
you that our new store sales each of the last two years have actually exceeded 
the average performance of new stores over the life of the company! 
</P>
<P>
 4. With regard to our earnings and Montgomery Securities' projections thereof, 
though the company is highly profitable, I am not aware of any Montgomery 
projection as high as $0.80 to $0.85 at any point in time. The fact is, even 
after service of very reasonable levels of debt and other acquisition-related 
costs, we have substantially increased the company's profitability. In fact, it 
is the high profitability of our stores that led us to our rapid-growth 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Finally, Mr. Leslie has been saying since 1988 (and especially during 
1989-91, a period of time when he was losing substantial amounts of money 
trying to compete with us) that we are "overextended" or are in other ways not 
viable. With long-term debt of $12.8 million, or less than 38% of capital at 
year-end 1993, Leslie's Poolmart is not "overextended" by any reasonable 
measure, even after four years of rapid growth and two acquisitions. Leslie's 
is clearly positioned as the "category killer" in its industry, and we firmly 
believe that it is capable of continued extraordinary growth in both sales and 
earnings.

 Jordan update: Last week, with the bases loaded, the count full and his 
Birmingham Barons trailing Huntsville, 5-3, Michael Jordan grounded to third. 
When the third baseman threw the ball away, three runs scored and the Barons 
won, 6-5.

 He's a Player: Beginning Thursday at Turnberry, Scotland, Gary Player will 
play in his 40th consecutive British Open, a tournament record. He is the only 
golfer to win the event in three decades -- 1959, 1968, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1974 victory over Peter Oosterhuis at Royal Lytham in England was his 
biggest British Open payday -- $13,200. For the record, Greg Norman won 
$154,000 for his victory last year at Sandwich, England.

<P>
 McAuley has an ERA of 15.00, but it's all part of her plan.

 Tucker said he thinks Robinson can be the first player to make $100 million.

WILLIAMS QUALIFIES FOR OPEN WITH BULLET LODGED IN RIBS

 Kim Williams, who was shot in the neck 10 days ago and still has the bullet 
lodged in her rib cage, shot a one-under-par 72 Monday and qualified for this 
month's U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Few expected Williams, 31, to be there after she was accidentally shot while 
walking to a drug store in Niles, Ohio, where she was playing in the 
Youngstown-Warren LPGA Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 But after an exceptional performance in last weekend's Jamie Farr Classic in 
Toledo, where she tied for 10th, Williams continued her fine play at Franklin 
Hills Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played all right considering how tired I was. I'm physically exhausted," 
Williams said. "(My wound) is OK, but my legs are very tired. I can't even get 
up and walk across the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Her misfortune has gained her a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The native of Bethesda, Md., has never made the cut in the Open, including the 
1989 tournament held at Indianwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played in a bunch of them, some of them as an amateur, and haven't 
played well," Williams said. "This year it will be different, hopefully. I have 
a better attitude. I've been playing better the last five weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Police in Niles said Gary Swaney, who says he accidentally shot 
Williams, will be charged in connection with the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Dibos of Peru fired a course-record 65 to easily win medalist honors at 
Franklin Hills. The Open will be held July 21-24 at the Indianwood Golf & 
Country Club in Lake Orion.

 Shawn Eckardt, the beefy would-be bodyguard of Tonya Harding, was sentenced 
Monday in Portland, Ore., to 18 months in prison in another strange chapter of 
the already bizarre Nancy Kerrigan assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Eckardt, you have become a very well known person," Circuit Judge Philip 
Abraham said. "There are adjectives that can be added to your name, something 
like infamous, notorious, greedy, dishonest, even stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence already had been worked out as part of Eckardt's agreement to 
plead guilty to racketeering more than two months ago. The sentencing, though, 
was anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he left the courtroom in handcuffs, Eckardt made an unsuccessful 
attempt to delay the sentencing, fired his attorney and lashed out verbally at 
prosecutor Norm Frink.

<P>
 Martin Dahlin grabbed his aching right leg Monday and considered the 
unpleasant possibility of not playing for Sweden against Brazil in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cramps forced Dahlin out of Sunday's penalty-kick victory over Romania that 
sent the Swedes into Wednesday's semifinal at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish midfielder Jonas Thern sat out Sunday's match with Romania because of 
a swollen knee and is listed as questionable for the semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be a last-minute decision," Dahlin said, resting poolside at 
the team hotel in Marina del Rey. "Of course, I want to play. I also have to be 
able to give 100% or it's no use to play." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates are keeping him loose by giving him the nickname of O.J. Dahlin 
bears a slight resemblance to a young O.J. Simpson.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind," Dahlin said. "The flight attendants called me O.J. I said, 
'Oh, no.' But they said take it as a compliment, he's good looking. I didn't 
know who he was before I came here."

 Postmatch information comes very hard in the World Cup, mostly because 
everything is happening in about nine languages at once.The translations are 
stilted, or frequently merely stupid. But the award for the worst goes to the 
Bulgarian translator phrasing an answer by Coach Dimitar Penev about how soon 
his team will begin preparing for its semifinal against Italy.

 "We will think about it tomorrow," the translator said. "Right now, the

 In the "They'll do anything to make a dollar department," organizers of the 
New York/New Jersey World Cup venue are holding a public sod sale after 
Wednesday's semifinal at the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bermuda Turfgrass field will be removed from Giants Stadium after the 
Italy-Bulgaria semifinal, so why not sell it? The sale begins at 6 a.m. 
Thursday.About 80,000 square feet of official World Cup turf will be available. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, chairman of World Cup '94, said in a statement there is no 
better way of showing "our appreciation than to offer something special from 
the World Cup that the fans will cherish for a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Because proceeds from the sale will be donated to the U.S. Soccer Federation 
Foundation, it will also benefit Rothenberg, USSF president. 
</P>
<P>
 The sod is going for $10 to $20 per square foot. Minimum orders of one square 
foot are $20. Call (201) 460-4144 or (201) 804-2871. ELLIOTT ALMOND

 Coach Berti Vogts of Germany took a farewell shot at retiring goalkeeper Bodo 
Illgner on Monday, the day after Bulgaria had eliminated the Germans in the 
World Cup quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Vogts told reporters he would not blame anyone for Sunday's 2-1 upset 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to look (to see) who is guilty," he said. "It's not good to do 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Vogts pointed his finger at Illgner, who played erratically during the 
tournament. Vogts was furious that Illgner announced his resignation from the 
national team after the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had lost to South Korea, I would have made the change," Vogts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illgner gave up two second-half goals as South Korea rallied to scare the 
Germans in a first-round match. Although Illgner misplayed the two goals, he 
later made some brilliant saves to help Germany preserve the 3-2 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 After the match, Vogts talked to an assistant to decide whether to continue 
starting Illgner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mistake to maintain him," Vogts said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the coaches had made the change, Andreas Koepke would have drawn the 
starting assignment. Hearing what Vogts said further frustrated Koepke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vogts is crazy," he said at the team hotel in Short Hills, N.J. "He could 
have said it weeks ago, but now he says it." ELLIOTT ALMOND

 A Frenchman working his third World Cup and a World Cup rookie from Colombia 
involved in a controversial call in the previous round were picked Monday to 
referee the tournament's two semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, soccer's governing body, chose Joel Quiniou for the game between 
Bulgaria and Italy in Giants Stadium and Jose Torres for the game between 
Sweden and Brazil at the Rose Bowl.Both semifinals are Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was the referee in Sunday's 2-1 victory by Bulgaria over defending 
champion Germany and disallowed a goal by the Germans on a close offside call. 
</P>
<P>
 With Germany leading, 1-0, Andreas Moeller's shot hit the post in the 74th 
minute and Rudi Voeller put in the rebound but was called offside. Two minutes 
later, Hristo Stoitchkov tied the game on a free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany refused to criticize Torres or blame the loss on him.

 Bulgaria's upset of Germany has sent organizers scrambling for translators. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have thought? Until this tournament, Bulgaria had not won a game in 
six previous World Cup appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44 translators hired for the World Cup speak 11 languages ranging from 
Arabic to Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Leigh Hofflich, head of World Cup language services for Giants Stadium, 
told the Associated Press there seemed little reason to hire a Bulgarian 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much figured they wouldn't be here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bind before Sunday's quarterfinal game at East Rutherford, N.J., Hofflich 
contacted Columbia University and persuaded three Bulgarian students to work 
gratis. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't even get a T-shirt . . . but they'll have this experience the rest 
of their life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofflich admits that her Bulgarian is nonexistent. She speaks "salad dressing" 
languages.

 The Daily Telegraph consulted Brazilians in London to learn the background of 
various team names.Among the gems they came up with: Carlos Verri is Dunga, 
which translates as Dopey, because he was thought when young to resemble one of 
the Seven Dwarfs. Jorginho translates as Little George, Zinho as Tiny, Branco 
as Whitey, and Bebeto as Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafu, the Telegraph was told, "is impossible to translate literally, but you

 Perhaps Swedish forward-midfielder Henrik Larsson had the best approach when 
it came time for his turn during the high drama of Sunday's penalty kicks at 
Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think so much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson was the final Swedish player to kick against Romanian goalkeeper 
Florin Prunea. His kick gave Sweden a 5-4 advantage and the victory when 
Romania's Midorag Belodedici couldn't score on his attempt.

 "I decided which corner I should put it in, then I looked at the goalkeeper," 
Larsson said. "He was going the other way, and then I put it in the goal. I 
would kick it hard if he was going in the same direction, loosely if he was 
going the other." LISA DILLMAN

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; SPOTLIGHT; NOW ENGLISH REALLY WISH THEY WERE

 The more chauvinistic portions of the British press reacted to Germany's loss 
in the World Cup with glee. Other writers sounded the what-might-have-been 
theme if England had qualified for the Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Sun, Brian Woolnough commented: "There is romance and justice left in 
the World Cup after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Germans are out. Good riddance! 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no handkerchiefs needed by neutrals in New York's Giants Stadium. 
No, we were delighted to say goodby to the world champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had enough of their diving, play-acting, cheating and arrogance over 
the years. Yes, of course, they can play and their record is incredible. But if 
ever a bully needed a kick in the Bulgars, it was Lothar Matthaeus and his 
men." 
</P>
<P>
 And from his colleague at the Sun, John Sadler: "These finals, dramatic and 
exciting as they have been, have not yet produced a side that would unduly 
trouble a well prepared, well managed England. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not claiming England would have beaten (Brazil), but England are better 
than many of the teams that qualified for these final stages." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Independent answered its question: How might England have fared? "The 
presence of seven European nations in the quarterfinals suggests at least 
participation in the second round."

 "I wanted to call earlier but he forbade me," the woman told the emergency

 Interest Rates Rise on Treasury Bills: The Treasury Department sold $12 
billion of new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.50%, up from 
4.31% last week. Another $12.1 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an 
average discount rate of 4.94%, up from 4.74%.The three-month bill rate was the 
highest since they sold for 4.58% on Nov. 18, 1991. The six-month bill rate was 
the highest since they averaged 5.04% on Oct. 28, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.61% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,886.30, and 5.14% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,750.30. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value. T-Bill Auction

 New media: Two Time Warner subsidiaries, Home Box Office and Warner Music 
Group, have invested about $5 million to form a multimedia company called 
Inscape, to be headed by developer Michael Nash and based in West Los Angeles. 
The venture reflects the growing realization among big media companies looking 
to get into the interactive business that good talent is hard to find."So much 
in this industry is not what it appears, but Michael Nash is for real," HBO 
Executive Vice President John Billock said. Nash left Voyager Co. when it moved 
from Malibu to New York last year. He was the executive producer of the 
critically acclaimed CD-ROM "Freak Show," Inscape's first title, which Nash 
describes as "a cross between 'Sim City' and 'Twin Peaks.' " AMY HARMON

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JUDY BRENNAN: COMPANY TOWN; IS GEFFEN'S SONG COMING 
TO AN END? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON and JUDY BRENNAN, Brennan is a regular contributor to The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a major shake-up already under way at Warner Music Group, record industry 
sources are speculating that one of the next seismic shifts may come at the top 
of Geffen Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder David Geffen has only nine months remaining on a personal services 
contract with MCA Inc., which purchased his company in 1990. Sources say Geffen 
is ambivalent about renewing the contract and has not even begun formal 
discussions with MCA executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen and MCA declined to comment on his future, though MCA is said to view 
his chances of returning as slim. Although 14-year-old Geffen Records is having 
its strongest year and Geffen is close to MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and 
President Sidney J. Sheinberg, sources say the 51-year-old executive may want 
to focus on other business areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "On an economic level, Geffen sold his label brilliantly, when it was the peak 
of the market," one colleague said. "He scored as big as you can possibly 
score. But I don't think his interest lies in building the label. He's an 
entrepreneur, and it's not his anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 After making $700 million from the label sale, Geffen became one of 
Hollywood's wealthiest executives. He is continually linked to rumors of a 
major studio or network investment but so far has remained on the sidelines. 
Geffen has also become a major benefactor of progressive political and social 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say MCA would have a hard time devising a big enough incentive to keep 
Geffen on board, since his $600,000 a year salary is small change for him. Some 
colleagues also believe Geffen has grown restless with the record business. In 
an interview last year, he described his role as that of an adviser, saying, "I 
set a tone for the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Geffen is still regarded as one of the industry's savviest executives. 
Said one observer who thinks his departure would hurt the label: "He is the 
brains, baby. When (the label) needs to sign an act, they wheel him out. It 
really, really helps. And other executives could leave when he leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen Records is expecting its best year ever, with $450 million in revenue 
worldwide from acts such as Nirvana, Counting Crows, Aerosmith and Beck. It 
will also acquire the rights to an album by the reunited Eagles under a legal 
settlement with Don Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 One area of increasing visibility for Geffen is film. His Warner Bros.-based 
company will release "Interview With the Vampire" later this year. Geffen 
Pictures is also making "Barney: The Movie," based on the popular children's 
show, and "Joe's Apartment," which was inspired by an MTV short. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Figure this: A plum job in Hollywood as head of a film company with deep 
pockets has been available for months, and nobody seems to want it. 
</P>
<P>
 The post is president of Turner Pictures Worldwide, one of three production 
companies under Ted Turner's umbrella. At least six names have been bandied 
about for the job. The latest to fall through was Amy Pascal, a production 
executive at Columbia Pictures who has two more years on her contract there. 
</P>
<P>
 Same song, second verse for Hal Lieberman, Universal Pictures president of 
production, who apparently was interested but couldn't wiggle out of his studio 
pact. There was a brief courtship of Eric Eisner, who headed Island Pictures. 
Not to mention the very brief discussions with Oscar-winning producer Arnold 
Kopelson ("The Fugitive," "Platoon"). 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Turner also got a pass from another Warner Bros. producer, Paula 
Weinstein ("Flesh and Bone"), who happens to be a good friend of Turner's wife, 
Jane Fonda. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest disappointment came when Dawn Steel begged off, squelching 
Turner's hopes of seeing movies like her "Cool Runnings" bulk up the Turner 
Pictures film operation. Says one Turner source: "Dawn was so close they had 
even knocked out walls to put in a closet. And a new bathroom was on the 
drawing board. The joke was Dawn has such expensive taste that when she saw the 
white fiberboard walls and furniture that looked like something from Ikea, it 
sent her running!" 
</P>
<P>
 So why are there no takers for the job? One reason is widespread concern that 
Turner Pictures will be treated like a stepchild to the cable mogul's two other 
production companies, Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that no one has quite figured out what becomes of Dennis 
Miller, who's in the job now. Although Miller has built a foundation for Turner 
in Hollywood through TNT movies and features such as the upcoming "The 
Pagemaster," sources say the company wants someone with as much feature 
experience as the chairmen of Castle Rock and New Line. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sassa, president of Turner Entertainment Group, would not discuss 
prospects or Miller's employment, other than to say Turner is pleased with 
Miller. Miller is said to be waiting to see what happens before deciding 
whether to remain. Sassa also said not everyone on the rumored list was 
necessarily a true candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, we are looking for the right person to make movies tomorrow. Right 
now we have the luxury of not having to rush in and hire somebody right away," 
Sassa said, adding, "We are looking for the right fit . . . someone to make 
movies that have a commercial appeal and are a complementary fit to our other 
operations." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he sighed. Every time he makes a comment like that, a flood of scripts 
pours in.

 Film: In an unusual and complicated deal, director Jon Avnet and producer 
Jordan Kerner have signed an exclusive production agreement with Walt Disney 
Studios, while Universal Pictures will continue to have first crack at 
Avnet-directed films. The deal gives Disney second crack at Avnet-directed 
films that Universal passes on.Avnet and Kerner are expected to produce films 
for the Walt Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures banners. Both the Disney 
and Universal deals are for three years, possibly extending to six, Kerner 
said. Avnet directed the hit "Fried Green Tomatoes" for Universal as well as 
the studio's upcoming film "The War" with Kevin Costner and Elijah Wood. 
Avnet/Kerner Co. produced Disney's hit "The Mighty Ducks." The deal was 
arranged by Creative Artists Agency's Rand Holston. As part of the deal, 
Avnet/Kerner is elevating Elizabeth Guber and Lisa Lindstrom to senior vice 
presidents of development and production. JAMES BATES

PROPERTY VALUES: HISTORIC STATUS CAN MEAN A HAPPY REVERSAL OF FORTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The January Northridge earthquake seemed to deal a fatal blow to the San 
Fernando bungalow that has been home to Melvin and Esther Benson for 43 years. 
Their Hagar Street residence -- built in 1912 with non-reinforced concrete 
blocks -- was red-tagged and faced probable demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Bensons' two-bedroom, one-bath house was more than 50 years 
old meant that it had to be reviewed for any historical significance before 
demolition funds were provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. As a 
result, local preservationists found out about the pending demolition, and now 
the Bensons have qualified for grant money to rebuild their home from Historic 
Preservation Partners for Earthquake Response, a coalition of funding resources 
that includes the U. S. Department of the Interior, First Interstate Bank and 
several historic preservation groups. 
</P>
<P>
 This old house isn't just any old house. It is considered a prime example of 
the ornamental block construction style that became popular just after the turn 
of the century. Various ornamental molds were used to cast the blocks used to 
build the Bensons' home. While today's concrete blocks are usually plain and 
boring, the concrete blocks of 90 years ago were made in a wide variety of 
designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bensons knew that their house was old, but not that it was eligible for 
inclusion on the venerable National Register of Historic Places. This 
eligibility is turning out to be a windfall for the Bensons. They will soon 
receive a grant of about $68,000 to repair and rehabilitate their home. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many other property owners in the San Fernando Valley who own 
historic homes and don't even know it, said Pam O'Connor, project manager for 
Historic Preservation Partners for Earthquake Response. "There are people who 
might not realize that there are special programs for historic buildings and 
that their property is a historic one," O'Connor said. "Historic preservation 
has become much more inclusive of all sorts of buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor's organization -- which operates out of the offices of the Los 
Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit group dedicated to historic preservation -- 
has budgeted about $700,000 in technical assistance grants and another $3 
million in so-called Bricks and Mortar grants, much of which is still 
available. This money will go to help owners of historic buildings fix some of 
the damage wrought by the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for a grant, a building doesn't have to be on the National Register 
of Historic Places, but must merely be deemed "eligible" by preservationists. 
So far, there have been only a handful of inquiries by property owners in the 
San Fernando Valley, O'Connor said. "We need help in getting the word out about 
our grants." 
</P>
<P>
 For properties that may not qualify for a grant, O'Connor said, "we have 
pro-bono architects who have volunteered their time to help and advise people 
about repair strategies for homes that have some historic value." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more historic buildings in the Valley than most people realize," 
said attorney William Delvac, a principal partner in Historic Resources Group, 
a Hollywood consulting firm. A property can be historic for a variety of 
reasons, Delvac said. It may be historic based on a significant architectural 
style, a famous architect's involvement in the design or the fact that it was 
owned or built by someone of renown. Anything over 50 years old has the 
potential to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of possible historic designations, Delvac explained. The 
most important of these designations is listing in the U. S. Department of the 
Interior's National Register of Historic Places. The state is currently in the 
process of compiling a California Register of Historical Resources. Various 
local governments may have their own listings. Los Angeles, for example, has a 
Historic-Cultural Monument list that includes structures recommended by the 
city's Cultural Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are only about 15 nationally registered buildings in the Valley, 
Delvac believes that there are many more buildings that would qualify for 
either the national list or for the state or city lists. "The Valley doesn't 
have block after block of historic properties, but there still are many 
important older buildings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being on a list of historic properties can mean more than mere cachet, Delvac 
said. Properties that are not owner-occupied and that are eligible for the 
National Register may enjoy certain federal income tax credits for 
rehabilitation work. A building recognized in California as historic may also 
be able to take advantage of the state's more lenient Historic Building Code 
when major repair work is undertaken. Various preservation groups and 
foundations have small grant programs, and historic properties may even qualify 
for property tax relief. Property owners in Los Angeles who think they have a 
historic property can inquire about possible relief under state law. 
</P>
<P>
 For every benefit, of course, there is usually a burden. "If you have a 
building that is on a historic list, you often have to go through hoops if you 
want to make major changes to it," said Jim Hicks, an attorney for 
preservationists at the Los Angeles law firm Andrews & Kurth. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 requires federal agencies to 
take into account the adverse effects of their undertakings on historic 
properties. It is because of this law that FEMA has had to inquire into the 
possible historical significance of properties for which it has been asked to 
fund a demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Historic Preservation Partners are offering grants of up to $10,000 for 
technical assistance, and repair and rehab grants of up to about $250,000 for 
qualified property owners. Work must be completed by September, 1995, and 
property owners must agree to rehabilitate their building in a way that is 
sensitive to the historical features of the building. Owners who receive the 
so-called Bricks and Mortar grants must also sign a covenant not to demolish 
for a period of five to 20 years. For more information, call (213) 623-CITY.

 ALL OR NOTHING: You know those Barbra Streisand tickets turned back in because 
of her four postponed concerts at The Pond of Anaheim? You'd better have deep 
pockets if you want any of them. Late Monday, the $50 tickets were sold out; so 
were the $150 tickets. . . . The $350 seats were the only ones left -- and only 
for the July 22 and July 24 concerts. The July 18 and July 20 concerts were 
sold out, according to Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 NIGHT FLIGHT: If you like going out, maybe there's no such thing as too many 
nightclubs in Orange County. Here's the latest: the Airporter Club. It's at the 
Airporter Garden Hotel in Irvine, across MacArthur Boulevard from John Wayne 
Airport. . . . Thursday's grand opening includes three live bands, free food 
and drink, Los Angeles Rams cheerleaders handing out free key chains, and 458 
square feet of dance floor. The club will play live music all nights except 
Mondays, when a deejay is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH TEACHER? Rudy Lozano, 55, who teaches at Lathrop Intermediate School in 
Santa Ana, recently won first place in a statewide power-lifting competition 
for his age bracket. Now he's training for the nationals. . . . Lozano weighs 
165 pounds, but was able to lift more than 350 pounds. . . . Lozano says 
there's a purpose: to show young people what they can accomplish with 
exercising and staying drug free. There's also a bonus, he quips: "I have 
little problem keeping control of my classes. It helps." 
</P>
<P>
 FIVE TO GO: Remember those 14 people who left Huntington Beach on foot June 18 
heading for Central Park in New York City? . . . . Now they are five. Desert 
temperatures reaching 117 degrees exhausted some of the runners in the 
corporate-sponsored Trans America Footrace. A few were weakened by a 
"dysentery-type illness" they picked up in Utah, a spokeswoman says. Now the 
die-hards have left the desert and are climbing the mountains of Colorado. They 
expect to reach New York Aug. 20.

 BRADYMANIA: It won the nation's Academic Decathlon title, so it's only logical 
that Taft High in Woodland Hills has two new star pupils -- Greg and Marcia 
Brady. The campus is the setting for fictional West Dale High in the new "Brady 
Bunch" film (B2). . . . "I don't think it's ever going to die," said Elizabeth 
Moran, whose book "Bradymania!" has sold 75,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL HEROES: The Valley has reason to brag. It fields two players in today's 
baseball All-Star Game, one more than a lot of major league teams. Local boys 
getting honors are Rod Beck of Grant High in Van Nuys and Bret Saberhagen of 
Cleveland High in Reseda. . . . Marty Siegel, a Cleveland coach, says 
Saberhagen is "doing the same now he did in high school -- throw strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 CARS: Detroit may be the Motor City, but the Southland is making quite an 
impression these days in creating the cars of the future. And that includes the 
Ford studio in Valencia, which had a major influence on the 1993 Probe. . . . 
Another big local contribution is the new design (above) of the classic 
Volkswagen Beetle, put together at a Simi Valley studio. See Valley Business, 
Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAM: The con game, unfortunately, remains alive and well. This time, it 
claimed a 72-year-old woman, who lost her life savings in a K mart parking lot 
in Valencia when a man told her he needed to sell three gold bars to pay for 
his son's hospital bills (B1). . . . In 1993, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department reports, 430 acts of fraud were committed in unincorporated county 
areas and cities patrolled by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 ON TRIAL: He was known for helping out troubled high-tech companies. But now 
it's his turn to be in trouble. He's Quentin Thomas Wiles of Sherman Oaks, who 
has been charged with defrauding investors in a Colorado company by issuing 
false financial statements. . . . The trial began Monday in Denver. See Valley

SCOTT HARRIS: ALLERGIC REACTION TO MEDIA'S O.J. MANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was a well-earned night of vegetation, of slouching on the sofa with 
channel changer in hand. It had been a long day, and the last thing I wanted 
was to watch the news. So I punched up ESPN. All sports. All the time. 
</P>
<P>
 What I wanted were the baseball highlights. We're all entitled to an escape, 
right? 
</P>
<P>
 But ESPN's "SportsCenter" wanted me to wait. Their top story was everybody's 
top story -- a double homicide that has already gotten more ink and more air 
time than most wars. 
</P>
<P>
 And it ticked me off. I can't tell you how it ticked me off. I felt like 
throwing the channel changer at the TV. I felt like calling ESPN and saying: 
"You jerks! You jock-sniffers! Murder is not a sport! Who do you think you are 
-- Court TV?!?" 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I went searching for my new favorite show, which is called "Anything 
but O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as though the Simpson case doesn't interest me. It does. I'll admit 
to intermittent moments of fascination. But I couldn't even watch the famously 
riveting freeway chase for more than a couple of minutes. Not long after the 
first news of the murders, I seemed to develop an allergic reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 My diagnosis suggests a combination of factors. One is almost too common to 
mention. Simply put, I never rooted for a football player more than I rooted 
for O.J. Why, in one semi-glorious season in junior high, I was lucky enough to 
be assigned O.J.'s No. 32, further stoking my superstar fantasies. So inside 
the adult lingers the hurt of an adolescent who fears that he's been betrayed. 
Has the say-it-ain't-so sentiment ever been felt so widely and so deeply? 
</P>
<P>
 But there's another reason for my aversion: the sheer gaudiness of the 
spectacle. The Simpson case is the Las Vegas of media events -- a grotesque 
perversion of sensible values. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us, I suspect, know the difference between a big story and an 
important story. Important stories are supposed to be big. But, as the Simpson 
case demonstrates, an enormous, humongous, Gargantuan story doesn't have to be 
all that important. 
</P>
<P>
 The point here isn't to minimize the pain of the victims and their families. 
Nor is it to minimize the concerns about domestic violence raised by the 
Simpson case. But sadly, there are many other victims and many other families 
who do not make headlines.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the convergence of two great American pastimes -- celebrity worship and 
the voyeurism inspired by "sensational" crimes -- that has made this the 
biggest story of the moment. The people who manage American media believe that 
the public can't get enough O.J. The spousal abuse stories, however worthwhile, 
represent an effort by the media to find deeper meaning to the Simpson case 
and, perhaps, to salvage a measure of self-respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over spousal abuse is not why a division of TV trucks are camped 
outside the Criminal Courts Building. And it's not why the networks went live 
from the preliminary hearing. Rather, the Simpson case is the latest and 
perhaps greatest monument to the way American culture so routinely perceives 
heinous crime as a source of entertainment, eclipsing the sagas of Amy Fisher, 
the Menendez family and the Bobbitts. When the Simpson case reaches its 
resolution, it would be interesting to count and compare the TV hours and print 
coverage devoted to these great L.A. stories -- the Rodney King riot, the 
Northridge earthquake and the Simpson case. Hell, it would be interesting to 
compare them now. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something wrong here, and that's why I hope the O.J. allergy is 
contagious.  
</P>
<P>
 It was good to learn that fans of daytime soap operas, for example, made it 
clear they prefer to be entertained by the fiction of regular programming than 
the sad facts of the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most journalists, I've hyped a story or three, so I can empathize with 
the programmers, producers and editors who want to cover every angle, every 
detail of the Simpson case. If criticized, they'll defend their decisions by 
saying they are merely giving you what you want. Don't blame the messenger -- 
blame the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, they need our help. Letters are good. But the most effective 
protest is to simply change the channel. They'll get the message -- and print 
will follow TV's lead. And in time, maybe O.J. mania will settle down into the 
more appropriate levels of a sensational story of little social consequence -- 
which, if you consider recent examples, is plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 So it isn't that I don't find the Simpson case interesting. It's a good 
whodunit, particularly given the desire to believe it was some random psycho 
and not O.J. But of all the O.J. conversations I've had in recent weeks, the 
most interesting wasn't a dissection of the evidence, an exchange of tasteless 
jokes or the speculative casting of the made-for-TV movies to come. Rather, it 
was an exchange with a visitor from Sweden describing her arrival in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I turned on the TV," she told me, "there was this picture of a white 
truck on the freeway. The police were trying to arrest this Simpson man for 
murder. And I was wondering, 'Who is this Simpson?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, to be blessed with such ignorance.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; FIGHT AGAINST AIDS

 Often, those who offer to help the AIDS Healthcare Foundation have lost 
someone to AIDS -- a family member, a friend, a co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 But increasingly, some volunteers have had no contact at all with people who 
have contracted the disease, such as a college student who either took a course 
or read a magazine article, said Karen Dale Wolman, the foundation's director 
of volunteer resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "They realize how devastating it is, and they want to be involved with people 
who have AIDS," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolman, once a volunteer, got involved with the foundation through her work on 
lesbian issues and because she has lost close friends to AIDS. Rather than 
trying to help someone you know with AIDS, she said, it is sometimes easier to 
help strangers as a volunteer for a group such as the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which runs two hospices and four outpatient clinics, 
provides help to AIDS patients regardless of their ability to pay. Its newest 
clinic opened in Sherman Oaks in November and has recently started looking for 
volunteers for daytime office work. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic especially needs bilingual volunteers. Although AIDS has 
devastated the homosexual population in the San Fernando Valley, the disease 
has been spreading to heterosexuals, including undocumented minorities, in 
greater numbers, said Joe Silva, the case manager for the Sherman Oaks clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Zanaida Vasquez, the clinic's office manager, remembers one case in which a 
woman was in the final stages of the disease. She had not gone to the clinic 
because she was an undocumented resident. Finally, she went to Olive View 
Medical Center in Sylmar, where she died. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think we are going to turn them in," said Vasquez, who added that the 
clinic closely protects the confidentiality of its patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more education and outreach," Silva said. "We want people to know we 
are here." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching heterosexuals with AIDS is also difficult because of the lingering 
stigma attached to the disease. Because many see AIDS as only a gay disease, 
the denial among heterosexuals may run deep, Wolman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have residents (dying) in hospices who don't admit that they have AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation promises that no phone call to its clinics will be ended until 
the person calling receives the help he or she needs, or a referral somewhere 
else in the network of agencies that deal with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy is to provide one-stop shopping," said Wolman, explaining that 
the foundation's goal is to have as many services as possible available through 
one site. The organization also is starting a free legal-service program within 
the next month, which will include help with wills, immigration, family issues 
and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to volunteer, call Vasquez at (818) 981-0041 or Wolman 
at (213) 462-2273. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Tournament of Roses is looking for volunteers to help with the 
construction of its "Reach for the Wind" float, which will appear in the 
Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day. Burbank is one of only six cities 
that build floats entirely with volunteer labor. Float work parties are on 
Wednesdays and Saturdays. For more information, call (213) 258-1925 or (818) 
566-7933. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Storefront Multiservice Center for Seniors is looking for 
volunteers to instruct seniors in a variety of subjects such as photography, 
indoor gardening, beginning French, t'ai chi, pepper-spray use and 
improvisational comedy. Classes are one hour once a week. Call to schedule an 
interview with Judy Raffel, activities director, at (818) 984-1380. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Storefront is looking for a volunteer co-chairman for its Senior 
Tix program, which arranges for discount theater tickets for senior citizens, 
and a typist who preferably knows how to use a computer. For information, call 
(818) 984-1380.

'DISCOUNT KING' THUMBS HIS NOSE AT RETAIL BUREAUCRATS; JAPAN: TOSHIO MIYAJI'S 
HIGH-VOLUME, CASH-ONLY SHOPS, ONCE VIEWED AS SHADY, LAST YEAR RANG UP $126 
MILLION IN SALES AND HAVE MADE HIM A FOLK HERO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARI YAMAGUCHI, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toshio Miyaji has made a career and a fortune out of flouting the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 As founder and president of a small Tokyo-based electronics retail chain, 
Miyaji takes special delight in bending or sidestepping government regulations 
and the cozy conventions of Japan's business world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 65 already, time is short. If I can change the laws in my lifetime, I 
don't mind sacrificing myself," Miyaji says. "I'm ready to go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "Discount King" and "Consumers' Crusader" by the media, Miyaji's 
aggressive business style and flamboyant marketing stunts have made him 
something of a folk hero in this increasingly consumer-oriented society. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have made him richer. While other retailers watch sales languish as 
Japan's recession drags on, sales at Miyaji's Jonan Denki shops shot up to 13 
billion yen -- about $126 million -- in the fiscal year that ended March 31, up 
from 8.3 billion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyaji's spry appearance and friendly western-Japan accent give him an elfin, 
grandfatherly air that is belied by his sharp eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of his success is in the Louis Vuitton briefcase he uses to haul 
around some 30 million yen in cash to make purchases on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyaji started out as a "battaya," a spot trader who buys up leftover 
inventory from bankrupt stores at steep discounts. Now he uses his cash to buy 
most of the merchandise he sells directly from manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of his strategy is to give up his right to return unsold goods to 
suppliers, one of many arcane Japanese retail practices that help keep prices 
in this country higher. Miyaji often gets products at less than 60% of list 
price, about 15% less than more conventional store owners. 
</P>
<P>
 His tactics enable Miyaji to sell appliances -- from rice cookers to radios -- 
at roughly 30% off standard prices. European cosmetics go for as much as half 
off list prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyaji's high volume, cash-only business once was viewed as slightly shady. 
But Japanese consumers increasingly on the lookout for good deals and cheaper 
imports are shedding such qualms as they find ways to skirt a retail system 
stuffed with price-inflating middlemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm buying here because of the president's consumer-friendly policy," says 
Masahiko Nishimura, who ordered air conditioners, a refrigerator and a rice 
cooker while shopping with his fiancee. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyaji agrees with U.S. trade negotiators who accuse government bureaucrats of 
coddling retail middlemen to shut competitive imports out of the Japanese 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to cut the trade surplus, President Clinton ought to come talk to 
me instead of wasting time with bureaucrats," Miyaji suggested during a recent 
interview at his office in Tokyo's Shibuya entertainment and shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop looks more like a warehouse than like its sleek, chrome and glass 
retail competitors -- Miyaji doesn't throw money away on fancy decorations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miyaji, the bureaucrats in charge of regulating Japan's multitiered retail 
system face a formidable rival. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Food Agency tried to crack down on sales of home-grown rice this 
spring to counter a shortfall, Miyaji dumped 11 tons of the forbidden grain, 
packed in plastic bags, in front of one of his retail shops in Tokyo and sold 
it at half the price he had paid for it. Miyaji says he ran the sale to force 
the government to confront problems in the way it handles rice distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 2,000 people lined up to buy the rice, which sold out in less than two 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food Agency, which controls sales of the grain, issued a warning to Miyaji 
for selling rice without a license. But already embarrassed by harsh public 
criticism over its failure to balance rice supply and demand, it took no 
action. Agency officials said they didn't punish Miyaji because he had promised 
to donate some rice to the elderly or give it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Thumbing his nose at the Pharmaceuticals Affairs Law, Miyaji peels the 
Japanese-language labels listing ingredients and other information off imported 
lipsticks to hide the identity of his "battaya" supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do this because the law is bad," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyaji took some detours on the way to discount superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a lumber trader in western Japan, Miyaji opened the first of his 
six Jonan Denki outlets in 1968, after earlier businesses in car battery repair 
and pinball machine manufacturing failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition was cutthroat: Miyaji's ads were torn down and his phone lines 
cut -- he believes by manufacturers outraged by his refusal to play by usual 
business rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Miyaji was slightly injured in a mugging -- the robber who broke 
into his office was after his famous cash-stuffed briefcase. The thief, who has 
not been caught, made off with about 1 million yen. Miyaji is still carrying 
the briefcase around.

FIRMS CAN EASE REVERSE CULTURE SHOCK FOR EMPLOYEES; TRANSITION: 25% OF U.S. 
EXECUTIVES QUIT THEIR COMPANIES WITHIN A YEAR OF THEIR RETURN FROM ASSIGNMENT 
OVERSEAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After working overseas, many executives suffer a severe case of culture shock 
when they return to home base. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, many U.S. companies do little or nothing to smooth the 
return of their executives from foreign assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one company in 20 provides any repatriation training, and their failure 
to address the issue "is a waste of time, money and people's careers," says J. 
Stewart Black, associate professor at the Thunderbird Graduate School of 
International Management in Glendale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason why 25% of all returned executives quit their companies 
within a year, said Black, who has worked abroad for a U.S. firm and authored a 
book on global assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Black found from his own survey of 300 returned U.S. executives of 
multinational firms that 65% of them "have a harder time with reverse culture 
shock than they did going overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Black calls it the "Dorothy Syndrome," after the heroine of "The Wizard of 
Oz," who found Kansas just as she left it when she got home. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Dorothy's experience, homecoming for many executives and their 
families can be disillusioning when so much about Kansas has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Black, repatriated managers often discover: 
</P>
<P>
 * Their efforts abroad were not appreciated. "They and their families expect a 
hero's welcome after returning home from a successful global assignment, but 
many are lucky to receive any welcome at all." 
</P>
<P>
 As one photography company official complained, "I busted my butt working for 
them in Tokyo for five years and when I came back they didn't even know I 
existed." 
</P>
<P>
 * No plans have been made for them to step into new assignments. About 
one-third of them, Black said, "are caught in a holding pattern, with no 
specific job, title or responsibilities. The company hasn't thought about what 
to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 * They are "out of sight and out of mind" to mentors and supervisors who 
posted them overseas, and therefore are virtual strangers when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 * They are marked by home office superiors as being "different" because they 
have picked up "foreign ways" or a foreign perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 * The broad freedom of action they enjoyed overseas has been radically 
reduced, as it usually is for 80% of those returning. 
</P>
<P>
 * The familiar ways of doing business they had mastered have changed 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our organizational culture was turned upside down. We now have a different 
strategic focus, different tools to get the job done and different buzzwords to 
make it happen. I had to learn a whole new corporate language," one expatriate 
lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 * The nation itself may have changed perceptibly to the point that "Kansas 
isn't Kansas anymore," Black said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People often return home with incorrect mental maps of what to do, learned 
inabilities regarding how to do it and uncertainties about what the results of 
their actions will be in the now foreign home country," Black wrote in "Global 
Assignments" (Josey-Bass Publishers, San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he says, "their closest friends can become envious and uncomfortable 
in their company, and their children, especially teen-agers, can feel really 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many repatriates have become severely depressed, requiring psychiatric 
counseling -- one more expense for a company that on average has shelled out 
$1.2 million to keep the executive and family abroad for a typical four-year 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, Black said, is that companies can ease repatriates back into 
the organization by assigning a mentor who will keep them informed about the 
home office while they are abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The repatriate will also be helped by as little as one day of "repatriation 
training," Black said. The session could be either before they return home or 
shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, headquarters can put the repatriate in touch with previously returned 
employees who understand their feelings when they realize that "Kansas isn't 
Kansas anymore."

INVESTORS SHOULD MOVE CAUTIOUSLY ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY; COMPUTERS: SCAM

 "Caution: Bad advice ahead. Proceed slowly and at your own discretion." 
</P>
<P>
 If the information highway was a real highway, with transportation department 
officials posting protective road signs at all the on-ramps, there would be one 
like that at the entrance to Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online, Internet and 
all the other computer bulletin board systems where investors congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment scams, stock manipulations and illegal promotions abound on on-line 
investment bulletin boards, says the National Assn. of State Securities 
Administrators. And that doesn't even count the many well-intentioned investors 
who trade tips freely but don't have any idea what they are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 What's good about the on-line world also presents serious risks. Anyone with a 
computer and modem can send a message that hundreds of thousands of people will 
read. And the feel of the on-line world conveys a certain strength of 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 On-line communicators, unable to convey subtleties with an inflection of the 
voice or the raise of an eyebrow, tend to remove all the verbal qualifiers we 
throw into our speech and strengthen their on-line language. A good stock 
becomes a can't-miss opportunity. An investment hobbyist becomes a fee-charging 
mutual fund adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are just some of the scams that have gone on-line, according to Craig 
Goettsch, president of the securities administrators group and superintendent 
of the Iowa Securities Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Antonio-based ring promoted an illegal electronic-mail chain letter 
promising people that if they sent $1 to each of five people on an on-line 
list, they could earn $60,000 in just three to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A stockbroker unlicensed to do business in Missouri touted his own services 
and made dubious claims for stocks not registered for sale in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 An Austin, Tex., man invested $10,000 with an out-of-state correspondent who 
called himself a skilled money manager but who, in fact, was not licensed as a 
stockbroker or investment adviser and who pocketed the money. 
</P>
<P>
 A ring of 20 individuals manipulated prices on stocks they owned, dumping them 
after on-line hype pushed the prices up to levels that proved profitable to the 
scam artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment schemes now flourish on commercial bulletin boards, says Goettsch. 
The most prevalent involve manipulation of obscure, thinly traded stocks (one 
user can sign on with different names and make it appear there's a broad-based 
rush into a stock); misconduct by phony and unlicensed brokers and advisers; 
undisclosed interests of promoters who may be paid to push a product; and the 
promotion of exotic scams like gold mines, pyramid schemes and ostrich farms 
that are also promoted by phone and mail. 
</P>
<P>
 What's a high-tech investor to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't give up the on-line world. It still remains a marvelous place to get 
quick quotes and research, perform trades and talk with others who have serious 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Just take all the information with a tremendous grain of salt and constantly 
remind yourself that you're taking advice from people you don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 And avoid the stupid: no investing by mail with a company you haven't checked 
out, no buying stocks you haven't researched yourself, no assuming that your 
on-line compatriots have your interests at heart and no conflicted ones of 
their own, and -- most obviously -- no sending away $5 and expecting to get 
$60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to show that all on-line correspondence isn't bad, you can reach the 
National Assn. of State Securities Administrators at: nasaa@holonet.net.

RAVELING CITES LOVE FOR L.A. IN STAYING AS USC'S COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Raveling, Trojan basketball coach, said Monday he would stay at USC, 
turning down the vacant coaching position at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being offered more money and an opportunity to return to the area of 
his youth with a team in the Big East Conference, Raveling said his commitment 
was to USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a few sleepless nights and long hours of deliberation . . . ultimately, 
I had to decide to listen to my inner voice and the dictates of my heart," said 
Raveling, who has coached at USC for eight seasons. "At this juncture of my 
professional career and coaching life, I've decided that it is best for me to 
remain as head basketball coach at the University of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling spoke with USC President Steven Sample before making his choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach's decision surprised some who had believed that he would accept the 
job because of his friendship with Larry Keating, Seton Hall's athletic 
director, and the reported salary, $2.5 million for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling makes a base salary of $200,000 per year now and has two years left 
on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, however, cited other factors that were strong enough to make him 
stay at USC. His son, Mark, has another year at the school and Raveling said he 
has a growing love affair with Southern California as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has really been an emotional experience for me, perhaps the most in my 
31 years as a basketball coach," said Raveling, who came near to tears at one 
point during the news conference. "I've learned a lot from this. I realize that 
I really love SC." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his rumored differences with Athletic Director Mike Garrett, 
who has made it no secret that he wants to upgrade the Trojans' basketball 
program to ease the athletic department's financial strains, Raveling answered: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any concern about that. I think some of that has been made more 
of than necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that we've made significant progress with this program from the time I 
first took over. We all want instant gratification. But realistically, what we 
can get is delayed gratification. We've gone from the bottom of the heap to 
among the leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who said he has been told USC will have a new practice site by the 
end of 1995, denied reports that he was given a contract extension or a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never did I once ask for an extension to my contract or ask for any 
additional money consideration," Raveling said. "I would not want the 
characterization wrote that the school turned down (or accepted) the request 
because I never made that request." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two weeks, Raveling, 57, has been staying in a hotel in Irvine, 
preparing the U.S. national team for the Goodwill Games in Russia later this 
month. Since he became a candidate for the Seton Hall job, he said, he has had 
more than 200 phone messages at either the hotel or his Los Angeles home, most 
from local supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The support I've received has been amazing to me," Raveling said. "The other 
day at a (U.S. national scrimmage game against the Lakers' summer league team), 
a little kid walked up and gave me a note that said, 'Coach Rav, don't leave.' 
Things like this made it kind of tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling has taken USC, Iowa and Washington State to the NCAA tournament and 
has a 115-118 record with the Trojans, who have been in postseason play the 
last four seasons. But he is coming off a 16-12 season in which the Trojans 
finished seventh in the Pacific 10 Conference and lost to Fresno State in the 
first round of the National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, (getting the job offer) was kind of exciting," Raveling 
said. "But then when you think about it being permanent, you start to wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just relieved that it's over."

ALL-STAR GAME; CLOUDS OBSCURE THE STARS; BASEBALL: THE THREAT OF A PLAYER 
STRIKE OVERSHADOWS TONIGHT'S ANNUAL GAME BETWEEN THE MAJOR LEAGUES. 
</P>

<P>
 They will play the 65th All-Star game at Three Rivers Stadium tonight, but a 
gulf wider than the Ohio, Allegheny or Monongahela continues to separate 
baseball's owners and players. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Maddux of the Atlanta Braves and Jimmy Key of the New York Yankees were 
selected to start for the National and American leagues as the teams worked out 
Monday amid a darkening labor situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's executive board, made up of players from each of the 28 teams, did 
not set a strike date during a five-hour meeting here Monday, but Executive 
Director Don Fehr said three-fourths of the clubs -- with the others yet to 
vote -- have given virtually unanimous strike authorization. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate news conferences, Fehr and Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief 
negotiator, seemed to paint a bleak outlook regarding completion of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said the owners "cannot and will not" continue under the current 
economic system and that a salary cap linked to increased revenue sharing by 
the clubs is the "most sensible" answer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said baseball "will be in a hell of a mess" if there is no bargaining 
agreement by Nov. 1 and insisted the owners will not give up their right to 
ultimately declare an impasse and implement the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr reiterated that a cap will restrict salaries, transfer hundreds of 
millions of dollars from players to owners over the proposed seven years, 
destroy free agency, eliminate arbitration -- at least under the owners' 
proposal -- and inhibit competitive balance because decisions will be made by 
accountants rather than general managers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the owners have yet to make a persuasive enough case that an industry 
with revenue of $1.9 billion has the types of problems that have to be resolved 
with a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 He challenged the owners to ease their alleged problems by changing their 
revenue-sharing formula without linking it to a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't do that because the big clubs want the players to pay them back 
(under a salary cap) for helping out the smaller clubs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike, he insisted, is a last resort, but a strike represents the players' 
only leverage against the owners' declaration of an impasse.  
</P>
<P>
 The dates that the players seem to be considering most seriously are Aug. 16 
and Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "This should be an exciting, vibrant, good time for everybody," Fehr said. 
"It's been a phenomenal year with several players setting a record pace, 
attendance projecting to more than 70 million again and a new playoff format 
starting in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't be sitting at the All-Star game talking about a collective 
bargaining agreement that doesn't appear headed for resolution. No one wants 
this. No one wants the fans to sit through another work stoppage, but any fan 
who has followed the last 18 months (while the players waited for the owners' 
proposal) understands that this is not a fight of the players' choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never seen a situation in which a day after the owners finally make 
their proposal, their chief negotiator is predicting a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, there's a pattern to it, and I think it's obvious that some 
management people still believe they can break the union and hope to provoke a 
strike, but the players won't be provoked until there's no other option." 
</P>
<P>
 The players have not formally rejected the salary cap, but their own 
proposals, which they will probably make Thursday or Friday in New York, are 
designed to maintain the status quo rather than open avenues of negotiation 
within a cap concept, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that's not the case," Ravitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the union is responsive to our underlying needs. The owners will lose 
between $125 million and $150 million this year. The disparity in revenue among 
the clubs is becoming greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no alternative to the owners' need to change the system. It would be 
an act of self-immolation on the part of the union to strike for a long time, 
thinking the owners will capitulate as they have in the past. It won't happen 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 As Ravitch and Fehr discussed the possibility of an eighth work stoppage in 
the eight negotiations since 1972, National League manager Jim Fregosi of the 
Philadelphia Phillies was selecting Dodger catcher Mike Piazza to bat cleanup 
between Barry Bonds and Matt Williams in a lineup he hopes will end the 
American's six-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Piazza in cleanup? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's Italian," Fregosi said, adding, "Of all our guys, I think he's having 
the best all-around year from an average, power and production standpoint, so I 
thought it would be a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza took it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be cool, a good experience," he said. "This will be a crash course if I 
ever hit cleanup for the Dodgers." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza, who has hit 21 homers and driven in 76 runs, simply crashed again in 
Monday's home run contest. He went without one for the second consecutive year 
as the AL won it, with Ken Griffey Jr. hitting seven out. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League lineup features Griffey, with 33 homers and 69 RBIs, 
batting third and Frank Thomas, with a .383 average, 32 homers and 78 RBIs, 
batting fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey, Thomas and Williams have led this summer of record paces, but Maddux 
and Key have managed to balance the books. Maddux is 11-5 with a 1.80 
earned-run average in his bid for athird consecutive Cy Young award, and Key is 
13-2 with a 3.31 ERA. All-Star Statistics

JIM MURRAY: ALL-STAR GAME; PIAZZA MAKES JINX SOPHOMORIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are certain superstitions baseball lives by. It is considered unlucky to 
mention a no-hitter in progress in the dugout for fear of angering the baseball 
gods into ordaining a hit. It was considered unlucky to strike out the first 
batter until, one day, Dizzy Dean in some exasperation wanted to know, "How can 
you strike 'em all out if you don't get the first one?" 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the most enduring of all baseball superstitions is the one that 
holds there is a "sophomore jinx." According to its logic, a player who had an 
outstanding rookie season inevitably suffered a disastrous or near-disastrous 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to see what it's based on. You will look in vain in the record 
book to find any substantiation, instances of where such players had anything 
but improvements from their rookie to sophomore seasons. Because he was a 
pitcher his first five years, it's difficult to compute Babe Ruth's first and 
second years but, in general, you will find he went from .322 his first full 
year as a batsman to .376, no less, his second. His homers took a quantum leap 
from 29 to 54.  
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere it's the same. Ty Cobb went from .320 to league-leading .350, 
Rogers Hornsby from .313 to .327. Stan Musial went from .315 to .357 and a 
batting title. Henry Aaron went from .280 to .314 and in homers from 13 to 27.  
</P>
<P>
 And so on.  
</P>
<P>
 None of which will come as any surprise to Michael Joseph Piazza, the nearest 
thing to asuperstar in the catching irons today.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza is supposed to be in the firm embrace of that storied second-year 
jinx this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Some jinx! Piazza, at the All-Star break and playing in tonight's game as the 
sole representative of the Dodgers, was batting .325 at the close of business 
Sunday. That's up seven points from his average in 1993, when he was rookie of 
the year, one of only four catchers ever to get that honor in his league. 
Johnny Bench, Earl Williams and Benito Santiago were the others. And only seven 
catchers got it altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza has hit 21 home runs in a little more than half a season this year, 
compared to 35 all of last year. He has 76 RBIs. He had 112 for a full season 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Jinxes, of course, never stand the scrutiny of time or examination. Players 
who have second-year jinxes usually have third-, fourth- and fifth-year jinxes 
as well. What ordinarily happens is that the pitchers find the pitches the 
rookies can't hit and feed them a diet of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger players have been rookie of the year 13 times since the award was 
inaugurated in 1947 -- with a Dodger, Jackie Robinson, as the first winner. Far 
from being a jinx, it has been a springboard to a long and illustrious career 
for most. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of rookies of the year reads like a Hall of Fame roster. Willie Mays, 
Frank Robinson, Pete Rose, Willie McCovey, Tom Seaver and Don Newcombe were 
award winners. Not a bad second year in the lot.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to understand, Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays or Barry Bonds comes into 
the league with flags waving, bands playing. Piazza was almost smuggled in. 
Piazza was picked in the 62nd round and the popular misconception was, he was 
chosen because Manager Tom Lasorda was his godfather. He wasn't. He was 
Piazza's brother's godfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza didn't fit the profile of the prototypical American ballplayer of the 
20th Century anyway. He didn't come from a farm or underprivileged background. 
Father was rich, in fact, rich enough to build him an indoor batting cage, rich 
enough to try to buy a major league baseball team, the Giants, of his own.  
</P>
<P>
 But indoor batting cages work only if you have the coordination to meet the 
balls served up, the eyesight to gauge their curvature and the strength to hit 
one over walls.  
</P>
<P>
 Piazza had these in abundance. He could hit more than batting cage serves. 
Only two rookies have ever hit more home runs than he did in his rookie season 
-- Wally Berger and Frank Robinson. Only two ever had more RBIs than his 112.  
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers have no clue how to pitch to Piazza. Most of his home runs are not 
"pull" hits at all, but balls that land in right or right-center. He seldom 
hits a home run less than 400 feet. In short, even swinging late, he has the 
strength to drive a ball out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that he plays a position -- catcher -- that is perhaps the most 
important in the game, he should be in the hunt for the most valuable player 
award every year his numbers duplicate.  
</P>
<P>
 Most teams ask no more of a catcher than a .269 average and a dozen or so home 
runs with, say, 70 RBIs. Piazza passes those in mid-season. 
</P>
<P>
 But by baseball tradition, he should be walking around with a cloud over his 
head, like that character in L'il Abner, Joe Btfsplk. He should be standing in 
the rain, hiding under the bed, tiptoeing through a cemetery.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he's going to be playing in the All-Star game tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 How did he avoid the hoodoo? The answer is, Piazza did it by treating it for 
what it is -- nonexistent. He treats it like a high, outside changeup. He lays 
off it. Ignores it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think, if it ever existed, it was an accumulation of trying too hard, 
pressing to live up to a past that you achieved by being relaxed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "My position in the game is basically a defensive one and I have enough to 
think about without worrying about any jinx. I don't think about numbers. I 
think about winning the game. That sort of takes your mind off yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 For a catcher, Piazza suggests, a time at bat might be a relief, not a 
torment.  
</P>
<P>
 If a 21-homer, 76-RBI half-season is a jinx, a lot of guys might want to kill 
a chicken or stick a pin in a doll so they could catch it. For the Dodger 
catcher, so far it's been more high jinks than voodoo. When last seen, the jinx 
was disappearing over the center field wall.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; THE NUT IN THE NETS; SWEDEN'S RAVELLI SEEMS LIKE 
A NORMAL FELLOW, BUT THE TRUTH CUTS HOLES IN THAT SCENARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goalkeepers, no matter their nationality, have traditionally been a bit, well, 
peculiar. 
</P>
<P>
 In South America, it is no surprise that many of them are nicknamed "El Loco." 
</P>
<P>
 England's Brian Glanville once wrote a book entitled "Goalkeepers Are Crazy." 
No one argued the point. It comes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to be a little strange to do what goalkeepers do. The want ads for 
keepers read something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Tired of your everyday job? Why not try goalkeeping? Requirements include not 
objecting to having your fingers broken consistently, an aptitude for diving 
headfirst into a melee of flying soccer cleats, a willingness to put your body 
in front of 70-m.p.h. shots. The ability to fly is a plus." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which is by way of introduction to a certain Thomas Ravelli, who these 
days can be found secretly cutting holes in the underwear of his teammates on 
the Swedish World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 Or reading poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 Or risking life and limb to put Sweden into the semifinals of the World Cup 
for only the second time.  
</P>
<P>
 Does Ravelli qualify as peculiar? You bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he rate right up there with the world's best goalkeepers? Sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But about that underwear business?  
</P>
<P>
 To get to the, uh, bottom of the story requires a bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli was born in Vimmerby but grew up in the small town of Vaxjo in 
southern Sweden. Until he and his twin brother, Andreas, came along, the place 
was best known for its matches -- the kind you light, not the kind you play. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of an Austrian immigrant, young Thomas endured the typical Swedish 
childhood -- plenty of snow and too many Ingmar Bergman movies -- so it was not 
surprising that he became a wire-brush salesman and part-time soccer player. 
Working in the match factory didn't strike his fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was 22, he had established a reputation as something of a nut 
and was thus perfectly positioned to become Sweden's national team goalkeeper 
when Ronnie Hellstrom retired in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the same year Ravelli won the Golden Ball, which is presented 
annually to the nation's best player. He didn't drop it, so his place on the 
national team was assured. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been there ever since. When Ravelli took the field in Sunday's 
quarterfinal against Romania at Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, he was playing 
his 115th game for Sweden, tying the record set by Bjorn Nordquist. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, which Sweden won on penalty kicks thanks to Ravelli's two 
penalty saves and all-round excellent play, Nordquist sent him a good luck fax, 
saying "It's about time somebody broke my record." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ravelli said the record was the last thing on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think of that at all," he said. "If this had been a friendly game or 
something else, I would have thought more about playing for my 115th cap. But 
this game was so important for us, I didn't think about Nordquist." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli is not easily mistaken for anyone else on the field -- Andreas, his 
twin, also played for Sweden as a defender but has since retired. Thomas 
Ravelli's receding hairline and almost demonic glare are trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
 So is the intensity of his game. Goalkeepers are supposed to be loud. They are 
supposed to shout at their defenders and keep the lines of communication open. 
Ravelli can almost be heard by the other keeper more than 100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very competitive," Ravelli said. "I want to show everyone that I am in 
command of my area. Anyway, I hate losing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very loud," defender Joachim Bjorklund said, then joked, "but we don't 
hear him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Added striker Martin Dahlin, "He's a crazy man and talks a lot, which is 
really important." 
</P>
<P>
 And something of a wild card in the Swedish pack, it seems. Ravelli likes to 
keep things loose in the locker room, Dahlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance? 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, you might come back to the locker room and find holes cut in 
your underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 Does this sound like a happily married man of 34 with three children? Or does 
it sound like a goalkeeper? Even Ravelli is not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have this primitive thing about being a goalkeeper," he said. "That takes 
over. I don't like to think too much. During the game, I'm another person." 
</P>
<P>
 So far in World Cup '94 that other person has been at the top of his game. 
After a shaky start in Sweden's 2-2 opening tie against Cameroon, Ravelli has 
been spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Pontus Kamark, one of the defenders on the Swedish team, is 10 years younger 
than Ravelli and remembers watching him as a child. Kamark said that in this 
World Cup, Ravelli has rediscovered his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rate him very high," Kamark said. "But a few years ago we thought 
that the job should go to the second goalkeeper. Thomas was lazy. His training 
was not very serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little, I would watch him on television, making saves, jumping 
high for the ball. He's playing like that again. I haven't seen him play better 
than this for the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a reason behind Ravelli's newfound enthusiasm. He has never played 
abroad and has never made much money from the game in Sweden, where he has 
starred on four championship-winning teams, including his current club, IFK 
Gothenburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the twilight of his career but still very much at the top of his game, 
he wants to make a dollar or two off the sport. His hope is that a Major League 
Soccer team in the United States will come calling, or that the J-League in 
Japan will want a goalkeeper with a sense of the absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he'd like to keep playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer is the most funnest thing for me to work with," he said after the 
victory over Romania. "I feel like that. It's my hobby. Some people play golf, 
I do this. I love it."

NFL'S ANNUAL RITE BEGINS AFTER OFF-SEASON OF CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It happens every summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The good people of Latrobe, Pa., form two lines along the steep steps leading 
up the hill from the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice field to their locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 As the players trudge past after completing two-a-day practices, the citizens 
cheer them. Not for winning, but surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens every summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Little boys bring their bikes and their dreams to Lambeau Field in Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The lucky ones are hired by those Packers who don't want to make the long walk 
across the parking lot to the practice field. The player rides the boy's bike, 
the boy jogs alongside carrying the player's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 The player pays a buck and gets a breather. The boy gets to touch a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 It happens every summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The good people of Platteville, Wis., entertain the Chicago Bears with a pig 
roast. 
</P>
<P>
 The good people of LaCrosse, Wis., are treated to a tailgate party by the New 
Orleans Saints, offering that rare opportunity to spill mustard on Jim Mora. 
</P>
<P>
 From Fredonia State to Flagstaff, from Sierra Community College to St. 
Edward's, small places will begin filling up with big names this week as NFL 
teams open training camps. 
</P>
<P>
 This being the second year of landmark upheaval in the league, some names will 
be bigger than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Switzer will begin training camp in Austin, Tex., his first as coach of 
the Dallas Cowboys. Jimmy Johnson will begin training camp on a boat docked off 
South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 But time and distance will not lessen the sting of their insults. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon will be starting all over again with the Minnesota Vikings. 
Likewise for about a dozen other quarterbacks and their new teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And Buddy Ryan, football's most bombastic personality, will begin his first 
training camp as coach of the Phoenix -- oops, make that Arizona -- Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 One Buddy, one group of players badly in need of a swift kick, all thrown 
together in the forests of northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody else think that sounds like a pig roast and a tailgate party 
rolled into one? 
</P>
<P>
 A peek at the next six weeks: HI, I'M WARREN. AND YOU? 
</P>
<P>
 While NFL owners were making rules to increase scoring, their general managers 
were making moves to reduce it. What else would you call trading or releasing 
quarterbacks as if they were kickers? 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly because of free agency and the salary cap, 11 of the 28 teams will have 
new starting quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 We're guessing none of them will throw for as many as 350 yards in one game in 
the first month. Some of them won't even know all the plays until Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the tough and smart will triumph. The rest will get treated like Mark 
Rypien. 
</P>
<P>
 The three easiest transitions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jim Everett, New Orleans Saints. Not too tough getting used to speedy wide 
receivers and fans who aren't threatening to dismember you. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jeff George, Atlanta Falcons. Nobody other than Mike Tyson wanted to leave 
Indiana so badly. His season should be one big smile. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Erik Kramer, Chicago Bears. Dave Wannstedt is careful never to put his 
players in a position to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The three most difficult transitions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Warren Moon, Minnesota Vikings. Where he's going, the run-and-shoot is 
something you do in the woods with your dog. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Heath Shuler, Washington Redskins. A rookie quarterback in the NFC East? By 
Halloween, he will have the smile of a jack o' lantern. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dave Brown, New York Giants. Who? YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT FIRST 
IMPRESSIONS 
</P>
<P>
 We know Ken Norton Jr. is going to be the leader of the San Francisco 49ers' 
defense the minute he shows up at Sierra Community College. That's simply him. 
</P>
<P>
 And we know Seth Joyner and Clyde Simmons will have Cardinal defenders 
throwing around offensive teammates from the first scrimmage in Flagstaff. 
That's simply them. 
</P>
<P>
 But for other celebrated free agents, first impressions are less certain and 
more important. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the San Diego Chargers thought Anthony Miller was selfish. The Denver 
Broncos will be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Jones was never reluctant to speak his mind in Houston. The Packers will 
be listening. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years in Atlanta, Chris Miller was not sound for more than two 
seconds. The Rams will be holding their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Falcons accept troubled Ironhead Heyward? Will the Detroit Lions 
listen to a career backup, Scott Mitchell? 
</P>
<P>
 And wouldn't you like to be a fly on the wall when former Bear Steve McMichael 
checks in with his former hated rivals in Green Bay? 
</P>
<P>
 Cheeseheads, huh Mongo? THREE WORDS: CAN THEY RUN? 
</P>
<P>
 The three most important injury rehabilitations, in order of progress: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Terry Allen, Vikings, knee surgery: He has recovered so well that he was 
able to compete in a made-for-TV running back competition. He will spend the 
season in the same sentence with Emmitt Smith and Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randall Cunningham, Philadelphia Eagles, broken leg: The leg has healed. 
But has the ego? It's not every off-season your bosses announce they are trying 
to trade you. A huge year for a man who does his best when he's the only one 
who believes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dan Marino, Miami Dolphins, torn Achilles' tendon: He will be the only one 
of the big three rehab cases who will not be 100% by the start of training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a problem? Depends on what you believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino threw well during mini-camps, but did not participate in the entire 
workouts. He will remain on the same reduced schedule until at least the start 
of exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question he does not have the step that quarterbacks need to 
escape trouble, the ability to step up into or scramble out of the pocket. But 
did he ever have that step? 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say no, but if anybody can recover fully from a mobility-limiting 
injury, it is the quarterback with the game's quickest release. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics wonder. We have seen cornerbacks' careers end with this type of 
injury. But we have seen NBA star Dominique Wilkins come back with a flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 What about quarterbacks? We don't know what to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither do the Dolphins, the proof being an off-season acquisition named 
Bernie Kosar. THE HEAT IS ON, AND WE AREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE WEATHER IN AUSTIN 
OR PLATTEVILLE 
</P>
<P>
 As difficult as it is to change teams, sometimes there is even more pressure 
in staying. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Cody Carlson, who occupies his own NFL hot spot as the Oiler quarterback 
replacing Warren Moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that Carlson looks as comfortable with the Oilers as Bum Phillips once 
did. He is tough, he is respected after past successes there, and he will do 
splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hot spot is in the Kansas City Chiefs' defensive backfield, where the 
starting cornerbacks from last year's AFC championship finalists are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Lewis and Kevin Ross are gone. In their places are former New York 
Giant Mark Collins and Dale Carter. David Whitmore, Doug Terry and Charles 
Mincy are at safety. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway, are you listening? Thought so. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be no hotter spot than the Cowboy defense, which has lost 
leadership, depth and experience with the departures of Norton, Tony Casillas, 
Jimmie Jones and Thomas Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 We like James Washington replacing Everett at free safety. But we don't like 
Robert Jones starting at middle linebacker in place of Norton. 
</P>
<P>
 And we have no idea what the Cowboys will do for fresh legs in the defensive 
line in the third and fourth quarters. Their strength has become a weakness. 
And don't the 49ers know it. THEY'D BETTER DO MORE THAN STAND UP IN THE 
CAFETERIA AND SING THEIR FIGHT SONGS 
</P>
<P>
 These rookies need to play like veterans -- and quick: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marshall Faulk, Indianapolis Colts. He can save face for a struggling 
franchise, and the job of a nice coach named Ted Marchibroda. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Trent Dilfer, Tampa Bay Buccaneers. See Faulk. Insert Sam Wyche for 
Marchibroda. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bryant Young, San Francisco 49ers. All of their defensive changes won't 
mean a thing if he is the reincarnation of Ted Washington. IS DON SHULA REALLY 
IN THE LAST YEAR OF HIS CONTRACT? IF SO, WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THE REST OF 
YOU GUYS? 
</P>
<P>
 Five coaches whose jobs are absolutely safe: Barry Switzer, Buddy Ryan, June 
Jones, Pete Carroll and Norv Turner. If you guessed that they are new, you are 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 A few others aren't so lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 The great Shula? We would not be surprised if he received a contract extension 
from owner Wayne Huizenga before the end of training camp. A summit meeting 
between the coach and the salesman at Shula's North Carolina retreat on July 4 
weekend indicated as much. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, we would also feel a lot better if Johnson would dock his boat 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Mora? New Orleans owner Tom Benson is tired of enduring losses with the 
patience of a saint. Marchibroda? Nice guys get fired, especially in 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyche? A better team, so he must turn in a better record. Bill Belichick at 
Cleveland? Diminishing skills. YOU THINK THE ONLY GUYS WORTH WATCHING ARE 
EMMITT AND TROY? 
</P>
<P>
 From deep roughs come three diamonds who will go from training camp to 
stardom: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Natrone Means, San Diego Chargers: Those rushing to buy O.J. Simpson 
trading cards last week, a better investment would have been this guy. Means 
will lead the AFC in rushing this season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hardy Nickerson, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: This linebacker might be the best 
tackler in football. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aeneas Williams, Arizona Cardinals: This cornerback doesn't do anything 
flashy, but does everything with gusto and heart. Returned both a fumble and an 
interception for a touchdown last year -- in the same game. In Buddy Ryan's 
defense, he will become another Eric Allen. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF TWO-POINT 
QUARTERBACKS AND KICKOFF KICKERS 
</P>
<P>
 When you see coaches throwing up their arms and swearing this summer, they 
have either spotted Jimmy Johnson standing with their owner or they are working 
on the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches will spend as much as two hours each week simply figuring out how to 
run a two-point conversion play. Not that they would ever use it if the game 
were on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 They must also work with their kickoff teams, which now start from the 30-yard 
line instead of the 35. If their kicker can't get it into the end zone, they 
must add a kicker, find a new kicker, or teach their old kicker to direct the 
ball away from the return man. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, coaches will not work on field goals, even though 
missed attempts will now be returned to the spot of the kick instead of the 
line of scrimmage, a seven-yard difference. 
</P>
<P>
 That is because this rule will effectively end long field goal attempts and 
cause more punts. Which would you rather see? Nice job, owners. THE LESSONS 
</P>
<P>
 What will we learn during training camp? 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the Cowboys have become a circus without Johnson, and that 
the 49ers have become a powerhouse with Norton and Richard Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the Buffalo Bills are finally willing to let somebody else 
win the AFC title. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the Raiders will be that team. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the best off-season signing involved a backup player. 
Perhaps nobody will be as important as Steve Bono to the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the worst free-agent signing, for the money, was Mitchell 
by the Lions. The Dolphins will not be surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the Vikings and Packers will challenge the Cowboys and 
49ers in the NFC. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the Denver Broncos will challenge the Raiders in the AFC. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that Seattle and New England will finally be playoff teams. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that the Giants, Lions and Oilers will not. 
</P>
<P>
 We will learn that when it comes to making predictions in a league where the 
two-time defending champion coach quits, Pro Bowl quarterbacks are fired and 
the commissioner sues the Baltimore Colts for being the Baltimore Colts . . . 
we will never learn. NFL Training Camps

NOTRE DAME GIVES UP ITS INDEPENDENCE; COLLEGE: EVERY SPORT EXCEPT FOOTBALL WILL 
COMPETE IN THE BIG EAST STARTING IN 1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It had become "The Question" for John MacLeod. When would Notre Dame's 
basketball program join a conference? 
</P>
<P>
 It was asked often as the Fighting Irish struggled to losing records the past 
two seasons, and MacLeod could only shrug as the administration methodically 
weighed its options. 
</P>
<P>
 When Notre Dame finally announced Monday that it had been approved to join the 
Big East in every sport except football in 1995, MacLeod couldn't wait for 
someone to ask his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are all the guys that want to talk about the conference?" he said, 
reporters still trickling in for a news conference. "We finally can talk about 
it. I don't have to give this canned response anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish were introduced as the 13th Big East member only four 
months after it appeared the chances of joining were scuttled with the addition 
of Rutgers and West Virginia as full members. 
</P>
<P>
 Those former football-only schools were added March 9 and Temple and Virginia 
Tech, also football-only members, were denied full membership. That ended a 
basketball vs. football membership feud that had threatened to shatter the 
15-year-old conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big East presidents had said any further expansion before 2000 was 
unlikely, unless "a unique exception" arose. Notre Dame was that exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Big East Commissioner Mike Tranghese said the addition of Notre Dame was 
"probably the greatest Ben Gay we could apply to our wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Already entrenched in the New York television market, the nation's biggest, 
the Big East now moves into the Chicago market, which is No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference also gets Notre Dame's immense national following, as well as 
the addition of lesser-known sports in which the Irish are national powers, 
including men's and women's tennis and soccer, baseball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame has been a member of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, a 
non-football conference, in every sport but basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Irish, the largest impact is the potential for its basketball program 
to return to the prominence of the 1970s and '80s, when it was perennially 
among the nation's top teams under Digger Phelps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish have lost several top recruits in recent years because they were not 
in a league. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were going to play in the Big East next season, we would have a very 
difficult time," said MacLeod. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by the time '95 rolls around we will have had a chance to bring five new 
players into our program . . . . We're stepping up big-time." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite MacLeod's enthusiasm, Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said 
the alliance was not made because the basketball team couldn't compete as an 
independent.

 "I have always maintained that we could continue as an independent. I still 
do," said Rosenthal, who was vacationing in Colorado. "I think the emergence of 
our Olympic sports as national competitors . . . . and the fact that those 
programs would be enhanced was a clear-cut factor." 
</P>
<P>
 There never was talk about including Notre Dame football. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame, Rutgers and West Virginia will begin competing in all sports in 
the 1995-96 season. A conference format has not been worked out, although it 
appears likely there will be two divisions with each team playing the others at 
least once.

BASEBALL ALL-STAR GAME REPORT; BRAVES' MADDUX DISDAINS AWARDS, VOWS TO KEEP HIS 
EYES ON THE PRIZE 
</P>

 Greg Maddux, the Atlanta Braves' right-hander who will start for the National 
League in tonight's All-Star game, tends to take the low-key approach to nearly 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 His major league-leading 1.80 earned-run average and 11-5 record? 
</P>
<P>
 "The season's not over," Maddux said. "I've had a great first half, but I 
don't want to say I've had a great year when I have 15 to 17 starts left. I'll 
just try to go about it like I did in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 His chances to win a third consecutive Cy Young award, never done before? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you pitch for the Cy Young, you pitch for the wrong reasons," he said. "I 
have to remember the team comes first. My main goal still is to pitch in the 
World Series, and that's the reason I left Chicago and went to Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astro first baseman Jeff Bagwell said of Maddux: "I don't see the 
American League, but I have to think he's the best pitcher in baseball. The 
impression I get is that he stands out there knowing he can get you out. He 
throws three pitches for strikes any time he wants. I just look for the ball 
against him. I don't try to guess or go deep, but I haven't had much luck no 
matter what I try." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh represented the last stop for Jim Fregosi as a player before he was 
hired as the Angels' manager in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the National League manager: "This is where I finished, but my career was 
over long before I came to Pittsburgh." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, executive director of the players association, made the point again 
that more than 200 players have attended the collective bargaining 
negotiations, but not one owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that suggests the level of interest among the players in reaching a 
solution, and the level of interest among the owners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief negotiator, has instructed the owners to 
stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" Fehr asked. "What's he trying to hide?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said he's not hiding anything, only trying to have the message come 
through one voice for consistency and continuity. He said the owners are kept 
fully apprised and disagreed with Fehr's contention that by having the owners 
present "it eliminates the difficulty of having information filtered out." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Fehr: "Also, if you're talking about a true partnership, as they claim, 
you need to have the partners present to make the appropriate arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why is a salary cap needed to adjust the alleged revenue disparities when you 
have a small-market team, the Montreal Expos, leading its division, and the 
big-market New York Mets in an ongoing state of collapse? 
</P>
<P>
 "Spending doesn't guarantee winning, but if you don't spend, it's almost 
impossible to win," Ravitch said. "I'm standing here today and predicting that 
the Expos of 1995 will become what the Pittsburgh Pirates are in 1994. They 
won't be able to keep their team together, and that's the tragedy of the 
current system." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 American League Manager Cito Gaston of the Toronto Blue Jays said he hopes to 
use his entire pitching staff, a reference to his failure to use Mike Mussina 
of the Baltimore Orioles in last year's game at Camden Yards, which left Gaston 
a marked man in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was last year and this is this year," Gaston said. "I try not to carry a 
grudge, and I hope he doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Mussina, back as a member of the AL staff, said he doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to know that I didn't buy even one of those T-shirts (denigrating 
Gaston)," Mussina said. "It was a big deal at the time, but you don't play 
major league baseball with the goal of pitching an All-Star game in your home 
park. There are more important goals." ROSS NEWHAN

DANTE'S OUT OF THE INFERNO; FORMER ANGEL BICHETTE HAS EMERGED AS A SLUGGING 
STAR WITH THE ROCKIES AFTER HAVING BEEN WRITTEN OFF AS A FLAKE AND NEARLY 
LEAVING FOR JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It happens less frequently now, but whenever Dante Bichette's concentration 
lapses or his punctuality isn't what it should be, Don Baylor likes to say, 
"Well, our man just dropped in from Venus again." However, there are other 
reasons for the Colorado Rockies' manager to declare that his right fielder has 
been out of this world. 
</P>
<P>
 After five frustrating seasons as a part-time player with the Angels and 
Milwaukee Brewers, reaching the point where he thought his only chance to play 
regularly was in Japan, Bichette has developed into one of the major leagues' 
most productive hitters during his year and a half with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 The best measure of that was his selection by Philadelphia Manager Jim Fregosi 
to the National League All-Star team that will play the American League in 
Pittsburgh tonight, a selection that prompted a congratulatory call from 
Bichette's idol, Ted Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the culmination of everything I've worked so hard for," Bichette, 30, 
said during the weekend. "I've been knocked down and stepped on so often that 
it makes it even more special. I always knew I could be this kind of player if 
I had the chance to play regularly, and this proves to all those people who 
said I couldn't that they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Don when he told me that I had been selected to the (All-Star) team 
that if it hadn't been for his confidence in me, for giving me the chance to 
play regularly, it wouldn't have happened. I owe him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing regularly for the first time last season, he jumped into the financial 
big time -- $2.8-million this year -- after a season that would have been even 
more impressive if he hadn't sat out the final 21 games because of a broken 
hand. The 6-foot-3, 230-pound Bichette still finished third in the league in 
doubles, fourth in extra-base hits, sixth in slugging percentage and third in 
outfield assists. As Baylor notes, Bichette is armed and dangerous. He threw 
out 14 runners but also led National League outfielders with nine errors, 
trying to do too much with his throws. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 141 games before he suffered a broken left hand when hit by a pitch by 
Doug Jones, Bichette established career highs for average, .310; hits, 167; 
doubles, 43; home runs, 21, and runs batted in, 89. He is about to wipe all of 
that off the board, however. 
</P>
<P>
 He already has 77 RBIs, second in the league, and has already matched his 21 
homers of last year, which earned him a spot in the All-Star home run contest 
Monday. He is batting .303 and certain that his development will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Baylor: "When he learns to swing only at strikes, he may run the league." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Angels, some seemed to believe Bichette was a flake, a player who 
always seemed to be five minutes behind schedule and whose talent tended to be 
overshadowed by his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette acknowledges having made mistakes in those early years but says the 
Angels, and then-manager Doug Rader, emphasized them to rationalize not playing 
him and eventually trading him. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would characterize him that way now? 
</P>
<P>
 Merely because he is close friends with Dinger, the purple dinosaur who serves 
as the Rockies' mascot? Merely because he spends much of his free time on the 
road passionately playing foosball, a table game? Merely because he rarely is 
early for a bus or plane and is seldom up before noon because he has trouble 
unwinding and likes to watch videos of his at-bats, often staying in the 
clubhouse for several hours after a game? 
</P>
<P>
 Merely because he calls his clubhouse locker "the Happy Zone" and often leaves 
the Rockies cringing with his penchant for weightlifting and arm wrestling (he 
and outfielder Chris Jones teamed to win the $5,000 first prize in a Las Vegas 
players' tournament during the winter)? 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor simply smiles and shakes his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dante likes to say he patterns himself after Paul Molitor and Robin Yount 
from his days in Milwaukee," Baylor said. "Those two would probably beat him 
over the head if they knew he had said that. Their approach and his approach 
are two different things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll walk out of the tunnel just before a game and Dante will be standing 
there with a cup of coffee and looking at the scoreboard and asking, 'Who's 
pitching (for the other team) today?' That's normal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bichette: "Two things. One, I like to have fun, and two, I grew up in an 
environment where there wasn't much discipline. Maybe I grew up as something of 
a nonconformist, but I don't consider myself a flake. I've always worked hard, 
even when I was with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't know the right way to go about it. I didn't have the leadership 
of guys like Molitor and Yount. I wasn't married yet and didn't have a son 
(Dante Jr., 21 months). I've got a better grip on my priorities now. I'm in a 
positive environment. Things were always kind of negative with the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 A 17th-round draft pick of the Angels at Palm Beach Junior College in 1984, 
Bichette opened in right field after an impressive spring in 1989, but was back 
in the minors in mid-June. He produced another impressive spring in 1990 and 
was batting .295 with a team-leading 17 RBIs on May 11 when the Angels traded 
for Dave Winfield, leaving Bichette a bewildered part-timer who hit 15 homers 
and drove in 53 runs in 349 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 He was traded to Milwaukee at the end of the season for an over-the-hill Dave 
Parker, one of those lamentable transactions that dot the Angel landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was leading the team in seven offensive categories when they traded for 
Winfield," Bichette said. "I was excited about it because I thought it would 
help the team. I never dreamt it would cost me my job, and I had a tough time 
accepting it. I was frustrated and let it show. I had a couple of run-ins with 
Rader and got far too emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I didn't handle it right. I know the team is more important than the 
individual, but I thought we were a better team when I was in there. I thought 
I was in the process of proving that. They obviously felt otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette now considers it a learning experience and said he is far too happy 
where he is to still hold hard feelings toward the Angels or Rader, who, he 
said, seemed genuinely upset when informing Bichette he had been traded. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the two years in Milwaukee didn't seem much of an improvement. 
Bichette appeared in 134 games in 1991, 112 in '92, when he began to think 
about Japan. However, a metamorphosis was slowly taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette had always read as much as he could on the subject of hitting. Books 
by Pete Rose and Steve Garvey. "The Science of Hitting" by Williams, given to 
him in 1986 by Tom Kotchman, now an Angel scout and then manager of their Palm 
Springs farm club. Bichette believed he understood the theories and mechanics, 
but wasn't sure how to apply it all. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned in Milwaukee, where Baylor was his hitting coach in 1991 and Mike 
Easler followed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels had always talked to me about being a Rob Deer type hitter," 
Bichette said. "They didn't care if I struck out 100 times as long as I hit a 
lot of home runs. That's fine in theory, but as soon as I'd start to strike 
out, I'd be out of the lineup. They wouldn't let me practice what they 
preached." 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor and Easler taught Bichette how to hit for power and average without the 
strikeouts. They taught him how to adjust, cut down on his swing in certain 
situations, use the whole field, apply his studies. They now preached 
discipline and consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Easler convinced me I could do it and showed me how," Bichette said. "I 
learned how to channel my work ethic from Yount and Molitor." 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor, who had become the St. Louis Cardinals' hitting coach in 1992, 
remembered the potential when he was hired to manage the expansion Rockies in 
1993. The Rockies selected Kevin Reimer from the Texas Rangers in the expansion 
draft, then traded Reimer for Bichette in a prearranged deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is playing regularly for a no-nonsense manager who was instrumental in 
laying the groundwork for Bichette's development. He plays half the season in a 
consistently sold-out ballpark suited to his gap power. He is batting third in 
an offense-minded lineup ahead of the Baylor-rejuvenated Andres Galarraga, who 
says Bichette has the ability to hit 30 homers and steal 30 bases in a season, 
done only 16 times in National League history. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dwight Evans, his new hitting instructor: "When Dante is in his home run 
mode, things come easy. He might hit six to eight in 10 or 12 days. When he's 
not in that mode he becomes a good enough hitter to shoot one down the line or 
hit the ball in the gaps. He's becoming a smart hitter, and he's so strong that 
he'll hit 20 to 25 homers by mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Bichette is already there with 21 homers, but Baylor continues to preach 
discipline to a guess hitter who loves to swing at the first pitch and could be 
even more effective, the manager believes, by learning to use the count and 
swinging only at strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams might have given him the same message if he had made contact, but the 
chagrined Bichette was out at the time and Williams told Bichette's wife, 
Marianna, to extend his congratulations. That was good enough, Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would have ever believed that Ted Williams would be calling, or that 
Bichette would be headed to the All-Star game? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a confidence builder just like last year gave me that much more 
confidence going into this year," Bichette said. "I'd been told so often what I 
couldn't do that I had a lot of confidence to build back up. I'm still working 
at it, but I have to feel good about how far I've come."

 Barry Bonds doesn't know why New York Yankee Manager Buck Showalter would 
single him out for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants outfielder showed up for the All-Star workout and 
wondered why Showalter criticized him and Ken Griffey Jr. for not having their 
shirts tucked in at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's stupidity -- a manager throwing stones at a baseball player," Bonds 
said. "Enough people are throwing stones at them. I think it's childish, to be 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Showalter told The New York Times Magazine in a story published Sunday that 
Bonds and Griffey show a lack of respect for the game. Showalter criticized 
both for not tucking in their shirts, and Griffey for wearing his cap backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Griffey) comes on the field, and his hat's on backward and his shirttail's 
hanging out," Showalter said. "I go to the All-Star game, Bonds is there for 
three days, and the only time he tucked his shirt in was for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey also challenged Showalter's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one, my shirt's never been tucked out," Griffey said. "You can ask 
anybody in this locker room. And No. 2, I've always worn my hat backward since 
I was little. I have pictures of it at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those are the only two things I have to worry about in my game, then I'm 
OK." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No Cincinnati Reds in the 65th All-Star game? No problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Jose Rijo and shortstop Barry Larkin were chosen for the NL team, but 
backed out because of sore elbows. Fregosi replaced them with San Francisco 
closer Rod Beck and Montreal shortstop Wil Cordero. 
</P>
<P>
 Rijo and Larkin attended the workouts Monday and will be in uniform for 
tonight's game, but can't play. Fregosi wasn't upset that they chose a couple 
of days' rest over an All-Star appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the Reds yesterday and it was not a matter of Barry Larkin or 
Jose Rijo not wanting to play. Both have elbow problems and their doctors did 
not want them to risk further injury," Fregosi said. "I don't have a problem 
with that." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Vera Clemente was a little confused about baseball's chain of command as she 
presented the Roberto Clemente Award, named for her husband, to Dave Winfield 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 She started her remarks by saying, "I want to thank the commissioner of 
baseball . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There is none. Owners don't want to hire a commissioner until they get a new 
collective bargaining agreement with players. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield wished his wife, Tanya, could have accompanied him to Pittsburgh to 
accept the Clemente Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Winfield said she has a good excuse: She is five months' pregnant with twins 
"who will take over for me when I'm done." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Manager Chuck Tanner used a starting lineup made up of his former Pittsburgh 
Pirates as the National League defeated the American League, 5-3, in the annual 
All-Star old-timers' game. . . . Wilson Alvarez of the Chicago White Sox is the 
first Venezuelan pitcher ever chosen for an All-Star squad. . . . The Yankees' 
Wade Boggs will make his ninth consecutive start at third base, an All-Star 
record for that position. Boggs is only the fifth AL player to appear in 10 
consecutive All-Star games. The others are Brooks Robinson (15), Yogi Berra 
(14), Cal Ripken (12) and Mickey Mantle (10). . . . St. Louis Cardinal 
shortstop Ozzie Smith, the NL's top vote-getter, voted for Larkin as the 
starting shortstop.

 Yeager, a strong-armed catcher, was a member of six division-winning Dodger 
clubs from 1972 to 1985. He also introduced the "neck protector" -- the flap 
that hangs from the bottom of a catcher's mask -- after a 1976 accident in 
which he was speared in the neck by the jagged edge of a broken bat while 
waiting in the on-deck circle.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; TEARING DOWN THE WALL; SUCCESS OF BULGARIA, 
ROMANIA MARKS ONLY BEGINNING OF CHANGE IN WORLD SOCCER

<P>
 Don't feel bad for Dimitar Penev just because he has to work on his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Penev, who turns 49 today, has reason enough to celebrate. In the last month 
he has gone from almost complete obscurity to worldwide fame. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it would be fair to say that when he blows out the candles today, his 
name will be recognized by more people than that of Zhelyu Zhelev. 
</P>
<P>
 Penev is Bulgaria's soccer coach. Zhelev is Bulgaria's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing what a little thing like a World Cup victory can do for a man. And for 
a country. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bulgaria had knocked defending champion Germany out of the tournament on 
Sunday, both Zhelev and Lyuben Berov, the country's prime minister, immediately 
were on the phone to Giants Stadium, calling to congratulate Penev and his 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 As every politician knows, it never hurts to tie your name to a winning team. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Bulgaria's moment in the sun. After never having won a World Cup game 
in 16 attempts dating from a 1962 loss to Argentina in Chile, the Bulgarians 
find themselves in the 1994 semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 And not as the underdogs, either. Having already beaten two-time champion 
Argentina and three-time champion Germany, Bulgaria is at least even money to 
do as well against three-time champion Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 And after that? Three-time champion Brazil in the final? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not too much to dream, as Penev is finding out this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bulgaria is not alone in celebrating this World Cup. Had it not been for 
the heroics of Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, Romania, too, would have been 
taking part in Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time Sunday, there were comments, only half in jest, about the 
possibility of a Bulgaria-Romania final at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here? Why are the supposed "unknowns" from Eastern Europe 
suddenly in the limelight? 
</P>
<P>
 Sportswriters -- and not only Americans -- who earlier would not have known 
Basarab Panduru from Plamen Nikolov, have been tripping over themselves in the 
last few weeks, trying to learn the life stories of such players as Ilie 
Dumitrescu and Borislav Mihaylov. 
</P>
<P>
 You know things have gotten out of hand when the balding dome of Bulgarian 
midfielder Yordan Letchkov becomes the subject of postgame questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a case of -- you will pardon the expression -- hair today, gone 
tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Bulgarians and Romanians fade into obscurity once the World Cup is 
over, or is there a new order to the soccer world? 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, European soccer is undergoing a huge change. The end of 
communism and the breakups of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have profoundly 
altered the international sporting landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the fall and rise of Eastern European soccer. Communism's fall and 
soccer's rise. 
</P>
<P>
 To better illustrate the point, consider the 1996 European Championship in 
England, qualifying for which gets fully under way in autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Always before, the qualifying competition was a fairly straightforward affair. 
But when the preliminary draw was held in Manchester, England, earlier this 
year, organizers found they now had 49 countries seeking a place in the final 
tournament field of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 It once seemed as if Europe consisted of only a couple of dozen countries. Now 
there are 50. A host of new or resurrected nations are on the scene, many of 
them from what used to be called "behind the Iron Curtain." 
</P>
<P>
 Every one of those countries has a national team. Every one of those national 
teams aspires to be the best in Europe. And many of them have players who, if 
they are given half a chance, can rise to international stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania's Gheorghe Hagi and Bulgaria's Hristo Stoitchkov are but the tip of 
the iceberg, the most recognizable Eastern European stars in this World Cup. 
There could have been more. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Yugoslavia not degenerated into a civil war, it would have provided a much 
better team in the tournament than Greece, whose feeble effort showed that it 
had only qualified because Yugoslavia was banned from international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, had Russia's soccer federation not become embroiled in an unseemly 
internal squabble pitting the players against the coach and federation, it 
could have brought its first team to the United States and we would have seen 
such legitimate stars as Andrei Kanchelskis, Igor Shalimov and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, the former Czechoslovakia, a World Cup quarterfinalist in 1990, has 
officially split into two separate states, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. 
Once each of them puts its soccer house in order, they will be back challenging 
Europe and the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia demonstrated Eastern Europe's potential this spring when it traveled 
to Spain and scored a deserved 2-0 victory over the Spanish, who came very 
close to reaching the semifinals of this World Cup before bowing to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine, which once provided most of the Soviet Union's national team players, 
is sure to discover its own strength in the not-too-distant future. The same 
applies to former powers Hungary and Poland. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty facing Eastern European teams, on both the club and national 
team levels, is money. With their nations' economies strapped for cash, it is 
no surprise that their soccer federations are, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarian federation, for example, was on the verge of bankruptcy and was 
saved only by Emil Kostadinov's last-minute goal against France that qualified 
Bulgaria for the World Cup. The federation stands to earn $1-2 million from the 
tournament, enough to give the players sizable bonuses and restore solvency to 
the federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Others federations are not so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 National teams are made up of the best club players. But clubs with no money 
can't buy top players and therefore can't qualify for or compete well enough in 
European competition to earn the money that such competition brings. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, these clubs have to raise what money they can by developing 
promising young players and then selling them to wealthier clubs abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Such capitalistic ventures were not permitted under the old communist regimes, 
but now there is a lively market in Eastern European soccer talent, a market 
that will only become more frenzied because of the success of Bulgaria and 
Romania in World Cup '94. Breaking New Ground 
</P>
<P>
 The record of Bulgaria in World Cup finals: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1962: Eliminated in first round with an 0-2-1 record. Outscored, 7-1 
</P>
<P>
 * 1966: Eliminated in first round, losing all three games. Outscored, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1970: Eliminated in first round with an 0-2-1 record. Outscored, 9-5. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1974: Eliminated in first round with an 0-1-2 record. Outscored, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1986: Eliminated in second round, after going 0-1-2 in group play. Lost to 
Mexico in round of 16. Outscored, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994: Advanced to semifinal Wednesday against Italy, going 3-0-1 after 
losing opener to Nigeria. Outscored opponents, 9-5.

RAVELLI TO SET RECORD, BUT CAREER HAS YET TO BE CAPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Wednesday, goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli will play his 116th and most important 
game for Sweden, a World Cup semifinal against Brazil at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 That will give him the record for most national team appearances by a Swedish 
player and leave him only nine games shy of the world record. 
</P>
<P>
 The record is held by England's Peter Shilton, with 125 caps, followed by Pat 
Jennings of Northern Ireland with 119. Both players have retired from 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli, who ranks third with 115, is intent on making the mark his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of my goals, to break (Shilton's) record," he said earlier this 
year. "It depends on how I'm playing, but I plan to go on for at least two more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the European Championship finals in 1996 and I'd like to play in 
England if we qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, with Ravelli in the nets, finished third, behind Denmark and Germany, 
in the 1992 European Championship. But Ravelli does not consider that the 
highlight of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the biggest moment of my career is yet to come before I retire," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory on Wednesday would certainly make that dream come true. GRAHAME L.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; BREAKING NOSE OF SPAIN'S ENRIQUE COSTS ITALY'S 
TASSOTTI EIGHT GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FIFA went to the videotape Monday and slapped an eight-game suspension on 
Italy's Mauro Tassotti for an elbow that broke a Spanish player's nose during a 
World Cup quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA's disciplinary committee said Tassotti's action against Luis Enrique in 
the closing moments of a 2-1 Italian victory Saturday was "intentional serious 
violent conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-game ban means Italy will be without two starters for Wednesday's 
semifinal against Bulgaria. Gianfranco Zola is completing a two-game suspension 
for a red card in a second-round victory over Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tassotti will sit for a while longer. He will be benched if Italy reaches 
the World Cup final, plus at least Italy's first six games in preliminary 
rounds of the European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the suspension, twice the longest previous ban imposed during 
the World Cup, Tassotti was fined $16,000.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; PRESSURE IS A DEFINITE HANG-UP TO PARREIRA; 
BRAZIL: COACH FEELS HEAT FROM A NATION THAT HAS WON THREE WORLD CUP TITLES, BUT 
NONE SINCE 1970. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos Alberto Parreira has made it this far, to the semifinal round of the 
World Cup, by a simple strategic maneuver, a slight stroke of coaching genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Every hotel he checks into, Parreira instructs the front desk operator to 
block all phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then," Parreira says, "I am at peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The messages do pile up, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, Mr. Parreira, but a Mr. Pele called for you. He says he has six 
lineup changes he would like to propose, at your convenience.  
</P>
<P>
 "Also, someone claiming to be the president of Brazil called. A Mr. Itamar 
Franco. He sends his regards -- and suggests starting a third forward in the 
rematch with Sweden.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, and your mother called. She would like you to start Ronaldo, if it is not 
any bother."  
</P>
<P>
 As manager of the New York Yankees of international soccer, Parreira is, if 
not the most embattled man in this World Cup, then a strong No. 2 behind 
Italy's coach, Arrigo Sacchi. Because he is entrusted with the most sacred 
tradition in the sport, and because the Brazilians haven't won the event in 24 
years, Parreira approaches his daily news briefings like a man stepping up to 
the electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in many ways, Parreira claims, the two positions are quite similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a death sentence sometimes," Parreira said Monday in a session with the 
English-speaking media at a Fullerton hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, being a football coach is my life. It's a pleasure. But being the coach 
of the Brazilian team in the World Cup . . . is something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a pleasure. It's effort. It's compromise. It's a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot have fun in this position. Only if you succeed and win the World 
Cup. Then it will be a full pleasure. But you've got to win the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil has failed to do this since 1970, which is why Brazilian World Cup 
coaches are discarded like World Cup programs. There's a new one every four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Parreira, there was Sebastiao Lazaroni, who had the audacity to play a 
sweeper in Italy in 1990. Pele, sort of a free-lance ombudsman of Brazilian 
football, was horrified, huffing that, "This was not Brazil -- Brazil always 
plays three forwards" and predicted Lazaroni would lose "as soon as we play a 
good team." Brazil lost, 1-0, to Argentina in the second round and Lazaroni was 
cooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Tele Santana managed to survive both the 1982 and 1986 World Cups, but not 
without taking a three-year sabbatical in between. Claudio Coutinho didn't lose 
a game in the 1978 tournament, but because Argentina advanced to the final 
ahead of Brazil on goal differential, he was politely advised not to re-apply 
for same position. 
</P>
<P>
 How powerful is the soccer press in Brazil? 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful enough that one of its own, a highly opinionated newspaper columnist 
named Joao Saldanha, was actually appointed to coach Brazil's 1970 World Cup 
team. "He was such a critic," says Francisco Marcos, Brazilian team liaison, 
"that they decided to make him coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Saldanha never coached in the World Cup, however. He brought the team through 
qualifying, but when he announced he was considering cutting Pele from the 
final roster -- too out of shape, Saldanha charged -- the Brazilian soccer 
federation fired him out of fear of national revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Zagala replaced Saldanha, agreed to let Pele play and Brazil won the 
1970 World Cup. Pele was named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 A month in the life of Carlos Alberto Parreira: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After Brazil tied Sweden, 1-1, in group play, Pele wrote in USA Today that 
Brazil "couldn't play any worse" and advised Parreira to replace six of his 
starters." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Itamar Franco, the president of Brazil, also suggested Parreira shake up 
his lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 -- So did Parreira's mother, who is eager to see 17-year-old forward Ronaldo, 
the so-called future of Brazilian soccer, play. 
</P>
<P>
 Joked Parreira: "She's easy on me. It's only one change she wants to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira's good humor amid the maelstrom caused one American journalist to ask 
how he can remain so calm at a time like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the outside, yes," Parreira said with a laugh. "But on the inside, I am 
boiling, my friend."

 The door to the Raider training camp in Oxnard is swinging both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming in Monday after signing were defensive lineman Warren Powers, a former 
Ram, and safety/special teams player Joe King. 
</P>
<P>
 Going out was receiver Shawn Collins, who failed his physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers is a five-year veteran out of Maryland who was drafted by the Denver 
Broncos and played for the Rams in 1992 and '93. He was signed by the Raiders 
before last season's playoffs, but never played. Powers was cut last month, 
then re-signed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 King, a three-year veteran out of Oklahoma State, has previously played for 
the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>

 Defensive lineman Jerry Ball, signed as a free agent last month, is expected 
to report to Oxnard tonight. He had been excused from the first few days of 
practice because of a prior commitment. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; ROOKIE NEGOTIATIONS COULD GET SERIOUS

<P>
 The Rams have yet to start serious contract talks with their top draft pick, 
offensive tackle Wayne Gandy of Auburn, but discussions will start today with 
their second-round pick, wide receiver Isaac Bruce of Memphis State. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Zygmunt, Rams senior vice president, will meet with Bruce's agent, Jimmy 
Sexton, today and hopes to work out a deal shortly. Sexton was in town Monday 
to meet with the Lakers regarding one of his other clients, free agent Horace 
Grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Contract talks have been slow with Gandy, the 16th player taken in the April 
draft. The Rams project him as their starting left tackle and they are anxious 
to get him in camp for conditioning and to work on his upper-body strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Schwartz, Gandy's New York-based agent, had expressed an interest in 
coming to terms by mid-June at the latest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what is taking the Rams so long," said Steve Klein, who is 
assisting Schwartz with negotiations. "We would have liked to have had 
something done by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy and Bruce are the only unsigned players among the 10 the Rams drafted in 
April. Neither player attended the Rams' pre-training camp workouts, which 
began Monday at Rams Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said Gandy would not be in training camp when it opens July 22 unless he 
has a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holding out is the only leverage we have," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also signed free-agent offensive lineman Bill Schultz of Indianapolis 
and re-signed running back Howard Griffith to one-year contracts. Long-snapper 
Blair Bush also agreed to terms on a one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 45 players attended Monday's informal workouts on the first day of a 
four-day camp. Drills concentrated on the passing game and didn't involve 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the players missing the optional workout for veterans was new 
quarterback Chris Miller. He was excused to be with his wife, who gave birth to 
their first child, a son, prematurely over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp will end Thursday, but the players will return next Monday for three 
more days of workouts. Players then will report for training camp at UC Irvine 
on July 21, with workouts beginning the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Roman Phifer, a restricted free agent coming off his best NFL 
season, said he and his agent, Marvin Demoff, were still seeking a multi-year 
deal from the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The team tendered Phifer a one-year contract at $649,000 in February, a deal 
he will be locked into for this season if he doesn't sign the multi-year deal 
he is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be in camp (July 22) no matter what happens," Phifer said. "I'm not 
concerned about the contract. My agent calls and updates me on that, but it's 
not my focal point right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback T.J. Rubley and right tackle Darryl Ashmore have yet to re-sign, 
but the Rams own exclusive rights to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dannue L. Mayo of Anaheim, president of Golden Opportunity Youth Assn., and a 
friend picketed Rams Park on Monday with signs encouraging the team to stay in 
Anaheim instead of moving to another city, possibly Baltimore or St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayo carried a sign that read: "Save the Rams. Stay in Anaheim. Stay for the 
youth." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayo, 43, has coordinated several speaking engagements for Ram players in the 
community and wishes to meet with Rams' executive vice president John Shaw and 
encourage him to keep the team in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams (players) have been good role models for our youth," Mayo said. "We 
want to keep them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayo said he plans to continue picketing Rams park over his lunch hour for the 
rest of the week, and is encouraging local youth groups to join him. He said he 
is "85 percent sure" the Rams will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a 2-year-old bottle of wine that somebody gave me that I can't open 
until the Rams win the Super Bowl," Mayo said. "And I want them to be in 
Anaheim when they do it." MIKE REILLEY

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; REMATCH CAN ONLY GET BETTER; SOCCER: THERE 
WASN'T MUCH AT STAKE WHEN BRAZIL PLAYED SWEDEN THE FIRST TIME, AND IT SHOWED IN 
A DISMAL 1-1 TIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first encounter was kind of like a slow dance on a first date. On June 28, 
at the Pontiac Silverdome, neither Brazil nor Sweden was inclined to press the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 It all made for soccer to sleep by. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a desultory 1-1 tie and a dissatisfied crowd of 77,217. 
Brazilian fans, in fact, booed their team off the field. Then, in the 
mixed-zone area afterward, Brazilian journalists booed Coach Carlos Alberto 
Parreira off the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes, those Cheshire cats, disappeared into the night half-smirking, 
acting as though they had carried out their plan to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, one can only hope Wednesday's rematch in the World Cup 
semifinals at the Rose Bowl will be a rip-roaring bar dance. This time, there 
are no cards to hide, no players to protect and, presumably, nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Because that was not the case when the teams met in Group B play two weeks 
ago, it is hard to imagine what vital information might have been gleaned from 
that encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil began the game having already clinched a second-round berth, also 
knowing a tie was good enough to clinch the Group B title outright. Sweden had 
more to gain with a victory but also more to lose with a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes were all but assured of advancing and appeared preoccupied with 
damage -- as opposed to ball -- control. They obviously did not want to get 
caught up in a shootout with the high-powered Brazilians and possibly lose 
ground in total goal differential, the first tiebreaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Sweden also was without its best player, forward Martin Dahlin, who was 
serving a one-game suspension after having been given a second yellow card 
against Russia a few nights earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, the first Sweden-Brazil game had as much emotional buildup as a game 
of patty-cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians spent most of the first half showing off their considerable 
dribbling skills, playing foot-catch among themselves, often in their own 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes rarely pressed the issue, attacking only when receiving open 
invitations. Happily for them, their letter arrived in the 24th minute when 
forward Tomas Brolin took control of the ball on the right flank and sent a 
crossing pass left toward Kennet Andersson, who delivered one of the game's two 
exciting moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson, left of goal, chested the pass, let it bounce once, then fired a 
right-footed shot past Claudio Taffarel, the Brazilian goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a newborn, Sweden coddled its precious lead into halftime, during which 
it received news that gave it less incentive to win: The Russians were beating 
up on Cameroon in a Group B game at Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians' ultimate 6-1 victory clinched a second-round berth for Sweden 
regardless of its outcome against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Swedes were fired up in the second half? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, no. 
</P>
<P>
 The game now entirely devoid of drama, Sweden sauntered back to the field and 
seemed unaware that the second half had actually begun. Less than two minutes 
into play, Brazil tied the game when Romario dribbled past three defenders and 
pushed a shot past goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, who went on to better things in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the game was as thrilling as watching Alexi Lalas' goatee grow. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Sweden managed a whopping eight shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Brazil, the derisive whistles began piercing eardrums around the 83rd 
minute, after Parreira had removed midfielder and captain Rai with the outcome 
still in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Parreira tried to convince Brazil's media jackals that the game was no 
more significant than an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 The journalists weren't convinced. Parreira then blamed the Silverdome's field 
dimensions, smaller than Brazilian standards, and Sweden, for its 
play-for-the-tie defensive tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians swore it wasn't their fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ugly for the players to play because there was no game to be played, 
because of Sweden," Dunga, the Brazilian midfielder, said. 
</P>
<P>
 What could have been culled from the match? Most obvious was the considerable 
size advantage the Swedes held over the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Swedes' 4-4-2 defense appeared to have effectively contained the 
Brazilian forwards. Sweden chose not to guard either Romario or Bebeto 
individually, opting to play zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on Brazil, because they're the favorite," Dahlin said after 
his team's quarterfinal victory over Romania. "And Latin American countries are 
not used to the 4-4-2, which is what Sweden plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday will mark the first time teams have met twice in the same World Cup 
since 1982, when Italy and Poland played to a scoreless tie in group play and 
met again in the semifinals, Italy winning, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup can only hope the sequel to Sweden-Brazil will be better than 
the original.

DUCKS SIGN '93 DRAFT CHOICES, KARPOV AND TSULYGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks on Monday signed their second- and third-round draft picks 
from the 1993 entry draft, Valeri Karpov and Nikolai Tsulygin, to multiyear 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both played in the Russian Elite League last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsulygin, 19, a 6-foot-4, 205-pound defenseman and a native of Ufa, Russia, 
scored two goals and had 11 assists for Salavat Yulayev Ufa. He also competed 
with Team Russia in the 1993 World Junior Championships and European Junior 
Tournament. He was the NHL's 30th selection overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nikolai Tsulygin has been one of the best junior players in the world," said 
Jack Ferriera, the Ducks' vice president/general manager. "He has a lot of 
desire and plays with such strong determination. Tsulygin is a player who will 
help us defensively for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Tsulygin is looking forward to the opportunity to help the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great desire to play in the NHL," he said. "I will go to training 
camp and see how it goes. I am confident in my ability to play at the NHL level 
of competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferriera said Karpov is also a valuable asset to the Ducks, not only providing 
scoring ability, but "he is an excellent play-maker with a lot of high-level 
international experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov, 24, a 5-10, 175-pound right wing, scored three goals for the Russian 
Olympic team that lost the bronze-medal game at Lillehammer. He had 30 points 
in 32 games -- including 11 goals -- with Traktor Chelyabinsk during the 
Russian Elite League's 1993-94 season. In 1992-93, he scored 25 points in 29 
games and helped his team win the gold medal at the 1993 World Championships in 
Munich, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov was the NHL's 56th selection overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have yet to sign Paul Kariya, their top pick from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Training camp for the Ducks opens Sept. 4.

HIS PLAYERS CROWD SUMMER SPOTLIGHT; BASKETBALL: CLARK, AN AGENT WHO COACHES 
O.C. TEAM IN SUMMER LEAGUE, HELPS ATHLETES CONTINUE THEIR CAREERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Basketball fans will flock to UC Irvine's Bren Center this month for a chance 
to see their favorite stars up close. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Johnson is scheduled to appear in the ASICS Summer Pro basketball 
league, which continues through July 30. Current Lakers Anthony Peeler and Doug 
Christie, and Duke center Cherokee Parks, who leads Team USA, also will play 
here this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Coach Jerry Clark's Orange County squad played the Circuit City team 
in the league opener Saturday afternoon, it was no surprise that only several 
dozen fans were scattered among the 5,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Team USA, the United States' representative for the Goodwill Games, and the 
Lakers were scheduled to tip-off later in the evening. Orange County-Circuit 
City was just the undercard. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's team is a band of Continental Basketball Assn. refugees, European 
league hopefuls, and NBA camp rejects. Most people have never heard of Larry 
Lewis, Russell Ponds or Kirk Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 But these players are the lifeblood of the summer league. They are players 
looking for exposure, looking for playing time . . . looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 As an agent, Clark, a Newport Beach resident, helps some of those players find 
basketball jobs. With his wife, Linda, who works in property management, Clark 
also offers financial advice and money management to his clients. He doesn't 
like to think of himself as just a coach or agent, but rather as a friend to 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clark is anonymous to the average basketball fan, in the basketball 
community it seems everyone knows Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 And this month, Clark is trying to blend his Orange County team into a 
championship unit. Clark led Orange County to the league title last season, and 
it started the '94 summer off with a resounding 108-88 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the outcome was ever in doubt," Clark said. "For one month out 
of the year, we all get together in Southern California. The players have to 
realize that most of their work is done the rest of the year, establishing 
their reputations as players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to keep the communication lines open." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's ears are always open. It's only one game into the summer league 
season, and there are already numerous players approaching Clark.  
</P>
<P>
 While NBA West went through warm-ups, former Nevada Las Vegas forward Eldridge 
Hudson shared a chuckle with Clark. Former Cal State Fullerton point guard and 
1984 Olympian Leon Wood also stopped for a brief visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see Leon every year," Clark said. "And every year, it seems he comes here 
as a free agent and every year he finds work somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 A task more difficult than it appears. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the summer pro league is a perfect venue for those looking for 
exposure, the scouts look at more than summer performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some players feel it's the agent who has to find a team for them to play on," 
Clark said. "But it's the teams that will seek out players that fit their 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 That suitability is often more important than a player's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark remembers how Milt Brown helped his team last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a guy, 6 feet 4, out of Oklahoma State, that not many people knew 
about," Clark said. "But he dominated in this league. I played him defensively 
against guys like (Sacramento King center) Olden Polynice and he did great." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said Brown shot 70% from the field, averaged 27 points and 11 rebounds, 
helping persuade Rapid City of the CBA to draft Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 "Milt ended up leaving the CBA to go back to school," Clark said. "He was 
someone who could go and play all five positions on the floor, but he wasn't 
exceptional at any particular one.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the kinds of players you see in the summer. He's a great player and 
people tried to pigeon-hole him in one spot. I just recognized his talent, and 
I know if I had a team, I would find a place for him to play." 
</P>
<P>
 That dream is closer to reality now. Although Clark always enjoyed being 
around basketball, he never thought he would make his living as a coach. But he 
is currently a candidate for a head coaching job in the CBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few coaches, like John Lucas, who have coached in the summer 
league and moved on to the NBA," Clark said. "I'd like to eventually move into 
a general manager-vice president type position, but if this coaching job is 
somewhere that is a step in that direction, then I'll consider it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another consideration is his family. He has been married for 30 years and 
doesn't want to spend too much time away from his youngest children, 3-year-old 
Robert and 8-year-old Jaime. But Clark will continue to chase his basketball 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a kid at heart," Clark said. "That's why I stay with this game."

OWNER EXPRESSES ANGER OVER RV PARK'S FAILURE; VENTURA: NANCY HUBBARD BLAMES 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATORS FOR PUSHING HER INTO BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With bankruptcy proceedings under way and a bank foreclosure looming, the 
owner of the Ventura RV Beach Resort accused environmentalists and government 
regulators Monday of helping to push her out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all the support we've gotten from the community at large during our 
travails, there has also been an awful lot of 'kick 'em when they're down 
stuff,' " Nancy Hubbard wrote in a one-page news release. 
</P>
<P>
 The RV park in January had sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 
bankruptcy proceedings. In her statement Monday, Hubbard said Sumitomo Bank of 
California had initiated foreclosure proceedings and will take possession of 
the property by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sumitomo officials said they cannot formally take possession of the 
property until the bankruptcy case is resolved. Bank officials said they would 
like to continue operating the park until they can sell the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, they said, the Hubbard Family Corp. owes the bank $2.91 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura council members have said they would consider using city money to 
buy the property to add it to a Ventura River Estuary enhancement project. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Hubbard said she was disassociating herself from the resort and 
plans to pursue other business opportunities in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily damaged by floods in February, 1992, the beleaguered trailer park 
never fully recovered. Environmentalists opposed the recreational vehicle 
resort before it opened in 1985, and renewed their pressure following the 
floods. 
</P>
<P>
 The park lies on a 19-acre section of river bottom and flood plain, nearly 
skirting the Ventura River and only a short walk from the ocean shore. When 
pelting rain showers caused the river to overflow two years ago, the raging 
waters tore quickly across the adjacent RV resort. 
</P>
<P>
 The swollen river destroyed or damaged 40 of the 57 motor homes parked at the 
site and washed one vehicle under the Ventura Freeway and out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists pointed to the destruction as reason why a trailer park 
should not lie so close to the mouth of the river. The Ventura council debated 
suspending the park's permit following the flood, but ultimately agreed to let 
Hubbard continue operating the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the California Coastal Commission has ruled that the Hubbard 
Family Corp., which Nancy Hubbard manages, must increase its insurance policy 
from $2 million to $10 million to cover any future flood losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, county officials told Hubbard she would also have to install a new 
flood control warning system on the property. Hubbard had been contracting with 
the county and said the new system would raise her costs considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Hubbard implicated all the agencies and detractors as opponents of 
the RV park who ultimately contributed to its demise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a long hard struggle trying to keep the dream of my late husband 
alive," Hubbard wrote, referring to Arnold Hubbard, who died of heart failure 
following the floods. "Unfortunately, because of heavy government 
overzealousness, lost revenues since the flood of 1992 and high legal and 
insurance fees which made (the) operating cost prohibitive, the dream became 
impossible to fulfill." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said neither city staff members nor the council ever 
hoped Hubbard would fail in her enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the city has ever wished any ill will toward Arnold or Nancy," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford added, however, that opposition to the project, both on and off the 
council, was clear from the very beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold knew going into it that it would be a tough one to pull off," he said. 
"He made a business judgment and decided to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Murphy, an assistant county counsel who often deals with flood control 
issues, said the county also cannot be held responsible for the RV park's 
financial troubles.

OXNARD MAN SHOT BY STRANGER; FORMER SOCCER PRO FATALLY WOUNDED OUTSIDE 
RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 As police searched for his killer Monday, the family and friends of a popular 
Oxnard soccer player struggled to understand how a man who had managed to evade 
trouble all his life could be gunned down beside his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Calderon Leyva, 35, was shot once in the stomach Sunday night as he 
exited the Toppers Pizza Place, 2100 S. Saviers Road, after a confrontation 
with some other patrons. He was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of the incident vary, but Leyva was apparently shot by a young man -- 
described by Oxnard police as a gang member with a criminal record -- who 
accused him of staring at a female companion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like the suspect was trying to save face for the disrespect 
shown to the young lady who was with him," said Oxnard Sgt. Cliff Troy, who is 
in charge of the investigation. "Apparently he was short-tempered." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police investigators could not remember another slaying in recent 
history that erupted over such a trivial incident between two strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of frightening when you think you can't go out to eat dinner," said 
Sgt. Charles Hookstra, who supervises Oxnard's gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four years ago, an Oxnard teen-ager was fatally shot by a reputed gang 
member because he was staring at him and his friends in their car. Gang members 
refer to such a stare-down as "mad-dogging." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Magana, a close friend of Leyva since the two were children in La 
Colonia, said Leyva has always steered clear of trouble, looking for refuge in 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to get into trouble, and so did some of his other friends," said 
Magana, who stayed at Leyva's bedside late into the night. "But when I did 
those things, he would go the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva was a star goalkeeper for the Oxnard Nacional of the California Soccer 
League from 1974 to 1992, and played professionally for the L.A. Aztecs in the 
mid-80s, said Zeferino (Chino) Cano, a former coach of the Nacional. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good influence on younger players," Cano said. "He tried to keep 
other players off the streets and out of gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement, he began coaching the Nacional little league soccer 
team, and bragged to friends about his 8-year-old son, Enrique, and his 
interest in the game, Magana said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes this so sad," Magana said. "He wanted his son to play 
soccer and stay out of gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 During the last eight years Leyva held various railroad jobs. After being laid 
off by the Southern Pacific Transportation Co., he took a job with Amtrak about 
a year ago. He was recently promoted, and intended to travel to San Diego on 
Monday for training in his new position, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 10 children, Leyva moved to Oxnard from Guanajuato, Mexico in the late 
1960s with his farm worker parents. All seven of Leyva's sisters and one of his 
brothers mourned Monday at a relative's house in Port Hueneme, seeking a way to 
break the news to their elderly parents, who were flying in Monday night after 
vacationing in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both have diabetes and high blood pressure," said sister Esperanza 
Gonzalez. "We're afraid of their reaction. We're prepared here with the doctors 
and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva's wife, Susana, who initially refused to believe that her husband had 
died, was sedated Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members said Leyva spent Sunday watching the World Cup with his wife, 
son and 6-year-old daughter Mary Carmen. The family then went to Toppers Pizza 
for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 A disturbance broke out in the restaurant when a young man accused Leyva of 
making improper eye contact with his female companion -- either his sister or a 
friend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said the young man asked Leyva: "Are you looking at my sister?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva then reportedly replied: "I'm not looking at your sister, and I can look 
anywhere I want." 
</P>
<P>
 When the manager asked them both to leave, they continued talking in the 
parking lot. Leyva pushed his wife and children out of the way as the youth 
produced a gun and fired two shots, one of which struck Leyva in the abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 The man and a female companion left the parking lot in a charcoal gray truck 
followed by a witness, police said. They abandoned the truck about four miles 
away on El Dorado Avenue after hitting another vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both fled the scene on foot. The car was impounded Sunday night and examined 
for fingerprints Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later arrested the suspect's sister after questioning her. She was 
booked into Ventura County Jail on suspicion of aiding a fleeing felon. Her 
name and the name of the suspect have not been released pending further 
questioning of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garcia Mortuary in Oxnard is handling arrangements.

CITY TOURISM CAMPAIGN STIRS DEBATE; OXNARD: AFTER A SERIES OF COMPLAINTS, 
OFFICIALS AGREE TO INCLUDE MINORITIES IN BROCHURES AIMED AT ATTRACTING MORE 
VISITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Slick brochures aimed at luring tourists to Oxnard will be changed to include 
Latinos, blacks and Asians, who make up nearly two-thirds of the city's 
population, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the Greater Oxnard & Harbors Tourism Bureau said they would add 
minorities to the next phase of their marketing campaign, a promotion begun 
this past spring to attract Los Angeles and Southern California tourists to the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 30,000 informational brochures and a television spot broadcast 4,200 
times in Kern and Los Angeles counties feature about 10 white models lounging 
on a beach, playing golf, lolling on rafts in a swimming pool or enjoying other 
activities. The television ads are scheduled to stop running on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the local chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement 
of Colored People and the Ventura County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 
complained that minorities were excluded from the $135,000 promotion, which was 
paid for with city bed-tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have (almost) 58% of the community, we should be taken into 
consideration," said Ray Rios, executive director of the Hispanic Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many chamber members were stunned when they saw the publicity 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a trying moment," Rios said. "We were very concerned, not only for our 
(Latino) community, but also because we represent a lot of the businesses that 
support the tourism board." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to bed tax dollars, the tourism board relies on business 
contributions and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 55% of the Oxnard population is Latino, another 8% is Asian and about 5% 
is black, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. Whites make up less than one-third 
of Oxnard residents, the census said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Lavender, the tourism board executive director, said she was looking 
forward to working with minority representatives on the next shoot. But she 
said the campaign has always been aimed at promoting Oxnard, not at publicizing 
or hiding its ethnic makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The destination is not the color of someone's skin," Lavender said. "It's the 
amenities, the beaches, the harbor. We're marketing Oxnard to Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad executive who drew up the campaign, called "Upcoast," said the issue 
never came up in discussions with the tourism board. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was never any intent to exclude anyone from this campaign," said James 
Graca, who owns the Ventura advertising agency that produced the video and 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Graca and tourism board officials pledged to re-shoot some of the 
photographs in the brochure to include blacks and Latinos, a move praised by 
minority community leaders who attended a Monday news conference announcing the 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't coming in to raise hell if they are going to do something about it," 
said John R. Hatcher III, president of the Ventura County NAACP chapter. "We're 
here to talk about a resolution, not the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graca said there is no money to produce or air new television commercials. But 
a second printing of brochures, scheduled for later this month, can be changed 
to include minorities at no extra cost to the tourism board, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new brochures will feature minority children outside the Gull Wings 
Children's Museum and a quartet of minority golfers at the River Ridge Golf 
Course, Graca said. Callers can receive the pamphlet by calling 1-800-2-OXNARD. 
</P>
<P>
 Graca said a variety of factors contributed to his decision not to use 
minority models, including a tight shooting schedule and the availability of 
talent. He said he intentionally selected a deeply tanned white male model to 
blur the man's race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took people that were very dark-skinned, tanned, so there would be an 
allure of ethnicity," he said. "I don't know how anyone could have known that 
these people weren't Hispanic." 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Sanchez, a member of the tourism board who is president of the Hispanic 
Chamber of Commerce, said the lack of minorities in the original promotions did 
not bother him "because of the positive image I got from the video." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to go ahead and bring in that revenue to the city," Sanchez said. 
"We need to promote business."

SHOULDER TO SIGH ON; CAMPERS FIND THEIR BLUE HEAVEN AT PCH 'OVERNIGHT PARKING 
ZONE' 
</P>

 Jack Schneider, flanked on either side by a receding blur of motor homes, 
stood by the boulders that guard the shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway above 
Ventura and bubbled with the giddy cheer of a man who has it all. 
</P>
<P>
 At hand, just paces from the whoosh of cars and not far from the thunder of an 
occasional train, was a tumble of loved ones -- children, grandchildren -- 
milling about their piece of asphalt while the scent of steaks eddied with the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Before them, like a jewel under the sun, was the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where else can you get this in your front yard?" the 67-year-old Santa Paula 
man said, beaming as if he had just gotten away with something. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the beach, a man at the other reach of the economic spectrum, Robert 
Cameron, gazed out at the sand, the sea, the Channel Islands peeking 
seductively through the blue, and agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be an expensive view. How much would a house cost here?" the man 
without a house wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 At his side was his answer to Schneider's 30-foot Pinnacle motor home -- a 
third-generation bicycle loaded down with some of the necessities of a 
hard-scrabble life, and some of its eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be creative with the hours you use," Cameron, 28, said of his 
lifestyle. "You have to have about three or four places where you stop to 
sleep, and they have to be strategically chosen." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Rincon Parkway, specifically a one-mile stretch of Pacific 
Coast Highway between Faria and Hobson county parks, five miles north of 
Ventura. It is a novelty, officials said, in that they know of no other 
beachfront shoulder of a state highway that has been designated by local 
ordinances for motor home camping, for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years since becoming an "overnight parking zone," as Ventura County 
officials call it, this braid of motor homes now is an ever-shifting village on 
wheels whose only constant, it seems, is change. 
</P>
<P>
 Where long-term campers once took up permanent residence, there is now a study 
of contrasts between those who are well-off and those who are not so well-off, 
and the young, the working, 
</P>
<P>
 the retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like it was tense (in former times) because you had the homeless 
types, the hippie types," said Simi Valley resident Ron Williams, 60, who was 
sharing his motor home on a recent weekday with his son and his son's friend. 
"But now it's more like the working types, the retired types." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials could not be happier, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that long-term campers were crowding out surfers, sunbathers and 
other day-users -- in addition to causing sanitation problems -- the county 
Board of Supervisors moved in 1984 to strictly limit the number of days that 
motor homes could remain along the parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They set aside 112 spaces on the beachfront shoulder -- far fewer than before 
-- and visitors now must pay a fee to stay no more than five consecutive days 
from April to October and no more than 10 from November to March. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a greater, more fluid mix of people, said parks operations 
supervisor Pam Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the families, like the Schneiders. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the retirees, like Manhattan Beach residents Maynard (Smitty) Smith 
and his wife, Polly, who have been coming to this stretch since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the newcomers, like 56-year-old Doug Payne of Glendora and his 
6-year-old daughter, Christal, their dog, Storm, and Sammie, their hamster. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the "snow birds" who travel in their motor homes the year 
around, like 63-year-old Mary, who declined to give her last name but said her 
mailing address is in Newbury Park, and her husband, 65-year-old Marv. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 10 years into their mobile lifestyle, they have settled into a circuit 
that takes in Las Vegas, Tehachapi, Lancaster, Simi Valley and Oregon, to name 
a few, she said. "The Rincon" is a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not necessarily conspicuous, there are the former users there, too, 
Gallo said -- the "long-termers" whom her park rangers try to keep in line with 
the five- or 10-day limits, but not always with success. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, they move on," she said. "At times, they don't. It's a game." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the other guests, however, are clean and orderly, mindful of 
the length-of-stay limits, parks maintenance supervisor Ed Evans said. The only 
problem, he added, are the occasional users who empty motor home septic tanks 
into the portable toilets spaced along the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our most popular camping area," said county Recreation Services manager 
Blake Boyle, so much so, he added, it is "the only campground that we operate 
that returns a profit. . . . It's almost always full." 
</P>
<P>
 That might surprise those who seek the more out-of-the-way setting, "the 
wilderness," as Gallo put it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shirlee Zahnter, 63, of Chatsworth, is not one of them. Neither is her 
57-year-old husband, Ron, who proudly announced, "We call this 'RVing,' not 
camping." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawn might be a plastic green carpet, and their plastic awning and its 
"whirligig" mobiles might shudder whenever a delivery truck zooms by at 50 
m.p.h., or a freight train -- across the highway -- at 60. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the Zahnters and others who regularly frequent this ribbon of highway, 
it is the drama that is endlessly unfolding just beyond their "front yard," 
just beyond the boulders that separate the street from the sand, that matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see everything in the world out there," Shirlee Zahnter said while 
sitting on her patio chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long later, as if to prove her point, the dark fins of two dolphins cut 
through the water just beyond the surf. Farther out, a pelican crash-dived for 
fish. Hard to the right, an oil company island that is tethered to the shore by 
the Richfield Pier glimmered in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really love are the whales," she said. Not only has she seen dolphins 
"playing around the whales," but she also has seen "dolphins jumping right over 
one surfer." 
</P>
<P>
 Seated on the steps of her motor home, the wind blowing in from the channel, 
50-year-old Susan Thomson of North Hills said, "In March and April, there were 
dolphins everywhere. They were leaping. They had their babies with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Dale, also 50, said he had even seen dolphins surf in front of 
his motor home, skipping along the faces of the waves like slick torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles that appear along the parkway, like the visitors themselves, vary 
widely. They range from the $250,000, 43-foot "rigs" with all the luxuries -- 
microwave ovens, satellite dishes -- to the $7,000, 13-foot Scamp that Smitty 
Smith brought up from Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sign-off spot," said the 66-year-old Smith. "You turn off the 
radio, the TV, the sirens, and you listen to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, 62-year-old Polly, said it is the neighborliness of the people -- 
including those who walk along the bike lane on the highway side of the motor 
homes -- that especially charms her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," she said. "When you're camping, people just come by and say 
hello, the same ones that would not even say that in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other four county-run campgrounds, the parking area along the 
Rincon has no improvements -- no running water, no electrical hookups -- and so 
it costs relatively little to operate, Boyle of Recreation Services said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Oshita, manager of the county administration and planning section, said 
expenses for the 1992-93 fiscal year for the park rangers, garbage pickup and 
the emptying of the eight portable toilets, and insurance were $153,937, 
compared to revenues of $219,172. He said the latter were from park fees -- $11 
a day from April through October and $8 a day the balance of the year -- that 
campers are to deposit into the fee vault at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've operated in the black from the day it opened up," Oshita said of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1984, and after the Ventura Freeway alternate route opened in 1973, 
long-term campers had seized upon this suddenly little-used segment of Pacific 
Coast Highway to park their motor homes and live essentially free of charge, 
without a mortgage, property taxes or homeowners insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fisherman myself," said Oshita, who has been with the county since 
1976, "and I would go along the sea wall and would see trash along the place. I 
would see trailers blocked up. I asked them how long they'd been there and 
they'd say, 'Three, five years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose 3rd District includes the Rincon 
Parkway and who was instrumental in imposing the new restrictions on lengths of 
stay, said of the earlier days: "We were serving a segment of the homeless 
population, but we weren't serving the general population." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints coming in from the public -- concerns involving sanitation, 
litter, public access to the beach, crime -- could not be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Moynahan, 62, who for about 20 years has been the concessionaire at 
Hobson County Park, just up the beach from the parkway, said, "I can't think of 
anything there that was desirable before the change, to tell you the truth, 
although it was wonderful for (the long-term campers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the former users live in whatever was handy -- station wagons, 
small trailers, converted buses -- but some of them dumped their septic tanks 
onto the rocks, the sand and ultimately into the sea, Moynahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a man once who bragged he had a hose long enough that he could 
reach all the way to the water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dreadful."

STEEP RISE IN BIRTHS TO TEEN-AGERS IS REPORTED; PREGNANCY: THE BIGGEST INCREASE 
IS AMONG 13- AND 14-YEAR-OLD GIRLS. A COUNTY TASK FORCE HOPES TO FORM A 
COMMUNITY COALITION TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of Ventura County girls ages 13 to 16 years old who are having 
babies has risen dramatically over the past eight years, a new report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Ventura County Task Force to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, which 
will be presented today to the county Board of Supervisors, shows the number of 
babies born to teen-agers younger than 17 years old has increased by about 46%, 
from 147 in 1986 to 214 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is highest among 13- and 14-year-olds, for whom the number of 
births has risen by three-quarters from 16 in 1986 to 28 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 To address the problem, the task force is calling on county supervisors to 
help organize a countywide coalition of religious institutions, schools, 
nonprofit agencies and youth clubs, task force chairwoman Judy Bysshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we really want to address teen pregnancy, we need to have a community-wide 
effort," Bysshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition would have at least two aims: to encourage teen-agers to abstain 
from sexual activity and to provide child care, job training and other support 
to teen-age mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed by county supervisors two years ago and headed by the Ventura County 
Commission on Women, the teen pregnancy task force consisted of about three 
dozen people from across the political spectrum -- from representatives of 
anti-abortion groups to local directors of Planned Parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their different perspectives on some issues, such as abortion and the 
use of contraceptives by teen-agers, task force members began their study with 
one shared premise: that young girls should not be having babies, Bysshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers who have children often drop out of high school or, if they 
graduate, fail to attend college or get the vocational training they need to 
land good jobs, task force members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without good-paying jobs and frequently without any help from the children's 
fathers, many young mothers become mired in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are most teen-agers ill-prepared to become parents, task force 
members said, but many are also too young to have sexual relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that teens should be abstinent," said Nikki Davis, a task force 
member who heads a county public health program for teen-age parents. "That's 
something we all would like to see." 
</P>
<P>
 After holding focus groups with roughly 120 county teen-agers, task force 
members concluded that many young people become sexually active for the wrong 
reasons. They are pressured by partners into having sex or they use physical 
intimacy to make up for an absence of emotional warmth in their lives, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state Department of Education already requires schools to discuss 
the benefits of sexual abstinence as part of sex education, task force members 
said educators could emphasize the topic even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs to be implemented more in sex education curricula," said April 
Fernandez, a task force member and director of the Planned Parenthood center in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, children need to hear messages about sexual abstinence in other 
places besides the classroom, task force members said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to hear it from everyone in their community," said task force 
member Karen Johnson, who is on the board of the Crisis Pregnancy Center in 
Thousand Oaks, an organization opposed to abortion that advises pregnant 
teen-agers about alternatives to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Religious institutions, Boys & Girls clubs and other groups could launch 
comprehensive programs to teach teen-agers how to resist pressures to have sex 
before they are ready, Bysshe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups will have to do most of the work to reduce the number of 
teen-age pregnancies in the county because the cash-strapped county lacks the 
money for such efforts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is there isn't any cash to do any program," Bysshe said. "The 
only way anything is going to happen is that agencies pull together." Births

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY OFFERS FIRMS GUIDE TO RECYCLING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley businesses looking for ways to clean up the environment and save a 
little money along the way can get a free guide to recycling at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guide includes information on everything from setting up a recycling 
program to composting and trading waste with other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The packet also includes an explanation of ways that businesses can save money 
by recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, pickup service for a three-cubic-yard garbage bin costs $94.17 a 
month. But if trash is separated and the same bin filled with recyclable paper, 
glass or compost, the monthly charge drops to $51.20. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point is to encourage businesses to recycle because it's good for 
them and for the community," said Joe Hreha, deputy director of environmental 
services. For information or to order a packet from the city, call 583-6874.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; LITTLE ONES GET IN THE SWIM AT CITY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As 11-month-old Evan Mathers splashed his hands in the water at the Buena High 
School pool at the beginning of his swim class on Monday, his mother, Kym, knew 
exactly what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 She held the baby up out of the water, looked into his eyes and told him that 
he was going under, but only for a moment. "One, two, three -- and down you 
go," Mathers said as she quickly immersed the child, who came up smiling. "He 
feels much more comfortable in the water than when we had just started." 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching a child to safely go under water is one of the many techniques that 
Mathers and other parents learn at the infant and preschool aquatic summer 
program offered by the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-lesson course at the Buena High pool aims to teach infants and children 
ages 6 months to 3 years how to kick, blow bubbles, float and get ready to 
learn to swim.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-minute classes begin with signing songs and bouncing in the water 
before the day's work begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the youngest, the goal is to make them comfortable in the water and to 
show their parents how to teach them basic water safety techniques," said Mari 
Alsip, the pool manager. "The parents learn more than the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Alsip said parents often do not know how to treat infants in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to speak to them as if they understand what you are saying," Alsip 
said. "And the more you repeat the same technique, the more likely they are to 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 As the babies grow older, they can continue taking summer swimming classes 
offered by the city. Since 1974, the city has provided a variety of classes not 
only for infants but also for children ages 3 to 17, Alsip said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazaleen Lyons, 35, has enrolled all five of her children in city swimming 
classes for the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to be afraid of water," Lyons said as she taught her 
7-month-old baby how to kick in the water. "And at the same time, I don't want 
them to hop in without knowing what they are doing." CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; '3 STRIKES' LAW AFFECTS MOLESTATION 
SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge set an Aug. 2 trial date for a Simi Valley man charged 
with child molestation under the new "three-strikes-and-you're-out law," 
rejecting a defense argument that the statute was implemented too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. means Henry Diaz, 
40, will probably become the county's first defendant prosecuted under the law, 
which went into effect March 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn argued that Diaz should not have been 
charged under the law because it was not passed as an emergency measure and 
should not yet be in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, Quinn did not question the validity of the statute but said, 
"It should have gone into effect, like most laws, in January ('95)." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz faces 10 felony counts of child molestation after police said they raided 
his Sitka Avenue home in March and found him in bed with a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz, who is on parole, has three prior robbery convictions. The victim has 
told police that she and Diaz had an intimate relationship, according to court 
testimony. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PILOT FORCED TO MAKE EMERGENCY LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An experimental plane was forced to make an emergency landing Monday near 
Camarillo Airport, leaving its pilot trapped but uninjured, authorities said. 
Warren Fee of Thousand Oaks emerged unscathed after Ventura County firefighters 
freed him from the wreckage of his aircraft, the Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Fee was flying the plane near the airport shortly before 2 p.m. when it lost 
power and he managed to land it in a field near the runway, authorities said. 
The plane then rolled over, trapping him in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of guys lifted the thing up and he crawled out," said Lt. Paul 
Anderson of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. He said Fee required no 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration dispatched investigators to examine the 
crash site. Monday's crash was the third such accident involving an 
experimental plane in Ventura County in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a pilot was injured when his experimental aircraft crashed 
shortly after takeoff from Camarillo Airport. A Camarillo man was killed June 
21 when his ultra-light plane crashed near Santa Paula Airport. PHYLLIS W.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL GIVES FINAL OK FOR TENNIS COURT 
</P>

 A tennis court proposed for Ventura's Camino Real Park will not have a 
negative impact on the environment, Ventura city officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote, the City Council approved an environmental impact report 
on the proposal, estimated to cost between $30,000 and $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will now go out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for constructing a lighted court, restrooms and an office, as well 
as resurfacing existing courts at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's vote Monday marked the end of a saga dating back two years, when 
a concept by Oxnard businessman Marv Kohlman to build seven clay tennis courts 
at the park sparked an uproar from nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They protested, saying that seven new courts would significantly increase 
traffic and shrink the park's open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea lay dormant until this spring, when city officials began to discuss 
building new courts at the park. The original proposal was for four new courts, 
but public opposition at a May hearing whittled that number down to one.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NO DAMAGE REPORTED FOLLOWING TEMBLORS

<P>
 Three short but sharp aftershocks from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
rattled homes in Simi Valley late Sunday and early Monday, but police and city 
officials said no injuries or damage were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The first aftershock, magnitude 3.6, hit at 11:49 p.m. Sunday, according to 
seismologist Jim Mori at Caltech in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 It was followed by a 3.7 jolt a minute later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mori said both quakes were centered 3 miles southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The third aftershock, magnitude 2.6, was centered two miles southeast of Simi 
Valley and hit Monday morning at 8:57 a.m., Caltech officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said the city received no 
damage reports after the trio of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become almost routine," Sedell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'did you feel it?,' but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Federal Emergency Management Agency office in Simi Valley, spokeswoman 
Pamela Korneisel said she had not heard of any damage, but that residents tend 
to wait awhile before asking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we'll start to see people coming in later," Korneisel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, FEMA officials announced the agency will extend its deadline 
for earthquake relief applications another 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents now have until Sept. 16 to apply for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who wish to make FEMA claims should contact the agency at 
1-800-462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for applications for home and business loans through the Small 
Business Administration disaster loan program is Oct. 17. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY GIRLS WIN WORLD SOCCER TITLE AT AYSO TOURNAMENT 
</P>

<P>
 With all eyes on the World Cup soccer tournament, a team of Ventura County 
girls quietly won the world title for their age group Sunday in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11- and 12-year-old girls managed five consecutive shutout victories to 
take gold medals in the America Youth Soccer Organization world games, a 
tournament that drew 96 teams from as far away as Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably a once-in-a-lifetime shot for these kids," said Ed Guzman, 
the coach who helped put together the Ventura Girls Soccer team for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth organization typically hosts American tournaments, but expanded the 
contest to foreign teams because of this year's World Cup. Seven foreign 
countries sent teams to San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman won a slot for a Ventura team in the world tournament through a lottery 
and then put together a group of girls to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the 15 girls had played on an all-star team for the Ventura region, 
and others were picked in a series of try-outs. Most came from the city of 
Ventura, though a few members live in Oxnard and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 With a team chosen by March, coaches held practices three nights a week. The 
practice paid off when the tournament started last Wednesday. That day, the 
Ventura Girls shut out two California teams, Concord, 3-0, and San Mateo, 6-0. 
On Friday, they defeated two more state rivals, Palo Alto, 3-0 and Westchester, 
3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday they won a semifinal match against Brigham City, Utah, 3-0. And the 
final Sunday matched them against Laguna Niguel. That game was decided in the 
third period of overtime with a single goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnitude of this victory for these girls, this is a real eye-opener for 
the whole girls' program," said Guzman, whose daughter, Heidi, played 
goalkeeper for the championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 The other players include: Shannon Fink, Alex Gientke, Brenna Huhn, Natasha 
Ikeda, Megan Kelly, Corrie Leonardo, Ashley Miller, Kelly Nash, Darcy Perez, 
Chelsea Rasmussen, Nicki Rideout, Shayna Rosenburg, J.J. Toohey and Paige 
Wilson. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GUARD FIREFIGHTERS TO REMAIN IN ARIZONA

 More than three dozen members of the Channel Islands Air National Guard 
deployed to help fight Arizona'a deadly firestorms will remain on the front 
lines of two fires that have consumed 15,000 acres until the blazes are 
contained, National Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 40 full-time and reserve firefighters stationed out of the Channel 
Islands Air National Guard Base near the Point Mugu Navy base will continue 
dropping fire retardants from their C-130s as long as they are needed, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to tell when they might return," Maj. Michael Ritz said. "It 
all depends on the weather and the U. S. Forest Service," which will determine 
when the fires are contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Two main fires sparked by lightning are ravaging the Arizona desert, calling 
for round-the-clock drops of fire retardant from the giant aircraft stationed 
at Channel Islands, Ritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures reaching as high as 140 degrees have slowed firefighters, who are 
combatting blazes in steep terrain largely inaccessible on foot, Ritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritz said it is not unusual to have a series of severe firestorms this early 
in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember fires being early and late, where we've fought well into the 
winter on certain fires," Ritz said. "It depends on the climate changes and 
exactly where we're fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County guard crews reported to Arizona on July 1, several days after 
being dispatched to the Hemet and Sequoia fires in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, the 10,000-acre Rincon fire was 85% contained as of early Sunday, 
but the Rattlesnake fire was listed at 35% containment. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the C-130 crews drop an average of 26,000 pounds of pressurized fire 
retardant onto the fires every hour from as low to the ground as 100 feet. JEFF 
McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BICYCLE LOCKERS TO BE INSTALLED AT METROLINK

<P>
 Hoping to encourage Ventura County Metrolink commuters to ride bicycles 
instead of driving to the train station, a local agency is going to install 
storage lockers at stops throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission has received an $80,000 federal 
Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement grant to buy the 
lockers.Caltrans has agreed to pay an additional $20,000 for administrative 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, a total of at least 40 heavy-duty fiberglass lockers 
will be installed at the Metrolink stations in Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo 
and Oxnard, as well as at the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Users must supply their own locks and will have free access to lockers on a 
first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Before selecting the lockers, commission staffers surveyed other cities with 
similar programs, including Santa Clarita, Riverside, Sacramento, Portland, 
Ore., and Spokane, Wash., to find the best equipment and program. SARA CATANIA

COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PLAN FOR A NEW DAY-CARE CENTER; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
FACILITY, TO BE SITUATED NEXT TO CONEJO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, WOULD BE OPERATED 
JOINTLY BY THE CITY AND THE DISTRICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Working to address a shortage of child-care facilities in the central part of 
Thousand Oaks, the City Council today will debate a plan calling for a new 
after-school center run in partnership with the school district.  
</P>
<P>
 The proposed center, which would be located next to Conejo Elementary School, 
is one of several ideas the council is expected to consider during its regular 
meeting tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 The council may also solicit the help of private companies to build a 
full-service day-care facility for children whose parents live or work near 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard between Wilbur Road and Westlake Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of studying, looking into what is needed, but no action," 
said council member Jaime Zukowski. "What we're doing is getting things moving 
so we can have a day-care facility as soon as possible."  
</P>
<P>
 Even before a 1993 city-commissioned survey documented the need for child-care 
facilities in the central part of Thousand Oaks, parents have been urging the 
council to facilitate child care in that part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for a long time the council didn't realize how bad the situation 
was," said Geri Fineroff, a longtime child-care advocate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that for an area in which we pride ourselves on being family 
oriented, it is sad that parents have had to take their kids outside of the 
city for care," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The September, 1993, survey, city officials said, offered proof that the city 
-- and the central district in particular -- was underserved by day-care 
providers.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, no facilities existed in central Thousand Oaks, where 
about 2,100 children were in need of child care. And, it estimated that only 
2,256 spaces existed citywide for the more than 10,000 children that needed 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lack of care is a real problem for (parents) here," Zukowski said. "And I 
think we all are aware that when kids are left unattended is when the seeds are 
planted for bigger problems."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of meetings between city officials, parents and school 
officials, Conejo Valley School District Supt. Jerry Gross sent the city a plan 
for the two entities to work together.  
</P>
<P>
 That proposal calls for the city to purchase a large portable building to be 
placed on property next to Conejo Elementary School and to subsidize expenses 
for 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials said they requested city subsidies because an 
earlier attempt to start up an after-school program at Conejo Elementary School 
failed because parents couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program would cost parents about $200 a month, said Sarah Hart, an 
assistant superintendent for the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the program would work well if there was some sort of scholarship 
available to the parents who need it," Hart said. "But we're just not in the 
position to offer anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the city's support, Gross' letter said the school district 
would agree to pay rent for use of the building, create and run a before- and 
after-school program and purchase all the materials and equipment necessary to 
operate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said she believes a joint project with the school district would 
receive the support of most city residents.

THOUSAND OAKS CONSIDERS RAISING SALARY BRACKETS; PAY: THE CITY MAY INCREASE THE 
EARNING POTENTIAL OF KEY MANAGERS BY 10.7% TO STAY IN LINE WITH SIMILAR 
GOVERNMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Salary brackets for some top Thousand Oaks officials would shift upward by as 
much as 10.7%, under a compensation adjustment proposal the City Council will 
consider tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 While individual paychecks would not be affected until at least next summer, 
key employees' potential earnings could skyrocket if the council approves the 
reclassification. 
</P>
<P>
 The top salary for the director of library services, for example, would jump 
to $104,112 a year, up from the $94,044 set as the maximum salary two years 
ago. And the directors of the finance, planning and public works departments 
would see their upper earning potential raised by more than 8%, to a maximum 
$111,888 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Big boosts in earning potential would also be awarded to the human resources 
manager and assistant city manager, who would see their brackets move upward at 
least 5.5%. In contrast, the city manager's top potential wage would inch 
higher by less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Within each salary bracket, employees traditionally climb a ladder from the 
low end of the scale to the maximum salary, based on their experience and 
performance evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are not guaranteed to stay on the same rung of the ladder if their 
salary bracket slides. So a manager standing on the third of five rungs, for 
example, could be technically demoted to the second rung in order to maintain 
the same annual wage if the bracket parameters suddenly jump up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential (for salary hikes) could be out there . . . but there's no 
guarantee, and there's not even an expectation," Finance Director Robert Biery 
said. Just because the wage brackets slide upward, he said, "it would have 
nothing to do with where any one manager ends up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the thought of boosting even potential earnings made some council 
members nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think the whole ladder should move up for upper management," 
Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "Certainly this is not the time for those 
kind of increases. They would be very difficult to justify." 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski said she still had not decided whether to support bracket adjustments 
for lower-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, a street maintenance supervisor, for example, could see a 
nearly 5% increase to $55,728. But other brackets, such as librarians and the 
deputy city clerk, would receive negligible adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 All the changes, both the major and the minute, are designed to bring Thousand 
Oaks' pay scale in line with comparable cities, such as Camarillo, Irvine, 
Pasadena and Torrance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the proposal would cost the city about $300,000 a year, said Greg 
Eckman, the city's human resources manager. The exact figure would be 
determined only after next summer's performance evaluations when each employee 
could get a raise based on merit and the new pay scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are assessing what the same job is paying at comparable cities in Southern 
California because we need to keep up to date with our competition," Councilman 
Frank Schillo said. "We need to keep the people we want (with good salaries) so 
they don't slide sideways to other cities." 
</P>
<P>
 But taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings, who has sharply criticized public 
officials' perks and salaries in the past, objected to any analysis that 
adjusted Thousand Oaks' wages based on other cities' pay scales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, whether it's the Police Department or the Fire Department or 
city staff, their salaries all run in this upward spiral because they compare 
themselves with other locales," Robings said. "If Thousand Oaks raises their 
(brackets), then the next city is going to say 'Gee, we gotta bring ours in 
line with Thousand Oaks,' and it goes on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because pay increases are based on merit, with no automatic cost-of-living 
increase, no employee would be guaranteed a raise. Generally, the benchmark for 
merit raises hovers around 3% to 4%, and even exceptional employees rarely 
receive more than 6% in any one year. 
</P>
<P>
 But an employee's higher bracket could factor into greater pay hikes during 
the next round of performance evaluations, scheduled for next July, said Jeff 
Knowles, president of the Thousand Oaks Management Assn. labor union, which 
represents about 80 city supervisors.

HOMELESS SHELTER PLAN DRAWS HEATED DEBATE; VENTURA: ADVOCATES FOR THE 10-BED 
DOWNTOWN FACILITY ARGUE WITH RESIDENTS BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to open a homeless shelter in downtown Ventura pitted the mentally 
ill homeless and their advocates against residents Monday, with both sides 
arguing the issue late into the night before the Ventura City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turning Point Foundation, which operates a drop-in center for the mentally 
ill on Thompson Boulevard near California Street, has proposed putting 10 
roll-away beds in the center to allow clients to spend the night there. The 
Planning Commission approved the proposal in June. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, some landowners -- one of whom forced the issue onto the council's 
agenda by appealing the commission's decision -- argued that the shelter's 
clients are already a nuisance and would become more troublesome if a shelter 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get assaulted constantly from people begging from us," said Steve Smith, 
who lives in an apartment complex adjacent to the drop-in center. "Sometimes 
when you say no they get very argumentative and start cursing at you. Opening 
the facility, I think, will only attract more people and make it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiastic supporters of the project, however, also turned out in droves. 
They argued that homeless mentally ill people already live in Ventura, and 
offering them a place to live would help them become better citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hoffman, who described himself as homeless and mentally ill, said 
opponents of the shelter "need to wake up and open their eyes. We're 
everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce Jenkins, a caseworker for the Salvation Army, also voiced strong support 
for the shelter. "I see what's happening at Turning Point as an incredible 
thing," she said. "They're going to get people more involved in the community, 
people who are already here." 
</P>
<P>
 William Orcutt, who owns land across the street from the foundation, filed the 
appeal of the Planning Commission's approval of the project, saying the shelter 
will only attract more transients to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Turning Point's proposal, officials will clear out one of the building's 
two rooms each night starting this fall to make way for the roll-away beds and 
partitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation agreed to certain conditions for its nighttime shelter, 
including restricting guests to staying no more than 90 nights in a row at the 
shelter; requiring at least two employees to remain on duty at all times, and 
adding lighting to the back of the building to discourage homeless people from 
sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orcutt, however, says the Turning Point's clients already create problems in 
the neighborhood, and allowing them to spend the night would only worsen the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Orcutt lives in San Diego and acknowledged in a recent interview that he has 
not witnessed any problems. But he said residents who live near his property 
told him the foundation's visitors sometimes urinate in public and cause 
general disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Turning Point is a less than desirable neighbor now, how much better a 
neighbor will it become with the addition of outside lighting, toilets, a 
telephone and 10 overnight guests?" he wrote in a letter to the City Council.

 Although only one school suffered major structural damage in the Northridge 
earthquake, earthquake-related repairs at Thousand Oaks schools will cost an 
estimated $8 million, district officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimate, which came after months of detailed surveys conducted by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the California Office for Emergency 
Services, contrasts sharply with damage reports given right after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports found that schools in the Thousand Oaks area suffered minimal 
damage compared to schools in Simi Valley and Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 But Conejo Valley Unified School District officials said Monday that a 
thorough examination has revealed "hundreds" of quake-related repairs needed at 
31 school district sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a site in the district that does not have at least some sort of 
plaster crack," Assistant Supt. Sarah Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only 31 damage survey reports have been approved for government funds 
totaling about $1.1 million, a FEMA spokeswoman said. But about 60 additional 
projects are awaiting funding, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 District officials hope that the necessary repairs will be paid for through 
disaster relief funds over the next two to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the jobs include filling cracks in walls, replacing fallen ceiling 
tiles and reinstalling lighting systems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of little things throughout 31 schools," said Nat Johnson, 
a service and repair supervisor for the district. After the quake, he said, "we 
did a quick, immediate look at our sites to make sure we could get our kids 
back in safely. As far as an in-depth (study) goes -- that takes time." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage is more serious at a few campuses such as Thousand Oaks High 
School, where one classroom was red-tagged as structurally unsafe. An entire 
wing of the school's old modular classrooms are being replaced, and cracks in 
another school's swimming pool will have to be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, cracks caused by the earthquake have exposed asbestos at Redwood 
Intermediate School's library, multipurpose room and two classrooms, forcing 
authorities to remove the insulation. That alone is expected to cost about half 
a million dollars, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The damage is there, it's just not as graphic," said Oscar Corea, the 
district's consulting project manager for earthquake-related repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a thin crack snaking up a brick wall in Maple Elementary School's 
cafeteria, FEMA inspector Gerrold Ramos said some quake damage is hard to 
notice at first, but can still be expensive to repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was a point where this wall was anchored to the foundation, it would 
be a problem," the engineer said, running his finger along the hairline crack. 
Similar patch-and-repair projects on buildings at Newbury Park High School were 
estimated at nearly $15,000, he said.

OBITUARIES ; RAY REITZEL; ARMY MAN WHO TAUGHT TENNIS TO THE STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He conducted reconnaissance missions on skis for Gen. George Patton. He ruled 
as the U.S. Army's grand champion in Ping-Pong. And he taught tennis to Paul 
Newman and Doris Day at the Ojai Valley Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Ray Reitzel, 75, died after a brief illness, leaving behind a 
family and a legion of tennis buffs who learned and played with him in 25 years 
as a tennis pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a special kind of fixture at the Ojai Valley Inn," said Charles 
Furniss, a Los Angeles doctor who retired to Ojai. "I'm smiling as I talk right 
now, because he was one of the reasons I came here. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always on duty. Unlike today's pros, he was always available to get a 
game up for anyone. It was a lifelong job of play for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reitzel first visited Ojai in his teens when he played in the city's famous 
tennis tournament. He was born in Oakland and attend schools in Huntington 
Park. He spent three years in the Army, serving as part of the Reconnaissance 
Ski Patrol. As such, he slipped behind enemy lines in the Battle of the Bulge, 
said his daughter, Sharron Fletcher of Grass Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ski duty left Reitzel with severe frostbite in his toes. "It was amazing 
he continued to play tennis," Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 While in the hospital recovering, Reitzel started playing Ping-Pong and soon 
began traveling around to Army bases for tournaments. Before he left the Army 
in 1945, he won the service's championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Reitzel moved his family to Ventura County to work with his 
brother in the real estate business. Within a year, he joined the Ojai Valley 
Inn as the tennis pro, teaching lessons and rounding up games for the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 His students included actors Anthony Quinn, Paul Newman and Doris Day, as well 
as the ordinary guests at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a marvelous teacher," Furniss said. "He would tend to size up a person 
and adjust himself to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had an overwhelming tennis serve, Reitzel would play down to his 
opponent, always managing to just barely defeat him, Furniss recalled. "He made 
things fun," Furniss said. 
</P>
<P>
 After retiring in 1982, Reitzel opened a small shop in Ojai's downtown Arcade, 
selling tennis clothes. He continued to play the game and remained active in 
the Ojai Valley Tennis Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Diane Reitzel; two daughters, Fletcher and Judy 
Bowles of Edina, Minn.; a sister, Charlotte Gilmour of Walnut Creek and four 
grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is planned for 2 p.m. Wednesday at Clausen Funeral Home in 
Ojai. Inurnment will be at Nordhoff Cemetery in Ojai.

SALUTING ROLE MODELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was proud to read the coverage about the students of Cal Lutheran University 
and the work they are doing in the Mini Corps program ("Fields of Study," June 
28). Times like these ask for a new generation of mentors and role models to be 
there for all our children. 
</P>
<P>
 With the politics of immigration and the media wave surrounding it, it can be 
easy for us to forget about our future generations. No matter what side or view 
we take on the issue of immigration, we have to remember that our children, 
both legal and illegal, are waiting for us to teach them by example the 
goodness we can do for ourselves and for each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Putting all debate, labels, analysis, argument and opinion aside, the small 
children wait with their books. Much thanks is due to these young mentors and 
role models, the ones who have not forgotten them.

RATE INCREASE COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The board of a very small government agency -- the Channel Islands Beach 
Community Services District -- just passed a budget resulting in a $4-per-month 
water rate increase. Rate increases are so routine that most people do not even 
take note.They just write out the check and go back to work or to the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, the offhand dismissal to protesters is that this is only $4 a month, 
only a half-cent sales tax increase, just a mere $1 a year more on your auto 
registration fee, really nothing at all. Only a little mandate here, a small 
regulation there. In this way the Lilliputian threads bind the giant down. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the movie in which the exasperated man finally threw open the window 
and yelled, "I'm not going to take this anymore." Are we already so firmly 
bound that such a cry would be only a joke: "Look at that fool thinking he can 
do anything but lie there trussed up like a turkey."

CROSSING IS HAZARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your June 29 Ventura County Edition, there was an article about the dangers 
of the railroad crossing just west of Moorpark. The hazards of the crossing 
were downplayed by the California Highway Patrol, Caltrans and Metrolink 
because they could not recall any train related accidents at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, a significant hazard to bicyclists there because the 
crossing is very rough and is poorly maintained. A cyclist lost his life there 
within the last three years after falling while crossing the tracks and being 
struck by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized bicycle rides such as Cruising the Conejo and the L.A. Wheelman 
Grand Tour station an attendant at the crossing to warn riders of the hazard. 
The eastbound shoulder is so rough that riders are forced to enter the lane of 
traffic in order to cross the tracks safely. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, the responsible party should install a rubberized crossing 
to ensure the safety of the many bicycle riders who use California 118.

HE WILL MISS UNOCAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pending departure of Unocal Corp., a 104-year native of the local and 
state oil community, is a sad example of a trend that is threatening the 
California oil industry and the state economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent economic forecast seminar in Ventura County, a UC Santa Barbara 
economist noted that the loss of manufacturing jobs is the most significant 
reason for the county's continuing stagnant growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal was born in 1890 in Santa Paula and was one of the many oil 
manufacturers that, through more than a century of tax revenues and lucrative 
manufacturing jobs, helped California achieve its powerful economic base. As we 
all know, that base has eroded in recent years due to a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is more than a temporary economic downturn that has oil companies such 
as Unocal looking to sell its state operations. In fact, oil manufacturers 
trying to do business in California are finding fewer opportunities due to 
unfriendly or cavalier business conditions imposed by government. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at a time when production along the outer continental shelf is 
near capacity, transportation options to the huge Los Angeles refinery market 
are being limited or written off, forcing companies to compete for dwindling 
pipeline space. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent negative transportation developments include the indefinite shutdown of 
a crucial Four Corners Pipeline Co. line running from Kern County to Los 
Angeles, which was damaged by the Jan. 17 earthquake; the rescinding of a 
permit for Chevron to tanker crude oil from Point Arguello to Los Angeles, and 
the permanent shutdown of a 13-year-old Exxon offshore storage and treatment 
facility that used tankers to transport oil from the Santa Barbara Channel to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of these cases, government disinterest or regulation was unresponsive 
to the needs of the oil industry, causing area manufacturers to transport state 
oil to other refineries' areas -- especially Texas -- at a significant loss of 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to remember that Unocal isn't leaving the state because oil is 
no longer a profitable type of business. Rather, it is choosing to invest in 
other states and countries where government believes in opening doors for the 
oil industry -- not slamming them shut.

WEIS CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The criticism of county Supt. of Schools Chuck Weis for displacing the 
political aspirations of Dan Flynn could be entirely unwarranted. Chuck 
undoubtedly intends to eliminate the other positions in the department and then 
resign to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 He probably has realized that in the interest of economy, the Ventura County 
School Board and his department -- another layer of unnecessary bureaucracy -- 
should be demolished as a wasteful anachronism of the horse and buggy days. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an action could probably save $1 million a year for Ventura County 
education alone. And if the practice were extended to the other 58 counties, 
the savings could be more than $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe Chuck intends to replace Flynn with a newcomer at a much lower 
salary. With the savings, he could probably get the school board to give him a 
second raise this year.

 The Ventura County edition on June 26 published a complimentary and factual 
article about Amateur Radio Emergency Communication Preparedness with 
particular emphasis on the Conejo Valley Amateur Radio Club (CVARC). 
</P>
<P>
 However, your choice of one club member's tongue-in-cheek comment concerning 
"nerds, geeks, dorks, wimps" to end an otherwise professional article was an 
example of tasteless journalism. CVARC's members come from all walks of life. 
They include engineers, airline pilots, homemakers, business owners,

SHE'S THINKING GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, the city of Ventura has been accepting proposals from developers to 
convert agricultural lands to residential housing. These proposed projects are 
massive, with several projects encompassing more than 400 homes.With proposals 
for more than 2,200 residential dwellings already on file with the city, the 
potential economic and environmental impacts are severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Ventura residents would like to see our remaining agricultural lands and 
open spaces preserved. We do not desire to see our city converted to endless 
strip malls and housing tracts. Once greenbelts are lost, they can never be 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to forget that agriculture supports a complex network of jobs in 
Ventura County, including trucking, machinery sales and repair, agricultural 
supplies, financial services and field work. With aerospace, oil and gas jobs 
in severe decline, can we afford to reduce our agriculture-related jobs through 
land conversion? What concrete plans do the politicians have to replace jobs 
lost from agricultural land conversion? While a housing development may seem 
like a panacea to city tax revenues, the long-range impact of this conversion 
is detrimental to all of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this City Council supporting development on agricultural lands that our 
planners have set off-limits for development till the year 2010? The answer is 
simple: money. Developers have adopted a new tactic of submitting proposals for 
new developments with promises of checks or other incentives to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacrificing long-range planning goals for financial promises from developers 
is fundamentally corrupt and should not be tolerated.

PLANS FOR PLANTING ANOTHER SUBURB; GROWTH: SANTA CLARITA VALLEY DEVELOPMENT 
WOULD COVER 19 SQUARE MILES AND HOUSE 70,000 PEOPLE. OFFICIALS AND 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS THINK THEY CAN SOFTEN ITS IMPACT, BUT THEY KNOW IT'S ONLY ONE 
OF SEVERAL PROJECTS TO COME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TRACEY KAPLAN and DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years ago, they took onion fields and planted a suburb called 
Valencia, at the time the largest subdivision in Los Angeles County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Newhall Land & Farming Co. wants to transform a 19-square-mile Santa 
Clarita Valley tract peppered with oil wells and cattle into a community of 
70,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 25,000 homes, 10 schools, six shopping centers and a business 
park, the development would surpass even the original Valencia project. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be about half the size of the city of Santa Clarita and about three 
times larger than San Fernando or Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is only the latest of several housing projects around the state that 
are lining up like supertankers at a port, ready to capitalize on the end of 
the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, designed to be built in five phases over a 25-year period, has 
sparked worries about traffic and other environmental impacts. Concern is 
heightened because Southern California's largest remaining wild river, the 
Santa Clara, flows through the site west of Six Flags Magic Mountain and is 
home to two federally designated endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling Newhall Ranch project would straddle California 126 and fill in 
a five-mile gap of open space between the amusement park and the Ventura County 
line. Ventura County officials fear that the suburban sprawl would eventually 
spill across the line into the bucolic farmlands of the Santa Clara River 
Valley, since the developer owns another 15,000 acres there. 
</P>
<P>
 But even environmentalists who oppose the project concede that the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors and at least five other state and federal agencies 
are likely to approve the stack of permits that the developer needs to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced by company officials, the long-anticipated project is beginning 
to wend its way through a three-year approval process in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the development will undoubtedly go through in some form," said Ron 
Bottorff, chairman of Friends of the Santa Clara River. "The best we can do is 
to reduce the impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Working for Newhall Land is its reputation as developer of the carefully 
planned Valencia community, and its assertions that it will do all it can to 
make Newhall Ranch a model of environmentally sensitive development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did nationwide surveys and we found that people want to live close to 
nature," said James M. Harter, a senior vice president of Newhall Land. "People 
are tired of concrete and urban sprawl." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Ranch would be made up of five villages linked by a network of roads 
the company plans to build, including extensions of Chiquita Canyon Road, Magic 
Mountain Parkway, Valencia Boulevard and San Martinez Grade. Plans also call 
for California 126, which the state Department of Transportation already 
intends to widen to four lanes, to be widened to six lanes along a four-mile 
stretch west of the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has offered to set aside 5,400 acres of open space -- or 45% of 
the property -- in the southern corner of the project. Mostly impractical for 
development, the hilly land is part of an area recognized as ecologically 
sensitive by Los Angeles County. It would be reserved for hiking trails and a 
few estate lots, Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have vowed not to pave over any part of the 100-mile-long 
Santa Clara River, critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo, an endangered 
songbird, and the last refuge of the unarmored three-spined stickleback, a tiny 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan filed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Newhall Land would 
preserve the Santa Clara River's natural soft bottom and add materials to 
riverbank sections where erosion occurs. That is considered preferable to 
putting in concrete channels, which reduce the chance of flooding but speed up 
water flow, scouring the riverbed farther downstream, disrupting river wildlife 
and prohibiting water from seeping into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would appear they're taking the sensitive way to go," said Dave Vannatta, 
a field deputy to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But some environmentalists plan to argue that no structures should be allowed 
in the river's flood plain, so there will be less pressure in the future to 
alter its natural state to protect buildings. They are pushing the Army Corps 
of Engineers to require a full environmental report of the company's plans 
instead of accepting a less thorough environmental assessment that has already 
found no significant impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic impact of the project also troubles Santa Clarita officials, who 
founded the city six years ago out of concern that unbridled building was 
outpacing the growth of public services in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many more people can this valley hold?" asked Councilwoman Jan Heidt, 
pointing out that the Santa Clarita Valley was the fastest-growing region in 
the county before the recession hit. "The impact is going to be just 
tremendous." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land officials said they could not estimate the amount of traffic the 
project would generate on California 126, the Golden State Freeway and already 
congested local roads. But they minimized the effects, saying many Newhall 
Ranch residents would work in local business parks being built in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land's environmental studies will not be completed for months, but it 
is certain that the impact of the new project will be felt in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 As the closest Ventura County city to the new community, Fillmore will 
probably feel its effect most heavily. Some city residents say they are looking 
forward to the groundbreaking because it may help Fillmore emerge as a tourist 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County officials said the development would eventually create 
enormous pressure on the county to alter its strict policies limiting 
construction in unincorporated areas separated from existing cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials note that Newhall Land is involved in a 10-year process of removing 
all of its unincorporated Ventura County acreage from a state farmland 
conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to be very concerned about this project's impact on Ventura 
County," said Maggie Kildee, county supervisor for the Santa Clara Valley 
communities of Piru, Fillmore and Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Land executives say they simply want to remove government restrictions 
from their land and have no development plans for their Ventura County 
holdings, which stretch westward past Piru seven miles into the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their fears are unfounded," Harter said. "The world changes. I don't 
know what the world will be like 25 years from now. But at the present time, we 
have no plans for development in Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall Ranch alone would not be completed until 2032, Harter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the real estate market is still soft, Newhall Land is just one of 
several developers around the state attempting to obtain approval for huge 
projects in anticipation of the end of the downturn, said Bill Fulton, 
publisher of the California Planning and Development Report. For instance, in 
San Diego County, a developer plans to build a huge housing project on the 
23,000-acre Otay Ranch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that's interesting to me is that Newhall Land waited so long to do 
this," Fulton said. "It's evidence of how incredibly slow and late L.A. is in 
coming out of this recession compared to Northern California and San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the depressed housing market, Harter said more than half of the 
housing in Newhall Ranch would be attached owner-occupied and rental housing, 
such as condominiums, townhouses and apartments. The Newhall Ranch Project 
Projected population: 70,000 Size: 12,000 acres. Number of units: 24,700, 55% 
of which will be attached. Open space; 5,400 acres. Neighborhood parks: 170 
acres. Other amenities: A lake, 200-acres business park and golf course. 
Schools: One high school, one middle school and eight elementary schools. 
Projected completion date: 2023, 25 years after construction begins.

THE FUGITIVE HACKER; HUNT CONTINUES FOR MAN ACCUSED OF RAISING HAVOC WITH 
COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON and JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's one of America's most wanted digital desperadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitnick, a legendary "dark side" hacker whose computer was, in the words 
of one investigator, an "umbilical cord . . . to his soul," is being sought by 
federal and state authorities for once again allegedly using his technical 
wizardry as a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 A warrant has been issued accusing him of violating the requirement of his 
federal probation that he not enter a computer illegally. At the same time, the 
California Department of Motor Vehicles is accusing him of posing as a law 
enforcement officer to gain classified information and to possibly create false 
identities for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have not been able to catch up with him since they visited the 
Calabasas company that he worked for in late 1992. Mitnick's life now seems to 
have come tantalizingly close to replicating the Robert Redford movie role in 
"Three Days of the Condor," about a man who goes into hiding and uses his 
technical knowledge to outwit the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick once used the nickname "Condor." 
</P>
<P>
 For Mitnick, 30, a former computer nerd who dropped 100 pounds before going 
into hiding, these are just the latest accusations spanning a career of hacking 
that began at Monroe High School in North Hills, when he learned how to access 
the school district's main computers. Eventually, he was able to break into a 
North American Air Defense Command computer in Colorado Springs, Colo., several 
years before the movie "WarGames," about a hacker who nearly starts a war after 
entering a defense computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick also became a skilled "phone phreak" who was able to manipulate the 
telephone system to pull pranks on friends and enemies, according to 
authorities. He disconnected service to Hollywood stars that he admired, and a 
former probation officer said her phone service was terminated just as she was 
about to revoke his probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an electronic terrorist," said a onetime friend who turned him in to 
authorities in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest in 1988, he was denied bail by three different federal 
judges, who feared what he could do once back on the streets. Much of the fear 
about Mitnick in law enforcement quarters appears to stem not from what he has 
done in any one case, but from what mayhem he could cause in our 
computer-dependent society if he put his mind to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick eventually pleaded guilty to one computer crime and served a year in 
prison. Afterward, he spent almost a year in a Los Angeles residential 
treatment program, Gateways Beit T'Shuvah, during which time he was not allowed 
to touch a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriett Rossetto, the program director, said Mitnick suffered from an 
addictive-obsessive disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw his hacking as an addiction," she said. Mitnick was a loner who was 
very vulnerable and did not open up easily. In appearance, he resembled the 
classic computer jockey, with clunky glasses and shirttail hanging out. But at 
the keyboard of a computer, he felt strong and capable. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossetto liked him, but was not particularly impressed by his intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a recurring theme over the years. Some people see him as a 
genius with a terminal, while others say his technical abilities are not 
extraordinary. What is extraordinary, say friends, is his willingness to be 
consumed for as long as it takes by his task, such as finding a way past a 
computer's security system. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniable, however, are his skills at what is called "social engineering" by 
some and "gagging" by others -- the ability to manipulate others to turn over 
information he desires, such as access codes and passwords. 
</P>
<P>
 Beit T'Shuvah uses the 12-step recovery model. While at the center, Mitnick 
made good progress and lost weight. After leaving the program, he moved to Las 
Vegas, then returned for a relative's funeral. Rossetto saw him briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 He told her he wasn't doing well. "I said, admit yourself back here," she 
said. He didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1992, Mitnick went to work for Teltec Investigations Inc. in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executive Michael Grant said Mitnick was training to be an 
investigator for the firm, which does asset investigations, surveillance and 
research. Grant said he knew about some of Mitnick's past problems, but "he 
told me he had gone straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant said that while Mitnick was at the firm, he did a good job. He lived 
with another company official, Mark Kasden, a friend of Mitnick's father, Alan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in late September of that year, FBI agents showed up and asked to search 
Mitnick's office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit for another search at the same time, the FBI was 
conducting a computer and wire fraud investigation into computer hacking and 
unauthorized entry into Pacific Bell Telephone Co. computers. Mitnick was named 
as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI believed that Mitnick the "phone phreak" was back. According to the 
affidavit, Mitnick or others residing and working at three apartments and a 
Compton company had tapped into telephone and electronic communications to 
obtain passwords belonging to security investigators, tampered with the 
computers and intercepted company voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also alleged that special calling features not then available to 
the public had been placed on Kasden's phone and were not being paid for. They 
included speed dialing and priority ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI declined to comment on the investigation, but Grant said he and Kasden 
believe that Mitnick rigged the phones for himself while he was staying with 
Kasden. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant believes that Mitnick is "probably one of the brightest individuals with 
a computer that ever set foot on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 After the search, Mitnick disappeared. Kasden said he later saw him once 
briefly at a gas station. "He said, 'Adios, I have problems I have to take care 
of.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Grant nor Kasden sees him as destructive. "He's a gentle guy and 
nonviolent. He's never going to hurt anybody. But some of the stuff he does is 
irritating," Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concurring in that assessment are some people who have known him longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rubin, an attorney who once represented him, said Mitnick has never used 
his skills to enrich himself. When he was arrested in 1988, he was living in a 
modest Panorama City apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lewis De Payne, 35, who befriended Mitnick when both men were teen-agers, 
said his friend is often judged to be something he is not. "He's brash, but 
effective, and that causes some people some discomfort as far as rubbing them 
the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
 De Payne says people overestimate Mitnick's computer wizardry. 
</P>
<P>
 But others insist that his activities go beyond curiosity and pranks to 
serious crime, such as posing as a law enforcement officer to gain private 
information. The New York Times has reported that Mitnick is suspected of 
stealing software and data from half a dozen cellular phone manufacturers, 
compromising the security of the phone networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMV has requested a warrant for his arrest, contending that in the fall of 
1992 he began posing as a law enforcement officer to obtain sensitive DMV 
information, including driver's licenses and vehicle information and 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would give a requesting officer's name and would basically use his 
identity and birth date," said Bill Madison, a DMV spokesman in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison believes that Mitnick could have gotten the secret law enforcement 
personal identification numbers that he needed by tapping into DMV phone lines 
in Los Angeles and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities got wind of the trouble after a DMV technician became suspicious 
when a man, identifying himself as an investigator for the fraud division of 
the Los Angeles County Welfare Department, requested DMV information and 
supplied a fax number that the technician did not recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 The number was traced to a Studio City copy shop. Other fax numbers were 
traced to copy shops in Sacramento and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators staked out the copy shop and watched Mitnick pick up the 
materials, Madison said. A chase ensued, but Mitnick got away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost had him," Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said he believes that Mitnick may be using the information to change 
identities, to wreak havoc on other's lives or for some type of monetary gain. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Mitnick allegedly gained access to a Bay Area man's records and 
used information in the file in an attempt to change his health care provider 
so that he could benefit from the man's medical coverage. He also allegedly 
used the information to take on the identity of the man's dead son to obtain a 
phony driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very scary," Madison said. "You don't want him in your records."

SLAVKIN ELECTED HEAD OF L.A. SCHOOL BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first speech as the new president of the Los Angeles Board of 
Education, Mark Slavkin set some lofty goals Monday that targeted all the right 
political groups in the massive school system. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants a speedy and fair contract settlement with the teachers and other 
employee unions. He wants the school system to be more accountable for student 
achievement and more responsive to parents. He wants the central bureaucracy 
streamlined and more efficient. He wants earthquake-damaged campuses quickly 
repaired in the West San Fernando Valley -- an area he represents. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in a family of political activists, Slavkin at age 18 co-chaired a 
statewide campaign to enlist student support for the Jimmy Carter-Walter 
Mondale ticket. While an aide to county Supervisor Ed Edelman, he was elected 
to the school board in an upset victory in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 After placing a humbling fourth in a bid for the Democratic nomination to an 
Assembly seat last month, Slavkin turned his ambitions to the board presidency. 
He wanted it badly, his colleagues say, and worked behind the scenes to secure 
the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the largely ceremonial position on a unanimous vote at a 
brief board meeting Monday morning attended by his parents, his wife and his 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year term, which pays the standard $24,000 board salary, could have 
some long-term political ramifications for Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a very important opportunity to bring my leadership skills to the 
district and to the board," he said. "I am committed to serving this entire 
year as president of the board. I can't imagine anything that will come up 
between now and then that will change that." 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein put it this way: "It is 
clear that taking over this role at this moment will define his future. He'll 
either rise to the occasion or if he doesn't, it could be the end of his 
political career." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, believed at 32 to be the youngest board president, takes over from 
Leticia Quezada, the first Latina to hold the job. Quezada's formal style and 
strained relations with the powerful teachers union are in stark contrast to 
Slavkin's more easy-going, self-confident approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as a quick study with a good grasp of the issues facing the school 
district, he takes over as the board's chief front person, a potentially touchy 
job as Supt. Sid Thompson and the board push reforms on the schools. At the 
same time, Slavkin represents what may be the district's most vocal sets of 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin's district, which stretches from Porter Ranch in the northwest Valley 
to Los Angeles International Airport, includes hotbeds of parent activism in 
the northwest Valley and on the Westside. While Quezada had a small piece of 
the Valley, Slavkin is the first board president to represent a sizable chunk 
of the area since former board member Roberta Weintraub held the job in 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's effort to break up the massive school system was centered in his 
area of the Valley. Thousands of parents there and on the Westside participated 
in the new open enrollment policy and still others have aggressively pushed for 
school calendar changes so students could avoid going to class during the hot 
summer months. Campuses in that area also sustained the most damage in the Jan. 
17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 With his election as board president, Slavkin says the Valley still will get 
his attention. "By the nature of my district, I have that perspective," said 
Slavkin, who lives on the Westside. "The people I represent call and write and 
meet with me. I'm well aware of their concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his biggest and most immediate challenges will be contract negotiations. 
The teachers union is seeking restoration of a 10% pay cut imposed last year. 
Slavkin, who has enjoyed mostly favorable relations with the union since 
members campaigned and contributed to his first election, says he intends to 
ask that every account be reviewed to help restore employees' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will certainly not hear me say: 'There's no money and we can't do 
anything,' " Slavkin said. "The question will be how much and will it be 
acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 With a threat of a teachers strike vote looming, Slavkin said he hopes to have 
contract talks concluded by the beginning of the school year in September. He 
said he hopes to avoid the typically protracted, bitter contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that is very divisive and very damaging," Slavkin said. "People are 
really tired of it. Employees are really tired. Parents are scared . . . 
there's great anxiety and great frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said she welcomes a good, fair offer to teachers before school 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mark can get them (the board) organized and get their priorities straight, 
he could be a hero," Bernstein said. "It's a matter of will."

NEIGHBORS WELCOME LIBRARY'S REOPENING; NORTHRIDGE: COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE 
COMFORTED BY ROBUST RECOVERY OF 50,000-BOOK BRANCH. SOME RETURN BOOKS DUE JAN 
17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another piece of the Northridge neighborhood puzzle was put back in place 
Monday when the neighborhood branch library reopened nearly six months after 
being severely damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake centered just a few blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, life at the library resumed Monday as if it had never been 
disrupted by the quake: Johnathan Joo came to read some magazines; Mark Watkins 
stopped off to look for the name of an attorney; the members of the Reno family 
returned an armload of books that were due the day of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of the temblor's mess, which sent tiles tumbling from the 
ceiling, overhead lights crashing onto tables in the children's section and 
books and shelves spilling onto the library's linoleum floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad it's back," said Patricia Reno, with daughters Anna, 12, Sarah, 10 
and Theresa, 9, in tow. "There's nowhere else to go really that's nearby." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reno family had come to turn in the books, 14 in all, that had come due on 
the third Monday in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard that it was going to open back up today on the radio, so we decided 
we should probably turn our books in," she said. "I don't think they'll fine us 
for turning them in late." 
</P>
<P>
 Not a chance, a clerk assured her and the family handed over the books and 
went off to find some more. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-timers ran into each other, exchanging greetings and earthquake stories. 
Though the branch is neither the city's biggest nor its busiest, neighbors and 
employees alike said the 50,000-book repository is as much a part of the 
neighborhood as the strip malls and Cal State Northridge, just a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people come in every day," said Carmen Lofrano, the reference librarian 
who has worked at the branch for 22 years. "And we know each other by name. 
That's one of the good things about being someplace a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, Lofrano said, he came by the branch and was stunned by 
the apparent damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked through the window and it was a mess," he said. "Every single book I 
could see was on the floor. It was depressing. . . . Especially for me, having 
worked here for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which cost FEMA and the city $110,000 to repair, had no 
structural damage, however. And the cost included a new carpet and the 
library's first paint job in 19 years, Lofrano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other quake-damaged libraries in the San Fernando Valley remain 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 City branch libraries in Canoga Park, North Hollywood, Chatsworth, Granada 
Hills and Woodland Hills remain closed due to earthquake damage, but are 
scheduled to reopen in the next three or four months. 
</P>
<P>
 University officials say CSUN's Oviatt Library will reopen in the fall.

WOMAN FALLS VICTIM TO 24K CON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Higinia Perez, 72, thought she could do a good deed and at the same time make 
some easy money, almost $20,000, in an afternoon. But this widow, who lives on 
Social Security, got caught in a cruel con job, officials say, a new spin on a 
time-worn ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, she lost her meager savings and her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "God punished me for taking out the money," Perez said tearfully, in Spanish, 
in an interview Monday. Her daughter -- one of nine children -- translated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was because I was thinking of the $20,000," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her saga began last Wednesday, when she was leaving the K mart at the 
intersection of Soledad Canyon and Bouquet Canyon roads in Valencia at about 
noon. Perez was approached by a man who appeared to be about 40, she said. He 
told her his son had been struck by an automobile and was badly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very sad, crying," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was carrying three metal bars, each with "24K" etched into them. These 
"gold" bars, he told her, had fallen from the car during the accident. He was 
hoping to find the driver and trade them for money needed to help pay his son's 
medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man approached and, upon hearing the story, suggested he could sell 
one of the bars to K mart, Perez said. This second man said he knew an employee 
there who could help make the deal happen. 
</P>
<P>
 This second man walked into the store with one of the bars and returned a few 
minutes later with a large envelope full of cash, she said. The store had paid 
him $20,000 for the bar, he said, but couldn't buy the others until an armored 
truck arrived with more cash at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The first man said he couldn't wait that long. The second man offered to buy a 
bar for $10,000 and brought the cash from a nearby building he said was his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The second man encouraged Perez to get in on the deal, Perez said. The first 
man said he would accept whatever she could pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who became a widow 30 years ago and raised her children mostly on her 
own, saw a chance to make the money she needed to pay off her car loan and help 
her children financially. 
</P>
<P>
 But her daughter, Maria Golomb, said her mother had also been moved by the 
man's story. Perez had taught her children to help the less fortunate whenever 
possible, Golomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez drove the men to her bank, where she withdrew $300 from her checking 
account, and then to her home where she gave them her $500 in emergency cash. 
She also gathered various pieces of jewelry she had to bolster the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I was thinking at that point," Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the K mart parking lot, the two men got out. The second one arranged 
to meet her there at 4 p.m. so that they could go into the store together and 
sell their bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the lot at the appointed time, she waited. At 4:30 p.m., she went 
into the store alone and told her story to the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "The manager patted her on the back and said, 'You've been robbed,' " Golomb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her metal bar, now being held by sheriff's deputies as evidence, is likely 
brass, she was told by the deputies. Both men are at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar schemes, known as "pigeon drops," occur regularly in Southern 
California, according to law enforcement officials. The perpetrators of these 
crimes most often target the elderly.

 "They are aware that these people . . . may have some money stashed away in 
savings," said Lt. Tom Pigott, head of the detective bureau at the Antelope 
Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Santa Clarita Valley residents have been swindled in recent years, he 
said, sometimes out of thousands of dollars in similar schemes. On several 
occasions, Pigott said, people have paid a person who claims to have a winning 
lottery ticket he or she can't legally redeem. 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplice often participates as a "bystander," offering to become partners 
with the victim in buying the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's children are helping her replace the money she lost in the scheme. And 
although the swindle has shaken her, she gives thanks that the men who took her 
money did not physically harm her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having trouble sleeping, not from what I've lost," Perez said, "but the 
feeling that the things that happened to me could have been much worse."

SLAVKIN SETS LOFTY GOALS AS LEADER OF L.A. SCHOOL BOARD; EDUCATION: HE AIMS AT 
QUICK CONTRACT SETTLEMENT WITH TEACHERS AND REPAIRS TO QUAKE-DAMAGED SCHOOLS. A 
UNION LEADER SAYS THE ROLE WILL MAKE OR BREAK HIS FUTURE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first speech Monday as the new president of the Los Angeles Board of 
Education, Mark Slavkin set some lofty goals that targeted all the right 
political groups in the massive school system. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants a speedy and fair contract settlement with the teachers and other 
employee unions. He wants the school system to be more accountable for student 
achievement and more responsive to parents. He wants the central bureaucracy 
streamlined and more efficient. He wants earthquake-damaged campuses quickly 
repaired in the west San Fernando Valley -- an area he represents. 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, a graduate of Los Angeles public schools, is nothing if not a 
politician. Raised in a family of political activists, he is a former political 
aide who was elected to the school board in an upset victory over an incumbent 
in 1989. He co-chaired a statewide campaign to enlist student support for the 
Carter-Mondale presidential ticket at the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 After placing a humiliating fourth in a bid for the Democratic nomination to 
the state Assembly last month, Slavkin turned his ambitions to the board 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted it badly, his colleagues say, and worked behind the scenes to secure 
the votes. He was elected unanimously to the largely ceremonial position at a 
brief board meeting Monday morning attended by his parents, his wife and his 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year term, which pays the same $24,000 board salary, could have 
long-term political ramifications for Slavkin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a very important opportunity to bring my leadership skills to the 
district and to the board," he said. "I am committed to serving this entire 
year as president of the board. I can't imagine anything that will come up 
between now and then that will change that." 
</P>
<P>
 United Teachers-Los Angeles President Helen Bernstein put it this way: "It is 
clear that taking over this role at this moment will define his future. He'll 
either rise to the occasion or if he doesn't, it could be the end of his 
political career." 
</P>
<P>
 Slavkin, believed to be the youngest board president at 32, takes over from 
Leticia Quezada, the first Latina to hold the job. Quezada's formal style and 
strained relations with the powerful teachers union contrasts starkly with 
Slavkin's more easygoing, self-confident approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as a quick study with a good grasp of the issues facing the school 
district, he takes over as the board's point man, a potentially touchy job as 
Supt. Sid Thompson and the board push reforms on the schools. At the same time, 
he represents what may be the district's most vocal parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of the voters Slavkin's board district, which stretches from 
Porter Ranch in the northwest Valley to the Los Angeles International Airport 
in Westchester, live north of Mulholland Drive. While Quezada had a small piece 
of the Valley, Slavkin is the first board president to represent a sizable 
portion of the area since former board member Roberta Weintraub held the job in 
1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's effort to break up the massive school system was centered there. 
Thousands of parents participated in the new open-enrollment policy and still 
others have aggressively pushed for school calendar changes so students could 
avoid going to class during the hot summer months. Campuses in the area also 
sustained the most damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With his elevation to board president, Slavkin says the Valley will continue 
to get his attention. "By the nature of my district, I have that perspective," 
said Slavkin, who lives in West Los Angeles. "The people I represent call and 
write and meet with me. I'm well aware of their concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 And he will be watched. "We will continue to invite him to meetings, offer our 
advice to him," said Harriet Sculley, president of the 31st District Parent 
Teacher Student Assn., which covers the Valley. "It's a prestigious position 
and we will make an effort to keep in touch with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Julie Korenstein, whose district makes up a large portion of the 
Valley, said she believes Slavkin will be "spread thin" and hopes he will be 
able to maintain his efforts to serve the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's going to be tough," Korenstein said. "It's always a greater 
responsibility being board president, and his district is so large. It's a 
tough district to take care of. I hope he'll be able to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his biggest and most immediate challenges will be contract negotiations. 
The teachers union is seeking restoration of a 10% pay cut imposed last year. 
Slavkin, who has enjoyed mostly favorable relations with the union since 
members campaigned for him and contributed to his first election in 1989, says 
he intends to ask that every account be reviewed to help restore employees' 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will certainly not hear me say, 'There's no money and we can't do 
anything,' " Slavkin said. "The question will be, how much and will it be 
acceptable?" 
</P>
<P>
 With the threat of a teachers strike vote looming, Slavkin said he hopes to 
have contract talks concluded by the beginning of the school year in September. 
He said he hopes to avoid the typically protracted, bitter contract disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that is very divisive and very damaging," Slavkin said. "People are 
really tired of it. Employees are really tired. Parents are scared. . . . 
There's great anxiety and great frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said she would welcome a good, fair offer to teachers before school 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mark can get (the board) organized and get their priorities straight, he 
could be a hero," Bernstein said. "It's a matter of will."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; LIBRARY 
BRANCH DAMAGED IN EARTHQUAKE REOPENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city branch library in Northridge reopened Monday, nearly six 
months after the Jan. 17 earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our patrons are very happy that we're open," said reference librarian Carmen 
Lofrano."It's wonderful to be back again. It's like being reborn."  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the repairs, workers also installed quake-resistant ceilings and light 
fixtures and added more electrical outlets and upgrades to accommodate modern 
library technology. The library also got carpeting and was repainted for the 
first time since 1975. Shelves were bolted to the floor to prevent them from 
toppling in another temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will be open from 12:30 to 8 p.m. on Mondays and Wednesdays, 10 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Tuesdays and Saturdays, and 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. on 
Thursdays and Fridays.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth library will reopen later this month, and branches in Granada 
Hills, Woodland Hills and North Hollywood will be back in service in August.  
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills library was hit particularly hard. It sustained serious 
structural damage and required a new roof and ceiling. About 25,000 children's 
books were destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
 The North Hollywood regional library and Los Feliz branch also remain closed 
because of quake damage. A library spokesman did not know when repairs would be 
completed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
WITH EYE ON CAPITOL, REED ASKS DELAY IN COUNTY CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing uncertainty over pending legislation in Sacramento, Los Angeles County 
Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed is recommending that potentially 
devastating budget cuts in law enforcement and other programs be delayed until 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 That recommendation and other revisions are contained in new budget documents 
released Monday, just two days before the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to 
begin hammering out a final spending plan for its $14.7-billion fiscal 1994-95 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed's new budget projections contain good and bad news for the county. On the 
plus side, state and county officials have reached a tentative agreement that 
could free up more than $530 million in health-related funds, which would 
essentially maintain services levels in the Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Reed projects that the county will still face a $300-million 
shortfall that would require deep cuts in public safety programs, including the 
offices of the sheriff, district attorney and Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on whether the county can push through legislation that would 
relieve it of having to spend fixed amounts for certain health care programs -- 
money that could be used to reduce the impact of budget cuts planned for other 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the county will pursue the changes when the Legislature reconvenes 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Reed proposes to use various board reserves to keep several 
departments going, including $6.9 million for Children's Services, $2.8 million 
for the Museum of Natural History, $8.1 million for Parks and Recreation, $4.8 
million for the county assessor's office and $5 million to maintain service 
levels for the next six months at county libraries.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FIRE 
DEPARTMENT TO APPEAL RULING ON PLAYBOY BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department will appeal a judge's ruling that it is 
unconstitutional for the department to forbid firefighters to read Playboy 
magazine at work, a regulation meant to discourage sexism in firehouses.  
</P>
<P>
 Les Tolnai, a senior deputy county counsel who last month unsuccessfully 
defended in court the Fire Department's right to enforce the ban, said he filed 
the notice of appeal Monday with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials banned possession of Playboy and other magazines 
featuring pictures of nude or skimpily dressed women from all work locations in 
1992 in an effort to prevent a "sexually charged environment" for the 
department's 11 women firefighters, who work with about 2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-day trial last month, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson issued 
an order barring the county from enforcing the ban on Fire Department Capt. 
Steven W. Johnson, who brought a lawsuit challenging the policy.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES AIRPORT; 
LNG-BURNING SHUTTLE FLEET BEGINS OPERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's first airport shuttle bus fleet powered by clean-burning 
liquefied natural gas began operating Monday at Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials have taken delivery of the first three of 14 new LNG-powered 
shuttle buses.The rest of the fleet will be delivered over the next couple of 
months. The buses will transport passengers between airport parking lots and 
the airline terminals.  
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Airports operates a fleet of 46 shuttle buses and plans 
to add additional liquefied natural gas buses over the next few years until its 
entire fleet is replaced.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, airport officials awarded Southern California Gas a contract to build 
and operate California's first LNG refueling station. The Department of 
Airports leases the station at $8,000 per month, with fuel costing 67 cents per 
gallon.  
</P>
<P>
 The refueling facility, located on airport property adjacent to a remote 
parking lot on Jenny Drive near Westchester Parkway, is a temporary station to 
be used until a facility can be built. Its two tanks have a total storage 
capacity of 10,500 gallons.  
</P>
<P>
 The fuel, which is super-chilled to minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit through 
cryogenics, will be brought in by tanker truck from Shute Creek, Wyo.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN FALLS INTO CON 
ARTISTS' TRAP BY LURE OF 'GOLD' AND A GOOD DEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By MARK SABBATINI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Higinia Perez, 72, thought she could do a good deed and at the same time make 
almost $20,000. But the widow, who lives on Social Security, got caught in a 
cruel con job, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, she lost her meager savings and her jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "God punished me for taking out the money," Perez said tearfully, in Spanish. 
Her daughter -- one of nine children -- translated. 
</P>
<P>
 Her story began Wednesday as she was leaving a K mart in Valencia about noon. 
Perez was approached by a man who appeared to be about 40 years old, she said. 
He told her his son had been struck by a car and was badly injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was carrying three metal bars, each with "24K" etched into them. These 
"gold" bars, he told her, had fallen from the car during the accident. He was 
hoping to find the driver and trade them for money needed to help pay his son's 
medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man approached and upon hearing the story, suggested he that could 
sell one of the bars to K mart, Perez said. This second man walked into the 
store with one of the bars and returned with an envelope full of cash, she 
said. The store had paid him $20,000 for the bar, he said, but could not buy 
the others until an armored truck arrived with more cash at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The first man said he could not wait that long. The second man offered to buy 
a bar for $10,000 and brought the cash from a nearby building he said was his 
office. The second man encouraged Perez to get in on the deal. The first man 
said he would accept whatever she could pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez saw a chance to make the money she needed to pay off her car loan and 
help her children financially. Plus, she could help the man with the medical 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez drove the men to her bank. She withdrew $300 from her checking account 
and then gave them $500 in household emergency cash. She also handed over 
various pieces of jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the K mart parking lot, the two men got out. The second one arranged 
to meet her there at 4 p.m. When nobody came, she went into the store and told 
her story to the manager. He told her she had been robbed, and she contacted 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Her metal bar probably is brass, she was told by sheriff's deputies. Both men 
are at large. MARK SABBATINI

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; AIRLINE 
AGREES TO GROUND PLANE IN SEARCH FOR CAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tower Air agreed Monday to ground one of its planes for 24 hours to let a 
distraught owner of a 3-year-old cat search for the animal. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat's owner, Carol Ann Timmel, said the animal, named Tabitha, escaped 
from a kennel in the cargo hold of a New York-to-Los Angeles flight June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower agreed to ground the plane for 24 hours, starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday 
through 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, Timmel's lawyer Donald David said. The airline 
acted after being threatened with a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Dowling, a Tower spokeswoman, said Nick Lacey, the airline's vice 
president of operations, plans to meet Kimmel at New York's John F. Kennedy 
Airport after the plane arrives from Los Angeles late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to let this be basically her search. We're really hoping we will 
find the cat but it's been 11 or 12 days and the chances of finding her are 
diminished," Dowling said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tabitha is approximately the size of two tea cups and the plane is 
approximately the size of a football field," Timmel told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmel, 20, an actress who had just moved to Los Angeles from New York, said 
she would look for "as long as it takes" to find the feline.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BRADY BUNCH COMES BACK TO ITS ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's squeaky-cleanest family, the Brady Bunch, is back in 
town. But home never seemed so foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that their North Hollywood house has been replicated on a lot at 
Paramount Studios because the one used in the early 1970s TV series has been 
altered. Or that no one else drives a mud-brown station wagon any more. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the people in the Valley who've really changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, groovy chick," actor Christopher Barnes, who plays Greg Brady in the 
upcoming film, said to a politically correct high school girl of the '90s on 
the set at Taft High School Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I look like a yellow, fuzzy, baby bird to you?" the young actress asked, 
giving Barnes the brush-off. 
</P>
<P>
 The filming of a loosely adapted version of "The Brady Bunch" for the big 
screen -- taking place around the Valley until early September -- includes 
dozens of such scenes in which the archetypal Bradys, who haven't changed in 
two decades, collide with contemporary culture. 
</P>
<P>
 At a butcher shop in Northridge, a friend asks Carol Brady if she is "still 
eating red meat." Greg and Marcia are approached by a would-be carjacker at a 
mini-mall in Canoga Park, but can't understand what the man wants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a North Hollywood alley, a neighbor plotting against the Bradys describes 
the family to an accomplice: "Polite, trustworthy, still believe in the good of 
humanity. Real freaks of nature." 
</P>
<P>
 The TV series first aired on ABC from 1969 to 1974, featuring the late Robert 
Reed and Florence Henderson as Mr. and Mrs. Brady. There were also the six kids 
and Alice, the maid. 
</P>
<P>
 Reruns of the series are still shown, and the show has recently inspired a 
stage production, several books, a collection of vintage songs by the Brady 
kids and a cult following of mostly retro-fashion twentysomethings. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, scheduled for release in early 1995, puts the Valley family in the 
role of a walking museum piece. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's who they are: Middle America 20 years ago," said co-producer Jenno 
Topping. "But they're totally oblivious to the fact that everything has 
changed, and now they're different from everybody else. The mushy part is when 
the movie sort of yearns for the Bradys' naivete." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol and Mike Brady are played by Shelley Long and Gary Cole, and the roles 
of the children are filled by lesser-known actors cast largely for their 
likenesses to the originals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still the same Marcia," said Christine Taylor, who plays the oldest Brady 
girl. "Wide-eyed, innocent. I'm the Valley Girl of the '70s." KURT PITZER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GM PLANT TABBED FOR 'RECOVERY AREA' PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council panel gave a preliminary go-ahead Monday for the 
inclusion of the vacant General Motors plant in Panorama City in a proposed 
"recovery area" that would use property taxes to pay for improvements around 
the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district includes the 
plant, the Housing and Community Redevelopment Committee instructed the city 
Community Redevelopment Agency to draft plans to put the empty plant within a 
recovery area, which is similar to a redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery area must still be approved by the full City Council. But because 
the proposal is supported by Alarcon, its approval is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel instructed the CRA to draft plans for recovery areas in the 
neighborhoods hardest hit by the Northridge quake, and Alarcon said he wanted 
to make sure the GM plant was included in such a zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Under disaster provisions of the state's redevelopment laws, the CRA can use 
property taxes from recovery areas to bankroll bond measures that can be used 
for public improvements in that community or to provide loans to quake victims. 
An aide to Alarcon said the recovery area can also pay for improvements in the 
nearby crime-plagued Blythe Street neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal was blasted by longtime CRA critics who said the recovery 
area proposal will just allow redevelopment officials to use eminent domain 
powers to condemn homes and businesses. "When you recover, you don't recover by 
taking everybody's homes and businesses away," said CRA critic Howard Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said that under recovery area guidelines, redevelopment 
officials can only use eminent domain proceedings in limited circumstances.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: RED CROSS MOUNTS BONE MARROW DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For thousands of people across the country with leukemia and other blood 
diseases, the chance of finding a life-saving bone marrow donor can be as 
little as one in 100. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 17-year-old Lisa Mederos, the odds are closer to one in a million. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Mederos' illness -- a potentially fatal type of anemia -- that makes 
her chances so slim. It's her ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike blood, which can be matched across ethnic lines, bone marrow is more 
likely to match if the donor and patient have the same racial makeup. According 
to the American Red Cross, which runs a nationwide blood marrow donation 
program, only about 6% of the 1 million people in the program are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 To boost the odds of finding a donor for Mederos, who lives in Alhambra, and 
the 9,000 other critically ill people awaiting a marrow transplant, the Red 
Cross will hold a marrow testing drive July 24 in Sun Valley. The effectiveness 
of replacing diseased marrow varies greatly from patient to patient, but 
according to the Red Cross, a transplant increases the odds of long-term 
survival from less than 20% to between 45% and 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors must be between the ages of 18 and 55 and in good health. The Red Cross 
first conducts a simple blood test to determine the donor's tissue type. When a 
match is made, the donor undergoes additional tests.  
</P>
<P>
 Blood testing will be held from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at Our Lady of Holy Rosary 
Church, 7800 Vineland Ave., Sun Valley. For information call (800) 627-7692.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; LAPD BOMB SQUAD MAKES HOUSE CALL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeowner whose friend left a solid block of dynamite, plastic explosives 
and a detonation cord with him before taking a vacation called Los Angeles 
police Monday and had the materials removed from his house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's bomb squad removed the 
explosives from a home in the 13700 block of Wyandotte Avenue about 11:30 a.m., 
said Sgt. Brett Papworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently someone from Desert Storm brought it home and gave it to a friend 
to hold for him," said Detective John Mattingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The friend looked at it and didn't know what it was and when he discovered 
they were explosives, he called the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from the bomb squad removed the explosives from the home and rendered 
them safe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not identify the homeowner or his friend, Mattingly said. 
</P>
<P>
 One bomb squad officer, who was not identified, said that solid TNT is usually 
stable unless it's exposed to extreme heat or direct flame. CHIP JOHNSON

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FIRE DEPARTMENT ADDS 19 RECRUITS

<P>
 The Burbank Fire Department has hired 19 probationary firefighters, its 
largest group of recruits ever, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the recruits must still complete a 10-week course before becoming 
full-fledged firefighters.If they pass, the new hires will replace the 
department's retiring firefighters and alleviate the overtime required of other 
firefighters, Battalion Chief Mario Gagnon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason (the recruitment class) is so large is we had cutbacks a few years 
back," he said. "We lost six firefighters' positions, so we were able to get 
these positions back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The service will be the same, but there will be less wear and tear on our 
firefighters." 
</P>
<P>
 The department presently has 122 firefighters, Gagnon said. With some 
retirements expected soon, the department will be up to 133 after the recruits 
complete training. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Onion, the Sepulveda Unitarian Universalist 
Society, 9550 Haskell Ave., North Hills. The panel topic, "How to Prevent: 
Carjacking, Car Theft, Burglary, Drug Dealing, Armed Robberies and Rape," will 
be lead by Les Lovatt, senior lead officer of the Devonshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is invited to the event. Admission and parking are free. For more 
information, call (818) 894-9251.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; NO DAMAGE REPORTED FOLLOWING TEMBLORS

<P>
 Three short but sharp aftershocks from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
rattled homes in Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley late Sunday and early 
Monday, but officials said no injuries or damage were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The first aftershock, a magnitude 3.6, hit at 11:49 p.m. Sunday, according to 
seismologist Jim Mori at Caltech in Pasadena.It was followed by a 3.7 jolt a 
minute later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mori said both quakes were centered 3 miles southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The third aftershock, a magnitude 2.6, was centered two miles southeast of 
Simi Valley and hit Monday morning at 8:57 a.m., Caltech officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said the city received no 
damage reports after the trio of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's become almost routine," Sedell said. "People say, 'Did you feel it?' but 
that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
 No damage was reported in the San Fernando Valley, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Federal Emergency Management Agency office in Simi Valley, spokeswoman 
Pamela Korneisel said she had heard of no damage, but that residents tend to 
wait a while before asking for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually we'll start to see people coming in later," Korneisel said. MARY F.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; ARTISTS PITCH IN FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As she struggles to patch together enough loans and grants to rebuild her 
quake-damaged home, Conejo Valley artist Michele Weston Relkin has a new source 
to draw from: the generosity of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Donated works by local painters, sculptors and jewelry makers sold well at a 
recent silent auction fund-raiser for Relkin, bringing in nearly $2,000.More 
money will come in throughout the month as Relkin's gallery will donate 20% of 
the sales price of any item to her building fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good turnout for the auction -- it was just a real positive thing," 
organizer Phyllis Doyon said. "We'll say it's a success because any money for 
Michele's building fund is a big help to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Turned down for a loan from the Small Business Administration, Relkin is still 
waiting for word from the Individual Family Grant Program and the Thousand Oaks 
City Council, which will give out federal funds to earthquake victims this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 While she waits, Relkin said the $2,000 will help her hire engineers to begin 
evaluating her house's condition. "It was really heartwarming to see everyone 
there, I'll tell you that," she said. "I think this will be a turning point." 
</P>
<P>
 Relkin's Gallery 9, situated in the Hamburger Hamlet Plaza on Agoura Road, is 
open from 1 to 9 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, from noon to 9 p.m. Saturdays and 
from noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. STEPHANIE SIMON

OFFICERS WITHOUT OFFICES; DECENTRALIZATION MAY HELP SCHOOL POLICE, WHO OFTEN GO 
TO EXTREMES TO DO BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles school police officers assigned to the San Fernando Valley, West 
Los Angeles and Harbor areas are nomads. 
</P>
<P>
 They use their cars, local schools with understanding staffs, parking lots and 
even restaurants to conduct the normal business of campus policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some change into their uniforms in their cars, others drive an hour to pick up 
a patrol car to begin their shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that could change. Under a new effort to decentralize the Los Angeles 
Unified School District's police department, three new offices are scheduled to 
open to alleviate the officers' inconveniences and to bring services closer to 
the schools. The police finally could have a place to write reports and 
interview suspects and witnesses. And they won't have to drive Downtown to 
school district headquarters to complete paperwork or training sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had officers dressing in their cars, holding briefings in the parking 
lot," said Sgt. Randolph Glymph, who is assigned to the Valley. "We really need 
a place out here to conduct business. It would be a much more efficient way of 
dealing with the schools and taking care of business." 
</P>
<P>
 The school police department's efforts are twofold: first, to restructure 
operations from the Downtown district headquarters, and second, to give 
officers and other police employees a more visible and more effective place to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes no sense for a West L.A. officer or detective to drive Downtown and 
then turn around and go to West L.A.," said school district Police Chief Wes 
Mitchell. "The officers also need a sense of connectedness. There is a real 
sense of loneliness out there -- their bosses are 30 or 40 minutes away." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said his department has received the go-ahead and will soon submit a 
plan for the location and funding of the new offices to Supt. Sid Thompson. The 
department expects to have space by next year. Additionally, Mitchell said, the 
school police need a more visible presence throughout the school district. For 
example, he would like to find space in the district's Van Nuys regional 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officers are constantly driving Downtown to school district 
headquarters to submit reports and attend meetings. The sergeants and 
detectives are Downtown at least once a week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley, the officers park their patrol cars at the district's Sun 
Valley garage, where the transportation department keeps school buses and a 
bungalow. The officers recently were granted permission to use the office for 
their morning roll call, but bus drivers also use the space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only allowed to share it for those few minutes," Glymph said. "Bus 
drivers are walking through, supervisors. There's no locker room. It's just not 
ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Police department clerical staffers for the Valley and other areas of the city 
all work out of the district's offices at 450 N. Grand Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, the situation is worse, police say. There, the district has 
no place to park school police cars and no office space at all. The officers 
meet at schools and Downtown, and the Los Angeles Police Department sometimes 
loans the department space. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Harbor area, the department has a small office, but officers say it is 
inconveniently located in the southern part of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The police say they need central locations to meet with suspects and 
witnesses, and they typically do not want to interview the students in LAPD 
stations. "That's not always the environment we want to be in with these kids," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is embarking on a massive restructuring, shifting from 
top-down decision making. The school system will be reorganized into clusters 
and complexes of schools with reduced layers of district administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The police department's efforts are in keeping with the overall district 
philosophy, officials said. "It's definitely consistent with what we're trying 
to do," said Assistant Supt. Dan Isaacs, who oversees the district's school 
operations division. "We're all trying to bring services closer to the school 
sites."

FEDERAL AGENCIES EXTEND DEADLINE FOR QUAKE AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With requests for assistance still pouring in at a rate of 500 a day six 
months after the Northridge earthquake, federal emergency officials Monday 
extended the deadline to apply for disaster aid to Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still getting, believe it or not, a good number of applications from 
people who have legitimate disaster-related problems," said Frank Kishton, 
coordinating officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Monday, government agencies had received 594,430 requests for assistance 
-- nearly double the previous record set after Hurricane Hugo. The federal 
government has allocated nearly $12 billion for the recovery effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the deadline also was extended because of nearly 300,000 
applications issued but yet to be returned for U.S. Small Business 
Administration loans. The deadline applies to FEMA grants and SBA loans except 
economic injury loans, for which the deadline is Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has sent out 368,860 checks for emergency home repairs or rental 
assistance. The SBA has approved 87,000 business and home loans. And the state 
Department of Social Services has awarded 85,200 grants for replacing "basic 
necessities," such as lost dentures and damaged appliances. The state also has 
received 381 requests for grants to pay funeral expenses for quake victims and 
has paid for the funerals of 117 people. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,600 relief checks have been returned -- either voluntarily or on 
demand from FEMA. Some checks were returned because another member of the same 
household applied and received aid or private insurance covered the damage. 
Officials could not immediately say how many checks were returned because of 
suspected fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also reported that they have received only 2,851 requests for 
earthquake retrofitting funds. Disaster officials had sent out 250,000 letters 
offering up to $5,000 in earthquake retrofitting funds to homeowners who file 
applications for less than $10,000 in federal assistance to repair their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping we'd get a better response," Kishton said. "We've got to figure 
out a better way to market mitigation."

COLLEGE DISTRICT MARKS ITS SILVER ANNIVERSARY; EDUCATION: FORMER BOARD MEMBERS, 
OTHER DIGNITARIES NOTE CHANGES IN ENROLLMENT, FINANCIAL STABILITY OF 
NINE-CAMPUS L.A. SYSTEM SINCE 1969. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The silver anniversary of the Los Angeles Community College District -- the 
world's largest -- proved to be a bittersweet celebration Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 As former board members and other dignitaries gathered to make tributes and 
swap memories in the district's new Downtown headquarters, it was pretty clear 
that times have changed, not always for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enjoyed a public generosity that we've not known since," Trustee Kenneth 
S. Washington observed wistfully during midday ceremonies marking the 25th 
anniversary of the district's formation in tumultuous but prosperous 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of both the original and current seven-member elected Board of 
Trustees that oversees the district -- and a high-ranking district 
administrator in between board stints -- Washington is extremely familiar with 
the contrasts between past and present.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a budget surplus then -- the biggest issue for the board to decide was 
where the line was between free speech and oppression," Washington said, 
recalling protests against the Vietnam War and other movements that rocked 
college campuses nationwide then. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, after taking a break to sip punch and sodas and sample the 
chocolate sheetcake in honor of the anniversary, trustees were expected to 
elected Washington to a one-year term as board president, a largely symbolic 
post that nonetheless represents a tribute to his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-college district, dependent on the recession-battered state 
government for about half its annual funding, has been forced to tighten its 
belt for several years in a row. The $316-million preliminary budget approved 
by trustees June 29 was based on the governor's proposed fee increase -- 
rejected by the Legislature -- and cuts in district administration.  
</P>
<P>
 The district also is wrestling with falling enrollment, which officials 
attribute to the state raising community college fees last year and to the Jan. 
17 Northridge earthquake. Officials estimate enrollment at about 100,000. When 
the district was formed, by separating from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, 92,000 students attended classes at eight colleges, but by 1981, 
enrollment reached 145,000.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other differences between then and now were highlighted in the round of 
speeches delivered by former board members -- including county Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich and city Controller Rick Tuttle -- and by David Mertes, chancellor 
of the 107-campus California Community Colleges system. Instruction was free in 
1969; now most students pay $13 a credit. A majority of students were white and 
fresh out of high school. Today, the average age is 30 and students reflect the 
diversity of Los Angeles -- 37% Latino, 26% white, 18% African American and 17% 
Asian American.  
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Lindsay Conner, who was 13 when the district was formed but whose 1981 
election makes him the longest-serving current board member, said he has seen 
the district go through "the highest of the highs" and "some of the lowest of 
the lows." 
</P>
<P>
 But because the colleges have provided a "second chance" over the years to 
more than 1 million students, Conner summed up the district's first 
quarter-century as "a great, turbulent success."

 The resolution opposing the project was proposed by the Burbank city staff and 
stems from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, which caused two breaks along a 
35-mile span of the Four Corners Pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 One break spilled oil into the Santa Clara River in Santa Clarita, killing 
vegetation and wildlife. The other, in a residential neighborhood in Mission 
Hills, resulted in a fire that injured one man, destroyed one home, damaged 
three others and burned 17 vehicles and numerous trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank city officials said they are concerned about the likelihood of another 
break with the proposed pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has other concerns about the pipeline. Fire Chief Mike Davis, 
who prepared the resolution for the city, said that once crude oil begins to 
spill, it is very difficult to stop. He said he would prefer that the company 
find other ways to transport the oil, such as by ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have environmental catastrophes," said Davis, "but we need to 
figure out ways to make them small ones. If the crude oil was transported by 
ship or ground tanker, the danger would not be so high." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem, according to Davis, is that pipelines designed to transport 
crude oil sometimes transport other materials. On Dec. 1, 1980, he said, a 
pipeline in Long Beach exploded. The cause was found to be naphtha, a flammable 
liquid the pipeline was carrying. Davis said he fears something similar might 
occur in Burbank should the pipeline be built.  
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles already has passed a resolution opposing the project 
and the city of Glendale is considering a similar action. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on the project will be made by the state Public Utilities 
Commission. JAMES ELMENDORF

WITNESS IDENTIFIES SUSPECT IN FATAL CARJACKING; CRIME: JAPANESE STUDENT 
TESTIFIES AT PRELIMINARY HEARING IN SLAYINGS OF TWO FRIENDS OUTSIDE SUPERMARKET 
IN SAN PEDRO. CASE DRAWS ATTENTION FROM JAPAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Japanese college student Monday identified murder suspect Raymond Oscar 
Butler as the man who confronted two fellow students in a supermarket parking 
lot last March and demanded the key to their Honda Civic just before they were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Masake Miyake, 21, testifying at a preliminary hearing in Long Beach Criminal 
Court, said he and a friend in a separate car witnessed an altercation before 
the execution-style murders of Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, on March 
25.  
</P>
<P>
 The case brought protests from Japan last March about violence and lawlessness 
in Los Angeles, prompting President Clinton to express condolences to families 
of the victims. The hearing Monday was covered by Japanese newspaper, wire 
service and television reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, 19, is charged with two counts of murder with the special 
circumstances of murder during a robbery and multiple murder. The defendant, 
who has pleaded not guilty, could face the death penalty if bound over for 
trial and convicted. He also faces robbery and carjacking charges. Co-defendant 
Alberto Reygoza, 20, pleaded no contest last week to receiving stolen property 
and being an accessory after the fact of a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyake said he and a friend, Mari Kaneko, had eaten that evening at a Japanese 
restaurant in Gardena with Ito and Matsuura. All four were Marymount College 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, they drove in two cars to the parking lot of Ralphs supermarket 
in San Pedro, Miyake said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ito and Matsuura pulled into the parking lot in Ito's white Honda Civic, a 
man emerged from the darkness and accosted Ito, Miyake said. "The person 
holding Mr. Ito might have been drunk," Miyake said, adding: "He was holding a 
beer or something that contains alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by Deputy Dist. Atty. Janet Moore if he recognized the assailant in the 
courtroom, Miyake pointed at Butler and said: "That man there." 
</P>
<P>
 Miyake said that he could hear the man saying the word "key" several times in 
a loud voice. 
</P>
<P>
 As Miyake and Kaneko watched from Kaneko's car, the man put down the bottle 
and grabbed Ito by the shoulders, Miyake said. Kaneko honked her horn several 
times, then drove to the entrance of the supermarket to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
 Miyake said he heard three gunshots as he sat in front of the supermarket.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaneko, 20, told a similar story, but she could not identify Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that after Ito emerged from his car, the assailant tried to force him 
back into it. She said she heard the assailant use the word "shoot" several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaneko said she was seeking help from a supermarket employee when she heard 
the shots. She testified through an interpreter that she saw that Ito had 
fallen, then backed away from the supermarket's door to take cover.

MOM TESTIFIES IN CUMMINGS RETRIAL; CRIME: SHE TEARFULLY TELLS OF LOSING HER 
CHILD AS FORMER PTA PRESIDENT ONCE MORE FACES A JURY IN THE 1990 DEATH OF A 
BABY SHE WAS CARING FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her testimony occasionally interrupted by tears, Toni Majoy-Young recounted in 
Van Nuys Superior Court how she frantically drove her unconscious baby son to 
the hospital just hours after she'd left him at a baby-sitter's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was screaming at him the entire time I was in the car," Young told a jury 
on Monday. "I said, 'Kevin, wake up. It's Mom. Wake up! Wake up!' And he never 
did. He didn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young was the first witness to testify in the retrial of former PTA 
president Debra Suzanne Cummings, charged with second-degree murder in the 
death of 9-month-old Kevin Young, who lost consciousness while Cummings cared 
for him four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kevin had been teething and vomiting the previous two weeks, 
Majoy-Young recalled how happy he had seemed the night before he was 
hospitalized, playing with toys and balloons in the living room of their home. 
She said he was "alive and well" when she left him at Cummings' Reseda home the 
morning of June 15, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:30 p.m., Majoy-Young said, she was called away from work by Cummings, who 
said Kevin had had an accident and should be taken to his doctor. He died the 
next day in the intensive care unit of Valley Presbyterian Hospital, his skull 
fractured and his brain swelling from pressure caused by his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually pulled the plug at 5:15," Majoy-Young testified. Then she broke 
into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its emotional beginning, the trial is likely to focus on more clinical 
matters.  
</P>
<P>
 In their opening statements, Deputy Dist. Atty. Carol Fisch and defense 
attorney Tamar Rachel Toister indicated that expert medical testimony will play 
a crucial role in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisch said that the medical testimony and other circumstantial evidence will 
point to Cummings.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a circumstantial evidence case," Fisch told jurors. "Keep in mind 
that every piece of circumstantial evidence will throw a web around the 
defendant and prove her guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 But Toister told the jury that evidence will show that some of Kevin's 
injuries had already begun to heal, showing they were inflicted before Kevin 
was entrusted that day to Cummings, his regular baby-sitter. She added that 
experts have found that 90% of all child abuse happens at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense is going to be that this injury . . . did not occur at the hands 
of Debra Cummings," Toister said. "It did not occur at the home of Debra 
Cummings and it did not occur while Debra Cummings was the caretaker of this 
child." 
</P>
<P>
 Toister said that in some cases, symptoms of head injuries do not appear for 
hours, or even days. The presence of collagen -- knitting skin fibers -- near 
the injury, as well as chocolate-colored clotted blood, indicated an older 
injury, Toister said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisch argued, however, that doctors who examined Kevin before and immediately 
after his death found no evidence of older injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the back of his skull was fractured in two places and a large blood 
clot had formed under the fractures. His abdomen and intestines also were 
bruised, she said. Doctors will testify that the injuries appeared fresh, Fisch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cummings told police and Majoy-Young that Kevin apparently hit his head 
against a coffee table while playing with Cummings' 2-year-old nephew, the 
prosecutor said, but the prosecution's medical experts will testify that a fall 
against a coffee table could not cause such extensive injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoy-Young testified that when she arrived at Cummings' house, about 2:55 
p.m. and found her son unconscious, "I asked her what happened and she told me 
she didn't really know because she was in the kitchen making a bottle and 
didn't really see what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Cummings was holding Kevin against her left shoulder. She was too 
frightened to touch the boy herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't look like he was sleeping to me," Majoy-Young said. "He looked like 
something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that Cummings discouraged her from dialing 911, saying it would 
be quicker for Majoy-Young to drive Kevin to the hospital herself. Cummings 
strapped the unconscious child into his car seat, Majoy-Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical testimony begins today.  
</P>
<P>
 At Cummings' first trial two years ago, jurors deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of 
acquittal after eight days of contentious deliberations.

QUAKE-DAMAGED CHURCH VOTES TO REBUILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having collected nearly $70,000 in earthquake-relief donations, the small 
Congregational Church of Chatsworth has decided to repair its damaged building 
rather than close down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would really miss the people we've known for so long," said Darlene Libby, 
moderator, or lay leader, of the 51-member congregation, in explaining members' 
unanimous vote Sunday to stay. She and her husband have been members for 30 
years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $30,000 grant from the Southern California headquarters of its 
denomination, the United Church of Christ, and $39,000 donated by individuals 
and churches around the country, the already financially struggling church had 
the choice between rebuilding or razing the structure and selling the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake shattered most windows and ruptured the connections 
between the church roof and the 40-foot sanctuary walls. One wall is being 
propped up from the inside by large beams, said Marv Davis, a member of the 
rebuilding committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a low estimate of $70,000 and a high estimate of $100,000 to repair 
the church," said Davis, a founding member of the congregation in 1958. The 
cost may be on the high side if electrical lines embedded in the roof were 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not out of the woods yet," said Davis, who lives in Chatsworth. In 
addition to the repairs, the church still owes debts for an addition built on 
the preschool building a few years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to repair the church was good news for the Valley So-Mang 
Presbyterian Church, a Korean-American congregation that rents space there, and 
a thriving preschool operation that serves as many as 90 children. Meanwhile, 
all worship services are held in the preschool building on the church property 
at 20440 Lassen St. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jeff Utter, the congregation's pastor for only a year, volunteered to 
take a 20% pay cut this spring but the church voted to pay his full salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it helps a lot that our minister has such a warm personality and 
ideas on how to bring in younger people," said Libby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most members are 60 (years old) plus," said Gigi Pircher, who sent her child 
to the preschool and then joined the church. "It's a wonderful school, and I 
think it's great the congregation voted to keep going."

FLARE-UP IN THE FIGHT OVER PLAYBOY BAN; COURTS: FIRE DEPARTMENT WILL APPEAL A 
RULING THAT BARS IT FROM FORBIDDING FIREFIGHTERS TO READ MAGAZINE AT WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department will appeal a judge's ruling that it is 
unconstitutional for the department to forbid firefighters to read Playboy 
magazine at work, a regulation meant to discourage sexism in firehouses.  
</P>
<P>
 Les Tolnai, a senior deputy county counsel who last month unsuccessfully 
defended in court the Fire Department's right to enforce the ban, said he filed 
the notice of appeal Monday with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials banned possession of Playboy and other magazines 
featuring pictures of nude or skimpily dressed women from all work locations in 
1992 in an effort to prevent a "sexually charged environment" for the 
department's 11 women firefighters, who work with about 2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a one-day trial last month, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. 
Wilson issued an order barring the county from enforcing the ban on Fire Capt. 
Steven W. Johnson, who brought a lawsuit challenging the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Wilson found that county officials had failed to prove that 
quiet reading of Playboy contributes to a sexually harassing atmosphere. The 
judge also found that the ban placed severe limitations on Johnson's First 
Amendment right to freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beyond my wildest belief that the fire chief and the county would want 
to waste more taxpayers' dollars," said Johnson, after learning the county had 
filed the notice of appeal. "I don't think they've got a snowball's chance in 
hell of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolnai, the attorney for the county, said his office is still negotiating a 
possible compromise settlement with Johnson's attorneys. Johnson was 
represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether county officials will apply Judge Wilson's ruling to 
other magazines covered by the ban and not just Playboy, the only magazine he 
specifically mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 A county official had testified during the trial that the ban would also apply 
not only to men's magazines, but to certain issues of Vanity Fair, Rolling 
Stone and Sports Illustrated that contained pictures of nude or partially nude 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he has drafted a nine-page grievance, which argues that the 
judge's order should apply to all reading material covered under the First 
Amendment and not just Playboy. He said he plans to file the grievance with his 
department if the issue is not resolved.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; 'GHOST TOWN' APARTMENT HOUSE OWNER HITS BUREAUCRATIC WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 20 years a seven-unit apartment house on Vista del Monte in Sherman Oaks 
was a winning investment for attorney William Streitfeld and his wife, Melanie. 
It produced steady cash flow and tax write-offs. When they needed cash to 
remodel their own home, they took it out of the building, tax-free, by 
refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake shook the building off its foundation. 
Now the Streitfelds are among Valley apartment owners in so-called "ghost town" 
neighborhoods, who face financial disaster on the heels of natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Having no earthquake insurance, Streitfeld, 53, has since been haggling with 
the Small Business Administration and his own lender to finance repairs he 
estimates at $115,000. Immediately after the earthquake, Streitfeld retained a 
house mover to lift the 2 1/2-story structure on hydraulic jacks to stabilize 
it. He has obtained a building permit and has been told orally that his lender 
will cooperate. The SBA initially rejected his loan application but reversed 
itself in April. But the money still hasn't come through, and Streitfeld is not 
sure what the future holds. 
</P>
<P>
 He was interviewed by Times staff writer Doug Smith. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: What happened to your building?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: My building was basically too tall. It did not have enough lateral 
support. It was poorly engineered. What happened was, when the building got hit 
by the quake, the building rocked and rolled, trying to find out which way it 
was going to go. It happened to go to the north and slid off its foundation 
about 18 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How has this affected your financial position?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We had an equity of over $100,000. We had a net income of $1,600 per month 
after expenses. Now we're down to no equity, and we've lost $1,600 per month 
income. It's that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you ever consider walking away from the building?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We've opted to repair it, not because we are heroes, but because from a 
practical view there's more advantage in taking that risk than in letting 
someone else deal with the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're trying to do in the short term is fix it and get it rented again, 
because we think the other alternatives would be worse. Foreclosure would be 
bad for our credit. That leaves another building that may be picked up by 
speculators. It leaves us exposed to the house movers to come after us 
personally for the $26,000. It leaves them high and dry. It leaves us with all 
sorts of problems in terms of what we would do income-tax-wise. Should the 
building be foreclosed, obviously, there would be no debt. If there is no debt, 
there is a gain, in Internal Revenue Service parlance. Since we don't want to 
pay for a gain on a building we no longer own, we would really prefer to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You mean the house movers did the job without being paid?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I would say that they did the work on faith in the sense that they believed 
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the SBA would advance that 
money. The problem is mechanically getting the money. I've been approved for 
the minimum interest of 4% with a 10-year pay-back. However, as with most 
bureaucracies, I cannot get the money released, so I cannot do my project. They 
sent out some money and then they ran into paperwork problems and haven't sent 
out any money since. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, I'm still waiting for my bank to send paperwork out. The bank, 
Great Western Bank, has indicated that it will cooperate in restructuring the 
debt. The first meeting I had with Great Western was on Presidents Day. We had 
two subsequent meetings, one on April 3 or 4 and one on May 13. We still have 
nothing in writing yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did the SBA at first turn down your loan application?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They gave us a reason for turning us down that we had other available means 
of getting money. We could never quite figure out what that meant, because 
nobody is going to loan you money on a building that is being held up on 
blocks, 80-foot steel beams and hydraulic jacks waiting to be put back on its 
foundation. There's no lender that will loan you a dime on it. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't quite understand how we were going to make money out of lemonade. 
They're a bureaucracy. They made a mistake in turning us down. Our project, I 
think, was the type that the loans were designed for. We could make the income 
stream break even with their loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How did you change their minds?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sen. (Barbara) Boxer's office intervened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you contact her office?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I certainly did. I must tell you it's a well-oiled machine that Sen. Boxer 
has. Sen. (Dianne) Feinstein had someone call me and say, "Thank you for your 
inquiry. We're going to do something about it" and did nothing. Sen. Boxer's 
office had three different people make phone calls and write letters and follow 
up in a period of one week. I suddenly and miraculously the following week got 
an approval. I can't say that it's directly connected to that, but it's an 
amazing coincidence, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 I've got to tell you that I couldn't do it and I'm kind of pushy. I'm an 
attorney. I tried to fight the bureaucratic maze. I called five or six numbers 
in Washington and I got names and numbers of people to call, and I wrote 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 I even got the President's hot line. That's kind of a joke. You call the White 
House. There's a professional listener who says, "Oh, isn't that sad? Isn't 
that a problem you're having?" And you say, "Is that it?" And they say, "Well, 
your 30 minutes are up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is the area around your building coming back?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You don't see much happening when you go out. You see some buildings being 
rebuilt and a lot of them not being touched. They should be removed or rebuilt. 
Somebody from the federal government should just make the decision that they 
should be operative. 
</P>
<P>
 The first building that was rebuilt following the Northridge earthquake in 
Sherman Oaks was this obscene-book store, the name of which is Le Sex Shoppe. 
And they're going strong now. They've rebuilt and they're back in business 
again. They were red-tagged, I believe, at the same time we were. But I guess 
they don't need SBA money. They get other money from other sources. That's kind 
of a disgrace to the city of Los Angeles, that such activity can be the only 
successful commercial activity that can be back in business.

<P>
 Q: What could be done about that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm surprised that Mayor Riordan is not taking a higher profile on this. He 
is the mayor of this city. I see very little being done by the mayor. He didn't 
do any lobbying in Washington, where the money is. He should be out there every 
day advocating that more money be made available and advocating that these 
buildings be repaired, trying to get legislation passed which would relieve the 
owner of even the responsibility of doing it, and let the city come in and 
either demolish the building or repair the building with federal funds and then 
bill the owner, or force the owner to be the co-venturer in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 I think if he put pressure on and worked with the President and these federal 
agencies, they could easily start repairing these buildings. Fix 'em up, rent 
'em out. Let HUD step in and put a HUD administrator in there and rent them 
out. Send some of the rent to the landlord. Send some of the rent to the people 
who did the repairs, back payments to the federal government. Enforce it that 
way. We're all sitting around waiting for private industry to do this. The 
problem is, private industry lenders will not loan money on these damaged 
properties.

ANIMAL SHELTER LIKELY TO STAY OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Castaic Animal Shelter appears to have weathered a budget crisis that 
threatened to close the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Revisions proposed Monday for Los Angeles County's 1994-95 budget would keep 
the facility operating, providing $191,000 from the $57.3-billion financial 
plan to maintain staffing levels at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, closure of the Castaic Animal Shelter was suggested as one of the 
cutbacks needed in the face of a $476.8-million county shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new revisions, outlined in a report by the Chief Administrative Office, 
adjusts the shortfall to $300 million and avoids cuts to county animal 
shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,500 animals passed through the Castaic shelter last year. The nearest 
similar facility is 60 miles away, in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Castaic Animal Shelter serves about 250,000 residents in a 
250-square-mile area in northern Los Angeles County, it is the smallest of the 
county's six animal shelters and, therefore, is seen as the most vulnerable to 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the suggested closure, animal activists gathered petition 
signatures and contacted county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have the animal shelter, the problems don't go away," said 
Laurene Weste, a member of the Los Angeles County Animal Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter supporters say they are pleased with the budget revisions but will 
wait and see what the final draft looks like before celebrating.

HART TRUSTEES MAY CLOSE CAMPUSES AT LUNCHTIME; EDUCATION: PLAN WOULD AFFECT 
NINTH- AND 10TH-GRADERS AT FIRST. PARENTS' PRESSURE, BOARD'S CONSERVATISM MAKE 
PASSAGE LIKELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most students at the city's four high schools will be kept on campus during 
lunchtime starting this fall if a proposal by William S. Hart School District 
officials gets final approval from the district's trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth- and 10th-grade students would be kept on campus this fall under the 
proposal to go before the trustees on Wednesday, and 11th- and 12-grade 
students would be added at the start of the 1995 school year, said Assistant 
Supt. Daniel Hanigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors could earn the right to leave campus at lunch, although the criteria 
for earning that right has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar closed-campus proposals have been rejected by the district's Board of 
Trustees in recent years, but passage is probable this time due to pressure by 
parents and because the board has grown more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that the view of our community has changed over the 20-some-odd 
years we've had an open campus," Hanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 All five board members have stated they favor closing campuses to some degree. 
A telephone survey of 137 parents in May showed that 77% favored closed 
campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is opposed by many students and some school officials, who say the 
schools lack adequate dining and restroom facilities to accommodate all of the 
students, according to a district study. Increased security would also be 
needed to prevent fights, they say, on the crowded campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 To relieve some of the pressure on the cafeteria facilities, the proposal 
calls for deals to be struck with four fast-food companies to establish food 
carts or stations, Hanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional restroom facilities, dining areas and security personnel will 
gradually be added, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mat Gonzalez, 16, who will be a junior at Saugus High School this year, 
still predicts long lines and crowded campuses. And he said he defends the 
choice to leave campus for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going out to eat is more fun," he said. "It's a freedom thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for the improvements necessary for a closed campus won't be easy, 
Hanigan said. The Hart district already has a deficit of at least $1.9 million 
in its $51.1-million general fund budget for the 1994-95 school year and is 
expected to be in the red again the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said district officials hope to fund the project through building 
improvement funds, which are separate from the general fund, and possibly 
through a bond issue the district hopes to pass this year or next. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees meets at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the district's 
administrative headquarters.

LIBRARY GETS $1.28 MILLION FOR ROOF REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will receive $1.28 million to repair the main library's leaky 
roof, in a settlement agreement reached after three years of negotiations with 
the building's architect, construction manager and sub-contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 With most of the settlement cash in hand, city officials on Monday said they 
plan to immediately begin working on the roof, which has leaked since the 
$9-million library was built in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "You felt like you had to use an umbrella inside the building," recalled Kathy 
Lewis, president of Friends of the Thousand Oaks Library. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the books, computers and patrons dry, engineers plan to redesign the 
entire roof, adding slopes so water no longer pools on the skylights and 
aluminum catch-basins during heavy storms, administrative services manager Ed 
Johnduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also replace the skylights with heavier models, less susceptible to 
warping and leaking. And they will install bigger drainage pipes to whisk water 
down, away from the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 By October the repairs should be complete -- allowing librarians to toss out 
the turkey-basting pans they kept on hand to catch drips during past rainy 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the work will take two to three months, officials plan to keep the 
library open through the summer. Construction workers will take up their tools 
mainly in off-hours, and patrons should be able to safely meander through most 
sections of the library even during the repair work, Johnduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the roof reconstruction begins, the library will also undergo other work to 
repair an estimated $2 million in damage caused during January's Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Johnduff said the roof redesign will complement efforts to reconstruct 
the library's interior ceiling, which crashed to the floor in metal shards 
during the violent jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get the library back much sooner, which is good news," said Toni 
Hagopian, chairwoman of the Library Restoration Committee. "It will be better 
than new, of course."  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Hagopian's committee has raised more than $62,000 to replace the books 
damaged by ruptured water pipes and tumbling shelves during the quake. The city 
is also still waiting for expected funds from a private insurance policy and 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, finance director Bob Biery said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement announced Monday, the Los Angeles architectural firm Albert 
C. Martin and Associates agreed to pay $895,000, thereby avoiding trial in a 
lawsuit the city had filed in October, 1991. Five other construction management 
and contracting firms added a total of $385,000 to the settlement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 No firm admitted responsibility for the leaky roof. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe it was a design problem," said Robert Stellwagen, an 
attorney for A.C. Martin. "There were construction problems . . . (because 
contractors) didn't follow the plan specifications." 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's attorney, James Negele, said the design "was a screw-up -- I 
don't think it was well thought out." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the cause of the leaky roof, city officials and library users said 
they were glad the problems had been resolved. And although the settlement will 
not cover every penny of repairs and legal costs, Negele said he thought the 
agreement would serve Thousand Oaks well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city could have gone to the wall and said, 'We want 100 cents on the 
dollar,' but they were reasonable," he said. "They figured, 'We don't want to 
risk the books anymore, so let's take a compromise.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to A.C. Martin, firms contributing to the settlement fund are: 
Turner Construction Co. of Los Angeles, $170,000; the now-defunct Coastal Steel 
Structures, $100,000; Model Glass Inc., $80,000; Award Metals Co., $25,000; and 
Kennedy Plastering Inc., $10,000.

BRIEFCASE: AUTOMOBILES; TOOLS ARE WEAPONS IN WAR BETWEEN DEALERS, INDEPENDENT 
GARAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by John O'Dell Times staff writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent garages have competed with new car dealers on price, service and 
convenience probably since Henry Ford rolled out the first Model T in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
 To judge by the number of car repair shops in the country, they've done very 
well. It is not unusual for new car owners to abandon the dealer's service 
department as soon as the warranty expires. But car dealers continue to change, 
as do the cars that the auto makers build. 
</P>
<P>
 A keen understanding of cars and a good set of wrenches isn't enough in these 
days of microprocessor-controlled brake, ignition and fuel systems and 
emissions systems plumbed like an Atlas missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda Motor of America is hoping to take advantage of today's auto complexity 
in a new campaign it has launched to woo Mazda owners back into the dealers' 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of mailings to 1.7 million Mazda owners in the United States, the 
Irvine-based company -- Mazda's North American import, distribution and dealer 
development arm -- says that only the tools it engineers for its vehicles 
should be used in making repairs. And of course, the campaign stresses, only 
Mazda dealers can get those tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Each dealer has to invest about $30,000 in some 300 tools to properly care for 
the 12 models of cars and pickup trucks that Mazda markets in this country, the 
company says. 
</P>
<P>
 Most auto makers these days are like Mazda, with their own proprietary tools 
and test equipment. Torrance-based Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. has been stressing 
the advantages of visiting its dealers for repairs in a series of print and 
radio ads for several months now. 
</P>
<P>
 But independent garage owners say they can buy generic versions of the repair 
devices and can obtain computer programs for diagnosing engine ills within a 
few months of their introduction by the factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how good the copies are is a subject of debate, but their existence has 
enabled independents like Ken Trujillo to stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto makers, he said "aren't too cooperative selling you a tool you need, 
but we can get them from aftermarket companies, usually within a month or two 
after they come out." 
</P>
<P>
 Trujillo, owner of Independent Repair Service Center in Fullerton, specializes 
in Nissan and Toyota repairs and maintains that he is every bit as well 
equipped as an authorized dealer.

KNOTT'S KEEPS FAITH IN COACH; AN ANACHRONISM? MAYBE, BUT STAGE RIDE STILL PACKS 
THEM IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an age when theme parks are judged by their latest roller coasters or 
computerized simulators, a perennial favorite at Knott's Berry Farm is an 
anachronism. 
</P>
<P>
 The stagecoach ride -- an enduringly popular attraction that features 
authentic vehicles pulled by real horses -- draws guests willing to stand in 
line for the opportunity to travel in the style of the previous century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in the city, you don't get to do this very often," said Kevin Norris, 
whose rumpled hat, dusty jeans and worn boots make him look every inch the 
stagecoach driver and horseman that he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Norris joined Knott's in 1978 as a stagecoach loader and worked his way up to 
riding "shotgun," then to driving. Today, he is the attraction's chief horse 
trainer, with a crew of 27 wranglers, and is in charge of the entire stable of 
51 horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty complex operation. People don't understand what it takes," the 
34-year-old wrangler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stagecoaches are originals that were bought by park founder Walter Knott 
from movie companies in the 1950s. Only one is a replica, and it is nearly 40 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 For safety, the 19th-Century wood-paneled coaches are equipped with the same 
kind of hydraulic brakes found on cars. Norris said the coaches are regularly 
inspected and repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is pulled by a team of four or six horses. Part of Norris' art is knowing 
how to line up the animals. The more aggressive are put in the lead, while the 
more docile follow them. A good horse follows commands and seldom looks back or 
to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of all the noise in the theme park -- squeals from roller-coaster 
riders, tooting horns of kiddie rides, hissing from the steam train -- the 
horses are taught to respond to gentle pulls on the reins rather than to voice 
commands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sometimes can be tough," Norris said. Drivers are taught to keep their 
eyes focused 30 feet in front of the team, he said: "You've got to see what's 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally there are mishaps. Horses sometimes take a spill even though 
their shoes are specially treated to prevent slipping on the pavement. That may 
result in consternation to the animals, Norris said, but seldom causes serious 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams typically spend four hours a day, three or four days a week pulling 
the stagecoaches, which can weigh more than 2 1/2 tons each when fully loaded 
with a dozen passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The horses need time to adjust to the activities around them, though, so only 
a single inexperienced animal is allowed on a team.  
</P>
<P>
 Watching a new horse learn the ropes is one of the real pleasures of his job, 
Norris said. He typically buys young quarter horses or mixed stock. The oldest 
horse in the Knott's stable now is Little Joe, a 14-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof of the attraction's lasting appeal, park guests sometimes wait as 
long as an hour to take the 5/8-mile journey around the park. Knott's officials 
acknowledge that the ride is one of their slowest.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOLLAR FALLS AGAINST MARK, YEN; DOW OFF; MARKETS: ANALYSTS 
BLAME G-7 INACTION FOR THE WEAKNESS IN U.S. CURRENCY. YIELDS ON 30-YEAR 
TREASURY BONDS RISE TO 7.73%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The dollar plunged Monday to its lowest level against the German mark since 
October, 1992, and hit a new post-World War II low against the Japanese yen, 
after the United States and its allies failed to devise a plan to stabilize the 
greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Treasury bond yields rose across the board, amid expectations that 
economic reports due out this week will show faster growth and rising inflation 
-- leading to another Federal Reserve Board rate hike. A jump in oil and other 
commodity prices also hurt bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. stocks closed only marginally lower Monday, largely ignoring the 
turmoil in bonds and currencies for a second consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's latest plunge took center stage in the markets: In New York, the 
dollar plummeted to 1.530 German marks from 1.563 on Friday and briefly traded 
at a 21-month low of 1.518 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the yen, the dollar closed at 97.75, compared to 98.05 on Friday. The 
dollar dipped for the first time below 97 yen about midday, but it recovered 
later on concerns about the leadership succession in North Korea and Japan's 
uncertain political situation. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the day, currency traders took their cue from the apparent lack of 
interest among the Group of Seven industrial nations to support the U.S. 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The G-7 leaders concluded their annual summit Sunday in Naples, Italy, without 
unveiling a plan to rescue the dollar and without expressing any particular 
concern over its alarming decline. Traders said the leaders' inaction confirmed 
the market's worst suspicion that the industrial nations did not perceive the 
defense of the U.S. currency as a major concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers said trading volume was fairly light as few large banks entered the 
market, exacerbating the dollar's downward trajectory against European 
currencies. Much of the activity was speculative, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed selling in the bond market also hurt the dollar. Yields rose 
again, after rocketing Friday when the government reported strong job growth in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 7.73% from 7.69% on Friday, 
and it now is the highest since the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term yields also jumped sharply: The Treasury sold new three-month 
bills Monday at an average discount rate of 4.50%, up from 4.31% last week and 
the highest in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in short-term yields suggested that investors expect the Fed to 
officially boost short rates soon, for what would be the fifth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Laughlin, economist at the Sanwa Securities unit of Tokyo-based Sanwa 
Bank Ltd., said market participants worldwide are worried that the Fed hasn't 
raised interest rates fast enough this year to curb economic growth and 
potential inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 "All market indexes right now signal a Fed policy that's too accommodative," 
Laughlin said. "The Fed is behind the curve in fighting inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts described bond trading as light in advance of government 
reports on June producer inflation today and on June consumer inflation 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise in the markets Monday was Wall Street's relative resilience 
despite bond and dollar markets' losses: The Dow Jones industrials eased just 
6.15 points to 3,702.99, recovering on late buying from a session low of 3,681. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by just 9 to 8 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on light Big Board volume of 222.97 million shares. Most broad market 
indexes also were off only slightly.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the factors weighing on stocks, optimism among some investors over 
second-quarter corporate profit reports kept a floor under the market, said 
William LeFevre, market analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a good showing overnight in Tokyo and in European markets, despite 
tensions over North Korea's crisis, may have lent support to U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index eased just 53.42 points to 20,473.09. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index gained 14.81 points to 2,065.66, while London's 
FTSE-100 index added 21.4 points to 2,983.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index lost 22.77 points to 2,292.00. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. stocks were also able shake off another jump in key commodity prices 
Monday. Coffee prices rocketed above $2 a pound to 8 1/2-years highs after 
another killer frost struck Brazil's coffee-growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
 September coffee futures soared 47 cents to $2.35 per pound at the Coffee, 
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In other commodity trading, crude oil prices leaped above $20 a barrel for the 
first time in three weeks because of concerns about politically oriented labor 
strikes hampering Nigeria's oil production. 
</P>
<P>
 August crude oil roared ahead by 70 cents to $20.18 a barrel at the New York 
Mercantile Exchange. Traders said the contract was poised to test 16-month 
highs of $20.95 hit last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But to break that level, traders said a strike scheduled for Tuesday by 
Nigeria's senior grade oil workers would have to cripple the country's exports. 
In addition, U.S. crude oil inventories would have to remain at relatively low 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold followed oil and coffee higher. July gold futures gained $3 to $387.10 an 
ounce on the New York Commodities Exchange. Less Yen for the Dollar

 After tonight's All-Star Game, Texaco, the official pit stop for All-Star 
ballots, will pretty much call its baseball season a wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 And with good reason. The Big Game that Texaco built its marketing season 
around will be over. But other Major League Baseball sponsors, who paid 
millions to link themselves with the sport all the way through the World 
Series, are wondering whether the players -- who are expected to vote soon for 
an August or September strike -- will eventually join Texaco on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Although baseball has had an exciting season on the field, some marketers are 
calling this the All-Star Game from hell. Many fans are angered about the 
strong possibility of a baseball strike -- with players upset over a proposal 
by team owners to cut costs next season by enforcing a salary cap. Other fans 
are turned off by visions of another American League blowout. (The American 
League has won the past six contests.) And baseball's midseason classic -- as 
American as Dodger Dogs -- finds itself competing for media coverage against 
soccer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real cloud hanging over this year's All-Star Game," said Brandon 
Steiner, president of New York-based Steiner Sports Marketing. "The karma is 
pretty bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, officials at NBC say all 60 of the 30-second commercial units have been 
sold, for up to $300,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors, who are generally trying to put the best possible face on the event, 
point out that many fans are especially eager to see several sluggers who are 
making serious bids at baseball's single-season home run record of 61, set by 
Roger Maris in 1961. Going into the All-Star break, Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. 
and San Francisco's Matt Williams each has 33 home runs, and Chicago's Frank 
Thomas has 32. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens, executives at Texaco figure they've covered their 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost all of our participation was leading up to the All-Star Game," said 
Tom Matthews, president of Texaco Refining & Marketing. "So if a strike does 
occur, it has a very minimal effect on us." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 6 million of the record 14 million All-Star ballots completed this 
year were picked up at Texaco service stations, Matthews said. The rest were 
obtained at the ballparks. And Texaco's name appeared on every one of the 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other sponsors, however, are in it for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatorade has its name and logo etched into the on-deck circles, where players 
stand before they bat. Each time the camera shows the batter waiting on deck, 
the Gatorade logo will be seen in up to 40 million American households. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds the public that we're the sports beverage used by the best 
athletes in the world," said Bill Daily, director of sports marketing for 
Gatorade. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors like to see their names in lights when viewers are paying closest 
attention, said Bob Lachky, vice president of Budweiser brands. That's why 
Anheuser-Busch is sponsoring the opening lineups, which will be seen by TV 
viewers as the "Budweiser Opening Lineup." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, MCI will sponsor "MCI Proof Positive Instant Replays." 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok hopes TV camera operators will find reason to show a close-up of the 
shoes of its long-ball-hitting spokesman, Frank Thomas. He'll be decked out in 
a pair of shoes from Reebok's upcoming shoe line, dubbed in honor of Thomas' 
many nicknames: "The Big Hurt." Although the shoe line won't be available until 
next spring, Reebok hopes this can help it build early interest in the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he'll foul a ball off his foot and the camera will show a close-up," 
joked Reebok spokesman Dave Fogelson.  
</P>
<P>
 But above all, it is Griffey who may seem as visible off the field as on 
during tonight's game. The Seattle Mariner outfielder will appear in new ads 
for Nike, Nintendo and a tear-jerker ad for Major League Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball spot features the superstar spending a day at Seattle's Kingdome 
along with a 12-year-old cancer patient whose longtime wish to meet Griffey was 
granted through the Make-A-Wish Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an attempt to make people realize that some of these guys -- even though 
they're making tons of money -- are real people," said Jeff Goodby, chairman of 
Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, the San Francisco agency that created the new 
baseball image ads.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency also created a spot airing tonight that features Dodger star Mike 
Piazza visiting a cancer ward at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. The slogan of 
the ads attempts to make ballplayers seem more accessible: "Real-life heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 During the game, Nintendo will twice air an ad featuring Griffey and his 
father, Ken Griffey Sr., who was a star with the Cincinnati Reds in the 
mid-1970s. Since April, Nintendo has sold nearly 750,000 "Ken Griffey Jr. 
Presents Major League Baseball" computer software games, said George Harrison, 
director of marketing. "We see a bump in sales every time he hits a home run," 
Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike, meanwhile, says Griffey's popularity has climbed so high during his home 
run record chase that Nike will broadcast its ad three times during the game 
instead of just once as originally planned. The spot features legendary 
baseball commentators, including Mel Allen and Harry Caray, calling Griffey 
home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given what he has accomplished so far, we're re-evaluating how to best use 
him as the season goes on," said Joe McCarthy, Nike's North American ad 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike also ran a print ad this week in Sports Illustrated and USA Today that 
features a picture of Griffey tagging a long ball. Under the photo it says, 
"Dear National League Pitchers: On July 12, you'll know what it feels like to 
be an American League pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad ends, "P.S. Good Luck." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles agency Mendelsohn/Zien Advertising has picked up two new 
clients: the $5-million Clothestime of Anaheim account, formerly handled by 
Kresser/Craig, and the $2-million account for Garden Fresh Restaurant Corp. of 
San Diego. . . . Two Southern California ad legends have left the ad business 
to pursue favorite hobbies: Phillip Joanou has stepped down as chairman of 
Dailey & Associates to study painting at the graduate school of the New York 
Academy of Art, and Jean Craig has retired as president of Kresser/Craig 
Advertising to work on several books, including one about the 1993 Malibu fire 
that destroyed her home. . . . Ad whiz Sakol Mongkolkasetarin, the 27-year-old 
who won a handful of prestigious Belding Awards earlier this year, has left the 
agency dGWB Advertising with two partners to form Newport Beach-based Acme 
Advertising.

STATE STUDY FINDS WIDESPREAD FRAUD IN AUTO BODY REPAIRS; CONSUMERS: THE REPORT, 
WHICH ALSO BLAMES INCOMPETENCE FOR INFLATED BILLS, CALLS FOR STRICTER 
REGULATION OF THE BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A state report released Monday found that auto body repair fraud and 
incompetence is widespread in California, often resulting in inflated repair 
charges and shoddy work. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, issued by the state Bureau of Automotive Repair, calls for 
stricter regulation of the 10,000 businesses engaged in auto body repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the report say there is not enough evidence to link poor 
workmanship to accidents or injuries but that it is logical to assume that at 
least some poorly repaired vehicles pose safety risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common-sense argument that we have going is that if cars are not being 
fixed properly, they are less likely to survive crash No. 2 and the likelihood 
of personal injury goes way up," said Allan Wood, program manager for the 
Bureau of Automotive Repair. 
</P>
<P>
 An industry group representing the state's auto body repair shops said the 
report's criticisms are too broad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not privy to the information the committee is privy to, but if it 
(fraud) is a problem, it is not a general problem," said Bill Conway, executive 
director of the California Auto Body Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway said the industry does support reforms, however, including stricter 
licensing and regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would agree that there are problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was produced by a 12-member committee with representatives from the 
insurance and auto body repair industries and law enforcement. The committee 
reviewed claim data from insurers, surveyed auto body shop operators about 
their equipment and training, and investigated repairs to 52 cars from Orange 
County and the Sacramento area randomly selected from insurance company claim 
files. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators working with the committee found that only 29% of the cars had 
been properly repaired, and they found evidence of fraud in 40%. Repairs to the 
remaining 31% were rated fair, poor or questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says poor workmanship or fraud adds an average of $866 to the 
repair bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, investigators found that two Sacramento-area auto body shops 
billed an insurance company for repairs to the frame of the same Toyota Celica 
GT. The investigation showed that the frame was never damaged and that a fender 
needed repairs it never got. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, investigators said it is difficult for consumers to protect 
themselves from auto body repair fraud because it is often not obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the fit or finish looks good to the customer, they don't see past that," 
Wood said. "If the car looks pretty, they don't look to see if it is properly 
straightened out or a part not replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding training and equipment, of the 1,572 auto body shops that responded 
to the survey, only 15% said they had an employee certified for paint and 12% 
had an employee certified for metal work by the National Institute for 
Automotive Service Excellence, a professional association. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the situation as "bleak," the report found that only 12% of shops 
surveyed had even one person who had completed the basic collision repair 
training course offered by the Inter-Industry Conference on Auto Collision 
Repair. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that many auto body repair shops lacked equipment 
considered essential for proper repairs. Only half of shops had a frame rack or 
bench, equipment needed to lift and stretch a damaged vehicle back into its 
original shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really set me back," said Dan Povey, a Bureau of Automotive Repair 
investigator who worked with the committee. "Almost every repair requires you 
to straighten out the core of the car before hanging new parts on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Povey said that some shops probably subcontract frame work to shops with frame 
racks but that it is doubtful that all do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The report suggests that the legislature consider various reforms, including 
separate licensing and testing of auto body repair facilities. The report also 
calls for more training for insurance claims estimators, many of whom are not 
trained in auto body repair and take the word of technicians as to what work is 
needed. Consumer Tips 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Automotive Repair offers these suggestions for consumers whose 
cars need body work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask for references and check technicians' qualifications. Are they certified 
by the National Institute for Automotive Excellence or by the Inter-Industry 
Conference on Auto Collision Repair? 
</P>
<P>
 * Be familiar with the existing damage to your vehicle. Investigators say, for 
instance, that one common scam is for technicians to merely switch wheel 
covers' positions rather than repair the one that is damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask questions. When repairs are completed, ask technicians what they did and 
have them show you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the gaps between body panels: Are they equal? Unequal gaps may 
indicate improper panel alignment or a bent frame.

LILLY WILL PAY $4 BILLION CASH FOR DRUG PLAN MANAGER PCS; ACQUISITIONS: IT'S 
THE THIRD RECENT DEAL WHERE A MAJOR DRUG MAKER HAS SNATCHED UP A FIRM INVOLVED 
IN THE SPENDING END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In another attempt by a giant drug maker to regain control of its market, Eli 
Lilly & Co. said it will pay $4 billion in cash to acquire PCS Health Systems 
Inc., the nation's largest company that manages prescription drug plans for 
employers and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilly's move is the third recent deal in which a major drug manufacturer has 
attempted to gain control of the firms that increasingly determine how much 
money will be spent on prescription drugs and which manufacturers' products 
will be prescribed. 
</P>
<P>
 PCS, a unit of San Francisco-based McKesson Corp., controlled roughly $6.4 
billion in drug spending for some 50 million people in its fiscal year ended in 
March. Its major customers include the three big U.S. auto makers and some 
federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers contract with companies such as PCS to process prescription claims, 
negotiate discounts with drug makers and monitor doctors' drug-prescribing 
activities. Such companies, for example, will encourage doctors to prescribe 
less costly generic versions of brand-name drugs when they are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilly's acquisition price -- about 23 times PCS' annual sales of $180 million, 
as estimated by analysts -- reflects the critical importance the drug maker 
places on gaining a foothold in the drug benefit management field. Lilly was 
one of several big drug makers scrambling to respond to earlier moves by rival 
firms -- and PCS was the last of the big drug benefits firms available. 
</P>
<P>
 Merck & Co., the world's largest drug maker, in November signaled the changes 
to come when it paid more than $6 billion for Medco Containment Services, a 
prescription benefits manager and mail-order drug firm. And British-owned drug 
maker SmithKline Beecham in May said it would pay $2.3 billion for Diversified 
Pharmaceutical Services of Bloomington, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Both those deals would have inhibited Lilly's access to patients in the Medco 
and Diversified Pharmaceutical benefits programs, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 For its $4 billion, Lilly would gain access to PCS' 50 million members and 
more control over ensuring that PCS members use Lilly drugs whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that Lilly is paying a far heftier price -- some 75 times 
operating earnings -- than Merck or SmithKline paid to gain entry into the 
managed-care field. Merck paid roughly 30 times earnings for Medco, while 
SmithKline paid 55 times earnings for Diversified Pharmaceuticals, according to 
Lawrence Marsh, analyst at Wheat First Butcher & Singer in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts also said Lilly's higher price is justified, in part because PCS 
has more members than either Medco or Diversified and is considered by analysts 
to be the most profitable and fastest-growing of the firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Lilly is paying what they need to pay to get the business," said Jack 
Lamberton, an analyst with County NatWest USA in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many Lilly investors apparently weren't happy with the $4-billion 
price tag, which the drug maker plans to finance mostly through borrowing. 
Lilly shares dropped $7.375 to $50 on the New York Stock Exchange, as the 
company lost about $2 billion in market value. 
</P>
<P>
 But McKesson shares soared on the news, gaining $24.75 to close at $98 on the 
Big Board. For McKesson, a giant drug wholesaler whose relatively tiny PCS unit 
was considered the company's crown jewel, the Lilly deal reflects an offer that 
was evidently too good to refuse. McKesson was reportedly approached by other 
drug makers interested in buying PCS, including British-based Glaxo Holdings.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a real sense of concern among the drug companies of missing the boat, 
and McKesson was willing to use its position as the last unaffiliated drug 
benefit firm to strike an impressive deal for shareholders," Marsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Seelenfreund, McKesson's chairman and chief executive, suggested that 
recent moves by "companies with substantially greater" clinical resources, 
physician relationships and research and development budgets were making it 
tougher for PCS to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of this changed environment and the offer from Lilly . . . this 
transaction represents the best opportunity to maximize shareholder value," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal, Lilly would pay McKesson stockholders $76 in cash for 
each outstanding share.

GAO CHALLENGES AIR FORCE ON ITS LANDING-TAKEOFF CLAIMS FOR C-17; AEROSPACE: THE 
WATCHDOG AGENCY SAYS THE CARGO JET'S ADVANTAGE OVER ITS CHIEF RIVAL HAS BEEN 
OVERSTATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The General Accounting Office said Monday that the McDonnell Douglas C-17 
cargo jet can land on less than half of the nearly 10,000 foreign airfields 
that the Air Force has claimed in justifying the $43-billion program. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite years of assertions by the Air Force that the plane has a 
revolutionary capability to land and take off at unimproved airstrips, the GAO 
found that many of the foreign fields are too weak to support the weight of the 
C-17, which is made in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 An Air Force spokesman declined to comment, saying the service had not yet 
seen the GAO's report. But in recent congressional hearings, senior Air Force 
officials have sharply disputed similar criticism raised by Rand Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane has survived a number of technical setbacks, and it is too early to 
say whether the latest revelation will cause serious political damage to the 
program. The Air Force has said the planes will cost an average of $325 million 
over the life of the program -- by far the most costly cargo jet in history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force has long asserted that the C-17 can land at about three times as 
many airfields as the rival Lockheed C-5B jet -- 9,900 for the C-17 compared to 
3,500 for the C-5B -- a crucial capability for supporting U.S. military 
operations in remote parts of world. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-17 is designed to land and come to a stop in less than 2,000 feet, 
enabling supplies to be flown directly from U.S. cargo bases into foreign 
battle zones. The plane features a new design in which the engine's thrust 
blows over the wings to create extra lift on landing and takeoff. But that 
might have little value if foreign runways are too weak. 
</P>
<P>
 The new GAO report examines the strength of those 9,900 foreign airfields and 
concludes that 6,198 of them are too weak structurally to support the weight of 
a fully loaded C-17. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining the data of the Defense Mapping Agency, GAO investigators 
found that the C-17 can land at just 911 more airfields than the C-5B -- not 
the 6,400 originally claimed. Moreover, of the 2,800 foreign fields actually 
visited by American teams, the C-17 could land at only 95 more fields than the 
C-5B, not including those in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas spokesman Larry McCracken, reflecting years of rebutting 
criticism of the C-17, remarked, "Give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 While McCracken said he had not seen the GAO report, he disputed it 
nonetheless, saying: "That sounds unbelievable. There have to be more than 95 
airfields in the world that this thing can operate in and the C-5 can't. Just 
look at the map." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), a frequent critic of the C-17, said the GAO's 
findings "that only a handful of airfields require the C-17's special short 
landing and takeoff abilities raises even more doubts about its value." 
</P>
<P>
 Every airplane is rated for the stress it puts on a runway, known as a load 
classification number, or LCN. For the C-17, the number is 48, meaning it needs 
to land on a runway with an LCN number of 48 or higher or else risk serious 
accelerated wear to the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The military plans to use the C-17 on runways rated as low as 20 in a war, 
which would cause serious damage after only 100 landings and takeoffs, 
according to GAO officials. But even based on those plans, 6,198 of the 
original 9,900 runways are still too weak to handle the C-17, according to the 
GAO. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not saying the C-17 doesn't have an advantage," GAO analyst Tom 
Denomme said. "All we are saying is let's be realistic. There are not thousands 
of runways the C-17 can land on that the C-5 can't." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report says, for example, that only two austere airfields in Korea and 
one in Saudi Arabia would be likely to get any use by the C-17 in wartime, even 
though the Air Force has cited potential conflicts in Korea and Saudi Arabia as 
a military need in supporting the C-17's cost.

 Supplier Rewarded: Calsonic Climate Control Inc., an Irvine maker of 
automotive air-conditioning systems, has been selected as Supplier of the Year 
by Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Calsonic is one of about 500 U.S. companies from which Nissan buys nearly $2 
billion in parts and equipment each year for installation on cars and trucks 
made in Japan and at its Tennessee facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese car makers are stepping up their purchase of U.S.-made parts in an 
effort to improve trade balances and disarm critics who fault the companies for 
slighting domestic manufacturers in favor of Japanese suppliers. Nissan has 
said it intends to boost its purchase of U.S. parts and supplies to $3.4 
billion a year by 1998.

 Teamsters Chief Cleared of Charges: A court-appointed group has cleared 
Teamsters President Ron Carey of alleged connections with organized crime, the 
union said.The panel, known as the Independent Review Board, concluded that 
evidence uncovered in its investigation "does not support recommending a 
charge" based on allegations against Carey, the union said. Carey has denied 
having any ties with organized crime. He said those who raised the issue were 
opposed to reforms he was carrying out in the union.

 UAL Buyout Plan Put to Vote: Shareholders in UAL Corp. were to vote today in 
Chicago on a $4.9-billion employee buyout plan, and one institutional 
shareholder said it favors the transaction.The California Public Employees 
Retirement System, which holds 198,200 shares, or 0.8% of UAL, said it will 
vote for the buyout. Many industry analysts and investors believe shareholders 
in the holding company for United Airlines will endorse the plan, under which 
about 60,000 employees would receive at least 55% stake of the company in 
exchange for six years of wage and work-rule concessions. Employees and UAL 
management on Dec. 15 first announced an agreement in principle on the sale.

 Hyundai Founder's Conviction Upheld: An appeals court in Seoul upheld a lower 
court and sentenced Chung Ju Young to three years in prison for election 
fraud.But the court immediately suspended the sentence, citing Chung's age and 
past contributions to South Korea's industrial development. Chung, 79, was 
convicted of illegally funneling more than $53 million in company funds into 
his 1992 presidential bid. The Hyundai business group is the world's largest 
maker of ships and a leading South Korean maker of autos and electronic goods. 
Chung, who ran a distant third in the 1992 elections, has retired from politics 
and from the day-to-day running of Hyundai.

Motors, once the leading West Coast recreational vehicle dealership, pleaded 
guilty to bilking three community banks out of $2.8 million.William P. 
Whitledge Jr., whose $50-million network of RV sales stretched to Seattle, 
could face 30 years in prison and a $1-million fine for pledging the same RVs 
as collateral to get multiple loans from more than one bank. Whitledge also 
obtained liens against RVs he didn't own. Prosecutors said Whitledge was trying

DELTA CUTS CONTINUE WITH 4,500 CUSTOMER SERVICE JOBS; AIRLINES: THE LATEST 
ROUND WILL BRING THE CARRIER ABOUT HALFWAY TO ITS RESTRUCTURING GOAL. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines Inc. said Monday that it will eliminate 4,500 full-time jobs 
from its customer service division over the next 12 months, continuing a 
cost-cutting effort to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions are expected to contribute to the division's goal of achieving 
$175 million to $250 million in annual savings for the company, the nation's 
No. 3 airline. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of job cuts represents about 20% of the customer service 
unit, Delta spokesman Bill Berry said. The carrier also cut 2,500 jobs last 
month from its technical operations division -- about 20% of that unit -- as 
part of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest cuts, Delta is about halfway to its goal of cutting as many as 
15,000 jobs in a bid to lower annual operating costs by about $2 billion by 
June, 1997. It has said it will save $100 million a year by removing 13 A-310 
Airbuses from its fleet. It will also revamp its short-haul operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other major airlines in the highly competitive U.S. market, Delta has 
been hit by massive losses in recent years. Its results improved in the most 
recent fiscal quarter ended April 29, but it still reported a deficit of $77.9 
million, about half the prior year's $152.3 million in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Full-service airlines such as Delta have been forced to cut expenses in order 
to compete in the low-fare environment.  
</P>
<P>
 The company has already said it will get rid of unprofitable routes. Cargo 
handling, ticket counter customer assistance and other airport operations will 
be reviewed for trimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're simply working through the divisions," Berry said. "No division is 
exempt."  
</P>
<P>
 Delta said the job cuts will be made possible by increasing the use of 
flexible work scheduling and part-time personnel, changing the way some jobs 
are performed, eliminating unnecessary processes and taking advantage of more 
outsourcing opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta declined to provide time frames for staff reductions in specific cities, 
but said that employees will be offered voluntary departure incentives before 
layoffs are made. 
</P>
<P>
 W. Martin Braham, Delta's senior vice president responsible for airport 
customer service, said reducing costs to make the airline competitive and 
ensure its survival requires difficult steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta's stock closed down 87.5 cents at $47.625 in afternoon trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange.CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING

MATTEL APPEARS TO HAVE WON SCRABBLE OVER RIGHTS TO GAME; LEISURE: THE EL 
SEGUNDO TOY MAKER SAYS ITS LATEST COUNTEROFFER HAS BEEN ACCEPTED OVER THAT OF 
RIVAL HASBRO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mattel Inc. has apparently won the battle with rival Hasbro Co. for J.S. Spear 
& Sons, the British company that owns the overseas rights to the popular 
Scrabble board game. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo-based Mattel, the world's largest toy maker, said Monday that it 
got "irrevocable commitments" for 51% of the British company's shares, 
following acceptance of Mattel's offer by Spear's board. Mattel said it made a 
confidential, sweetened bid last Friday of nearly $18 a share, or $90 million, 
to directors and trustees, who own or control a majority of the shares. 
Mattel's private bid came just as Hasbro announced it had increased its own, 
earlier bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition will fill a large gap in Mattel's product lines and give it 
for the first time a platform from which to challenge Hasbro in the board games 
arena. Hasbro, a close second to Mattel in annual sales, is the world's leading 
maker of board games. It owns the rights to Scrabble throughout North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel's shares slipped 25 cents to $27.75 in trading Monday on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel made an entry into the games category of the toy industry two years ago 
when it bought International Games, the maker of the Uno and Skip - Bo card 
games. Indeed, since 1991, Mattel has been on a buying binge that has helped 
diversify the company's product lines and wean it from its heavy reliance on 
Barbie dolls for revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Mattel's acquisition of preschool toy maker Fisher-Price last year, the 
Barbie line accounted for 50% of the company's revenue. However, sales this 
year are expected to top $2.8 billion, with Barbie bringing in about 35%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro already owns about 27% of Spear. Mattel said it hopes Hasbro will 
accept the offer to sell the shares. Hasbro officials were unavailable for 
comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bidding war for Spear began in June after Hasbro sought to buy control of 
the remaining shares for $13.50 each. That bid valued the total company at 
about $70 million. Hasbro thought it had irrevocable commitments to gain 
control of the company, but Mattel submitted a rival bid and a London court 
ruled that the board could consider it. That bid valued Spear at $78 million, 
and the Spear board appeared inclined to accept it, but left the door open to a 
higher bid. 
</P>
<P>
 That came last Friday, when Hasbro increased its offer to nearly $17 a share, 
for a total company value of $86 million to $88 million. A Mattel spokesman 
said a crucial point in Mattel's favor was its commitment to retain current 
Spear management and keep open the company's production facilities in Enfield, 
a suburb of London. Hasbro already has game-production facilities and might 
have sought to consolidate Spear's operations with its own. 
</P>
<P>
 Leisure industry analyst Laurie Lively Smith of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles 
said that "the company is more valuable to Mattel. . . . For Hasbro, Spear 
would be another feather in its cap but not a strategic cornerstone. For 
Mattel, it is more important. It is a strategic cornerstone."

DOCTORS' FEES IN WORKERS' COMP CASES UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a legal victory for doctors who treat injured workers, a California appeals 
court has ruled that a Beverly Hills medical group was unfairly denied due 
process when its medical bills were branded fraudulent and disallowed by a 
workers' compensation judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers said the ruling, if it withstands a likely appeal, will strengthen 
the hand of doctors in some of their legal skirmishes with workers' comp 
insurance companies.Many doctors have contended recently that the insurers are 
improperly trying to discourage claims from injured workers by increasingly 
refusing to pay justified medical expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the California Court of Appeal last week stemmed from a 
controversial and sweeping ruling in April, 1993, by a Long Beach workers' 
compensation judge. The judge tossed out the benefit claims filed by a group of 
10 employees laid off by El Segundo-based International Rectifier Corp. and 
accused the workers, their lawyers and doctors of conspiring to commit 
insurance fraud by submitting bogus claims. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that ruling, the judge disallowed the $158,000 in bills submitted 
by the medical practice that evaluated and treated the workers, Beverly Hills 
Medical Multispecialty Group. The practice appealed the decision, arguing that 
the judge unfairly prevented it from doing such things as cross-examining 
witnesses or otherwise fully participating in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice's victory on that point will help doctors who evaluate patients 
in good faith to collect on their legitimate expenses from insurers, even if 
the workers' injury claims themselves are rejected in court, said Carlyle R. 
Brakensiek, executive vice president of the California Society of Industrial 
Medicine and Surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edward C. Woodward, president of the insurance industry-funded California 
Workers' Compensation Institute, said the ruling could increase litigation 
costs and add to the backlog of cases already bedeviling the workers' comp 
court system.

EARNINGS: MOTOROLA REPORTS 64% RISE IN SECOND-QUARTER PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorola Inc. reported sharply higher second-quarter revenue and earnings, led 
by a 75% rise in telecommunications equipment sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For the period ended June 30, the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics manufacturer 
reported net income of $367 million, or 63 cents a share, up 64% from $224 
million, or 40 cents, for the 1993 second quarter.Sales increased 38% to $5.4 
billion for the period, contrasted with $3.9 billion last year. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Semiconductor products sales rose 23% to $1.7 billion, with the highest 
increase in North America. Automotive, communications and computing led the 
end-market segments in growth, and distribution orders also increased, Motorola

U.S. SEEKS TO TIGHTEN POULTRY INSPECTIONS; AGRICULTURE: PROPOSALS SET 'ZERO 
TOLERANCE' ON FECAL MATTER. CRITICS CALL FOR BACTERIA TESTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government proposed stricter inspection standards for poultry Monday in an 
effort to reduce the amount of disease-causing bacteria on the billions of 
birds Americans consume each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations impose a "zero tolerance" rule regarding fecal matter on 
any of the 7 billion chickens and 700 million turkeys processed annually in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Poultry feces may carry harmful bacteria such as salmonella, a major cause of 
food poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal is part of our ongoing efforts to use the best available 
science, in conjunction with good common sense, to improve the safety of our 
food supply," Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture has been criticized for not enforcing zero 
tolerance on poultry processors sooner. The rule has been enforced in beef 
inspections since three people died and hundreds of others became ill from 
eating contaminated hamburgers in the Pacific Northwest in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations require the reinspection of all chickens found to be 
contaminated, instead of just a sample. To carry this out, the positions of 
federal inspectors along the processing lines may be shifted. The inspectors 
will be given more authority to stop or slow the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules also put more responsibility on plant operators, requiring that they 
sort the birds in advance and present only disease-free fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the rules require that an antibacterial rinse be used on all 
carcasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The department estimates it will cost the poultry industry between $7 million 
and $10 million to make the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new standards will be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday for a 
90-day period of public comment. Department officials predicted the rules will 
take effect late this year or early in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals have already come under fire from consumer groups, who argue 
that inspection plans should focus on testing for bacteria rather than relying 
on visual scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poultry you buy at the store may look a little better, but USDA offers no 
proof that, day in and day out, it will be less likely to make you sick," said 
Carol Tucker Foreman, who was assistant secretary of agriculture for food and 
consumer services under President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be heavily contaminated with bacteria that are not visible and can be 
detected only by scientific tests," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy's press spokeswoman, Mary Dixon, told reporters, "One of the secretary's 
main priorities is to develop a rapid test for on-line use," but Foreman and 
other critics say the department already has the know-how to conduct such 
testing.

 Abbott Laboratories said second-quarter profit was up 9%, with improved sales 
in all of the company's drug and health products categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Chicago, Ill.-based company said net earnings for the quarter were 
$377 million, or 46 cents per share, contrasted with $346 million, or 42 cents, 
for the 1993 quarter. Sales for the period were $2.20 billion, up 6% from $2.07 
billion a year ago. Worldwide sales of pharmaceutical and nutrition products 
were up 9% from last year; sales of hospital and laboratory products were up 
3%. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects a substantial payoff from two second-quarter 
developments: an agreement with Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. to cross-license each 
other's gene-amplification technologies, and the introduction of a diagnostic 
system for medium- and high-volume laboratories to produce faster results from 
various medical tests.

 CBS Vote Expected on QVC: The CBS Inc. board was expected to endorse Chairman 
Laurence A. Tisch's plan to merge the broadcasting company with QVC Inc., the 
cable shopping concern headed by Barry Diller, by the end of the week. 
Speculation persisted on Wall Street that a third party could emerge as a 
spoiler of the proposed transaction, but many industry analysts consider that 
unlikely."Chances are getting slimmer as the days go by," said Ed Atorino, 
media analyst at Dillon Read & Co. Walt Disney Co. is often mentioned as being 
interested in buying some, if not all, of CBS. The filmmaker and theme park 
operator is a major supplier of TV programs, and involvement with a network 
would assure it of distribution. However, Disney watchers say the company is 
unlikely to intervene.

 Ex-Fed Governor Says Further Rate Hikes Needed: Wayne Angell, now chief 
economist at Bear, Stearns & Co., said that to avoid a recession in the next 
three years, the Federal Reserve Board needs to raise the federal funds rate -- 
the interest rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans -- by 100 
basis points, to 5.25%. The Fed has raised the rate 25 basis points four times 
this year. Many analysts expect to see rates rise again, perhaps as much as 50 
basis points, before the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee convenes 
again Aug. 16.

DELL WILL PULL ITS COMPUTERS FROM RETAIL STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dell Computer Corp., a pioneer in selling personal computers directly to 
consumers, said Monday that it will stop selling its machines through retail 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been losing money of late in that channel," said Michael Dell, chief 
executive of the Austin, Tex.-based company. "This is a no- or low-return 
business. For us, it has been losing money for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not specify how much it has lost in the retailing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell has stopped shipping its PCs to its five retail partners: CompUSA Inc., 
Best Buy Co., Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Sam's Club, Price/Costco Inc. and PC World 
in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell was the first major brand to sell through retail superstores such as 
CompUSA, beginning in 1989. "We were first in and first out," Dell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventory at the stores will be phased out over time, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It marks the maturity of the company," said David Wu, an analyst at S.G. 
Warburg. "When the management was young, they fell for all the distribution 
channels . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, after a while you find out there are things you don't do well and you 
stop doing them -- that's called maturity," Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell was unable to compete with Compaq Computer and IBM in the retail arena 
because its prices were not substantially lower, Wu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you cannot be significantly lower-priced than Compaq or IBM in the 
retail channel, you probably should get out," he said. "I think it was smart 
for them to get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Dell's sales through retailers are minute compared to its direct sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dell said he expects retail sales to contribute less than 2% of 
company revenue in the second quarter ending July 31. At a peak, about 10% of 
Dell's revenue came from retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Dell's direct sales to consumers and government and corporate 
customers account for about 87% of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dell said the core direct-sales business is "growing and profitable," 
although he did not give figures. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company is likely to incur some costs in getting out of retail 
distribution but that they will be offset by exiting a money-losing area. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is not likely to lead to any job cuts, Dell said. Affected 
employees will be moved to other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing some fairly dynamic growth in that core direct business with 
consumers right now," he said, "and we're going to continue to expand that." 
</P>
<P>
 The company plans to experiment with new methods to reach consumers directly. 
For example, it is considering delivering catalogues and other company 
information through computer on-line services such as the Internet, the global 
web of computer networks, as well as H&R Block Inc.'s CompuServe and Prodigy, a 
venture of IBM and Sears, Roebuck & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Another outlet may be kiosks in places such as malls and airports, Dell said. 
An inventory-less system might also be set up at retailers that would simply 
take orders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell said the company expects to show higher overall revenue in its latest 
quarter than the $766.6 million it made in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically expect to see a rise in revenues sequentially of a fairly modest 
nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to PCs, Dell makes notebooks, servers -- which control the flow of 
information between desktop computers linked on a network -- and other types of 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dell's stock ended up 81.25 cents at $28.875 in Nasdaq trading.

COFFEE FUTURES SOAR AS FROST RETURNS TO BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coffee prices soared on commodity markets Monday -- promising another round of 
retail price hikes -- after a weekend freeze destroyed more crops in Brazil's 
most important coffee-growing region. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, is already reeling from a June 
frost that destroyed 30% of next year's crop, and it was scrambling to assess 
and mitigate the damage from the latest catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the most active coffee futures contract on the London Commodity 
Exchange rose as much as $924 a ton, or 30%, to $4,000 a ton -- the highest 
price since February, 1986. This is the largest gain in one day since the 
dollar-based contract began trading in March, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of a pound of raw, green coffee on New York's Coffee, Sugar and 
Cocoa Exchange shot up Monday morning to $2.395 a pound, an eight-year high, 
and ended the day 47 cents higher at $2.353. The price has risen 87% since the 
first damaging frost June 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee drinkers had already started to feel the pinch of higher prices from 
the June freeze and from tight supply. General Foods, Procter & Gamble and 
Nestle Beverage, which together have 70% of the U.S. retail coffee market, have 
raised their prices as much as 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Nadelberg, vice president with Merril Lynch Futures in New York, said the 
impact of the second frost will probably be reflected in consumer prices within 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My advice," said broker Robert Griffith, owner of Capricorn Coffee in Brazil, 
"is to go out and buy a cup of coffee during your lunch break . . . because 
it's going to go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee growers and market analysts said the latest freeze, just two weeks 
after the first harsh frost, was more devastating because it struck plantations 
in the heart of Minas Gerias, the southern state of Brazil that is the world's 
No. 1 coffee-producing region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last frost, they had very heavy damage in Sao Paulo and Parana, but we 
were mostly not affected," said Marcello Vieira, a Minas Gerias plantation 
owner who is president of the Specialty Coffee Assn. of Brazil. "But yesterday, 
the loss is much heavier. We are making the first calculations now, and we 
estimate that 30% of the crop has been lost." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bagley, a coffee trader from Machado & Co. in New York, was surveying 
the damage Monday on plantations in southern Minas Gerias. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to wait a few days to see exactly the extent of the 
damage, but it could mean a loss of as much as 10 (million) to 13 million bags 
of coffee production," he said. Brazil had been expected to harvest about 30 
million bags of coffee for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Brazil, the government is trying to hold down coffee prices locally and 
increase the amount of coffee available for export by auctioning much of an 
estimated 17 million bags it has in stock to local roasters at below-market 
prices. Earlier this month, it agreed to increase the amount for auction to 7.4 
million bags, from 2.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The government agreed to allow 500,000 bags of coffee to be auctioned monthly 
between August and May. Last month, the bags fetched between $120 and $160 
each.

COMPANY TOWN; MGM GETS $350-MILLION LINE OF CREDIT FROM BANKING SYNDICATE; 
FINANCING: DEAL WITH CHEMICAL BANK WILL HELP STUDIO FUND AMBITIOUS PRODUCTION 
SLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the most meaningful steps yet in its nearly year-old comeback 
campaign, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer said Monday that it has negotiated a $350-million 
line of credit with an international banking syndicate led by Chemical Bank 
that will help it fund production and distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is important to the Santa Monica-based studio for two reasons. While 
the studio does not need the money immediately, it provides another major 
source of backing for its ambitious production slate, which is aimed at 
returning MGM to the ranks of the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, it gives MGM a much-needed psychological boost. The funding from 
such banks as Wells Fargo, Bank of America and North Carolina's First Union and 
Chemical represents a major vote of confidence in MGM's comeback strategy, 
which includes reviving its television business and expanding into such areas 
as interactive media. 
</P>
<P>
 "MGM wanted to be able to tell the world that this business plan stands on its 
own two feet," said John Miller, a managing director at Chemical, which is 
serving as administrative agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America and Bank of New York will serve as managing agents. Others in 
the group as co-agents are Bank of Boston, ING Capital Corp., National 
Westminster Bank, Sumitomo Trust & Banking and Union Bank. MGM and Chemical 
officials said demand was heavy for the deal and that it was oversubscribed.  
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the list of banks does not include MGM's parent, French bank 
Credit Lyonnais. MGM Chairman Frank Mancuso confirmed that Credit Lyonnais had 
been invited to join the banking group but preferred to stay out of the deal, 
partly to send a message that the studio is not entirely dependent on the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is not totally reliant on its shareholder," Mancuso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Lyonnais inherited MGM in 1992 when the bank foreclosed on Italian 
financier Giancarlo Parretti. U.S. banking laws require that the bank divest 
the studio by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Mancuso, who formerly headed Paramount Pictures, was named nearly a year ago 
to run the studio while Credit Lyonnais cleaned up MGM's balance sheet by 
forgiving about $800 million in loans to the studio and agreeing to provide 
$400 million a year in operating funds. The bank is being advised on its MGM 
strategy by Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of MGM's plan since restructuring was to attract outside financing, which 
could happen only after its balance sheet was cleaned up. Mancuso said he is 
particularly pleased with the new arrangement because it shows that the banks 
believe the studio still has valuable assets in its 1,800-film library, which 
he argues is not nearly as encumbered as many people believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chemical deal has been in the works since January. Talks included unusual 
private meetings between each bank and studio managers led by Mancuso. 
Typically, such meetings are held with groups of bankers. 
</P>
<P>
 The financing comes as MGM is just a few months away from the release of the 
first films from its new regime, which also includes MGM Pictures chief Michael 
Marcus and John Calley, head of its United Artists Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The first film is expected to be the Christmas release of "Speechless," 
starring Michael Keaton and Geena Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio's summer has been mixed so far. The family film "Getting Even With 
Dad," starring Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson, proved a disappointment, but the 
action film "Blown Away," with Jeff Bridges and Tommy Lee Jones, gave MGM its 
biggest opening box office numbers in at least a decade.

NEW OWNERS TAKE OVER AT FAILED BANK; FINANCE: CHINO VALLEY MOVES INTO THE 
FULLERTON OFFICE OF DEFUNCT PIONEER, JUST DAYS AFTER SEIZURE BY REGULATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The main office of failed Pioneer Bank, a fixture in the center of Fullerton 
for 13 years, reopened Monday as a branch of fast-growing Chino Valley Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers flowed into the quaint main office, with its wide lobby, open center 
and mezzanine level of executive offices, but few of the local residents 
queuing up before eight tellers took all their money out, said D. Linn Wiley, 
Chino Valley's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley spent the day in the Fullerton office greeting some customers and 
calling others on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 State and federal regulators seized Pioneer on Friday night and sold $78.5 
million in deposits, along with the main branch, to the Ontario bank for $1.3 
million. Chino Valley did not acquire an additional $37 million in brokered 
deposits, which are large, high-interest accounts placed by out-of-state money 
brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 About $8 million in deposits were not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp., which insures deposits up to $100,000 for each account holder. But the 
agency immediately made half the uninsured amount available to depositors and 
said it will repay what it can later from the sale of bank loans and other 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino Valley has 30 days to decide what loans it might want to buy, Wiley 
said. The bank expects to buy about $30 million worth of loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiley said the bank will determine Friday how many of Pioneer's 56 employees 
will have jobs with Chino Valley. Pioneer's branches in Orange and Santa Ana 
will not be reopened, regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer, long suffering from bad real estate deals, had lost $13 million in 
the last 30 months. Its capital, the final reserve against losses, had dropped 
to $2 million, and its last hope for a buyer evaporated in the last two weeks, 
said Thomas R. Timmons, Pioneer's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmons was brought in 16 months ago to try to help the bank recover from 
continuing losses on real estate loans made primarily on strip shopping centers 
in the Inland Empire, mostly from Rancho Cucamonga through Corona to Lake 
Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmons said the bank had been talking with two separate investor groups when 
news reports near the end of June revealed that regulators had ordered the bank 
to raise its capital by the end of the month. Customers withdrew $5 million in 
deposits on June 29, causing a crisis in the bank's liquidity -- its ability to 
have enough cash on hand to repay depositors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Timmons said, appraisals on troubled real estate came in 
much lower than expected, and the bank had to write down the value of those 
loans by $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought things in the Inland Empire had bottomed out, but the values just 
continue to decline," he said. "We worked hard. We just didn't quite get it 
done. But the regulators hung in there with us as long as they could on the 
sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer is the first Orange County bank to fail this year and the 45th 
financial institution to collapse in the county since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino Valley, meantime, continues to grow. With Pioneer and other acquisitions 
this year, it expects to have $800 million in loans and other assets and 19 
branches in four counties. Last year, it bought the failed Mid City Bank in 
Brea and ended the year with $687 million in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in the northern portion of Orange County," Wiley said. "It 
complements our existing market area and branch network." 
</P>
<P>
 Chino Valley has never lost money and has increased earnings in each of its 20 
years except 1991, when profits slipped. It earned $9.9 million last year.

ANOTHER FORMER HONDA EXECUTIVE CHARGED IN SCANDAL PLEADS GUILTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former top sales executive for American Honda Motor Co. pleaded guilty 
Monday to racketeering charges in the federal government's ongoing probe of a 
bribery and kickback scandal that has rocked the Torrance-based importer and 
distributor of Honda cars. 
</P>
<P>
 David L. Pederson of Roswell, Ga., pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in 
Concord, N.H., to one count of obstruction of justice and one count of 
violating the Racketeer and Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as 
RICO.A sentencing date has not yet been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson, 45, admitted accepting tens of thousands of dollars in bribes from 
dealers seeking lucrative franchises for Honda's Acura luxury car line in New 
Hampshire, Connecticut, Georgia and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the 12th of 15 former American Honda sales executives charged with 
felonies in the case to plead guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial is set to begin Nov. 1 in Concord for the remaining defendants, 
including a Laguna Hills man, Stanley James Cardiges. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges, American Honda's senior vice president for sales until he resigned 
in 1992, has denied wrongdoing. He is charged with racketeering, mail and wire 
fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael J. Connolly in New Hampshire said Monday that 
the case is open and ongoing and that his office expects to bring additional 
charges against new defendants in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson was a sales executive with American Honda in from June, 1979, through 
June, 1992, and was a zone sales manager for the Acura division from 1989 
through 1992.

FORMER OWNER OF SUNSET MOTORS PLEADS GUILTY TO FRAUD; LAW: IRVINE-BASED RV 
DEALER WILLIAM P. WHITLEDGE JR. ADMITS TO BILKING THREE BANKS OF $2.8 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The former owner of now-bankrupt Sunset Motors, once the leading West Coast 
dealer of recreational vehicles, pleaded guilty Monday to bilking $2.8 million 
from three community banks. 
</P>
<P>
 William P. Whitledge Jr., whose $50-million network of RV sales stretched to 
Seattle and included such celebrity customers as actor Tom Cruise, admitted 
that he used RVs as collateral for loans when the RVs already backed other 
loans and when he didn't own them or sell them. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence gathered by the FBI and federal prosecutors showed that Whitledge was 
trying to prop up a company that was faltering during the recent recession, 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Elana S. Artson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest hit of the three banks defrauded was struggling Bank of Newport, 
which lost nearly $2.1 million to Whitledge's inventory financing fraud. 
Separately, the bank was defrauded of $4.5 million in a subsequent unrelated 
equipment leasing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitledge obtained lines of credit from the Newport Beach bank, Bank of Yorba 
Linda and Pacific Business Bank in Carson to finance his inventory of expensive 
motor homes. Sunset Motors was required to provide the banks with various 
documents, including ownership records and statements that the vehicles were 
free from all other liens. 
</P>
<P>
 But from March to mid-December, 1992, Whitledge drew on his lines of credit by 
providing the required documents on 16 motor coaches that had already been 
pledged to other lenders or had already been sold. In one case, prosecutors 
charged, he created a false sales contract to obtain loan money. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks lost money on the loans after the RVs were sold or repossessed by 
the original lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitledge faces 30 years in prison and a $1-million fine at his sentencing, 
scheduled for Oct. 17 before U.S. District Judge Linda H. McLaughlin in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 While Whitledge was trying to keep his enterprise afloat in 1992, he was 
telling the city of Fountain Valley and the news media that he was surviving 
the recession in fine fashion by selling motor homes ranging in price from 
$50,000 to $450,000. The city was trying to attract the Irvine company to a lot 
fronting the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-priced luxury coaches came with marble floors, microwave ovens, 
built-in bars, ice makers, coffee makers, oak cabinets, leather sofas, 
wallpapered bathrooms and satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides listing actor Cruise as a customer, Sunset Motors said it sold its 
custom coaches to former California Angels baseball stars Rod Carew and Bert 
Blyleven. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to survive, Sunset Motors consolidated offices and cut costs, but 
the slow sales from the recession finally sunk it. If filed a bankruptcy 
petition last year.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: SEC DROPS CONTEMPT ORDER AGAINST THE 3 OWNERS OF FIRST 
PENSION CORP.

<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn a contempt order asking a 
federal judge to jail the three owners of First Pension Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC had requested the order on June 10, saying that the three had not 
complied with a May 23 court order requiring them to provide the SEC with 
various financial records.The agency said Monday it now has those documents.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to work this out within the parties," said Lisa Gok, assistant 
regional director for the SEC in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the matter scheduled for today was canceled, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Cooper, Robert E. Lindley and Valerie Jensen are implicated in the 
loss of as much as $125 million of investors' funds in the collapse of the 
Irvine-based pension management firm. The three have agreed to plead guilty to 
federal criminal charges in the case.

HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY; NME TO SLASH EMPLOYMENT IN SANTA MONICA

<P>
 National Medical Enterprises said Monday that it will eliminate a quarter of 
the jobs at its Santa Monica headquarters to simplify operations and reduce 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 NME, which employs 900 people, said it will lay off 200 of them and eliminate 
40 jobs that currently are unfilled. Most of those laid off will be corporate 
personnel in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital operator, which last month pleaded guilty to eight criminal 
counts and agreed to pay a record $379 million to settle a government fraud 
investigation primarily involving activities at its psychiatric hospitals, said 
it expects to save $32 million a year after making the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has already paid more than $200 million to settle lawsuits brought 
by insurers and patients. The suits allege misdeeds such as false imprisonment, 
billing fraud and conspiracy. The government charged that NME paid kickbacks 
and bribes to doctors, referral services and others so patients would be 
referred to NME's psychiatric and substance-abuse hospitals in 30 states, then 
fraudulently billed Medicare and other federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring announced Monday comes after a three-month study by the 
McKinsey & Co. consulting firm. It is part of a corporate plan to focus on its 
35 general acute-care hospitals, which are the source of most of NME's profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the government settlement requires NME to sell its psychiatric 
and substance-abuse hospitals; the company recently agreed to sell 47 
psychiatric hospitals to Charter Medical Corp. for $200 million. So far, NME 
has agreed to sell 85 of the 135 hospitals and clinics it once owned. 
</P>
<P>
 NME's overhaul gives the firm "a more nimble, cost-effective corporate 
structure with which to compete in today's extremely competitive health care 
industry," said Jeffrey C. Barbakow, the chairman and chief executive who was 
hired last year to clean up the company. 
</P>
<P>
 NME is still studying the question of whether it will move to a new 
headquarters. It expects to have an answer by August, a company spokeswoman 
said. NME's current home base has 300,000 square feet of space, and the company 
no longer needs such a large headquarters, she said.

HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY; PACIFICARE TO FRANCHISE ELDERLY COVERAGE IN NORTHEAST 
</P>

<P>
 PacifiCare Health Systems, borrowing a rapid-expansion technique from other 
industries, said Monday that it will franchise its health maintenance 
organization program for the elderly.  
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to offer PacifiCare's Secure Horizons, a Medicare alternative 
program, through Tufts Associated Health Plans of Waltham, Mass., is the first 
of its kind in the industry.It could also be the first of several pacts that 
would allow the Cypress-based PacifiCare HMO to expand into a potentially huge 
market with less expense and fewer regulatory restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called Medicare risk programs such as Secure Horizons operate under federal 
approval. They offer Medicare recipients an alternative to fee-for-service 
hospitalization and physician coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 2 million of the 35 million Americans who are 65 or older are enrolled in 
HMOs, said Eleanor H. Kerns, an analyst with the brokerage Alex. Brown & Sons 
in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare says its Secure Horizons subsidiary is the nation's largest HMO for 
seniors, but its 360,000 members are concentrated in just five states: 
California, Oregon, Washington, Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulations make it costly and time-consuming for an HMO operator to 
start from scratch in new territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going into Massachusetts ourselves," said Craig Schub, head of 
Secure Horizons USA, "because the rules say you have to have a commercial HMO 
in the same area you have a Medicare HMO." By marketing itself through Tufts, 
Secure Horizon can use Tufts' 340,000 commercial HMO clients to justify signing 
up 340,000 Medicare clients.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MEXICAN PLANT IS ROLLING, SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Industries International Inc., a Van Nuys-based supplier of aluminum 
wheels to the automotive industry, said it has made the first delivery of 
wheels from its new production plant in Chihuahua, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis L. Borick, the company's president and chairman, said the first shipment 
from the plant was sent via truck about July 1 to a Ford Motor Co. plant near 
Mexico City.Borick said a second shipment to a Chrysler plant in Mexico is 
expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The company operates six wheel production plants, one in Van Nuys, four 
elsewhere in the United States and the newest one in Mexico. Borick said the 
260,000-square-foot, $35-million facility began preliminary production in 
January and started regular production in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to initially produce about 600,000 wheels annually at the 
Chihuahua plant. Once additional equipment is added by early 1995, the plant 
will be able to produce more than 1 million wheels a year and employ up to 400 
people, the company said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: ROYAL CASINO GROUP SEEKS RIVERBOAT DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Royal Casino Group Inc., an Agoura Hills-based company with no major assets, 
is trying to get into the gaming industry. It said it is a finalist for a 
riverboat gambling concession in a small Missouri town and is pursuing a 
similar project in Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon F. Elliott, president and chief executive officer of Royal Casino, said 
officials in New Madrid, a Missouri town of about 3,400 people along the 
Mississippi River, have said they will decide between Royal Casino and a rival 
bidder by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, with an expected development cost of nearly $11 million, would 
involve a riverboat casino, and dockside restaurant and lounge, Elliott said. 
Royal Casino said it has a large company as a partner in the proposed venture, 
but Elliott would not identify the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Casino is also trying to locate a dockside gambling site along the river 
in Mississippi, Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Casino, whose stock is traded over-the-counter, was renamed in January 
from Capitol Television Network Inc. after it failed to form a new television 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott said his firm, with various potential partners, hopes to develop 20 to 
40 casinos in small- to mid-sized markets in coming years, contingent on 
regulatory approvals and raising capital.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: HEALTH NET MOVES INTO WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based Health Net, the state's second largest health maintenance 
organization, is expanding into the workers' compensation market in California 
by offering managed medical services for injured workers who are covered by 
self-insured employers and other workers' compensation providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The move by the unit of Health Systems International Inc. is the latest of 
several by California HMOs to directly or indirectly enter the workers' 
compensation market following recent state legislative reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its new COMP-24 program, Health Net will provide a network of 
physicians, hospitals and other providers to manage medical services for 
workers' compensation cases. The HMO previously had not provided medical 
services for workers' compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Health Net also announced its first contract to provide that service in 
California, to clients of AIG Claim Services Inc., a subsidiary of American 
International Group Inc., which claims to be the largest underwriter of 
commercial and industrial insurance in the United States.

BIOTECH'S VICTORY ON HOLD; AMGEN IS AMONG 3 FIRMS CLAIMING A BREAKTHROUGH IN 
BLOOD SCIENCE, WHILE WALL STREET YAWNS AND WAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thrombopoietin was given its unwieldy name before anyone was sure it existed. 
For decades, this mystery hormone was the Holy Grail of blood science -- 
believed to be a mere speck in the vast reaches of the blood system, but one 
with awesome power to make blood clot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three biotechnology companies, including Thousands Oaks-based Amgen Inc., 
say they've found the speck, and cloned it. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcements, made within a month of each other, represent a breakthrough 
for science and hope for thousands of cancer patients, whose blood often loses 
the ability to clot during treatment. Doctors now rely on risky transfusions to 
keep such patients from bleeding to death, and they're elated at the news about 
thrombopoietin. "We all want to get our hands on it," said Stephanie Williams, 
a doctor who treats cancer patients in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial analysts, though, are more stoic. As promising as the discovery 
appears to be, it is five years or more from the market. Wall Street is more 
interested in what new products these companies have to offer now.  
</P>
<P>
 And for Amgen, that's not much. Under the leadership of chief executive Gordon 
Binder, the company is still going strong with two, hugely successful products 
it developed in the late 1980s. Thanks to those two blood cell-producing drugs, 
Epogen and Neupogen, 14-year-old Amgen is now the world's premier biotechnology 
company, with a 1993 profit of $383.3 million on revenue of $1.37 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Neupogen alone were $719.4 million in 1993. If thrombopoietin is 
approved, most analysts estimate its sales could range from $250 million to 
$500 million per year. Demand could be even higher if it turns out that higher 
doses of chemotherapy -- which might become more common with the drug in use -- 
are effective in fighting cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The long process of getting approval for thrombopoietin starts with animal 
tests. Then, the Food and Drug Administration requires three separate phases of 
clinical trials on humans, followed by an FDA review. The process can take 
years, and for new, genetically-engineered products, development costs are 
typically $250 million to $400 million, according to Amgen. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say they are looking for a more immediate encore to Epogen and 
Neupogen that would propel Amgen's growth through the end of the decade, after 
sales of its existing products level off. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrombopoietin "has captured people's imagination . . . but in terms of the 
commercial aspects, this is still a long way off," said Edmund A. Debler, an 
analyst at the health-care investment firm Mehta and Isaly in New York. 
"Amgen's (research) pipeline is still weak." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a criticism that's been leveled at Amgen before. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Amgen is still credited for its stunning rise, some now say its 
streak has faded. Debler, the analyst, said the problem is this: Although Amgen 
should continue to be profitable, a gap in its growth may come in the late 
1990s because the company has come up with no new, blockbuster products that 
will hit the market by then. This, despite a mammoth budget for research: 
Amgen's research-and-development budget totaled $255 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem can't be solved by thrombopoietin, which has come too late to 
tide Amgen over for the rest of this decade, Debler said. Neupogen and Epogen 
"made Amgen the company of the '80s. But what will make them the company of 
2000?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such nay-saying is the curse of success, responded Amgen's senior vice 
president for research, Daniel Vapnek. While acknowledging that thrombopoietin 
is "the most exciting thing we have now," Vapnek was adamant that there is 
nothing wrong with Amgen's science. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he said, the problem is undue expectations built upon the company's 
explosive entry into the market. Biotechnology "is a home-run business," he 
said, and Amgen hit two early on with Neupogen and Epogen. "It's difficult to 
come up with products like that on a regular basis," said Vapnek. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether thrombopoietin will be another home run depends on how well Amgen 
fares against its competitors in the race for a patent. 
</P>
<P>
 South San Francisco-based Genentech, and Seattle-based Zymogenetics Inc., a 
subsidiary of Novo Nordisk A/S of Denmark, published their findings on 
thrombopoietin in the June 16 issue of the British journal Nature. Amgen -- 
which is working on thrombopoietin with the pharmaceutical arm of Japan's Kirin 
Brewery -- published its report July 1 in the American journal Cell. All three 
appear to have isolated the same molecule and are now poised to begin the 
various stages of clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because all three companies published their results so close together, a 
protracted patent process, possibly ending in a court battle, seems inevitable, 
said Debler, the analyst. In this country, "it will probably come down to 
opening up the lab books to see who found it first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, the companies could avoid a court battle by settling among 
themselves and marketing the drug jointly, added Debler. But that would mean 
sharing the potential profits from sales of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The route to market may be quicker if thrombopoietin proves as effective as 
early signs indicate. The three companies appear to have cloned the same highly 
specific, highly potent molecule that the body manufactures to stimulate the 
production of certain blood cells called platelets. 
</P>
<P>
 Platelets are wafer-shaped cells that cause blood to clot. Without them, you 
would bleed to death, either after cutting yourself, or through spontaneous 
internal bleeding that can't be stopped once it's started. 
</P>
<P>
 Platelets pose big problems for cancer patients undergoing certain types of 
chemotherapy, which involves bombarding the body with poisonous drugs that kill 
cancer cells. "They try to give the dose that kills the tumor without killing 
the person," explained Don Foster, a molecular biologist at Zymogenetics and 
senior author of the Nature paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemotherapy can lead to the loss of certain blood cells. Patients who lose 
too many white blood cells get infections; those that lose too many platelets 
have problems with bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs are available that help replenish white blood cells -- including Amgen's 
Neupogen. But so far, there is no corresponding drug to replenish platelets. 
</P>
<P>
 That means doctors must limit doses of chemotherapy to give the blood a chance 
to restore platelet levels -- hence, the grueling back-and-forth race of cancer 
treatment, in which chemical attacks on tumors are reined in just long enough 
to give the blood a breather. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors try to give the body an edge by using other, secondary treatments, 
such as platelet transfusions. But these are difficult, risky and expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, some patients develop immunity to platelet transfusions, creating a 
profound dilemma for patient and doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is often to continue chemotherapy and hope the patient doesn't 
bleed to death, said Gary Schiller, a doctor who treats leukemia and other 
cancer patients at UCLA's Bowyer Oncology Center. "Sometimes there are 
miracles." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors believe that doses of thrombopoietin could induce a frenzy of 
platelet-making in the blood, allowing chemotherapy to resume. That could 
eliminate the need for platelet transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible applications of the drug could include speeding recovery of 
cancer patients after bone marrow transplants and treatment of various blood 
disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, hopes for thrombopoietin are high -- some say unduly so for a 
substance that was just a name and a mystery until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "It clearly is the right thing. . . . This is the missing puzzle piece in how 
the bone marrow manufactures blood cells," enthused Zymogenetics' Foster, 
noting that the substance yielded a 400% increase in platelet production when 
administered to mice. 
</P>
<P>
 But that confidence may take a while to reach Wall Street: "The medical 
experts get excited," said Joyce Lonergan, an analyst at the investment firm 
Cowen & Co. in New York. "But you become jaded as a biotech analyst."

FORMER TURNAROUND EXPERT GOES ON TRIAL FOR FRAUD; TECHNOLOGY: Q.T. WILES OF 
SHERMAN OAKS IS ACCUSED OF PROFITING FROM FALSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT 
DISK-DRIVE MAKER MINISCRIBE, THE LAST FIRM HE WAS HIRED TO SAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trial of Sherman Oaks resident Quentin Thomas (Q.T.) Wiles, once renowned 
in high-technology circles for saving troubled companies, began Monday with 
opening arguments before Chief Judge Richard P. Matsch in U.S. District Court 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles, 74, faces three criminal counts of fraud related to the last company he 
was hired to save, Longmont, Colo.-based MiniScribe Corp., which filed for 
bankruptcy five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Wiles took part in a scheme to defraud investors by 
issuing false financial statements, then profited from stock sales. It also 
alleges that he illegally obtained a bank loan under fraudulent pretenses. Each 
of the three counts carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a 
$250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles' career at MiniScribe, a computer disk-drive maker, began in 1985. The 
company was posting losses, and Wiles, who worked for the San Francisco 
venture-capital and investment-banking firm Hambrecht & Quist, had a reputation 
as a trouble-shooter of rare talent. He was sent to MiniScribe to clean things 
up, and as chairman of the company he was initially credited with helping to 
bring about a sales increase from $115 million in 1985 to $603 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period, MiniScribe went from a loss of $16.8 million to reported 
earnings of $25.8 million, and the company's stock became a Wall Street 
favorite, quintupling in the first two years of Wiles' management. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1988, intense price competition in the computer-equipment market 
resulted in a loss at MiniScribe in the fourth quarter. Wiles resigned shortly 
after. 
</P>
<P>
 New management then reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it 
had uncovered inaccurate reports about earnings at MiniScribe. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, concealment efforts included shipping bricks packaged as disk 
drives to boost inventory numbers, according to the indictment, which was filed 
in Colorado in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wiles' attorney, H. Alan Dill, of the Denver law firm Dill, Dill, Carr & 
Stonbraker, said that Wiles did not know about the misdeeds being committed by 
his underlings at MiniScribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill said that Wiles lived in California and visited the Colorado firm only 
twice during his four-year tenure as its chairman and chief executive officer. 
Wiles' reliance on subordinates resulted in his being duped, Dill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill said former MiniScribe employees have been given immunity from federal 
prosecution. Prosecutors declined to comment on the case. Wiles "was as much a 
victim of it as anyone else was," added lawyer Cary Lerman of the Los Angeles 
firm Munger, Tolles & Olson, a member of the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles is the second person to face criminal charges in the case. Patrick J. 
Schleibaum, MiniScribe's former chief financial officer, was found guilty of 
two felony counts of filing a false statement with the SEC and insider trading 
before a federal jury in Denver last month. Schleibaum awaits sentencing.  
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed in federal court in Denver resulted in a 1992 settlement in 
which the defendants agreed to pay a total of $128 million. Another lawsuit was 
also settled after a jury in Texas found MiniScribe's former management liable 
for more than $250 million in damages in a case brought by the company's 
bondholders. Other civil suits that resulted from MiniScribe's collapse are 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense in Wiles' criminal case pivots on a meeting prosecutors allege 
took place in October, 1987, in which an executive showed Wiles a memo that 
said the company's inventory had a shortfall of millions of dollars. 
Prosecutors allege that Wiles ordered the memo destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiles' attorneys deny this. They say Wiles couldn't believe the shortfall 
existed, and told his subordinates to go back and take another count. Later, he 
assumed the matter had been resolved, said Dill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the case comes down to that meeting," said Lerman.  
</P>
<P>
 Wiles could not be reached for comment. His attorneys said he is no longer 
working and has temporarily moved out of his Sherman Oaks home, which was 
damaged in the Northridge earthquake and is being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Dill takes pains to point out that during Wiles' long career, he was the 
antithesis of the infamous corporate raiders of the 1980s. They bought and 
dismembered healthy companies, but Wiles restored sick companies to health, 
Dill said. For MiniScribe, it made little difference. MiniScribe has since been 
liquidated, and its assets were bought by Maxtor Corp.

 Soligen manufactures machinery that translates a design on a computer screen 
into a ceramic casting, which is then used to form objects from molten metal. 
In the past, the company has produced small numbers of metal parts by 
subcontracting with foundries. Now, with the acquisition of A-RPM, Soligen will 
begin production of metal parts on its own. 
</P>
<P>
 A-RPM has annual revenues of $1.5 million. For the fiscal fourth quarter that 
ended March 31, Soligen had a loss of $604,447 compared to a loss of $49,860 
for the same quarter a year earlier. The recent loss was on a 85% plunge in 
revenue to $87,251.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AMGEN GETS APPROVAL FOR EXPANDED USE OF EPOGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen Inc., the Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology company, said it has 
received government approval for expanded use of its red blood cell-producing 
factor Epogen. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug can now be given to patients experiencing only moderate loss of red 
blood cells. Previously, Epogen use was restricted to patients with severe red 
blood cell loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Epogen is commonly given to replenish the red blood cells of patients 
receiving kidney dialysis. The company projected that, at least in the short 
term, effects on sales resulting from expanded use of Epogen would be minimal. 
Sales of Epogen were $586.9 million in 1993.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VACANCY RATES DROP IN BURBANK AND GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vacancy rates in the Burbank and Glendale office space markets declined during 
the second quarter ended June 30, according to a study by Glendale-based CB 
Commercial Real Estate Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Among office buildings with 100,000 square feet of space or more, the total 
vacancy rate in Burbank dipped to 6.7% at the end of the second quarter, the 
report said, down from 8.9% for the first quarter.In the second quarter a year 
ago, the vacancy rate among such buildings was 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank has 11 buildings in the 100,000-square-foot category for a total 
availability of 2.5 million square feet. Total vacancy reflects office space 
immediately available, whether through a direct-lease or sub-lease arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Glendale, the vacancy rate for the recent quarter was 12.2%, compared to 
14.6% for the previous quarter, and 14.4% for the second quarter of 1993. 
Glendale has 16 buildings with 100,000 square feet or more, for a total 
availability of 3.59 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burbank continues to benefit from the office requirements of media-related 
companies," said William R. Boyd, senior vice president at CB Commercial. 
"Glendale benefits from companies not able to find available space in Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 Including smaller office buildings -- those with 30,000 square feet or more -- 
the vacancy rate at the end of the second quarter was 9.5% in Burbank and 13.2% 
in Glendale. Both figures represented slight declines from the previous 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Among buildings with 30,000 square feet or more, the vacancy rates of other 
cities covered by the report include 26.8% in North Hollywood, 18.5% in Studio 
City, and 7.4% in Universal City. Rates for previous quarters were not 
available for these cities, a CB Commercial spokesman said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SALE OF AILING WATERCOURT VIEWED WITH OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The comeback of the county's commercial real estate market is illustrated by 
the sale earlier this month of the long-troubled Watercourt at Westlake Village 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the 170,000-square-foot development is only 57% leased, 18 offers 
were made when it was put on the market by Bank of America, which had acquired 
the property through foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Principe of Westcord/Westoaks Commercial Group, who represented a 
Malibu-based partnership that purchased the complex, declined to disclose the 
purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Trammell Crow Co. bought the property for $12 million five years 
ago and spent an additional $10 million to refurbish it. Bank of America later 
took the property back after Trammell Crow's mortgage payments fell behind 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Watercourt, formerly known as the Olive Grove Shopping Center, is on Hampshire 
Road just west of the Ventura Freeway.

<TEXT>
<P>
 LTC Properties Inc., an Oxnard-based real estate investment trust, has 
acquired five skilled nursing facilities with a total of 600 beds in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 LTC paid $23 million for the centers and also provided $3.5 million in 
financing on another Florida facility, reports Andre C. Dimitriadis, the 
trust's chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The deals, along with mortgage loans made on two other nursing centers in 
California and Arizona, bring to $32.4 million the amount invested by LTC in 
the past two weeks -- a record for the 2-year-old trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we've been working on these projects for quite a while," 
Dimitriadis said. "They all happened to wind up at about the same time." He 
said all six Florida properties will be managed by Horizon Healthcare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that LTC has commitments to fund $19.1 million more in health 
care-related investments in the near future.

<P>
 Damaco Inc., a producer of lightweight wheelchairs, has outgrown its former 
Chatsworth plant and moved to a new location in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The move brings 35 jobs to Ventura County, but most of the employees who 
worked at the firm's former plant on Plummer Street in Chatsworth will commute 
to Moorpark, says Marjorie Bantle, Damaco's corporate secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be hiring only five new assembly workers to replace people who decided 
against staying with us," said Bantle, whose husband, David Bantle, is the 
company's president. 
</P>
<P>
 Damaco, which makes powered and nonpowered wheelchairs, purchased a 
25,000-square-foot building on Maureen Lane in Moorpark for an undisclosed 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's new home is twice as large as its former location.

 Companies in the east county expect to increase their payrolls by 14% in the 
next five years, according to a survey conducted by Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 The federally funded study found that 73 responding companies expect to hire 
2,500 new workers by mid-1999, according to Vicki Bortolussi, the college's 
dean of vocational education. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies, mostly in Camarillo, Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, now have 
17,600 full- and part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new positions will be in manufacturing, engineering, customer 
service, accounting, nursing and scientific research, the study showed.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: BANK'S TALKS ABOUT SALE CALLED 'VERY PRELIMINARY' BY CEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the news that Ventura County National Bancorp is discussing a possible 
merger with an unnamed suitor, there's no assurance that the merger will ever 
take place. That's the word from Richard S. Cupp, president and chief executive 
of the company and its chief subsidiary, Ventura County National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things are start-and-stop all the time," Cupp says. "The talks are very 
preliminary, but we feel we owe it to our stockholders to pursue every possible 
means of maximizing the value of their shares." 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp says there's no connection between the planned spinoff of Ventura County 
National Bancorp's Frontier Bank subsidiary, which was announced last week, and 
discussions regarding the possible sale of Ventura County National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontier, which has offices in La Palma and Wilmington, is to be sold for 
about $7 million to Palos Verdes-based Peninsula National Bank. The sale, Cupp 
concedes, is tied to regulators' demands that the holding company boost its 
capital position. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's been no demand -- not even a suggestion -- that we be acquired by 
another bank," he said. In fact, Cupp said, the bank holding company has come a 
long way in its struggle to solve its problems of the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've reduced the value of our nonperforming loans by about 50% in the past 
year," said Cupp, who replaced William E. McAleer as Ventura County National 
Bancorp's chief executive in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the reduction came when Ventura County National Bank sold its home 
mortgage division last May to CUB Funding Corp. of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bank, with $316 million in assets, has four locations: 
a main office in Oxnard and branches in Ventura, Camarillo and Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County National Bancorp, the parent company, suffered a net loss of 
$12.1 million in 1993, but reduced its losses in this year's first quarter to 
$114,000 from a $1.58 million loss in the same period a year earlier.

DESIGNS ON THE FUTURE; WITH THE SOUTHLAND A CRUCIAL BATTLEGROUND, CAR MAKERS 
ARE ASKING LOCAL STUDIOS TO SHAPE TOMORROW'S AUTOMOBILES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles W. O. Ellwood, an English-born car designer who has spent the bulk of 
his career in Germany, had an automotive epiphany when he arrived in Southern 
California last October to take the helm at Volkswagen's Simi Valley design 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 American drivers' fascination with cup holders, he says, suddenly made sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't drive the speeds we drive in Europe and use cup holders. It's just 
too dangerous," says Ellwood, 39, formerly chief of interior design at 
Volkswagen in Wolfsburg, Germany. "But here, you're living in the vehicle, 
you're drinking in the vehicle, the kids are moving back and forth. You're 
doing a lot of things other than driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Car makers have been making similar realizations since they began flocking to 
the West Coast 20 years ago. From the cup holders that pop out of dashboards to 
the sleek coupes pulling out of driveways, the Southern California influence 
has been profound. 
</P>
<P>
 Most designs are still produced in Detroit, Tokyo, Wolfsburg and other motor 
cities. But today 16 satellite studios are sprinkled throughout the Southland, 
including five in the San Fernando Valley and Ventura County region. From 
Camarillo to Valencia, designers in the area are shaping the futures of General 
Motors, Ford, Volvo, BMW, Volkswagen and Audi. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the five local studios have come up with an array of designs that 
have captured worldwide attention, including electric car designs from Volvo 
and BMW that are not yet scheduled for production, but may enable those 
companies to thrive in California as tough new emissions regulations take hold. 
The two domestic studios have produced designs -- the 1993 Ford Probe and the 
1994 Chevrolet Camaro -- that have resuscitated sports coupe models whose sales 
had faltered. And Volkswagen's update of the classic Beetle has generated so 
much excitement among long-despondent Volkswagen faithful that the company, 
which had been hesitant to revive the model, is talking of delivering the new 
Beetle to dealers in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their sparkle, these successes are already distant memories for the 
studios, where designers are under the gun to divine today what the public will 
want at the turn of the century. The stakes are monumental. To go from sketches 
on a page to cars on the road can take more than five years and cost upward of 
$1 billion. And after losing market share to consumer-attentive Japanese auto 
manufacturers in the 1980s, American and European car makers know they cannot 
afford to neglect a single nuance of a car's design. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas V. Peters, head of GM's studio in Newbury Park, says flatly: "This is 
war." 
</P>
<P>
 California, then, is a strategic battlefront. The state accounts for 10% of 
new car registrations in the United States each year, and 3% of new car 
registrations in the world. To succeed in California, car makers have decided, 
it makes sense to be in California, where the sun splashes off a car's finish, 
revealing the flaws or grace of every curve; where car-crazy consumers are 
quick to embrace a fresh design, and quicker to discard a stale one; and where 
cultural trends seem to land like drops of water that ripple through the rest 
of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Local studios scour the Southern California landscape for hints of shifting 
consumer tastes, looking for cues in everything from computer terminals to 
athletic shoes. They pore over hundreds of magazines each month, noting 
emerging clothing styles and advertising strategies. Some have even adopted an 
academic approach. Volvo's Camarillo design center, for example, employs a 
staff sociologist to track changes in consumer attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a think tank," says Sylvia S. Voegele, general manager at Volvo's 
studio. "When we present a design, we also present who we think it would sell 
to and why." 
</P>
<P>
 Always wary of industrial espionage, the studios guard their ideas zealously, 
hiding behind smoked-glass windows that are impenetrable to an outsider's gaze. 
Within the studios, work stations lie behind doors with magnetic security 
locks. Drawings and documents are locked away or shredded, and employees are 
required to sign contracts pledging to protect their company's secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual budgets at the studios fall in the $2 million to $4 million range, and 
each center employs about half a dozen designers, with total employment ranging 
from 15 at Volvo to 30 at GM. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five local studios -- Ford, GM, Volkswagen and Volvo -- are 
satellite operations of, or are under exclusive contracts with, the 
manufacturers they represent. The exception, Designworks/USA in Newbury Park, 
works on products ranging from light-rail cars to garden tools, in addition to 
the work the company does for BMW. It was Designworks' expertise in seat design 
that caught the German auto maker's attention in the late 1980s, says Charles 
W. Pelly, president of Designworks. BMW has since purchased 60% of Designworks' 
stock, and now accounts for a third of the studio's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio assignments range from the simple -- a request for a new rim design, 
for example -- to the seemingly impossible. "Detroit could direct us to explore 
the youth market and deliver what we think that group will embrace in 1998," 
says Richard J. Hutting, chief executive at Ford's Concept Center California 
Inc. in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But typically, the manufacturer will specify a wheelbase and engine layout, 
then request a new design or an update of a model already in production. As 
soon as the order arrives, designers commence sketching, and the weeding out 
process begins. Designers compete with other designers within the studio; 
studios compete with other studios within the company; and, finally, companies 
compete with other companies in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's studio in Valencia has fared well in these contests. Hastily assembled 
in 1983 after GM had laid plans for its Newbury Park facility, the Ford studio 
produced a winner right away -- the 1989 edition Thunderbird. Since then, the 
studio has had a string of successes, including a major influence on the 1993 
Probe. Sales of that year's model of the sports coupe surged 42% from 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But now even Hutting acknowledges that Ford, the domestic design leader since 
introducing the top-selling Taurus sedan in the mid-1980s, has surrendered the 
mantle to Chrysler, whose striking new car line was developed at the Chrysler 
Pacifica studio in Carlsbad. Ford, Hutting says, must search for ways to 
reassert itself. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key challenges will be to anticipate future trends in the minivan 
and sport utility vehicle markets, segments that barely existed a decade ago, 
but last year accounted for 16% of Ford's domestic sales, or 564,916 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for clues to the future of these markets, Hutting and his design 
team are paying close attention to societal trends, such as the four-day 
workweek. If that trend broadens, consumers may use vehicles less for commuting 
and more for leisure. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Hutting says, customers may want their utility vehicles "more 
car-like or more truck-like. We have to decide and make a commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 GM, meanwhile, must find a way to turn back the tide. The company has watched 
its share of car sales in the United States slip from 44% in 1983 to 32% last 
year, and design leadership has shouldered much of the blame. While Ford was 
turning heads with the Taurus, GM was turning stomachs with the Caprice, a 
whale of a car that went belly-up on arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had simply become "out of touch," says Peters, chief designer at 
GM's Advanced Concepts Center in Newbury Park. "They needed a wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters and his staff may have helped to provide it. The 1994 Chevrolet Camaro, 
based largely on an aerodynamic Newbury Park design, has been such an instant 
hit that analysts are saying GM may start paying increased attention to its 
sometimes-neglected California studio. U. S. sales of the Camaro and its 
Pontiac Firebird sibling totaled 76,602 during the first five months of 1994, 
compared to sales of just 21,509 garnered by the previous design during the 
same period of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM finally gets it," says Gordon Wangers, an analyst with Vista-based 
Automotive Marketing Consultants Inc. "The Camaro could be a car that will turn 
GM around." 
</P>
<P>
 At Volkswagen, similar hopes are being pinned on the Concept One, the working 
name for a smooth, symmetrical successor to the classic Beetle that was a 
best-seller for generations of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Beetle sales peaked at 367,607 in 1969, but Volkswagen sales have fallen 
off the charts since 1977, when the last Beetle was sold in the United States. 
Last year, amid production problems at the company's Mexico plants, U. S. sales 
dipped below 50,000 units, and trade magazines even began reporting rumors of a 
Volkswagen pullout from the U. S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Concept One is built -- and Volkswagen has signaled it probably will be 
-- it can't be expected to bring back 1970s-era market share for the German 
auto maker. But Volkswagen spokeswoman Lana Ferrari says that since January, 
when the Concept One was unveiled at the Detroit auto show, the company has 
fielded 30,000 calls and collected 5,000 letters from VW fans urging the 
company to build the new Beetle. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its nostalgic appeal, the Concept One is no replica, says Ellwood, 
head of Volkswagen's Simi Valley studio. The car is capable of being powered 
electrically -- an important capacity because California law requires that 2% 
of all vehicles sold in the state in 1998 be emission-free. Unlike its 
predecessor, the car also has an up-front engine, front-wheel drive, anti-lock 
brakes, dual air bags, and, of course . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Cup holders front and rear," Ellwood says with a chuckle. "We paid particular 
attention to that."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: CREATIVE COMPUTER'S INCOME RISES IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Creative Computer Applications Inc., a Calabasas-based company that sells 
automated data-handling systems for hospitals and medical laboratories, 
reported a sharp rise in net income for its fiscal third quarter that ended May 
31. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income for the quarter was $286,313, compared to $90,013 in net income 
reported for the same quarter a year ago.Sales for the quarter were up slightly 
to $1.85 million from $1.82 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nine-month period that ended May 31, the company reported a net loss 
of $88,892 on sales of $3.95 million. A year earlier, the company reported net 
income of $121,163 on sales of $4.66 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the nine-month results were hampered by damage to facilities 
caused by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. Steven M. Besbeck, chief executive 
of the company, said the quake triggered the office sprinkler system, soaking 
equipment and inventory, and disrupting operations for seven weeks.

BOOKS & AUTHORS: ALONG FOR THE RIDE; JO-ANN MAPSON IS ON THE 'BLUE RODEO' 
CIRCUIT, BUT SHE'D RATHER BE WRITING IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a handful of rave reviews in tow, Jo-Ann Mapson has left on the second 
leg of a 22-city publicity tour for her new contemporary Western novel "Blue 
Rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa author's itinerary during the next two weeks includes stops in 
Boston and New York followed by sweeps through Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, however, she'd rather be in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writers are hermits," Mapson said before leaving Friday. "Writers like to 
stay home. It takes a lot of alchemy to change your personality into a public 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 The thought of promotion -- a round of newspaper interviews, readings and 
signings -- never played a big role in Mapson's dream of becoming a published 
author. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what a publicity tour 
involves," said Mapson, 42. "It's a business trip basically: There's many plane 
rides, a different hotel room every night that you get to between 10 and 
midnight. You get one meal a day if you're lucky; the rest of the time you're 
eating airport peanuts." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's no guarantee how many people will even show up at a book signing.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Mapson has been pleased with the turnouts for signings in the Pacific 
Northwest, the Southwest and the Midwest during the first half of her publicity 
tour in June, she acknowledged that "sometimes there's no one there, and the 
publicity didn't arrive, or the books aren't there. You never know what's going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said for book reviews. But Mapson needn't worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Rodeo" (HarperCollins; $22) is receiving even more flattering reviews 
than her 1993 critically acclaimed first novel, the Orange County-set "Hank & 
Chloe." 
</P>
<P>
 A review in the New York Times praised Mapson's "tart and funny prose," 
likening the Southwestern romance to "a pleasing piece of country music." The 
Los Angeles Times calls it a "romantic, elegant, low-keyed Western for our 
time."  
</P>
<P>
 Set in secluded northwestern New Mexico, "Blue Rodeo" tells the story of 
Margaret (Maggie) Yearwood, a just-turned-40 woman who is intent on building a 
new life. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotionally reeling from an unexpected divorce from her Hollywood screenwriter 
husband and the sudden deafness of her teen-age son, Peter, from a bout with 
meningitis, Maggie has moved into a rented farmhouse in the tiny town of Blue 
Dog to establish state residency so her son can attend a boarding school for 
the deaf.  
</P>
<P>
 Peter, embittered by his parent's divorce and struggling to figure out how he 
fits in the deaf and hearing worlds, angrily shuns his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 But like "Hank & Chloe," Mapson's new novel is also a love story. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie's new neighbor is middle-aged cowboy Owen Garrett, a man with a past 
he'd just as soon forget: "a sorry night" in Colorado when, with a quart of 
whiskey under his belt to numb the news that his wife had left him for another 
man and taken their daughter with her, he accidentally killed a man in a 
pointless bar fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by Publishers Weekly as "the Marlboro man with a tender and 
sensitive streak," the earthy, working-class Owen and the brooding, equally 
honest Maggie form a friendship that quickly turns to romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They remind each other of the simple things in life, the simple pleasures, 
and I think they reaffirm in each other that there's someone inside each of 
them worthy of love," Mapson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romance is a recurrent element in Mapson's fiction, and she has no 
reservations about "Blue Rodeo" being referred to as a contemporary Western 
romance.  
</P>
<P>
 As she sees it, "the term romance has totally been trashed. Everyone thinks of 
bodice-rippers. Romance has to do with a whole way of life, the landscape and 
history, rather than just tearing your clothes off." 
</P>
<P>
 Her next novel, "Shadow Ranch," which she is writing under a new two-book 
contract, features a romance between an 80-year-old former citrus grower and 
the ex-stripper he marries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to write about love because that's what we're all about," Mapson said. 
"That's why we do everything we do. I just think it's fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson said she borrowed her novel's title, "Blue Rodeo," from the name of a 
song written by Laguna Beach author T. Jefferson Parker's late wife, Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her voice is so poignant it still makes me cry every time I listen to the 
tape," she said. "I think the song is about kind of a greater good than just 
what we humans do on Earth, and it's about loss and the kind of love that you 
have to have to let somebody go. The first time I heard it, it gave me chills 
up and down my spine, and I could never stop thinking about it, and I thank 
Jeff from the bottom of my heart for letting me use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson said she has constantly been asked on her book tour to explain the 
meaning of the novel's title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's two things that go into the title," she said. "One is that 
blue is a real spiritual color; it's a healing color in the Native American 
culture. The other thing is the idea of rodeo being kind of like an event where 
you are trying to stay on a wild creature. And that's another aspect of this 
book: the difficulties these people go through. It's much like being in a 
rodeo." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson said she doesn't sit down to write with a deliberate message in her 
novels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get nervous when people say, 'What are the themes in your book?' -- a 
question my editor asks frequently," she said. "I'm not the type of writer who 
sets out with a deliberate theme in mind. Maybe something evolves over the 
course of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my main character, Maggie, learns that the depth of love she has for 
her son surpasses his difficulties as a teen-ager, and she figures out she's 
got the courage to go on. Owen learns that he can't be rootless any more. He's 
got to go back and fix his past." 
</P>
<P>
 As for teen-aged Peter, "I don't know if an adolescent can learn anything, " 
Mapson said with a laugh, then added: "He learns to trust again, and he learns 
to trust women, and he just basically tries to find his place in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson said she always taps "real-life people" in creating her characters, but 
Maggie and Owen are "mainly a conglomeration of different people" she knows. As 
for Peter, she laughed and said her 16-year-old son, Jack, "will probably 
forgive me some day." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson, in fact, dedicated the book to her son: "For Jack: listen up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope," she said, "that maybe in 10 or 20 years he can go back and read it 
and realize all the Angst and the unhappiness that happened during these 
(teen-age) years was really supported by a great deal of love." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson said she and her son are both getting along "great now, but the last 
four years -- oh, my God. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that Jack taught me the lesson in this book. It wasn't so much me 
saying to him, 'Listen to this, you little dope.' It was more him saying to me, 
'This is what pain is like when you're an adolescent.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson's son also provided inspiration for the character of Peter in another 
way: He has a moderate hearing loss in one ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a couple of classes of sign language together, and our teacher was 
deaf," Mapson said. "I asked the teacher if there are any heroes for the deaf 
in literature. He told me there weren't. Moreover, it was really difficult for 
those who are profoundly deaf from birth to find their way into literature, so 
I thought I'd try to put a character who lost his hearing, which is something I 
could imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson, who has been riding horses since she was a child and has owned a horse 
the past 12 years, figures she'll always write about the contemporary Western 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still very interested in that whole world," she said. "After I finish 
'Shadow Ranch' I'm writing the sequel to 'Hank & Chloe,' which will take place 
on the Navajo reservation in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the more a writer discovers his or her own voice, those 
influences that shaped you as child emerge, and that is what you want to write 
about. (The West) is where my family comes from. My interests have always been 
with horses and animals and the landscape and wild places, and it was never 
acceptable to write about those concerns when I was in high school or college 
or even grad school. But those are like my issues, my passions." 
</P>
<P>
 Mapson said she began writing short stories in grade school -- always, she 
added with a laugh, "stories in which the main character was a middle child who 
was ignored grievously by her family." 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until 1982, she said, that "I turned my hand to the short story 
in a serious way." Her efforts have been rewarded. In 1986, she won first place 
in the California Short Story Competition sponsored by the Squaw Valley 
Writers' Community, and in 1989 her first collection of short stories, "Fault 
Line," was published by Pacific Writers Press.  
</P>
<P>
 Novels, however, have now taken a priority in her writing life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer them because I really like creating a world. That's fun. But I miss 
the (short) story a lot," she said. "I've got many ideas in the back of my head 
I'm trying to get to. I'm also getting really interested in journals."  
</P>
<P>
 She began one at the beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Journal writing, she says, "is highly overlooked as a form of creative 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it's really a way of going back and taking a look at these 
things that seem like simple activities and begin to see how they affect your 
life. They do, and if you treat that kind of writing with the same kind of care 
that you do writing a novel, poem or a story, you end up with a rich kind of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Journal or not, Mapson wouldn't think of going on tour without her portable 
computer. As she puts it: "Mr. Laptop comes with me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think it's what keeps me grounded," she said. "Inevitably 
something will get screwed up and canceled, which gives you four hours to do 
nothing in a strange city. I just sit down and write."

HANDING OUT HOPE AND HEALTH CARE; MEDICINE: ELIZABETH BENSON FORER TRIED TO GET 
OUT OF THE MEDICAL FIELD. INSTEAD, SHE NOW HEADS VENICE FAMILY CLINIC, WHICH 
SERVES ABOUT 12,000 PATIENTS A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By 10 on an overcast Monday morning, 15 people are sitting in the second-floor 
waiting room of the Venice Family Clinic. Some talk softly; others gaze at the 
art adorning the freshly painted mauve walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little quiet today," says Elizabeth Benson Forer, who took over in 
February. She replaced Fern Seizer, who retired after 11 years as executive 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, 35 or more patients crowd the waiting area of the nation's largest free 
clinic, which dispenses health care and hope to the poor, homeless and others 
without insurance. There are 2,400 non-medical volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in 1970, the clinic -- which has an annual operating budget of 
$5 million -- has grown from two rooms into its current 17,000 square-foot 
facility, which includes a pharmacy, laboratory, and 20 exam and treatment 
rooms. Last year, health care was provided to 11,500 patients and drew famous 
visitors, including Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview, Forer, 37, talked about the clinic's operation and its 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's your health care philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Every person should be able to have health care, especially preventive 
and primary health care. If we start with those, then more expensive health 
problems often can be prevented or avoided. Measles is a classic example. Now 
there are pediatricians who have never seen a case of measles, although it is 
coming back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Describe an average day here. 
</P>
<P>
 A: In a typical day, we see 175 patients with a variety of issues and 
problems. We're staffed by many volunteers; otherwise we couldn't see as many 
patients. Common problems in adults are diabetes, hypertension, asthma. In 
children, we try our best to emphasize well baby (care) and prevention. We 
emphasize lead screening and immunizations. We try to get them to understand 
the importance of ongoing care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, not too much in the way of colds? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have that, too -- colds, flu, standard problems. It could be someone 
coming in with a hangnail. We have women who have been battered -- although 
that's picked up usually as another type of checkup, usually women's health 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a typical patient? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most work very hard and still have very little money. As a result, they 
have no health insurance. Everything else can vary in terms of education level, 
type of work and living conditions. We have people living packed into two small 
rooms. We have people living a little better, but still (with) no more 
resources in terms of food, clothing and money. (There are shower rooms 
available for homeless patients.) 
</P>
<P>
 There's a small, hidden group of professional people who have lost their jobs 
and lost their insurance and are still trying to look like all their friends. 
They often say, "Don't tell anyone I'm calling here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the typical waiting time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: About two hours start to finish. On a bad day it takes longer, but we 
provide quality care. We don't just whip people through. It's unfortunate, but 
the need is always greater than our capacity. Every time we have expanded, by 
the time it's done, we are at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you get patient complaints? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the biggest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Waiting time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you have to turn away patients? 
</P>
<P>
 A: On the average, 50 a day. We try our best to find (them) other places to go 
or to get them an appointment later in the week. If it's acute enough, we tell 
them to go to the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much other care is sent elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Cardiology cases tend to get referred out. Heart surgery is often a 
bartering system. We try to get surgeries done for free. A classic case is an 
ophthalmologist who does cataract surgery for us. There is a range of other 
services off-site (that) we provide through the help of volunteer physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many noes do you get? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not a lot. We push. We only ask when we really need it. And we are careful 
(that) we don't ask the same people all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a wide network. A great example is St. John's Hospital, which provides 
lab and X-ray to us. And 45 seconds after the (Jan. 17) earthquake, that 
hospital was gone. They were on the phone to us the next day, saying: "We stand 
by our support to you. It will take us a little while to get back up. But we've 
reviewed our charitable donations and you are someone we want to be partners 
with." (People here) were astounded. Because they had just evacuated a whole 
hospital and we had two test tubes fall off the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your staff size? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are 100 full-time staff, including eight doctors. There are another 
500 volunteer doctors. That includes (physicians from) residency programs from 
UCLA (with which the clinic is closely affiliated), Kaiser, Daniel Freeman 
Hospital and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. . . . Any time we get a new doctor, 
we can see 10 to 15 more people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And the average time contribution of your 3,000 volunteers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A lot of doctors give three to five hours once a month. Others, once a 
week. Some retired physicians give that every day. Some of our non-medical 
volunteers volunteer once a year on Art Walk day (a major fund-raiser) . . . 
yet others are in every week, doing a wide assortment of tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Care is free, yet donations are accepted from patients. What's the average 
amount given? 
</P>
<P>
 A: On average, patients give $3. There are many who come and say, "What can we 
give you?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the common praises you hear? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They're happy we're here for them. We get letters all the time. The praise 
is often: "Our children were sick and not only did you take care of the 
children, but you took care of us too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What keeps you in the field? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I know that every day someone gets health care who wouldn't if I didn't do 
this work. 
</P>
<P>
 I left briefly. . . . I was tired of keeping up with the bureaucracy. The 
system is so messed up. . . . At home with my kids (though), I was reading the 
newspaper every day, reading health care stuff and cutting it out. I became 
this complete maven.

BATTLE AGAINST SAME-SEX HARASSMENT COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET; LITIGATION: EXPERTS 
FIGURE THAT SUCH CASES MAKE UP 5% OF WORKPLACE COMPLAINTS. BUT THE PERCENTAGE 
COULD GROW AS GAYS BECOME MORE VOCAL.

 His twist on Hollywood's fabled casting couch mixes the cliche with the 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Mogilefsky, a USC film school graduate with dreams of writing a 
box-office hit, landed a foot-in-the-door job at Silver Pictures. The studio's 
president, Michael Levy, encouraged the starry-eyed young man to submit an 
outline for a script -- and he eagerly did so. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, according to Mogilefsky, Levy's interest in him emerged as more than 
strictly professional. On Valentine's Day, 1992, Levy asked Mogilefsky to spend 
the night in his hotel suite -- implying that the screenplay's success hinged 
on the rendezvous, Mogilefsky claimed in a lawsuit against the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Afraid that his hope of a movie contract was about to crumble, Mogilefsky 
showed up at the hotel, he said. When he refused Levy's sexual advances, 
Mogilefsky alleged, his boss spouted profanities at him. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Levy acknowledged that he asked Mogilefsky to his room, said his 
attorney, Howard Weitzman. But the meeting was solely for business purposes, 
and he never pressured Mogilefsky for sex, Weitzman said.

 Eventually, Mogilefsky and the studio settled the suit out of court. But 
Mogilefsky is still so traumatized by the experience that he will not discuss 
it publicly, his attorney, James De Simone, said: "He just wants to put it 
behind him." Levy also could not be reached for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both men might just as soon forget the whole thing, Mogilefsky's 
accusations have been inked in law books for all to see. Earlier this year, 
Mogilefsky's lawsuit landed in the California Supreme Court, which upheld the 
state's first written opinion calling same-sex harassment illegal.  
</P>

<P>
 The term "sexual harassment" conjures up images of a power-happy lecher making 
passes at his female subordinate. Indeed, the vast majority of sexual 
harassment complaints are by women against men -- with suits filed by men 
against women ranking a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
 But employment attorneys calculate that about 5% of harassment cases fall into 
the same-sex category. And, they say, that proportion could grow as gays become 
increasingly vocal about their rights as employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a new political awareness in the gay community that makes gays less 
willing to allow themselves to be victimized," said attorney and gay activist 
Mickey Wheatley. "And, as gays come to see the law as protecting their rights 
in general, they will use the legal system more and more to stop discriminatory 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment complaints across the board have soared over the past 
decade. During 1983, 629 sexual harassment suits were filed with the California 
Department of Fair Housing and Employment -- where virtually all sexual 
discrimination claims originate before reaching the courts. The number of 
complaints has climbed steadily every year since, more than quadrupling by 1993 
to 2,703. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victims of sexual harassment have become more confident that they are, in 
fact, victims," said Amelia Craig, staff attorney for the Los Angeles chapter 
of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Fair Housing and Employment does not break down sexual 
harassment suits by gender. "As long as the behavior constitutes sexual 
harassment, it doesn't matter if it involves a male and a female or two males 
or two females," said the agency's deputy director, Wanda Kirby. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of same-sex harassment claimants have won monetary rewards in 
California due to that widely held attitude. Yet until Mogilefsky's case 
traveled through the courts, the state did not have any precedent prohibiting 
same-gender harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Pictures maintained that sexual harassment laws were not intended to 
cover same-gender situations. "As a feminist, I object to men taking advantage 
of a law meant to give women equal footing at the workplace," said Bonnie 
Eskenazi, a Los Angeles entertainment attorney who represented Silver Pictures. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Eskenazi said that sexual harassment laws become blurred when applied to 
same-gender situations. "A man can make a sexual joke to a group of other men 
without offending anyone, although the same comment could be offensive to a 
woman," she said. "It's a freedom of speech issue. Women say things to women 
and men say things to men that they would not feel comfortable saying in mixed 
company." 
</P>
<P>
 Mogilefsky's lawsuit initially was dismissed by a Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge, but an appellate court overruled that decision in December 1993. Silver 
Pictures settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the debate raged on. A Sacramento law firm representing a consortium 
of employers asked the Supreme Court to "de-publish" the appellate court's 
opinion so that it could not be cited in future cases.  
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU Foundation of California argued that the decision should remain on 
record, and the Supreme Court unanimously agreed. "All people are entitled to 
come to work and do their job without being subjected to the humiliation of 
sexual harassment," said Carol Sobel, senior staff counsel for the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Advocate -- a Los Angeles-based magazine for gays and 
lesbians -- briefly attempted a similar defense when slapped with a same-gender 
harassment suit by a former warehouse employee. Attorneys for the journal filed 
court papers contending that same-sex harassment was not covered by California 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the Advocate to take this position, sending a message to gays and 
lesbians that they are not safe from sexual harassment, was the ultimate 
hypocrisy," said Wheatley, the plaintiff's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a barrage of criticism, the Advocate withdrew that 
controversial line of defense and issued a statement saying it "would never 
want to harm the gay and lesbian community." The magazine settled the suit out 
of court last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Same-gender sexual harassment encompasses a number of situations: a gay man 
harassing another gay man or, though rarer, a lesbian harassing another 
lesbian; a heterosexual taunting a homosexual; a homosexual supervisor making 
advances toward a heterosexual subordinate. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the perpetrator's sexual orientation, harassment usually is 
driven by anger and insecurity as much as by attraction, said Laguna Beach 
psychologist Richard Ammon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It derives from a need to control and dominate," Ammon said. "The only way 
that the harasser can feel good about himself is by feeling that he has power 
over somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, what starts out as an innocent crush deteriorates into a 
self-perpetuated downward spiral, he added: "If you are a supervisor and you 
express interest in a subordinate, for a split second you have reversed the 
roles. If his or her answer is no, and you start using your position of power 
to coerce and manipulate, that's when harassment begins." 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual harassment frequently goes unreported. A recent poll conducted by Lou 
Harris & Associates showed that 60% of interviewees who believe they have been 
harassed took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman might balk at reporting sexual harassment because she faces the 
presumption that she brought it on herself -- she's a flirt, she dresses 
provocatively," said Carla Barboza, a Los Angeles attorney who specializes in 
sexual harassment cases. "A man, on the other hand, has trouble reporting 
sexual harassment because he could look like a wimp." 
</P>
<P>
 For gays and lesbians, those preconceptions cut both ways. "Gays are viewed 
first and foremost as sexual beings," Barboza said. "So it's hard for some 
people to understand that gays don't welcome any and all sexual advances." 
</P>
<P>
 An even bigger deterrent, though, can be the fear of divulging one's 
homosexuality at the office. In heterosexual-dominated corporate America, gay 
people labor under the weight of homophobia -- subtle and overt.  
</P>
<P>
 "The closet is a very powerful force for some people," Wheatley said. "Someone 
trying to protect his sexual orientation may be hesitant to report same-sex 
sexual harassment at his workplace for fear that people then will suspect him 
of being gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, who requested that his last name not be used, said that he tolerated 
his supervisor's harassment for more than a year -- until he was fired after 
requesting a transfer. "I worried that I would be discriminated against if 
people knew I'm gay," said the 32-year-old Laguna Beach resident, a 
professional restaurant manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently filed suit against his former employer, Sizzler International Inc. 
of Los Angeles. A lawyer for the restaurant chain declined to comment on 
pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment started, Robert claims, with an occasional inappropriate 
compliment from his boss, such as, "You have a nice body." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the passes became physical and relentless. "He fondled me, asked 
questions about my personal life and kept insisting we go out," Robert said. "I 
felt nervous, threatened, violated. But I didn't quit because I needed the 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Further inhibiting them from complaining, gays often resist "tattling on one 
of their own," said Ammon, who specializes in counseling gays and lesbians. "We 
are a subculture that has been persecuted and discriminated against, so we try 
to protect each other." 
</P>
<P>
 James Brown said he found the idea of reporting his boss' sexual misconduct -- 
and, in the process, inadvertently "outing" a fellow gay man -- so repugnant 
that he instead quit his job. "I didn't want to portray gay people in a 
negative way," said the 28-year-old Santa Cruz resident. "I felt that 
complaining about him would not be politically correct, that I shouldn't damage 
the career of another gay person." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown claims in a lawsuit that he was harassed by Robert Hoffman, the founder 
of an Oakland psychological counseling center, while working there as an office 
manager three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started getting offers of promotions in exchange for being his lover," 
Brown said. "It undermined my self-confidence; I couldn't come up with a 
solution other than to leave my job for a lower-paying position." Brown filed 
suit a year later, in December of 1992. "I realized I didn't want other people 
to go through what I went through," he said. The suit is scheduled for trial 
early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Sayad, a San Francisco attorney representing Hoffman -- a divorced man 
with children and grandchildren -- said "there is absolutely no truth to the 
allegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless there are witnesses, charges of sexual harassment can come down to one 
person's word against another's. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, who requested that her last name not be used, said she knows the 
trauma -- and long-term effects -- of being accused falsely of behavior she 
would never commit. A "line producer" who manages movie production budgets, she 
saw her reputation and career disintegrate beneath a heap of unchecked gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the Los Angeles resident was working on a prized project when 
the executive producer called her into his office and dropped a bomb. The 
film's star, he said, had told crew members that Sharon sexually harassed her. 
He then persuaded her not to risk disrupting the actress's performance with a 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't imagine where she got this idea," said Sharon, a lesbian who was 
not out of the closet. "One time I asked her if she needed a ride; I can only 
guess that she thought I was making a pass and then embellished on the 
encounter. Yet I couldn't even talk to her about it and clear my name." 
</P>
<P>
 Although her ordeal did not involve a lawsuit, it continues to haunt her. "I 
suspect it has affected my references," Sharon said. "I notice people are wary 
of me, and I don't have as many opportunities to work as I once did." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gay men in mostly male workplaces such as police departments are particularly 
vulnerable to same-sex harassment when a heterosexual scorns a homosexual, said 
Lambda attorney Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is motivated by a hatred of gays because they do not fit the stereotype of 
what 'real men' are supposed to be," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 One such case involves a former California Highway Patrol officer, who filed a 
lawsuit against the agency last year. Thomas Figenshu, a 10-year veteran of the 
CHP and one of its youngest sergeants, went out on disability leave in 1992 
after allegedly suffering verbal and physical abuse by his colleagues.  
</P>
<P>
 His horror story includes accusations that officers in the CHP's West Los 
Angeles office referred to him as "Sergeant Fag-in-shoe," stuffed threatening 
notes in his mail slot, made crank calls to his house and urinated in his 
wardrobe locker. 
</P>
<P>
 Figenshu declined to be interviewed. His lawyer described him as "emotionally 
distressed and tremendously disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was an outstanding, conscientious officer," said Los Angeles attorney 
Scott Silverman. "He worked very hard to achieve his success and -- for no 
rational reason at all -- he has lost his career with the Highway Patrol." 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy attorney general representing the CHP said the agency denies 
Figenshu's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambda attorney Craig said that California courts can expect to see more 
same-gender sexual harassment suits now that the state Supreme Court has 
affirmed their validity. She advised employers to educate workers about all 
variations of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies make the mistake of assuming that everyone is heterosexual," Craig 
said. "If you start with the assumption that some people are gay and lesbian, 
you will do a lot of things differently."

TREES OF LIFE; FRANCES LYNN CARPENTER HAS A VISION: A RENEWED TROPICAL FOREST. 
THE UCI ECOLOGIST'S DREAM OFFERS HOPE FOR COSTA RICA'S TIRED AND WASTED LAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the soggy mist of the nursery, Frances Lynn Carpenter's newborns lie still, 
nestled in a blanket of dusky topsoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of jade-colored seedlings sprout from a crib of wet earth, pushing 
forward delicate leaves like butterfly wings. Carpenter squats to finger the 
tender shoot of a freshly germinated tropical tree. She admires its fullness. 
She pictures it fully grown. She dreams of seeds rising up and saving the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people here feel sorry for me because I don't have any children," 
said Carpenter, a 50-year-old ecology professor from the University of 
California, Irvine. "They don't understand a gringa who doesn't have babies. 
But I do -- I have 6,000 babies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some baffled friends call her the "wanna-be Johnny Appleseed" of the tropics, 
a seasoned scientist who risked her academic prestige, her personal savings and 
every last dollar of her credit card limits for a quixotic project to raise a 
rain forest from the battered, grassy slopes of southwest Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $20,000 gift and the mud-stained, blistered hands of California 
volunteers, Carpenter is carving a tropical tree finca, or farm, along hills 
beneath the mist-shrouded mountains of the southern frontier and overlooking 
the steel-blue ribbon of the Pacific and Golfo Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 She is gambling the ranch that she can coax a rain forest so quickly, 
efficiently and economically that local farmers will imitate her, investing in 
trees and reaping a cash crop of hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Her aim is to stave off further destruction of rain forests, which have been 
chain-sawed and left rotting in the hills of Coto Brus to clear land for cattle 
pastures and coffee plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rufous-tailed hawks and wild parakeets sail the cool breeze above her farm -- 
63 acres of steep, emerald hills that have been burned by fire, shaved by 
herbicide, washed by relentless rain, crushed by cattle hoofs and now planted 
with 6,000 trees, with more on the way in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exactly what I wanted," Carpenter said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Just four decades ago, the vast sweep of hills was covered with a canopy of 
lush tropical hardwoods so dense that the towering forest smothered the light 
for 20th-Century settlers who wandered here from northern Costa Rica, the 
United States and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The first tree slain by an ax fell on Feb. 28, 1952, and in the years that 
followed the giants came crashing down with such fury and intensity that some 
wistful residents called the shuddering land la Tierra Triste -- the Sad Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica has been losing its forest more rapidly than other ecologically 
rich countries, even though the nation has been widely praised for its 
extensive network of forest preserves. At the start of the century, more than 
85% of the small, Central American country was covered with forest, but that 
figure has fallen to less than 50%. Some local economists fear that forests 
outside the preserves will vanish at the rate of 98,000 acres a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from the thunderclaps of falling timber, Carpenter had been preoccupied 
for much of the last 22 years with the foraging patterns of Hawaiian 
honeycreepers, or the pitched battle for nectar waged by insects and 
hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her UC Irvine research focused on the torpor of the Andean hummingbird and the 
feeding territory of migrant hummingbirds. She was fascinated by the wild, 
furious creatures that consume life at a fever pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They live life on the edge," she said. "They're always in danger of using up 
their energy reserves. They have to interact intensely with their environment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter keenly missed that intensity in her own life. She was restless 
in class, daydreaming about retirement that was years away. And as she careened 
toward her 50th year, she took stock of herself and assumed a peculiarly modern 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to realize that my life was going to be my career," she said. "I was 
not going to get remarried and have a family, and I accepted that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the iridescent hummingbirds no longer seemed so intriguing. While 
on sabbatical in 1991, she participated in a deforestation seminar in Costa 
Rica. She left the lecture outraged because no one seemed to offer a solution 
to the relentless problem. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the seed of an idea took hold: Why couldn't la Tierra Triste be 
healed? Carpenter started biting her nails again, tossing at night with dreams 
about her life's work. She received encouragement from her parents, who gave 
her $20,000 to purchase property for a tree experiment. Still, she couldn't 
decide. She feared that her colleagues might be scornful of a practical project 
in a lab of deep red mud and washed-out cattle trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came her father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does it really matter whether hummingbirds define their territory or not?" 
Carpenter asked. "I had never before taken on something that really mattered, 
because of a fear of failure. If I failed with the hummingbirds, it didn't 
really matter. But the trees really mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This June, when the steamy rain of Coto Brus began thrashing the hills, 
Carpenter returned to her 6,000 young trees rising from the gentle slopes known 
as Camp 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 She first glimpsed the land in 1991 while on a seven-month sabbatical to 
research the effect of exotic plants on native trees in a rain forest preserve. 
She was seated in a rumbling bus bound for a Pacific beach when she saw her 
future farm. It was disgust at first sight. 
</P>
<P>
 From her window seat, she was struck by the eroded pastures and she snapped a 
photograph of the bleak hills. The steep slopes, etched with a network of 
cattle trails, were losing black topsoil to a murky lagoon at the bottom of a 
huge, grassy bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 So exhausted was the clayish, rust-colored soil that farmers deemed it unfit 
for agricultural use. No tractor could tackle its rutted slopes. Chemical 
herbicides had ruined an old crop of coffee plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, her photo of the damaged hills would become Exhibit A in her passionate 
lectures on deforestation to ecology undergraduates at UC Irvine. There was 
something about the forlorn hills that touched her students like the whisper of 
hummingbird wings never could. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought the farm for $20,000 in August, 1992, a move that gave her new 
passion for teaching undergraduate and graduate ecology students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting fed up with my job until I got the farm," said Carpenter, who 
divides the year equally between teaching and her Costa Rica research. "It's 
given me some kind of heart and compassion for my students that I didn't have 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 She received a standing ovation after one lecture that featured her project. 
Volunteers started trickling to Costa Rica for the unglamorous tasks of 
counting and measuring trees and watching them grow. Some special expeditions 
paid as much as $2,000 to make the odyssey to her farm and a neighboring rain 
forest preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 At a supermarket checkout stand in California, a San Diego couple overheard a 
conversation about Carpenter's project. It was enough to inspire them to buy 
plane tickets to join the professor in Costa Rica. A Newport Beach accountant 
also headed south after reading about the project. 
</P>
<P>
 They were drawn by Carpenter, a guide as charismatic as Peter Pan -- 
particularly when the ecologist is dangling by rope from the sturdy branches of 
a 150-foot-tall amarillon tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A cocked olive hat covers Carpenter's cropped brown hair. Her eyes are the 
color of tree bark. Slim and lithe, she is dressed in lavender from her 
delicate amethyst earrings to socks thick enough to stymie chiggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the woods, people trail her even as she blasts along muddy roads at 
the wheel of a lurching four-wheel-drive vehicle, red earth spraying from the 
tires while howler monkeys scream from hidden retreats in the tree canopy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's single and she calls the trees her kids, and they are in a way," said 
Eric Pianka, 55, a volunteer and herpetologist from the University of Texas who 
followed Carpenter to Costa Rica to build a carport for her farm station. "It's 
kind of nuts. It sounds like a crazy project to me. And if it wasn't Lynn, I 
would probably say she's a lunatic. I hope it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said she thinks volunteers are attracted because her solutions seem 
practical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the appeal is the same for me," Carpenter said. "Once you hear the 
core ideas about my project, it just makes so much sense. You feel like your 
effort is making a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Her goals are summed up in her pleas for six-figure foundation grants, which 
have yet to flow like the volunteers: Find native trees that thrive on hardship 
and ravaged soil. Develop a recipe of mulches and clippings, vegetation and 
leguminous trees that can nourish the earth and speed growth. Move out of the 
way when the trees start growing. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds deceptively simple. But most forestry experiments last about five 
to 10 years while Carpenter estimates her experiment will take place over 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 She has also chosen to nurture trees on nutrient-poor earth -- in contrast to 
most forestry experiments, which usually are conducted on rich soil for quick 
results. She argues that her results will be closer to reality for farmers 
struggling to make damaged land productive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve her grander aims, Carpenter had to start with basics -- such as 
conversational Spanish. She brushed up on her college Spanish with such relish 
that a scientist marveled at her academic mastery of virtually all of the local 
vulgarities. 
</P>
<P>
 She also had to tackle subjects that she scorned during her university 
training: soil ecology, economics, sociology, forestry and political science. 
</P>
<P>
 With her broad American accent and open manner, she won over many of the 
farmers, who freely shared lore about the fastest growing, most marketable 
native trees. 
</P>
<P>
 They were in no hurry, though, to follow her example. A steady stream of 
visitors made a pilgrimage to her hillside station after hearing she had bought 
one of the most tired farms in the area. They simply wanted to sell her another 
finca . 
</P>
<P>
 "I am waiting 10 years to see what happens to her project," said Hernan 
Villalobos, a son of Costa Rican pioneers who helped to settle Coto Brus and a 
member of several farming organizations looking for alternatives to traditional 
coffee plantations and cattle ranching. "This is really an adventure at this 
point. It seems to have promise, but the problem is, she has to demonstrate 
that it will pay for campesinos ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was the campesinos who gave her the advice that prompted her to pick 
the amarillon tree to spawn a forest of seedlings. A tropical hardwood of rich, 
mustard-and-red grain, the wood was used for the double doors to her new Costa 
Rican home. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the task of plucking fresh amarillon seeds was assigned to her 
workers and volunteers who literally hugged and scaled trunks in a quest for 
robust mother trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter took a shopping list of mountain-climbing equipment to California 
and purchased $1,500 worth of webbing, ropes and harnesses. Then a savvy 
volunteer adapted the equipment to reach the towering canopies of amarillon and 
mayo colorado trees. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have plucked seeds scattered below the tree trunks, but Carpenter 
insisted that they had to come from newly cut branches to avoid fungus and rot 
that weakens seeds on the ground. She wanted to know the full history of the 
mother trees so she could track the strongest, healthiest stock for her 
seedlings. 
</P>
<P>
 And so a giant rubber slingshot was fashioned to send a heavy rope and a 
five-pound weight sailing over the tops of the mottled, white-and-gray branches 
of the amarillon. Then the volunteers climbed up, entering a new dimension of 
treetop life where the branches swarmed with beetles, butterflies and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Devon Biggs, a Wisconsin volunteer, and Eduver Sandi, Carpenter's Costa Rican 
foreman, learned to hoist themselves 150 feet with ropes and carabiners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an emotional feeling up there because you know your life could be 
on the ground," said Sandi, 30, who on one foray for pristine seeds was 
attacked by bees that swarmed over his face, ears and mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Carpenter stayed on the ground while others embraced the trees. 
This summer, she insisted on a climbing lesson, weighing the consequences of 
the ascent much as she mulled her decision to switch careers. 
</P>
<P>
 While her volunteers watched, she dangled from an amarillon tree like a 
spider, inching with the same deliberate speed until her hiking boots thrashed 
four feet above ground. Somebody whistled a James Bond theme song for 
encouragement. She paused in midair, measuring the growing separation from the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is switching from climbing up to coming down," Carpenter 
said. "I don't feel stable at that point. I feel basically that I know what I 
have to do, but I get nervous and weak when I think about what could happen. I 
really, really want to be able to get up there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, before the afternoon mist drapes the mountains and rain pelts 
the slopes, Carpenter slides on mud-caked rubber boots to head for her nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 The green wings of tiny seedlings make a thick carpet along the narrow beds of 
topsoil. Soon it will be their turn to sink roots into the hills where 6,000 
trees are already flourishing, some of them reaching above Carpenter's knee. 
</P>
<P>
 It is quiet moments such as these that Carpenter relishes like a favorite 
photograph in a family album. She doesn't dwell on the fact that she has 
charged her credit cards to the maximum to furnish her new farm station with a 
stove and refrigerator. She doesn't worry that she hasn't yet attracted 
foundation grants to underwrite her grand vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow scientist Marta E. Rosemeyer, a University of Costa Rica researcher, 
said she believes Carpenter has been able to plod along on a shoestring budget 
subsidized by volunteers because the UC Irvine professor has invested so much 
of herself in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most scientists don't do this kind of thing," Rosemeyer said. "She's put a 
tremendous amount of her savings into this. What's that old expression? Where 
your treasures are, that's where your heart is." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter takes heart in her seedlings.

 Somehow I wasn't surprised to learn in "Whispers," Ronald Siegel's third book 
about the world of mental illness, that the UCLA Center for Health Sciences is 
the third-largest building in the world. I have been lost in its labyrinthine 
corridors and appreciate the author's courage in descending to its basement, at 
night, on the advice of a virtual stranger who had promised him an opportunity 
to interview Hitler's brain (safely inside a computer program). 
</P>
<P>
 What better subject than Hitler for a researcher interested in paranoia? 
Hitler, like all paranoids, saw himself at the center of a vast conspiracy 
organized, in his case, by communists and Jews. He saw conspirators all around 
him, in the intellectual and artistic circles from which he was excluded, and 
later inside the very bunker where he held out against his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel uses his interview with Hitler's silicon brain, the handiwork of the 
graduate student who had programmed it based on definitive biographical 
information, to reflect on the real Hitler's mental state.  
</P>
<P>
 This was characterized by unpleasant obsessive tirades until 1937, when, 
Siegel tells us, Hitler began having full-blown psychotic episodes. Siegel 
attributes this shift to the regimen begun by Hitler's physician, who had begun 
giving the dictator intravenous injections of the new drug methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug did not cause Hitler's rages, but it did exacerbate them. Paranoia, 
Siegel suggests, is unlike other mental illnesses. It does not usually show up 
as an aberration on a brain scan, because the unfounded fears that feed 
paranoia are, in a sense, natural.  
</P>
<P>
 They arise from deep inside the limbic system, a pool of neurons, hormones and 
electric pulses that lies in the mammalian brain beneath the cerebral cortex 
and controls our primal urges. Hard-wired into all of us, a touch of paranoia 
may have helped us survive in the evolutionary past because it kept us on 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 But like our appendix, paranoia is not useful to modern humans. The condition 
seems to erupt when confused signals from the limbic system trigger unwarranted 
fear and panic in the conscious mind. This may result from biologic stress, or 
from a flammable mixture of stress and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel observes that there is a continuum of paranoia -- much of it harmless 
-- but always characterized by suspiciousness and hostility toward other 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 It is often the other face of narcissism -- paranoids know without doubt that 
they are very important, the focus of a vast conspiracy orchestrated by people 
jealous of their tremendous talents and accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the potential for paranoia lurks in all of us, the obsessive fears 
usually lie dormant but may be awakened, Siegel explains, by chemicals. A 
mixture of ordinary prescription medications as well as so-called recreational 
drugs can trigger murder and mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly a man for this season, Siegel is neither psychiatrist nor clinical 
psychologist, but as a research associate in UCLA's Department of Psychiatry 
and Biobehavioral Sciences, he explores the effects of chemicals on the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 He does not, however, exclude psychological explanations from his research. In 
the description of Hitler's behavior, for example, he mentions that the autopsy 
performed by the Russians (who found his body) revealed that Hitler was 
monorchid -- he had a single testicle.  
</P>
<P>
 A psychoanalyst might point to feelings of sexual inadequacy arising from this 
condition as the origin of Hitler's rage. Siegel discusses this with his 
friendly Freudian psychiatrist, Joel Morgan. Here, and elsewhere in the 
narrative, Siegel bounces ideas back and forth with Morgan, offering 
psychoanalytical interpretations of paranoia in tandem with, or in opposition 
to, biopharmaceutical explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 There is not much Siegel could do to have hands-on experience with Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 He could, however, pursue what he calls the "demon of paranoia" in people 
still living. In the most remarkable episodes in this remarkable book, he 
describes his adventures slipping into the shoes of two of these people. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the same medications, watched the same movies, and re-experienced the 
same states of mind and body that led a loving mother to murder her 9-year-old 
daughter and a cocaine addict to kill his sister and infant nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 Always open to contradictions and paradox, Siegel does not omit occasions when 
apparent paranoia turned out to be a rational reaction to actual facts.  
</P>
<P>
 The late Martha Mitchell's suspicion that her husband was engaged in illegal 
activities at the White House was diagnosed as delusional, until she was 
vindicated by Watergate. Mitchell has been posthumously honored with the term, 
"The Martha Mitchell Effect," used to describe people who were misjudged for 
reporting improbable, but true, events. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a string of case histories, "Whispers" is a well-crafted tapestry in 
which individuals who are the focus of one episode become the reference point 
of another. Horrifying and utterly fascinating, "Whispers" is a hard book to 
put down.

BODY WATCH; LIGHT READING FOR HEAVY WORKOUTS; YOUR MUSCLES SCREAM; YOUR LUNGS

 What makes the difference between wimping out early on the StairMaster and 
going the distance? 
</P>
<P>
 It may be as simple as something good to read. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget newspapers (sorry, boss!) -- those big, flapping pages can be tricky to 
handle while you're panting, and all that black ink on sweaty hands can leave 
you looking like a chimney sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 And forget books. Anything thicker than "The Cat in the Hat" won't lie flat, 
and it's tough to follow a serious plot line while sneaking peeks at the 
bench-pressing hunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider instead the magazine: While there's lots of talk today about the 
writing becoming too light, for gym reading that's just what you want. But 
remove all those loose subscription cards first so you don't jam the machine 
with paper shrapnel every time you turn a page. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes a good gym magazine? 
</P>
<P>
 * It should distract you from -- but not compete with -- what you're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 * It should not be embarrassing to be seen with -- or for others to share the 
room with. 
</P>
<P>
 * The type shouldn't be so tight that you have to bring bifocals even if you 
don't ordinarily need them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Features should not jump past non-page-numbered advertising supplements to 
page 205. 
</P>
<P>
 * And until someone makes exercise machines with suitable appendages to hold 
reading material, make sure your mag is lightweight or can easily be propped in 
front of you. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the thousands of possible choices, here are our picks for the best and 
worst magazines to take to the gym: THE 10 BEST 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment Weekly -- It's less tacky than the National Enquirer but still 
has those tabloid tidbits -- all the Hollywood grit and gossip, including 
everything you'd ever want to know about "Star Trek" spin-offs and Barbra 
Streisand's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 People -- Lightweight in every sense of the word, this is the magazine to read 
on cardiovascular machines. It travels easily among the dirty socks and towel, 
and if it gets a little wrecked, so what? You weren't going to showcase it on 
your coffee table anyway. Learn about the week's best TV programs, so when you 
stagger from the gym to crash on the couch, you'll know what button to push on 
the remote control. 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek/Time/U.S. News & World Report -- These clones offer great 
photojournalism and lots of meaty features in one easy-to-digest package. Keep 
up with weighty affairs without being so overwhelmed that your machine program 
drags to a dead stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Life -- In the old days, its big format might have kept it off this list. But 
the downsized version still has great photos and a lively mix of news you can 
use. One recent issue covered everything from Castro to breast cancer to 
electron-microscope photographs of live human parasites -- including the louse 
-- and Marilyn Monroe's sister's never-before-published photos of Norma Jean. 
</P>
<P>
 American Health Magazine -- Because fitness of body and mind is ostensibly why 
you're at the gym, look committed and motivate yourself at the same time by 
reading helpful stories about antioxidants, nine keys to a lasting marriage and 
how to find out if you, too, are a hypochondriac. Added bonuses: how giant 
rubber bands can firm your thighs and low-cal recipes to keep them that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural History -- More bang for your buck: Support New York's venerable 
Museum of Natural History, impress fellow exercisers and learn all at the same 
time. Easy-to-handle book will entertain and educate you with such features as 
ScienceLite (astrophysics made easy), great comics and compelling photographs 
of Maui hawkfish hovering over antler coral. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz -- The local pick: Wide and thin for easy propping, it's hipper than Los 
Angeles magazine and livelier than many other regionals. And while offering fun 
tips and dishing insider scoops about some of L.A.'s weightier institutions -- 
such as Hollywood and The Times -- it lets you in on what's happening each 
month in shopping, dining and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlantic Monthly -- With stories such as "The Coming Anarchy" and "The 
False Promise of Gun Control," its subject matter may be heavy, but the fact 
that you're reading it will definitely turn heads. True, you may not finish 
even one feature if other masochists are waiting for your machine, but at least 
the stories are presented on consecutive pages and the easy-on-the-eyes design 
allows the words to breathe while you can't. Good fiction and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Yorker -- You'll seem sophisticated and cosmopolitan despite the 
criticism that Editor Tina Brown has dumbed it down. The fiction is still 
great, the cartoons as acerbic as ever, and it runs great book and movie 
reviews. One warning: If you've never lived in New York, you may think they're 
talking too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Holiday -- To take your mind far, far from your physical agony, get 
lost in this well-photographed book with its easy-to-read type, vibrant writing 
style and handy travel tips. One recent issue meanders through Barbados, 
Africa, Vienna, Glacier National Park, American casinos and Kentucky bourbon 
distilleries. THE 10 WORST 
</P>
<P>
 The Economist -- Few pictures and way too dry for anyone without an Oxford 
degree in modern macroeconomics. Lots of graphs on subjects such as 
consumer-confidence levels, share prices and the Mexican stock market. Upside: 
If you drop this magazine, you can read it just as well upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 Bon Appetit -- No, no, no! All those gorgeous and mouth-watering pictures will 
only lead you into temptation. While it does include some low-cal foods such as 
Roman Broth with Parmesan Cheese Threads, the maple syrup pecan pie and 
white-chocolate cheesecake with hazelnut crust will suck you in like quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural Digest -- It weighs and costs a ton and besides, who really 
reads it? If you must buy this stuffy book for its pretty pictures of places 
and furnishings you'll never be able to afford, leave it on your coffee table 
for show. Besides, the slick finish could cause it to squirt out of your sweaty 
hands -- just one reason people who subscribe to it hire personal trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 National Geographic -- Although the pictures are lavish, it weighs too much 
and the rhinoceros-tough binding keeps it from politely lying open on the 
StairMaster. It does have well-written text and gorgeous photos, but the naked 
natives might be in depressingly better shape than you are. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanity Fair -- It's so thick and heavy that you'll be worn out just getting it 
to the gym. The covers are great conversation openers (a naked Burt Reynolds, 
Roseanne Arnold in skimpy black lace), but to finish an article you'll have to 
fumble around to the back of the book. Save it for bedtime, when you can lie 
back and inhale the perfume samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmopolitan -- Like Vanity Fair, it's thick and heavy and stories jump all 
over the place. Unlike Vanity Fair, you should never be caught dead holding 
this one-track pop psychology magazine with its cleavage-on-the-cover 
obsession, stupid quizzes on finding your marital IQ and nauseating features 
like "Women Who Love Men Who Never Pay Their Parking Tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Muscle & Fitness -- Even though the theme is right, this mag is too pumped up 
in every way. It's cumbersome, ad-laden and unless you're a hard-core fitness 
fanatic, the popped-veined men and women pictured there look more like gross 
parodies than anything you'd want to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular Mechanics -- Reading this is a sure way to fall asleep on a speeding 
treadmill, causing yourself embarrassment or even physical trauma. But don't 
blame yourself -- it takes a special person to get into those 22-step treatises 
on installing furnace filters, or fixing dripping relief valves, or where to 
purchase a time-delay wall switch, or . . . need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
 Playboy -- Guys, we know you buy it only for the writing, but save it for the 
privacy of your bathrooms. And ladies, while the bodies pictured here might 
inspire you to work harder, they could just as easily send you scampering off 
to Ben & Jerry's -- or Implants R Us. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldier of Fortune -- Unless you want to keep people from talking to you, 
leave it in your truck. It'll scare the hell out of everyone, including 
yourself. Recent topics: complete trial coverage of Waco, Aussie snipers, the 
ins and outs of belly guns, and a Foreign Legion vendetta.

MYTH BUSTERS: BODY WATCH; NO AVOIDING SOME OF LIFE'S GROWING PAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of health information you never questioned. After all, it came 
from an authority -- not your doctor, but from your mom, your grandpa or maybe 
even your pal who once dated a med student. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time, we'll look at these long-held health "facts" and answer the 
question -- sorry, Mom -- "True or false?" 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Growing pains are normal in kids. 
</P>
<P>
 True. "Growing pains are not at all uncommon," says Dr. L. Philippe Theriot, 
pediatrician at Memorial Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach. About 7% or 
more of children are affected, says Theriot, a clinical associate professor of 
pediatrics at USC and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing pains are more of a nuisance than a medical problem, he says. The name 
is a bit of a misnomer, he says, because they don't normally occur during the 
fastest period of growth (from birth to age 1) but rather from ages 3-12.  
</P>
<P>
 The pains often strike in the legs, usually the back of the thighs and knees 
and the calves. "They typically occur in the evening and often after a very 
busy day," Theriot says. "No one knows what causes them." 
</P>
<P>
 In some children they are infrequent. Other children may experience them for a 
month or longer. By morning the pain is usually gone. If pain is severe, 
Theriot tells parents to give acetaminophen (Tylenol) or other pain relievers 
as recommended by their pediatricians. If pain does not subside or if the 
parents are concerned, see a physician to rule out other problems, Theriot 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Athlete's foot is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 True . . . and false. Athlete's foot is caused by a fungus and can spread from 
one area of the foot to other areas, says Dr. Jim Allen, a Malibu family 
practice physician. Its spread from one person to another is less likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are more likely to get athlete's foot from a locker room floor than from 
another person," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose you have a bunch of athletes tromping barefoot through a locker 
room," Allen says. "There is a likelihood of getting athlete's foot, especially 
if someone has broken skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Athlete's foot is also more likely, he says, if you "foster the conditions 
that promote fungus growth." For instance? "Wearing the same socks for three or 
four days." 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Non-dairy coffee creamers are healthier alternatives to cream. 
</P>
<P>
 No way, says Elizabeth Somer, an Oregon dietitian. Non-dairy creamers are low 
in cholesterol, says Somer, author of "Nutrition for Women: The Complete Guide" 
(Henry Holt & Co, 1993). But that about sums up the nutritional good news about 
creamers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often the fat in creamers is coconut or palm oil, which is more saturated 
than lard," Somer says. Depending on the brand of non-dairy creamer, about 
45%-90% of its calories come from fat, she says. About 77% of the calories in 
half and half come from fat. Either way, she says, it's a load of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't tolerate black coffee? "Use evaporated nonfat milk or 1% milk," 
Somer suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Sitting too close to the television, and reading in dim light, will 
cause vision problems. 
</P>
<P>
 True . . . and false. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither activity will cause loss of visual acuity (sharpness or clarity of 
vision)," says Julie Ryan, an Irvine optometrist and associate professor of 
optometry at the Southern California College of Optometry, Fullerton. "But both 
can cause stress and fatigue of the eyes. Our advice is to keep kids back from 
the television -- the optimal distance is seven feet," Ryan says. Parents might 
buy young children a special chair and place it seven feet away from the set, 
she suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to read is with the help of a good incandescent light over the 
shoulder illuminating the pages equally. It doesn't matter which shoulder (the 
light falls over). Most adults should hold a book about 12 to 16 inches away 
from the eyes. Kids usually hold (reading material) a shorter distance away 
because their arms are shorter."

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY: ALL BOOKED UP; CHAPTER 1: GUESTS FILL THE OPENING 
NIGHT PARTY OF THE NEWPORT BEACH CENTRAL LIBRARY

<P>
 Libraries are supposed to be quiet places, but nobody complained when 650 
party-goers noisily celebrated the opening of the Newport Beach Central 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests got their first look inside the mammoth 54,000-square-foot library 
Saturday when the Newport Beach Public Library Foundation held a black-tie gala 
opening at the contemporary stone and stucco building overlooking the Pacific. 
The $200-per-person event netted about $300,000 to support programs and 
services at the library. Checking It Out 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in their best evening wear, guests took a champagne tour of the 
library, some wandering through stacks of books, searching for their names on 
the large donor wall and testing the state-of-the-art equipment. Women in 
drop-dead slip dresses sat down at computers and gingerly pecked at the keys. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the opening of the library was the culmination of a longtime dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "A remarkable number of people use the library. They really love it," said 
Barbara Glabman, event chairwoman. "Libraries add to the life's blood of a 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Library trustee Lucille Kuehn, who was a Newport Beach City Council member 20 
years ago when she launched the project, was misty-eyed at the sight of the 
library: 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw them putting the books on the shelves I broke into uncontrollable 
sobs," she said. "I knew then it was really true." 
</P>
<P>
 James Pirdy, architect of the modern building, pointed out its special 
features, including an exposed steel frame, marbleized plaster walls and the 
children's story-time room with its dome-shaped ceiling inset with lights to 
simulate the constellations. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it looks 30 years ahead of its time," said T. Jefferson Parker, one of 
nine writers on hand, including Irwin Gellman, Raymond Obstfeld, Jack Smith and 
Theodore Taylor. Bookworms and Dreamers 
</P>
<P>
 "Impossible Dream" -- with the "im" crossed out in red -- was the gala theme, 
which Bugs Bunny creator and guest Chuck Jones illustrated by drawing Bugs 
reading a book and dreaming of the new library. A poster of the illustration 
was given to each guest. 
</P>
<P>
 A tent that looked as if it could cover a football field was set up outside 
the library to accommodate the crowd for dinner. There guests dined on petite 
filets of beef and grilled shrimp and chicken prepared by the Four Seasons 
hotel in Newport Beach. On each table were stacks of books and pots of fresh 
herbs and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Emcee Peter Ueberroth, author, former baseball commissioner and president and 
CEO of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee in 1984, welcomed guests 
with a quip about the tent: 
</P>
<P>
 "The real reason the tent is this shape is Brazil and Italy are going to play 
World Cup here tomorrow afternoon," he said. A Child's Sanctuary 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth introduced a panel of authors to talk about their love of libraries. 
The panel included: Parker, author of "Laguna Heat"; Nancy Taylor Rosenberg, 
author of "Mitigating Circumstances"; Charles Champlin, Los Angeles Times arts 
editor emeritus, and biographer Peter Collier. 
</P>
<P>
 "With books, I didn't need friends. (As a child) I used to sleep on the 
playground with my coat over my head," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Collier, who has written about the Rockefellers and Roosevelts, the 
library was a "sanctuary" he discovered at age 9 in 1950 when his family was 
"coming apart." 
</P>
<P>
 "The library was an emotional demilitarization zone where I could get away 
from feuding parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $8.2-million Newport Beach library was funded by a public-private 
partnership between the City of Newport Beach and the nonprofit library 
foundation, which raised nearly $2 million from private donations. John and 
Elizabeth Stahr, who headed the original capital campaign, received a crystal 
star as appreciation for their efforts. The Irvine Co. donated the four-acre 
site at 1000 Avocado Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were: David Carmichael, foundation president, and his 
wife, Beverly; LaDonna Kienitz, city librarian; Robert Wynn, Frank and Marilyn 
Lynch, Richard and Lynette Berg, Milton and Peggy Shedd, George and Phyllis 
Drayton, Jack and Jerri Dwan, Tom Johnson, Shari Esayian, Robert and Jean 
Hilchey, Don and Dorothy Koll, Jack and Belle Lindquist, Kevin Murphy, Donald

RSVP; RODEO BLOCK PARTY HOSTS SOCCER BLOC 
</P>

 It was billed as "The World Comes to Rodeo Drive," and the name was apt as the 
Concern Foundation for Cancer Research and Concern II linked up with 
festivities for World Cup USA '94 to stage their annual fund-raising block 
party Sunday night in the internationally famous shopping mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer balls blockaded the ends of Rodeo Drive as the well-dressed and the 
scantily clad wandered amid an array of entertainers sporting costumes 
representing many of the 24 countries whose teams qualified for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads turned each time a ponytail, a goatee or dreadlocks were spotted in the 
crowd, but these were merely Baggio, Lalas or Larsson wanna-bes, not the real 
stars of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Food booths served everything anyone might or might not want to eat from the 
cuisine of the participating nations -- from herring salad to vegetable risotto 
to hot dogs and popcorn. Celebrities including Hal Linden, Mr. Blackwell, 
Costas Mandylor, Michelle Phillips, Michael Lerner, Max Cassella and Tommy 
Lasorda took turns tending bar, some clearly more adept than others. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-chairmen of the evening, Mitchell Feinstein and David Schaeffer, 
expected to raise more than $1 million to fund continued research in cancer 
immunology. The advance sales numbered 2,800 with tickets going for $300 each, 
and another $65,000 was raised through walk-up business. Inevitably, although 
the good cause of the night was not forgotten, much of the talk was about 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Pacula, strolling the boulevard with Count Giovanni Volpi and Armani 
executive Wanda McDaniel, admitted that she knew little of the contest but was 
pleased to hear for her companions' sake that "Italy is still in it," because 
Armani had designed the Italian team's off-field uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Kopell said he is a "tennis and boxing fan. I tried playing soccer 
once. I thought I was fairly fit, but I nearly died. The action never stops."  
</P>
<P>
 That nonstop action is what appeals to one enthusiast, Zachery Ty Bryan. "I 
love that nonstop 90 minutes without timeouts. I play the game all I can and 
I'd love to be able to go on to play professionally," said the 12-year-old 
actor, hopeful the impact of this World Cup will push soccer to major-league 
status in this country by the time he's grown up.

AN EQUAL-RIGHTS ACTION THRILLER GAINS 'SPEED'; MOVIES: ANALYSTS SAY THE PICTURE 
IS AS POPULAR WITH WOMEN AS WITH MEN -- A DEPARTURE FOR THE MALE-DOMINATED 
SLAM-BANG GENRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Who'd have thought a Santa Monica Big Blue Bus could hold its own against such 
competitors as Alec Baldwin and Julia Roberts? 
</P>
<P>
 The bus, of course, is the centerpiece of the summer's hot action movie, 20th 
Century Fox's "Speed," which has already taken in $84.6 million and proven 
itself a worthy competitor of such film fare as Baldwin's "The Shadow" and 
Roberts' "I Love Trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 As an action movie, "Speed" has its assets -- the prerequisite psycho villain 
(Dennis Hopper), some out-of-sight pyrotechnics and Keanu Reeves in his first 
adult role as a policeman trying to save a busload of passengers. But it also 
has something that distinguishes it from most films in this male-dominated 
genre -- its appeal to women. 
</P>
<P>
 "This film played to women from the second they saw it," said Andrea Jaffe, 
president of domestic marketing for Fox, of "Speed's" initial test screenings, 
adding that the film tested well with women regardless of age. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit polls taken opening night by Cinema Score reflect the same data. Although 
fewer women went to see the film, the same percentage of women and men -- 97% 
-- liked the movie. Harold Mintz, Cinema Score's research analyst, put it 
simply: "Everybody who goes to see 'Speed' likes it." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's print ad campaign now reflects this phenomenon. Initially focusing 
on Reeves and the bus exploding, it now includes Sandra Bullock, whose 
character's fortitude helps save the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've definitely geared the campaign equally to men and women," Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe attributes the film's success among women to their interest in Reeves. 
"We knew (that) would take them across genres. Our tests showed that women's 
interest in seeing a movie with Keanu Reeves was really high." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Sherak, executive vice president for Fox, believes that Reeves' co-star, 
Bullock, whose character Annie manages to keep the pedal to the metal while 
ensuring that the hero doesn't have an emotional breakdown, is a significant 
factor in the film's crossover appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sandra's just like Keanu, she's also our hero," Sherak said. "Women like to 
see the woman as the hero, and she's just as much of a hero as he is." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, there's a supporting actress who doesn't break down and 
cry or whine," Jennifer Fos, 27, said after seeing the film at the Del Amo Mall 
in Torrance. "They played her as well as they played him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gordon, who produced "Speed," said that making Annie an equal was 
intentional. "When we started three years ago," Gordon said, "I was very 
interested in creating a female protagonist who was intimately and aggressively 
involved in the progress of the movie, rather than being saved by the man 
throughout the film." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jan DeBont agreed: "Sandra's playing such a different part than the 
usual, she's not helpless . . . she's in charge of her own destiny. In fact, 
she's more in charge of herself than Keanu's character is." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, this is an action movie without a lot of blood and gore. For Dena White, 
25, who saw the film at the Beverly Center Cineplex, "Speed" offered a welcome 
respite to the usual action fare. "I usually don't like action movies, because 
they're too violent, too many people getting killed."  
</P>
<P>
 But "Speed," White said, was different. "It's like you're pulled along, and 
you're not sure what's going to happen next. It's not like 'Robocop' where you 
don't care what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 DeBont acknowledges that he consciously tried to limit the violence. "I don't 
like to see it myself," he said. "I'm so fed up with seeing violence in movies, 
on television. There's already so much in the city that when I go to the movies 
I want to have the action based on feeling and emotion rather than on violence 
and gore." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike some other action movies, this one's not done with a body count," 
Sherak agreed. "People do die . . . but that's balanced by all the people who 
get saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon concurred. "Most action pictures are all about people being mowed down 
by machine guns. Fewer than 10 people die in this movie. . . . (Audiences) have 
had it with gratuitous violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that keeps people coming back," Gordon continued, "and why 
it has crossed over to women, is that it's a ride, a roller coaster ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherak thinks "Speed" transcends its action movie status and is instead "the 
definition of a summer fun movie. It touches all the right buttons. . . . It's 
a good movie for the public and for the film business. If you see a picture 
like 'Speed,' it makes you feel good about movies, and that's contagious, it 
spurs you to see another movie." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bullock has reaped the benefits that come with being in one of the biggest 
hits of the summer. The actress will next star in "While You Were Sleeping" for 
a reported $1.2-million salary.

REALITY DOESN'T BITE FOR GAROFALO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janeane Garofalo's patience has paid off. Four years ago, the bold and brainy 
stand-up comic auditioned for Lorne Michaels, executive producer of "Saturday 
Night Live," with a half-hour set at a New York comedy club. 
</P>
<P>
 Michaels was impressed enough to offer Garofalo a writing job on the show, but 
she turned it down, preferring to craft her comedy onstage rather than behind 
the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Michaels is finally ready to welcome Garofalo's brusque charms and barbed 
point-of-view to the "SNL" set. When the show begins its next season Sept. 17, 
Garofalo will be a member of the cast. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old New Jersey native is excited about moving back to the East 
Coast, but the new job does create some new worries. "I don't have any fears 
about living in New York. But there are some fears about the show. It's live 
TV. What if I blank out in my first sketch? What if I vomit? It's a whole new 
kind of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 "SNL" sketch work won't mark the first time that Garofalo has departed from 
her stand-up material. She has proved herself to be a strong comic actress with 
her work as a featured player on "The Ben Stiller Show"; as Paula, the cool, 
capable talent booker on Garry Shandling's "The Larry Sanders Show," and as 
Winona Ryder's glibly good-natured pal in the film "Reality Bites."  
</P>
<P>
 But even with a successful film career under way and "Saturday Night Live" in 
the immediate future, Garofalo remains devoted to her stand-up work, which she 
now regularly brings to alternative comedy settings, including a recent 
appearance at a benefit for the cutting-edge art space, Los Angeles 
Contemporary Exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to increase my visibility for the sake of the stand-up as 
opposed to using stand-up to get on TV. I was hoping that being on TV would 
help sell more tickets to stand-up shows. It hasn't really been the case for me 
yet, but we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo took the jump into the stand-up world during her senior year at 
Providence College in Rhode Island. The idea of working her way up to an 
appearance on "Letterman" sounded more exciting than anything her history major 
might lead to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it immediately," she recalls. "I didn't do well, but I liked it 
anyway. I knew I was going to keep doing it. It was the first thing in my life 
I'd ever approached with at least a notch above apathy."  
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Garofalo concentrated on presenting comedy that was intense 
and personal. And she often found it easier to speak openly to a club crowd 
than to friends and family. "I think I'm much stronger on stage than in life. I 
don't know where I get whatever courage I have up there, but I'm more open with 
a roomful of strangers than I am with people I've known for years. Maybe it's 
easier because there are no strings attached. It's hit-and-run confession. You 
can say something, bolt out of the room and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, Garofalo speaks too honestly and directly for some audiences' 
tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm obsessed with myself, but I really don't know what else to 
talk about. I can't speak for others. I say, 'This is what happened to me, and 
this is what I think about it.' When you do that out on the road, you're going 
to meet with some resistance. I've run into actual violence and a lot of 
hostility at my shows, but other comics were always very supportive and there's 
always been a little pocket of each audience that really liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, those pockets of Garofalo-watchers will tune in to "SNL" to see 
how the comic's edgy talents are put to use. She says the prospect of weekly 
national attention hasn't gone to her head yet. "I'm still so low on the 
celebrity totem pole, changing my life isn't even an issue." Garofalo did 
experiment with changing her hair color recently, but was unhappy with the 
results. "I wanted to be a blonde, but I was just a yellow." 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo, who will continue with "Larry Sanders" when the "SNL" season wraps, 
says she won't be fazed by meeting and working with the celebrity guests at her 
new gig. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already completed my celebrity checklist. Albert Brooks once called me 
up to tell me I was funny, which was probably the most amazing moment of my 
life. And I got to meet Elvis Costello on 'Larry Sanders.' They're the only two 
people I felt I had to meet. But I will say that, even though I'm not a 
Republican, I really like Mary Matalin, and I love the Matalin-Carville duo. If 
being on 'Saturday Night Live' puts me in a position to have dinner with the 
Matalin-Carvilles, I'll be very happy."

'BEWITCHED': HAUNTED BY LUNA TUNES; POP MUSIC: THE ALTERNATIVE ROCK BAND 
DEFENDS ITS SOUND AND NEW ALBUM AS DISTINCTIVE, NOT DERIVATIVE, DESPITE SOME 
OBVIOUS LINKS TO VELVET UNDERGROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ROOS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're based in New York, former Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling 
Morrison played on their latest album, and on their 1993 EP, "Slide," they 
covered the Lou Reed-John Cale song "Ride Into the Sun."  
</P>
<P>
 Is alternative-rock band Luna having an identity crisis?  
</P>
<P>
 Responding to criticism that his group is derivative of the Velvets is nothing 
new to Dean Wareham, Luna's articulate leader. Not surprisingly, he has no 
problem tackling the issue head-on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can take things musically -- pick and choose from here and there 
-- without sounding retro, and I don't think we do," said the band's 
30-year-old singer, guitarist and lyricist during a recent phone interview. 
"Hopefully, you create something that's unique. I believe we sound like Luna. 
We do have a distinctive sound."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the use of Morrison on Luna's new album, "Bewitched," would seem to invite 
even more skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gonna get the comparisons anyway, but it is true that it is worse now," 
said the New Zealand-born Wareham, who brings his band -- which also includes 
drummer Stanley Demeski, guitarist Sean Eden and bassist Justin Harwood -- to 
the Coach House on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was that worried about it, though, I wouldn't have asked him to play. I 
love what Sterling adds to 'Bewitched,' and if you can't sit back and enjoy him 
without getting nit-picky, it's just foolish. The only stuff on this record 
that sounds like the Velvet Underground was played by Sterling -- and he's 
allowed."  
</P>
<P>
 Unveiling a quieter, more hypnotic pace than heard on 1992's "Lunapark," the 
quartet's latest recording makes the Cowboy Junkies sound energized. Dreamy 
melodies float along from the simple, Meat Puppets-like "Tiger Lily" to the, 
well . . . sleepy "Sleeping Pill." Although low-key, a gentle folksiness graces 
the 12-song collection.  
</P>
<P>
 "The softer sound developed by accident, really," Wareham said. "I had written 
a few half-baked acoustic songs at home, and they wound up on the record," he 
said, referring to "Into the Fold" and "Great Jones Street." "And Stanley 
(Demeski) was playing drums more with brushes, so we did pull back a little 
bit. Actually, I thought we'd turn up the guitars a little more for 
'Bewitched,' but it just didn't happen. Maybe the record is louder in a quieter 
sort of way."  
</P>
<P>
 Thematically, buried beneath soothing melodies are melancholy tales of 
breakups, unrequited love and other matters of the heart. Exemplifying the 
feelings of self-doubt and loneliness that creep moodily through "Bewitched" is 
this verse from "Into the Fold": "Well, you know I ain't no mystic, but I'm 
wrapped up in your life / And I don't ask silly questions, 'cause I couldn't 
stand the lies."  
</P>
<P>
 Are these songs of fiction, or has Wareham found an avenue for venting his own 
romantic frustrations? 
</P>
<P>
 'Well, I'm hopeful for myself because my own situation is quite good. . . . 
I've been in the same relationship now for seven years," he replied. "I don't 
know; you have to look around you. You never know what's going on between two 
people. It's a mystery. Sadly, people do all kinds of horrible things to each 
other. We're capable of all kinds of hurtful things." Another fairly recent 
change for Luna is the addition of guitarist Sean Eden, who splits the lead 
licks about equally with Wareham. Eden has been touring with Luna for the past 
year, including the group's recent three-month stint opening for the Cocteau 
Twins.  
</P>
<P>
 "We always wanted to be a four-piece (band), mainly because there are all 
kinds of things that you record that you can't get across live as just a trio," 
explained Wareham. "So we placed an ad in the Village Voice, and Sean wound up 
our man. Now, I do play less lead, but it frees me up as a singer, and Sean 
gets to play all of the tricky parts."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In case you're wondering, this Luna is the same band heretofore known as Luna 
2. As Wareham tells it, legal entanglements forced the band to buy the rights 
to the name Luna.  
</P>
<P>
 'We always just called ourselves Luna, until someone wrote a letter to our 
lawyer claiming she was Luna," he said. "So (on 'Lunapark') we put a little '2' 
there in the corner and hoped no one would notice. But this woman noticed, so 
we payed her off to avoid being sued. Now we get to be Luna, and she's going 
around calling herself Lluna, or something like that." * Luna, Red Red Meat and 
Maya play Wednesday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano. 8 p.m. $10.

 On the Orange County rock scene, Water is a promising alternative-rock band 
whose debut album for MCA Records is already in the can. But, according to the 
O.C. band's co-manager, Steve Levesque, a Colorado bar band has emerged 
claiming that it had first dibs on the name Water. 
</P>
<P>
 Levesque said the Colorado band's lawyer has quoted $40,000 as its asking 
price for the rock 'n' roll version of Water rights. Rather than ante up, the 
O.C. band's first response was to change its name to Waterchrome. 
</P>
<P>
 But Levesque said officials at MCA thought "Waterchrome" had a tinny ring, so 
Water is again mulling what to call itself. Levesque said there is a 
possibility that the band will pay off the Colorado Water for undisputed rights 
to the name, but it would rather take the cheaper way out if it can find a 
different name that fits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now we're looking at trying to find a cool name," Levesque said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Water will play occasional shows under its old name, including one 
Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. at On the Rox in West Hollywood. The club is above the 
Roxy, 9009 Sunset Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Water recorded its debut album in February in New Orleans with producer Gavin 
Mackillop, whose previous credits include Toad the Wet Sprocket and the Church. 
Levesque said the release is being held until January so that Water, or 
whatever the band will be called by then, won't be submerged in the annual 
end-of-year flood of major releases.

 Standing Hawthorn, Soul Scream, Stranger and Goldfish will play their way up 
the coast together on a four-stop jaunt that starts Wednesday at the Belly Up

 AND IF YOU ORDER BEFORE MIDNIGHT . . . : Dan Crary, the bluegrass guitar ace 
from Fullerton, shares his astonishing acumen in a new instructional video for 
Homespun Tapes (the Woodstock, N.Y., company is run by Happy Traum, the '60s 
folkie who was one of Bob Dylan's compadres in the old days). 
</P>
<P>
 The 85-minute tape, dubbed "Dan Crary's Bluegrass Guitar Workshop, An In-Depth 
Exploration of Dynamic Flatpicking," lists for $49.95 and can be ordered by 
phone, by calling (800) 338-2737. 
</P>
<P>
 Acoustic-guitar fans content to enjoy Crary's playing rather than pursue a 
video course in his technique can check out "Jammed If I Do," his latest album 
for Sugar Hill Records. It features guest-guitarist turns by Doc Watson, Tony 
Rice, Norman Blake and Beppe Gambetta.

IT'S TRUE: 'LIES' TO GET A SNEAK PREVIEW THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans awaiting the release of 20th Century Fox's highly anticipated "True Lies" 
will be able to catch the film a day earlier than expected. Sneak previews of 
the movie, which unites the "Terminator" team of director James Cameron and 
superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger, will be held at 1,300 theaters nationwide on 
Thursday night in anticipation of its 2,345-screen opening on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While this may be good news for moviegoers, the studio's decision to include 
pre-opening ticket sales into first-weekend revenues raises questions about the 
process of box-office accounting. But it is not without precedent. Fox did the 
same on 1990's action sequel "Die Hard 2," as did TriStar Pictures with 
"Terminator 2" in 1991. Warner Bros. also used the strategy on both "Batman" 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Reardon, president of distribution for Warner Bros., defends the 
practice. "Sneaks add a nice little bonus to the opening weekend," he says. 
"They're a great way to kick off the weekend. But not everyone shares my view, 
of course. There was an asterisk (indicating an added evening's gross) added to 
both 'Batman' figures when we reported them. That asterisk has stayed with it 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's senior executive vice president Tom Sherak admits that sneaking films 
falls into the category of "hype," but says "that's what this business is all 
about." As part of the hoopla, Schwarzenegger -- surfacing on screen for the 
first time since last summer's "Last Action Hero" debacle -- will put his hand 
and footprints in cement at noon on Thursday at Mann's Chinese Theater. An 
afternoon screening of the $100-million-plus picture will follow, and those 
grosses will also be added to the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherak explains that since Cameron was working "seven days a week, 24 hours a 
day" to deliver the film, the studio wasn't able to hold the press junket until 
last weekend. Sneaks, he says, were one way of fueling positive word of mouth. 
Because the film was not completed in time for its planned July 1 release, the 
studio was forced to move it back two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Goldman, president of marketing and distribution for New Line Cinema, 
who plans to sneak Jim Carrey's "Mask" the night before the film's July 28 
opening, understands the reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holding sneaks is a great way of getting extra summer play time, particularly 
when you've got a young male audience up for going to the movies late on a 
summer night," he says. "But, we won't be wrapping that extra one-third of a 
day into the opening weekend figures. You can't pretend that it's all on 
Friday, when it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherak good-naturedly dismisses the naysayers who charge that the calculations 
are unfair. "Are you comparing apples and oranges?" he asks. "If it's your 
movie, it isn't. If it's someone else's, it is. This isn't about being No. 1 or 
2, but about dealing with the heat of the movie. You can't tell me that, if any 
other studio had a movie with this much wanna-see, they wouldn't be doing the 
same thing."

STOLEN MERCEDES SLAMS CAR; BOY GRAVELY HURT; ACCIDENT: DRIVER OF SPEEDING 
VEHICLE LEAVES SCENE AFTER BROADSIDING A MOTHER AND TWO CHILDREN. A SUSPECT IS 
LATER ARRESTED AFTER IRVINE NEIGHBORHOOD IS SEARCHED. 
</P>

<P>
 A 7-year-old boy was critically injured Monday when a man who had sped through 
three red lights in a stolen Mercedes broadsided the child's mother's car, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, Trent McGee of Irvine, was in extremely critical condition on a 
ventilator at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, Police Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a six-hour, door-to-door search, police arrested John Eric Phelps, 
31, of Dana Point on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, evading arrest, grand 
theft auto, reckless driving and other charges, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps was held without bail because he is on parole, police said. They would 
not say what he had been convicted of. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercedes was going about 100 m.p.h. when it attracted the attention of an 
off-duty motorcycle officer from Laguna Beach, who was getting on the Santa Ana 
Freeway from Laguna Canyon Road, according to Laguna Beach Police Chief Neal J. 
Purcell Jr. The officer, whom Purcell did not identify, was en route to repair 
his broken radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mercedes was passing cars like they were standing still," Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the chief said, his officers do not involve themselves in traffic 
offenses outside their jurisdiction unless it is serious. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle officer, who was in uniform and riding his police motorcycle, 
put on his red lights and began catching up with the car. 
</P>
<P>
 When it appeared the driver of the Mercedes did not notice him, Purcell said, 
the motor officer "turned on his siren to get his attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver turned to look at the motorcycle and, within several minutes, 
exited the freeway at Jeffrey Road. Purcell said the Mercedes began to slow, 
then ran red lights at the bottom of the off-ramp and again at the intersection 
of Jeffrey and Walnut Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Purcell said, the officer decided to stop the chase but 
continued to follow the Mercedes with lights flashing because the officer was 
in unfamiliar territory and unable to use his radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made the decision not to pursue the car any farther," Purcell said, and he 
did not see the accident at Jeffrey and Irvine Center Drive about an eighth of 
a mile ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl McGee, 40, was driving a Peugeot station wagon with her 10-year-old 
daughter and son Trent through the intersection at about 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mercedes pushed the Peugeot against a median divider. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the mother nor daughter was injured, but Trent suffered serious head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps ran, and the motorcycle officer chased him, but lost him in a 
residential area, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police cordoned off the area and began a daylong search. About 3 p.m., 
a home alarm went off at an unoccupied house on Lorraine Way, and Phelps was 
spotted riding from the house on a bicycle, Allevato said. After a brief chase, 
he was arrested, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 450 Mercedes, a two-door convertible, had been reported stolen Sunday 
night following a break-in at Dana Point Foreign Car Service.

ANAHEIM CONSIDERS REDEVELOPMENT OF STADIUM PROPERTY; LAND USE: PLANS COULD 
INCLUDE A NEW FACILITY THAT IS BETTER FOR FOOTBALL OR CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICES 
AND STORES IN THE PARKING LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider declaring Anaheim Stadium a 
redevelopment project to finance renovations and spur future development in the 
parking lot -- including the possible construction of a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just gives the city, or a developer, another financial tool to generate 
economic development," said City Manager James D. Ruth. "We see this as a real 
positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of damage to the stadium from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the 
city can designate the stadium and the parking lot a "redevelopment project," 
Ruth said, thus bypassing normal redevelopment restrictions that require a 
showing of blight, crime and other deficiencies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials believe that remodeling the stadium or building a new one 
is key to retaining the Los Angeles Rams. Team officials have said the stadium 
is obsolete and they want to move to another city with a better facility and 
greater financial opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who exercised a 15-month escape clause in their stadium lease in 
May, are being courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are examining several "construction options to make the 
existing stadium more suitable for football," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the project could assist in financing a new stadium, Ruth said: "I 
wouldn't preclude that possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake, the stadium's 17-ton scoreboard toppled and crushed 
several hundred seats. Those repairs are underway and will continue regardless 
of the redevelopment plan, Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 By declaring the city-owned land as a redevelopment area, the city will be 
able to use any increase in tax revenues to help pay for stadium improvements 
and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the city is exploring development projects that would be beneficial 
to the stadium area. Among the options, he said are office buildings and retail 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's action tonight begins the redevelopment process, which will require 
several public hearings before it can go forward. City staff will also be 
meeting with the council to determine how it wants the 150 acres of stadium 
land developed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other governmental agencies, such as school districts, often oppose 
redevelopment projects because they receive a smaller share of any increase in 
tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth, however, said that city officials have meet with the school districts in 
the area, as well as the Rams and the California Angels about the redevelopment 
plan, and "they had no opposition to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly, who has spearheaded efforts to keep the Rams in Anaheim, said 
the redevelopment plan "is a proper thing to do considering the circumstances. 
It gives the city a tool to rehabilitate and remodel the stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly called the project a prudent step to involve the private sector and spur 
growth around the stadium. He said he was not certain what type of development 
projects will be encouraged for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, a development group involving the Rams has the right to construct 
office buildings on part of the stadium parking lot. The Rams and Angels are 
appealing a recent court decision dealing with the group's development plans.

DISTRIBUTOR TO PAY FINE FOR MISLABELING OYSTERS; SETTLEMENT: PROSECUTORS SAY 
CAPTAIN SALTY'S MISBRANDED THE HARVEST DATE ON 80 CASES OF SEAFOOD. ADMITTING 
NO WRONGDOING, THE FIRM AGREES TO REFRAIN FROM 'DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING' 
ADVERTISING.

<P>
 A Garden Grove seafood distributor that mislabeled the "freshness" dates on 
dozens of cases of oysters has agreed to pay nearly $33,000 in penalties under 
a lawsuit settlement, a county prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer protection lawsuit charged that Captain Salty's Seafood Inc. 
misbranded the "harvest date" last November on 80 cases of oysters intended for 
local distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are health and safety concerns about eating oysters that are 
not fresh," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrea L. Burke of the Consumer Protection 
Unit of the Orange County district attorney's office. "There are various 
viruses and other health issues to be worried about if oysters are sitting 
around on shelves." 
</P>
<P>
 The corporation has not admitted wrongdoing, but under the settlement agreed 
to pay $32,756.25 in civil penalties and investigation costs and refrain from 
"deceptive and misleading" advertising, Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mislabeling was discovered during a routine inspection by the state 
Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The mollusks were tested and found to be safe for consumption before they were 
sent on their way to area buyers, Burke said. Before shipment, the labels were 
changed to reflect the true harvest date. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said Captain Salty's officials were aware that the oysters were 
harvested on Nov. 5, 1993, but mislabeled tags to indicate the harvest date as 
being several days later. 
</P>
<P>
 A lag in the time between harvest and consumption can lead to illness, said 
Burke, who noted that many connoisseurs enjoy their oysters raw. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozzie Schmidt, a supervisor with the state health department, said mislabeling 
also can stymie efforts to trace tainted oysters to their source. 
</P>
<P>
 "The loss of traceability is the most serious problem," Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Captain Salty's general manager Mike Armstrong and Motivatit Seafood Inc., of 
Louisiana, which shipped the mollusks to Orange County, were also named in the 
lawsuit but could not be reached for comment Monday.

15-YEAR-OLD CONVICTED IN FATAL STABBING; COURT: JUDGE RULES THE YOUTH WAS THE 
AGGRESSOR WHEN HE KILLED A RANCHO ALAMITOS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STAR DURING 
DISPUTE IN GARDEN GROVE OVER A CAR. 
</P>

<P>
 A 15-year-old was convicted Monday of second-degree murder for fatally 
stabbing a Rancho Alamitos High School football star when a fight over a 
Volkswagen bug escalated out of control, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory Allen Callison was 14 years old -- and large for his age -- when he 
stabbed 18-year-old Moudka Chounlamany during a March 8 confrontation on a 
Garden Grove street. Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald E. Owen rejected 
Callison's claims that he acted in self-defense, and found that the youth was 
the aggressor in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko said Callison is a brash youth with a hot 
temper who insisted on challenging a group of four teen-agers -- and then 
stabbed Chounlamany, a 5-foot-6-inch, 150-pound star running back who led his 
school to a sectional football championship last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big kid who wants to prove he's in charge, he's got a knife, and 
unfortunately he uses it," Molko said of Callison. "He was the aggressor, and 
as the aggressor he has no right to self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 While juvenile violence seems rampant, it is still rare to find youngsters 
facing such serious charges in Orange County, defense attorney Julian Bailey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said he is disappointed with the judge's decision and plans to appeal. 
He said his client believed he was about to be attacked by four teen-agers and 
stabbed the victim because he feared for his own safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the most, I believe this verdict should have been for voluntary 
manslaughter," Bailey said, adding his client is distraught, depressed and 
extremely remorseful. "I think it's also possible a jury could have found him 
not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Molko said the incident began when Callison mistakenly believed that two 
teen-agers -- including a youth who lived near Callison and Chounlamany's 
younger brother, Tootoo, were tampering with his Volkswagen parked in the 12700 
block of Louise Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison confronted the youths, punched one in the face and ran them off, 
Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moudka Chounlamany and a friend later picked up Tootoo Chounlamany and were 
escorting the other teen-ager back to his home in Callison's neighborhood when 
the defendant approached their vehicle and punched the older Chounlamany in the 
face as he sat behind the steering wheel, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Moudka Chounlamany got out of his car, Callison stabbed him in the chest, 
causing a gaping wound that punctured his heart and lungs, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, defendants must be 16 years or older at the time a crime is 
committed before prosecutors can seek to have them tried as adults. Callison is 
expected to be sentenced July 25 to the California Youth Authority. The judge 
has sentencing discretion, but under state law Collison cannot be held past the 
age of 25, Molko said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said he is sure that all involved in the case can agree on one point: 
"This is a horrible tragedy that should never have happened."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; A HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE FOR SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Irvine Adult Day Health Center, which opened Monday next door to the 
city's new senior center, is part recreation hall, part medical clinic and part 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 It is designed to provide medical services as well as health education, social 
activities and meals for frail seniors and disabled adults who live in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 For some clients who suffer from chronic ailments such as arthritis or 
Alzheimer's disease, the center could mean the difference between living at 
home with relatives or being institutionalized at a nursing home or hospital, 
center officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to prevent unnecessary hospitalization and nursing home 
placement," said Carol Quintana, executive director of the facility. "We offer 
the support services and medical services they need in order to stay healthy 
and active." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which was funded with a combination of private donations and city 
money, can accommodate as many as 60 clients at one time. 
</P>
<P>
 Quintana said about 20 people are enrolled so far and another 20 are having 
their applications reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's long-awaited opening was hailed Monday by local seniors. Ethel 
Coplen, an Irvine senior citizens activist, said the center will help one 
friend who cares for her nearly blind mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be wonderful because she can drop (the mother) off at 9 and 
pick her up at 5," Coplen said. "Right now, she's on 24-hour duty because her 
mother can't be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Though its proximity to the Lakeview Senior Center is bound to attract many 
elderly visitors, the health center is open to all adults, including younger 
people with disabling medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The center employs a full-time registered nurse as well as social workers, a 
physical therapist, an activities coordinator and a psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff works with clients' doctors to work out personalized medical plans 
that might include psychological counseling, speech or physical therapy and 
mild exercise, Quintana said. 
</P>
<P>
 In between these medical sessions, the visitors can take part in a variety of 
activities, including arts-and-crafts classes, nutrition lectures and dance 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the best of both worlds," Quintana said. "People can enjoy all our 
activities while they get all the medical services they need." 
</P>
<P>
 The center puts a premium on keeping clients involved and entertained, 
Quintana added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep things moving all day," she said. "We want to create a social 
setting where they can be with their friends and peers." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5,600-square-foot center includes health offices, conference rooms and a 
dining area. 
</P>
<P>
 Center services are covered by MediCal as well as many private insurance 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The base rate is $55 per visit, but the center can provide scholarships to 
people who cannot afford to pay the full price.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LIFEGUARDS SEEK OK TO CAPTURE STINGRAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seal Beach lifeguards are seeking permission to net stingrays after a rash of 
people reported getting stung in North County beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have observed an increase in the number of stingrays 
recently because of warmer water temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have had a notable increase," said A. J. Summers, a Seal Beach 
lifeguard supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 He said lifeguards have contacted the state Department of Fish and Game to ask 
if they can be authorized to capture and destroy or have the barbs removed on 
the fish. 
</P>
<P>
 On recent summer weekends, water temperatures have gone as high as 73 degrees, 
which has helped draw the usually docile stingrays to the beach, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 15,000 people visit the beach each weekend day, lifeguards average 
reports of 10 stings a day. On Saturday, 17 stings were reported and another 10 
on Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When swimmers disturb or step on the stingray, it swings its whip-like tail 
upward and causes a painful wound. Medical treatment is simple. Lifeguards 
place the area of the sting in hot water to help neutralize the ray's toxins, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one Seal Beach swimmer, who told lifeguards he was recovering from a 
hospital stay, temporarily needed oxygen after he was stung. Paramedics were 
not called, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stingrays are attracted to the San Gabriel River mouth, which has won it the 
nickname of "Ray Bay." Before stingrays came under the protection of coastal 
laws, Summers said, they were routinely captured in nets and destroyed or their 
barbs removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have contacted (Department of) Fish and Game to get the ball rolling on a 
possible netting," Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fish and Game spokesman said authorization to hunt the rays is not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did allow them to net and destroy the rays about 20 years ago," said Pat 
Moore. "But my feeling is they won't be allowed to do that again. We don't just 
go out and go hunting when someone is bothered by animals anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't gotten to the point of formally warning the public because 
stingrays have always been here," Summers said. "And we don't want to cause a 
panic. We have thousands of people who visit our beach and they don't get 
stung. But our stance is that if you're concerned, you should check with the 
lifeguard because they know where the safe areas are." 
</P>
<P>
 At nearby Huntington State Beach, lifeguard Jeffrey Lung said that even on 
busy weekends only a few bathers are unlucky enough to encounter stingrays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting about 30,000 to 45,000 people a day on Saturdays and Sundays," 
Lung said. "And, we're averaging only about two or three reported stings a day. 
They like still water, and seem to be coming closer to shore at Bolsa Chica 
State Beach than here at Huntington State, where we tend to have more wave 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Lung said lifeguards were telling visitors to shuffle their feet when they 
walk in the water. "This will draw them away from you," Lung said. Summer Sting 
Normally docile, stingrays are ever present this summer at Orange County 
beaches and stinging away. More than 100 stingray injuries have been reported 
so far by local lifeguards, double the number reported this time last year. 
Stingray: Small, flat fish with nearly round disk. Its whip-like tail has sharp 
spines on the back near the middle with poisonous glands at the base of each 
spine. Size: Up to 30 inches long, 28 inches wide. Coloring: Brownish or 
gray-brown, usually with yellow spots, white to yellowish below. Diet: 
Invertebrates and small fishes. Sting: In defense against predators, a stingray 
will swing its tail upward and inflict a wound with the spine of its tail. 
Habitat: Sand or mud bottoms off beaches and in bays, from 3 to 70 feet 
offshore. Range: Northern California to Panama, mostly in warm coastal waters. 
Protecting Yourself Feet up: Try not to walk too much in water. Swim or float 
to avoid stepping on a stingray. Stingray shuffle: When you do walk in the 
water, lifeguards suggest shuffling your feet. This kicks up the sand and 
alerts stingrays, who may move away to avoid any contact. Be alert: Stingrays 
lie on flat, sandy areas in warm water. Lifeguards can tell you places to 
avoid. Treatment: If stung, let the wound bleed, then soak it in hot water for 
30 to 45 minutes. Sources: Peterson Field Guide to Pacific Coast Fish,

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; FILING PERIOD NEARS FOR WIDE-OPEN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With three council seats available and two incumbents spurning another 
four-year term, the filing period for a suddenly wide-open City Council 
election opens Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomination papers can be submitted to the city clerk's office from that day 
through Aug. 12 at 5 p.m. The deadline will be extended to Aug. 17 if any of 
three incumbent council members decides not to run for reelection, as appears 
likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent council members whose terms expire this year are Robert D. Breton, 
Sharon Cody and Mayor Susan Withrow. The city election will be Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody and Breton have already announced their intention not to seek reelection 
-- in Cody's case, the announcement came almost two years ago. Both former 
mayors have said the time required to be an effective council member has taken 
too much time away from family and career. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow, a political newcomer four years ago who spent more than $30,000 of 
her own money to win election, has expressed a desire to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination papers must be signed by a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 30 
registered voters living in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are also required to submit a disclosure statement listing all 
investments and financial involvement in real estate. There is no charge for 
filing nomination papers. However, there is a $950 charge for turning in an 
optional candidate's statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates also must be registered voters living in Mission Viejo. All 
nomination forms are available at the city clerk's office in City Hall, 26522 
La Alameda. For more election information, call (714) 582-2489. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; REPLACEMENT NAMED FOR OUSTED DEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of electrical and computer engineering at UC Irvine has been 
named acting dean of the university's School of Engineering, UCI officials 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Allen Stubberud will succeed William Sirignano as dean Sept. 1, UCI 
spokesman Scott Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening ousted Sirignano as dean of the School of 
Engineering in March on the recommendation of a faculty committee after a 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirignano plans to return to full-time teaching in the department of 
mechanical and aerospace engineering and continue his research in 
thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stubberud, 60, has extensive experience as a dean of the UCI engineering 
school, Nelson said; he served as dean from 1978 until 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult job," Stubberud said. "You've got to interact with a lot of 
people, administrators, faculty members, industrial people and students. You've 
got several different constituencies you're trying to please." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubberud said he did not apply for the permanent dean's slot. He estimated 
that a search for the next dean would last until next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally from Glendive, Mont., Stubberud said he started his career in the 
University of California system as an instructor at UCLA in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined UCI's faculty during its infancy, moving to the university in 1969 
-- four years after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a leave from UCI between 1983 and 1985, when he was appointed chief 
scientist of the U.S. Air Force in Washington, D.C. From 1987 to 1988, he 
served as director of the Electrical, Communications and Systems Engineering 
Division of the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stubberud, of Irvine, said he received his bachelor's degree in electrical 
engineering from the University of Idaho and his master's and doctoral degrees 
in engineering from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 He will continue to serve as chairman of the electrical and computer 
engineering department at UCI during his stint as dean.ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL TO DECIDE IF HOUSE IS A NUISANCE

<P>
 The City Council tonight will decide whether to classify a castle-style home 
in the Ranch village as a public nuisance -- a move that could eventually lead 
to the demolition of the controversial structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, owned by Fern and Victor Ganish, has been under construction for 
more than 12 years.And for nearly that long the city has pressured the Ganishes 
to complete the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, city building inspectors armed with a search warrant 
examined the home's interior, which the Ganishes admit lacks flooring, drywall 
and plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on information obtained during the search, the city charged the Ganishes 
with violating various building and safety codes. A court hearing on the matter 
is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The council tonight will receive a report from city officials on the history 
of the house, which the Ganishes transformed from a modest ranch-style home 
into a Tudor castle that neighbors complain is out of place in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the home is declared a nuisance, the city could give the Ganishes a 
deadline to complete the remodeling job. If they fail to meet the deadline, 
officials could move to have the home demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ganishes have long accused the city of harassing them. In an interview 
earlier this year, Fern Ganish said the remodeling job was progressing slowly 
because of her husband's poor health. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; BALLOT STATEMENT FEE RAISED TO $1,000 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to increase the fee that candidates pay to have 
their ballot statements printed in the city's voter pamphlet. 
</P>
<P>
 It will now cost $1,000 to have the statement included in the city mailer -- 
an increase of $250 from the current price.Candidates running in this fall's 
council and mayoral races will have to pay the new rate. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the fee increase was necessary so that the pamphlet could 
be translated into Vietnamese and Spanish, as state law mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are not required to have the 200-word statements printed in the 
pamphlet, but most serious contenders do because the mailer is distributed to 
voters throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members expressed hesitation at increasing the fee, fearing it 
might price some potential candidates out of the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of system deters people without money from running for office," 
said Councilwoman Christina L. Shea, who voted against the fee increase. "It 
seems like the fairest thing to do is have a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members argued that serious candidates could raise the 
$1,000, which represents only a fraction of the money they would need to pay 
for such expenses as campaign signs and direct mailings. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters this November will select a mayor and two council members. Candidates 
can pull nominating papers beginning Monday. The papers must be returned to the 
city clerk's office by Aug. 12.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; LAW WOULD LIMIT HANGING LAUNDRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carmen Reyes washes at least two loads of laundry a day and hangs the clothes 
to dry on the chain-link fence and clothesline beside her Grace Avenue home. 
</P>
<P>
 Her daily routine soon may be disrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider adopting an ordinance that would 
prohibit people from hanging laundry in public view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the government will let me continue drying our clothes out here," 
Reyes said on a recent morning while placing damp bedsheets and children's 
clothes on her fence. "I wash a lot of clothes for seven of my children, my 
husband and myself every day and I don't have enough money to dry them at the 
Laundromat. I can't afford a dryer and even if I could, there's no room for one 
in the house." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ordinance was drafted in response to years of complaints about 
unsightliness. The law also would prohibit storage of vehicles or any household 
goods including furniture, fixtures and appliances on yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want a car parked on somebody's front lawn," Mayor David M. 
Cheverton said. "We don't want knee-high weeds. We want properties to meet a 
certain standard and, by putting this (ordinance) in place, I think we're doing 
what the people of La Habra want." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reyes' neighbor, Maria Gomez, says she has no inconspicuous place to dry 
her clothes. So she hangs them from two ropes connected to trees in her front 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always pick up the clothes as soon as they are dry, so I can't see what the 
problem is," she said. "You have to dry your clothes, and you can't put 
clotheslines inside the house. . . . I think the city should worry about real 
problems like gang violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the ordinance worries the Rodriguez family on Olive Avenue, 
who live with two other families and park their cars on their front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no place else to put our cars," Maria Rodriguez said. "We can't 
afford to buy a bigger house. I think the city is just trying to get rid of 
poor people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed ordinance, graffiti also would be banned and paving more 
than 60% of a front yard to park vehicles would be prohibited. Also, residents 
would be required to make sure the exterior paint on their homes wasn't peeling 
and that lawns are no taller than six inches. Violators could be cited. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and homeowners associations applaud the proposed ordinance, 
saying it's about time the city cracked down on residents who don't keep their 
homes and neighborhoods in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners associations in Irvine, Brea and Santa Ana also prohibit 
clotheslines that are visible from a public street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Craig Bird and others circulated a petition against the ordinance, saying 
it discriminates against poor people and Latinos. They collected more than 50 
signatures Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand the weeds being a safety concern," Bird said. "But forcing 
people who can barely make their house payments to make sure their house paint 
isn't chipping is wrong. And I don't see how a clothesline is an eyesore. We're 
not Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheverton said the ordinance is an attempt to curb blight in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as discriminatory against anybody, any place in town," he 
said. "I think it's just common sense, and it's going to work out just fine."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; LIFEGUARDS HONORED FOR WORK IN PIER FIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lifeguards whose actions helped prevent injuries during a fire on the Seal 
Beach Pier have been honored by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council presented certificates of appreciation to A.J. Summers, Jeff 
Aldinger, Jeff Bousche, Russ Campbell, Damon Hannaman, Brian Lawrence, Bryan 
Liff, Ross Madden, Diane Rosenkranz and Craig Stenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The May 21 fire flared up in the middle of the historic wood boardwalk and 
stranded more than 100 people at the far end of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the lifeguards swam from shore to calm those trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lifeguards patrolling on a rescue boat saw flames shooting from below 
the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 They radioed the main lifeguard station, where officials called the Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the fire was extinguished, lifeguards placed a temporary wood overlay 
across the burned portion of the pier to allow the stranded people to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also praised the work of then-Chief Lifeguard Dan Dorsey, who 
coordinated the department's actions.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALLS PANEL LAWSUIT SEEKS SPECIAL ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton Recalls Committee Monday filed a lawsuit in Orange County 
Superior Court, seeking an October special election to replace three recalled 
officials, Mayor A. B. (Buck) Catlin and council members Molly McClanahan and 
Don Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed against the city and City Clerk Anne M. York, alleges that 
the state elections code was violated when the special election was 
consolidated with the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
 By consolidating the two elections, a special election to replace Catlin and 
McClanahan was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the special election for Catlin's and McClanahan's terms 
is unnecessary because they are due to expire in November anyway and 
consolidating the elections saves the city about $56,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, only Bankhead's seat would be up for replacement in the special 
election because his term is not due to expire until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Fullerton Recalls Committee said that is not fair and cheats 
the voters, even though those elected to fill Catlin's and McClanahan's terms 
in the requested October election would hold the seats for little more than two 
weeks. Officials said 75.3% of the people who voted in last month's recall 
election favored a special election to replace the three ousted officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the city clerk and the city violated the elections code and the 
only remedy we have is to file suit," said Thomas S. Babcock, chairman of the 
recalls committee. "We feel it is important enough to the voters of Fullerton 
to not let (the city) steal away the replacement election." 
</P>
<P>
 York could not be reached for comment Monday. City officials said she is 
vacationing in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking the city to quit breaking the law," said W. Snow Hume, a recall 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. R. K. (Kerry) Fox has maintained that no laws have been violated 
and that it is legal to consolidate the special election with the general 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the matter is scheduled in Orange County Superior Court on July 
22 at 1:30 p.m. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; REQUIREMENTS MIGHT CHANGE FOR

 The school board will consider a change in high school graduation requirements 
at its meeting tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes for Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District students would 
include reducing physical education requirements from three years to two years 
and eliminating driver's education as a required course. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are being recommended by an advisory committee that includes 
several high school and middle school principals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at adjusting the curriculum to meet the needs of modern high school 
students," said committee member Joe Quartucci, principal at Esperanza High 
School. "We haven't made many changes in curriculum in 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Quartucci, who until last month was principal at Valencia High School, said 
reducing the physical education requirement would give juniors and seniors more 
flexibility in the schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an indictment of the P.E. program," he said. "We need flexibility 
for students to establish career paths and to establish program majors for 
11th- and 12th-grade students." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said changing driver's education from a required course to an 
elective and offering it before or after school or on Saturday would also 
result in greater scheduling flexibility for students. 
</P>
<P>
 A third recommendation would shift world history to 10th grade; it is now 
taught in the ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board approves the curriculum changes, they will go into effect this 
September for students entering ninth and 10th grade. Juniors and seniors would 
meet current graduation requirements.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

MOTHER OF HIT-AND-RUN VICTIM RAN OUT OF TIME; TRAGEDY: THAO PHAN HAD PLANNED TO 
MOVE HER THREE CHILDREN TO A SAFER STREET -- BUT THEN SHE BRIEFLY LEFT THEM 
UNATTENDED. POLICE HAVE IMPOUNDED A CAR THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE ONE THAT 
FATALLY STRUCK 2-YEAR-OLD KAREN NGUYEN.

<P>
 Thao Phan was in a hurry to move her three small children off 15th Street. She 
hated the noise and the traffic that forever raced past their tiny apartment. 
On Saturday, she'd be out of there. 
</P>
<P>
 When plans to borrow a car for the move fell through, Phan set her sights on 
Sunday instead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one day too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan's 2-year-old daughter, Karen Nguyen, wandered into that traffic Saturday 
evening and was struck dead by a hit-and-run driver who police still were 
hunting on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping up the search, police sought a warrant to comb through a car that was 
seized Sunday from a public parking lot nearby following a tip from a neighbor. 
Authorities hoped to find clues that might lead to the driver and to examine 
the car for any tissue residue that might be linked to the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Phan tearfully appealed for help to pay for the funeral and 
replayed her decision to leave Karen and the two other children at home with 
two neighbors, age 11 and 13, while she went to buy sweet rice at a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan, 25, said she popped a videotape -- "The He Tre," or "The Young 
Generation" -- into the VCR, knowing Karen always laughed and danced along with 
the tape's images of young children dancing and singing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave them candy and told them to stay inside and not run outside," Phan 
recalled Monday as she asked for help on Vietnamese-language Little Saigon 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for her restaurant order, Phan said, she went to get a newspaper and 
then felt a wave of inexplicable dread. She said she ran home -- without the 
food -- and found an ambulance parked in front of the apartment she had rented 
since splitting up with her husband last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan said in an interview later that her two other children -- Cathy, 5, and 
Jimmy, 6, -- told her the children decided to go outside and play after she 
left for the food. All were playing in the front lawn in the 8300 block of 15th 
Street when Karen decided to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "She picked up some dirt and was on her way back when the car hit her," Phan 
said. She said Karen had never played outside the house unsupervised before 
Saturday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses described a red "Corvette-type" car and on Sunday a neighbor who 
said he witnessed the accident called police to report a similar car parked in 
the lot of a senior citizens center a quarter-mile from the scene, said Sgt. 
James Waller. 
</P>
<P>
 He said police impounded a 1973 Plymouth Satellite, though it is not known if 
it is the same car. Authorities were having trouble determining its owner 
because records showed it had been reported sold but no buyer named, Waller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we don't know who it belongs to," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said police were seeking a warrant to pick through the car and perform 
tests that might indicate whether it was involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Tony Lam said he plans to introduce a council motion tonight 
to install at least one speed bump on 15th Street in the area where the 
accident occurred. A school playground across the street from the Phan home is 
a popular draw for neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many families are very concerned about the traffic there, especially because 
so many children play in the area," Lam said. "Many children run across the 
street so they can get to the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Phan, who emigrated from Vietnam nine years ago under a special program for 
Amerasians, had put down $500 rent on a house in Garden Grove on Friday. She 
couldn't find transportation Saturday and decided to borrow her friend's car 
then. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, Phan was trying to come up with the $6,000 to $7,000 she said the 
funeral would cost. Her husband is in jail for attacking her with a meat 
cleaver in a drunken stupor two years ago, Phan said, and she has no job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life here in the U.S. is just so sad that my life is centered around my 
children, especially the youngest, Baby Karen," Phan said. "I gave her all my 
love and pinned all my dreams and hope on her. I don't know what I'll do now."

NEIGHBORHOOD SIGHS WITH RELIEF AS TOXIC CLEANUP STARTS; ENVIRONMENT: WORK 
BEGINS AT LAST AT WESTMINSTER LOCATION THE EPA CALLS ONE OF NATION'S MOST 
POLLUTED. ABOUT 50 FAMILIES WILL BE RELOCATED DURING EFFORT.

 Using a bulldozer to ceremoniously remove the first bucketful of earth from a 
vacant field, Environmental Protection Agency officials Monday began the 
cleanup of what they have described as one of the worst hazardous waste sites 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "This marks the beginning of the end of what's been a toxic site nightmare 
here in your community," Jeffrey Zelikson, director of the EPA's western 
regional office, told the gathering of about 70 residents and city officials. 
"What has made this so difficult is that the waste is literally in your back 
yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Vesperman, project manager, concurred. "Everything finally has come to a 
head," he said in an interview after the ceremony. "This is the true kickoff of 
the beginning of on-site work; we're now in the mobilization phase." 
</P>
<P>
 That phase has been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 According to historical records gathered by the EPA, the waste has it genesis 
in 1936 when the Long Beach-based Ralph Gray Trucking Co. dumped about 45,000 
cubic yards of petroleum products of unknown origin into four open pits in a 
field the company owned near what is now the intersection of Golden West Street 
and Sowell Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, a developer -- apparently intent on building a housing tract unmarred 
by the unsightly pits -- moved the hazardous material into two long trenches 
buried 18 feet beneath the back yards of 25 of the houses he was building. 
</P>
<P>
 And ever since then, residents say, the stuff has been oozing out of the 
heated ground every summer in the form of a black gooey tar exuding a powerful 
stench that many blame for health problems ranging from headaches and nausea to 
severe asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 "These poor guys have been scared to death," Eber Knapp, a 35-year tract 
resident, said of his affected neighbors. "This cleanup will relieve the 
tension for a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the area was added to the National Priorities List of Superfund 
sites, thus qualifying it for the $15-million federally funded cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials say the work will be accomplished in two phases. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in two weeks, they say, the first of about 50 affected families will 
be relocated at government expense to area hotels, rented houses or the homes 
of relatives and friends. In their absence, bulldozer operators wearing 
breathing masks will tear up swimming pools, patios and room additions -- all 
of which they will later replace -- to dig deeply into back yards and remove 
the hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the work will be completed this summer, officials say, and the rest next 
summer. Numerous residents and city officials were on hand Monday to applaud 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very significant event," Westminster Mayor Charles V. Smith said as 
onlookers ate cookies, downed soft drinks and pored over a display of 
protective gear to be used by Rust Remedial Services Inc., the company 
contracted to do the cleanup. "This could have been a major catastrophe; 
without the (federal government) it would have been impossible to do anything 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Johnson, who has lived here for eight years, expressed relief that his 
neighborhood's ordeal might soon be over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that something is finally really going to happen," he said after 
watching the ceremonial bulldozing. "Before it was just talk; this is the start 
of the end."

BOYS PLAYING WITH FIRE IGNITE BLAZE; DANGER: THE THREE WERE USING MATCHES WHEN 
THEY ACCIDENTALLY STARTED A 5-ACRE BRUSH FIRE, INVESTIGATORS SAY.

 A 9-year-old boy who was kept home for setting fires and two friends used 
matches and lighter fluid to start a back-yard brush fire Monday morning that 
burned five acres and briefly threatened some homes at the edge of Whiting 
Ranch Wilderness Park, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the eight nearby homes were damaged and no one was injured in the 
fire, which firefighters brought under control with the help of water dropped 
by helicopter.Fire crews on the ground also moved in to surround the blaze 
along a ridge near the intersection of Santiago Canyon and Modjeska Canyon 
roads, said Capt. Dan Young, spokesman for the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire burned through thick brush up the steep hillside but was controlled 
easily in windless conditions, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said two 9-year-old boys and a 12-year-old boy admitted setting the fire 
accidentally while playing with matches near their homes. Their names were not 
released because they are juveniles. Young said the case will be referred to 
the district attorney and the boys' parents asked to repay the estimated $1,000 
to $2,000 cost of dousing the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the younger boys told fire investigators he was grounded for having set 
fires during the past two weeks, Young said. Investigators discovered signs of 
at least five recent fires in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not talking about a campfire," Young said. "These kids were out in the 
middle of vegetation and using cigarette lighter fluid. Unbelievable."

 Two Santa Ana men have been arrested in connection with an alleged gang 
shooting Sunday night that wounded a 5-year-old boy playing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard William Hernandez, 21, and Roger Arenas, 18, were booked late Sunday 
on suspicion of attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon, Lt. Robert 
Helton said.He said both are gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Five-year-old Jonathan Garcia remained hospitalized in good condition Monday 
at UCI Medical Center in Orange. The child suffered a superficial wound in the 
lower back when he was struck by a stray pellet from a shotgun blast that 
Arenas allegedly fired at a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the shooting stemmed from a gang fight earlier in the day. As a 
car with rival gang members passed near the intersection of Pomona and Townsend 
streets late Sunday afternoon, Arenas ran out of his house with the shotgun and 
fired once, Helton said. A stray pellet pierced the boy's back as he played in 
his driveway nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who was at Arenas' house at the time, is being held as an 
accomplice, Helton said. Both man were being held on $250,000 bail. Helton said 
the weapon was not found. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have released one other suspect held for questioning.

RIORDAN PAYS THE PRICE FOR CALLING BAKERSFIELD BORING; CITIES: AFTER A 3 
1/2-HOUR TOUR ON 106-DEGREE DAY, HE'S ROASTED BY RESIDENTS. BUT L.A. MAYOR 
SLIPS IN SOME DIGS.

 "Bakersfield is boring," Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan blurted out during 
a recent radio interview, a remark he did not deem controversial in the least. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, after the quip caused a flap in this image-conscious San Joaquin 
Valley city, Riordan paid the price -- a 3 1/2-hour tour of Bakersfield in 
106-degree heat. What's more, the mayor was roasted by the proud citizens of 
Bakersfield. Through it all, a good-natured Riordan still managed to get in a 
few digs at his hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's put-down of Bakersfield came in February during an interview on 
Michael Jackson's KABC radio show. After hearing a commercial during the 
program that urged Angelenos to give Bakersfield a try, Riordan said: "I hope 
you all agree with me that Bakersfield is boring." 
</P>
<P>
 The remark did not sit well with David Bash, marketing director for the West 
Kern Corp., a development company. Although he is a newcomer to Bakersfield, 
Bash wears his civic pride on the bumper of his Lexus. "Bakersfield is NOT 
boring," the sticker says. 
</P>
<P>
 So insulted was Bash that he went to a City Council meeting to complain, 
carrying with him a tape-recording of the offending remark. "I just felt we had 
to defend ourselves," said Bash, whose company sponsored the ad that Riordan 
skewered. "I don't think we're boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, others were crying foul in letters to the local newspaper. Even the 
mayor of Bakersfield jumped into the fray by sending a letter to Riordan asking 
him to give the city a try -- at least for half a day. 
</P>
<P>
 A political cartoon in the local paper showed Mayor Bob Price dressed as a 
cowboy, saying: "Dick Riordan!! You Quake Shook, Brush Fired, Mud Slidin', 
Traffic Jammin', Smog Choked Varmintz! Ah'm Callin' You Out!" 
</P>
<P>
 Taking up the challenge, Riordan made the 110-mile trip to Bakersfield City 
Hall, where he and Price hopped on a helicopter and toured the city's sweeping 
farms and oil wells. To counter stereotypes that that is all there is to 
Bakersfield, the tour also pointed out industrial parks, colleges, the Kern 
River and the playing field of the Bakersfield Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and city leaders peppered the mayor with Bakersfield trivia: There 
are 24 Fortune 500 companies with operations in Bakersfield. It lies in the 
second-largest oil producing county in the country and ranks among the nation's 
most productive counties in terms of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the hometown of former Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren, 
sportscaster Frank Gifford and country crooner Buck Owens. There is a 
Bakersfield Symphony, a Class A baseball club and the best Basque-style beef 
tongue around. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensiveness comes from Bakersfield's reputation as the doormat of 
California's Central Valley. A while back Santa Barbara suggested shipping its 
homeless people to Bakersfield. And there is an ongoing municipal rivalry with 
Fresno, which considers itself a cut or two above old "Bako," as it is 
sometimes known among locals. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Armstrong, a member of a booster organization called Bakersfield Now, 
said people need to update their views of the rapidly growing city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in Los Angeles seems to remember going through Bakersfield when 
they were 7 years old and it was 100 degrees outside," she said. "They need to 
come for a visit. A community is its people and we don't find ourselves boring 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the thinking behind the invitation to Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 To show off a bit of upscale Bakersfield, Price took Riordan to the plush 
grounds of Seven Oaks Country Club to meet with business leaders. There, an 
upscale home right on the fairway goes for about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick golf competition between the two mayors did not prove much of 
anything. Riordan, not known for his golf game, hit some erratic shots. But 
Price was worse. He missed the ball completely on several swings and then 
nearly beaned a newspaper photographer. Then it was off to a buffet-style 
luncheon at the Bakersfield Convention Center, where civic leaders had paid $15 
a plate to give Riordan a taste of his own medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern County Dist. Atty. Ed Jaegels told the luncheon crowd that Bakersfield 
may be boring, but it does not think much of Los Angeles' idea of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said motorists are not fired at on Bakersfield's roadways, the city's 
police officers do not carry picket signs and, in a reference to the O.J. 
Simpson case, the very few celebrities Bakersfield has do not have murder 
charges hanging over them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get a verdict people don't like, they write a letter to the (paper)," 
Jaegels said. "In Los Angeles, they burn the place down." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan got in a few licks of his own in this municipal duel. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by a local television reporter whether Bakersfield was as boring as he 
thought, Riordan said: "It couldn't be as boring as I first thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a wry compliment, he said: "From the look of it, Bakersfield is on an 
upward climb." 
</P>
<P>
 He offered his Bakersfield counterpart some gifts for his next trip to Los 
Angeles -- a beach ball, sun tan lotion, shades and an LAPD cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a key to the city, he gave Price a chunk of Los Angeles City Hall 
shaken loose by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan received a basketful of gifts of his own, including a Bakersfield 
lapel pin and subscriptions to the local magazine and newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll use these every night when I have insomnia," Riordan said.

INCREASE WORLD ROLE, CLINTON TELLS GERMANY; EUROPE: PRESIDENT CALLS NATION 
'PLAINLY CAPABLE' OF MORE RESPONSIBILITY. CHANCELLOR KOHL SECONDS THAT VIEW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 President Clinton prodded Germany on Monday to broaden its world leadership, 
lending support to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's efforts to calm German and European 
fears of a more assertive, reunited Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-day visit, planned partly to reassure a country whose history 
excluded it from the observances of D-day, Clinton said he hoped "we will have 
the benefit of the full range of Germany's capacities to lead." 
</P>
<P>
 He cited the leadership responsibilities that Europe's largest economic power 
"is plainly capable of fulfilling." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's comments, delivered as he stood with Kohl outside the German 
Chancellery, were the latest expression of his desire to see Germany share in 
the costs and burdens of leading Europe and policing world trouble spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit, which took Clinton to Berlin on Monday night, comes on the eve of a 
decision by the German Constitutional Court, which is expected to legalize the 
use of the German military in peacekeeping efforts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In their eagerness to break with their country's Nazi past, postwar Germans 
have confined their military to a narrow domestic role and have been reluctant 
to allow deployment of troops abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's interest in the court ruling was underscored by his questioning of 
German President Roman Herzog, formerly chief judge of Germany's high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, who this month took over the presidency of the European Union and is 
seeking a seat for Germany on the U.N. Security Council, has been the country's 
leading voice for a broadened international role. At the news conference, he 
supported Clinton's views, pointing out that, as a nation rebuilt with 
international support, Germany "cannot simply sit back and let the others do 
the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany cannot be a country "with the kind of reputation and prestige we 
claimed for ourselves if we do not fully accept our responsibilities and 
fulfill our obligations," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's motives stem in part from domestic considerations. The American 
public generally feels it pays a disproportionate share for military security 
and economic aid around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States wants Germany to play a greater role in multinational 
military operations and to continue the heavy economic aid it has distributed 
among former Soviet Bloc countries since the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while there is growing support for a broader international role within 
Germany itself, it runs counter to a strong pacifist streak that makes many 
here unwilling to countenance expanded military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic Party and Kohl's main rival 
in the Oct. 16 federal election, generally agrees with the chancellor on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scharping's party filed the court challenges against government use of the 
military abroad. The cases challenge the deployment of German ships in the 
Adriatic Sea to support an embargo against Serbia and of German soldiers in 
radar surveillance flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the ground in 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel -- who leads Kohl's coalition partner, the Free 
Democratic Party -- said in an interview published Monday that, even with the 
expected court approval, Germany will be circumspect in its use of troops 
abroad. "We have done well with our policy of restraint. In the future, we will 
still be saying 'no' more often than 'yes,' " Kinkel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton supports a key aspect of Kohl's program to broaden the German role -- 
his effort to integrate Eastern Europe into the European Union. The proposal is 
controversial among America's other West European allies because it would 
effectively shift Europe's center of power to the East and toward Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton's support is expected to bolster Kohl's position against 
internal critics who still want Germany to hold back, chancellery sources 
expressed concern that unabashed support from the President for a strong 
Germany could backfire. It could, they said, scare Germany's European neighbors 
and make Kohl's job as president of the European Union tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 The ticklish aspects of Clinton's desire for a more assertive Germany were 
apparent during his Bonn appearance when a German reporter asked whether the 
phrase "special relationship" now refers to America's ties to the Germans 
rather than the British. "That's like asking me to pick a team in the World 
Cup," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bonn, Kohl and Clinton rhapsodized about the American role in protecting 
and helping rebuild postwar Germany. "We have not forgotten the millions of 
American soldiers who, over a period of more than 40 years, defended freedom 
and peace and security for us here in Germany," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 After private meetings with Herzog and Kohl, Clinton had a ceremonial lunch 
and individual meetings with Scharping and Kinkel. 
</P>
<P>
 The President then flew to Kohl's home in Ludwigshafen to dine on Italian 
cuisine with a leader who shares his fondness for a good meal. En route to 
Berlin, he stopped at Ramstein Air Base to address American troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's visit is expected to boost Kohl. But a Clinton aide insisted the 
President was not taking sides in German politics.

COMPUTER AT NUCLEAR LAB USED FOR ACCESS TO PORN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM S. BAUMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dramatically illustrating the security problems posed by the rapid growth of 
the Internet computer network, one of the nation's three nuclear weapons labs 
confirmed Monday that computer hackers were using its computers to store and 
distribute hard-core pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassed officials at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which 
conducts a great deal of classified research and has highly sophisticated 
security procedures, said the incident was among the most serious breaches of 
computer security at the lab in Livermore, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer, which was shut down after a Times reporter investigating 
Internet hacking alerted lab officials, contained more than 1,000 pornographic 
images. It was believed to be the largest illicit cache of hard-core 
pornography ever found on a computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer hackers once were primarily mischief-makers aiming to prove their 
computer prowess, and they devoted their efforts to disrupting computer systems 
at large organizations or stealing technical information. But today, a new 
breed of hackers has developed methods for seizing partial control of 
Internet-linked computers and using them to store and distribute pornography, 
stolen computer software and other electronic information -- often for profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a "network of networks" originally designed to connect computers 
at universities and government research labs, has grown dramatically in size 
and technical sophistication in recent years. It is now used by many businesses 
and individual computer users, and is often viewed as the prototype for the 
information superhighway of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Internet has an underside, where so-called "pirates" with code names 
such as "Mr. Smut," "Acidflux" and "The Cowboy" traffic in illegal or illegally 
obtained electronic information. The structure of the Internet means that such 
pirates can carry out their crimes from almost anywhere in the world, and that 
tracing them is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI late last week confirmed that it was investigating software piracy on 
the Internet. A Times reporter discovered a number of sites at prestigious 
institutions that were being used to distribute stolen software, including one 
in the office of the UC Berkeley chancellor and another at Lawrence Berkeley 
National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate sites, which carry exotic monikers such as "3 Days Till Death," "Impact 
of Chaos" and "Field of Dreams," can generally be found only by highly 
sophisticated computer users who are well-schooled in the intricacies of the 
Internet. The pirates use a new and relatively obscure method for transferring 
information, known as the "file service protocol," and they often change the 
location of their sites every few weeks to avoid detection. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, MIT student David LaMaccia was arrested on felony conspiracy and 
wire fraud charges for allegedly using the protocols to distribute more than $1 
million worth of commercial software. The protocol allows files to be sent to 
large numbers of computer users easily with minimal disruption of other 
computer functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirates also have their own "chat" lines, a series of channels within a 
service called the Internet Relay Chat. An elaborate pecking order determines 
who will be allowed to take part in these conversations -- newcomers can often 
wangle their way in if they have a particularly hot piece of software to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden-variety copyrighted software is known as "warez" on these channels, 
while especially good software is called "kewl," and brand-new software that 
has not even reached stores is called "zero-day software." At the Lawrence 
Berkeley pirate site, the offerings last week included Power Japanese, which 
retails for $395, as well as IBM DOS 6.3 and a game called Alien Legacy, which 
is not yet available in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Merola, deputy director of information and computing at the Berkeley 
lab, said the pirate site was shut down last week after The Times investigation 
revealed its existence. Merola said the Department of Energy, which oversees 
lab operations, as well as the FBI, had been notified of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lawrence Livermore, officials said Monday they believe that at least one 
lab employee was involved in the pornography ring, along with an undetermined 
number of outside collaborators. Chuck Cole, deputy associate director of 
computing at the lab, said that nearly 2,000 megabytes of unauthorized graphic 
images have been found in a Livermore computer. He confirmed that they were 
pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee has been placed on "investigatory leave" and his or her security 
badge confiscated while an investigation is under way, the lab said. It was 
unclear whether the pornographic images were being sold or how many people had 
gained access to them. The pictures were sufficiently graphic that they could 
be considered obscene by courts in some jurisdictions, in which case 
transmitting them over the Internet might be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive amount of storage capacity used in the Livermore scheme shows how 
Internet hacking could be quite profitable. Seizing partial control of large 
and sophisticated computer systems at universities or government laboratories 
can save unscrupulous entrepreneurs large sums of money. 
</P>
<P>
 There were indications that the person operating the pornography database had 
become aware of possible scrutiny. On June 27, a message left in a file labeled 
READ ME!!! said: "It appears that news about this site has escaped. In the past 
two weeks, I have had 27 unauthorized hosts attempt to access my server. This 
does not give me a warm-fuzzy feeling. I would hate to have to shut this down, 
but I may have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 One computer expert, who requested anonymity, said there might be more to the 
incident than meets the eye. The expert suggested that the hard-core 
pornography may be a cover for an ultra-sophisticated espionage program, in 
which a "sniffer" program combs through other Livermore computers, encodes the 
passwords and accounts it finds, and then hides them within the pornographic 
images, perhaps to be downloaded by foreign agents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cole said there was no possibility of a computer intruder gaining access 
to classified data at Livermore Labs. "We use an air gap security method in 
which no electronic connection of any kind is maintained between the classified 
computer world and the unclassified computer world." 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff Stoll, a former computer systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley who 
chronicled his experiences with a computer hacker in the book "The Cuckoos 
Egg," said there would be easier ways to conduct espionage over the Internet 
than to use pornographic pictures as an encoding method. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the computer penetrations at Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley "show very 
poor management on the part of the national labs," Stoll said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of pirate sites extends far beyond U.S. government laboratories 
and universities: Many popular sites discovered by The Times are located in 
Mexico, France, Britain and other countries. One system operator of a pirate 
site in Istanbul, Turkey, openly bragged on-line that his country has no laws 
preventing the distribution of copyrighted software; thus, he claimed, he was 
breaking no laws by doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Software Publishers Assn., a trade association representing major software 
manufacturers, has made software piracy on the Internet a major priority. Peter 
Beruk, the association's litigation manager, said: "We are currently tracking 
over 1,600 pirate sites on the Internet in a joint investigation with the FBI. 
It is a very serious and costly problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of David LaMaccia, we estimate over a million dollars of software 
was downloaded from his site in a two-week period. We will start going after 
the universities next. . . . The Internet, in our view, is now getting a very 
bad name." 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Hendershot, manager of the fraud and computer crime abuse initiative of 
the FBI, though declining to give any details, acknowledged that the bureau was 
cooperating with the association in regard to Internet piracy. As the 
popularity of the Internet surges, the problem of net piracy will increase, 
Hendershot said.

HAITI ORDERS OUT RIGHTS MONITORS; CARIBBEAN: U.N. AND OAS ARE EXPECTED TO 
COMPLY AND WITHDRAW OBSERVERS. U.S. AND ALLIES CALL MILITARY REGIME'S ACTION 'A 
SERIOUS ESCALATION IN THE CONFLICT.' 
</P>

<P>
 The military authorities of Haiti, defying the international community once 
again, Monday ordered the expulsion within 48 hours of all human rights 
observers of the United Nations and the Organization of American States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reasons are quite obvious," Dante Caputo, the chief U.N. official for 
Haiti, said at U.N. headquarters in New York. "They kill people. They torture 
people. They rape people. And they don't want any witnesses in their country." 
</P>
<P>
 He denounced the decree as "outrageous," "a provocation" and "an insult to the 
international community." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, reading a statement on behalf of 
the United States, France, Canada, Venezuela and Argentina, denounced the act 
as "a serious escalation of the conflict" and warned that it underscored "the 
need for quick and decisive action by the international community to end the 
Haitian crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 But, when asked if this meant an invasion, she replied, "There is no point in 
trying to figure out whether we will call their bluff." 
</P>
<P>
 The five countries, known at the United Nations as "the Friends of Haiti," 
have been asked to take a special interest in the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint international mission in Haiti is made up of 64 OAS and 40 U.N. 
observers. Although subjected to threats and harassment, the observers have 
managed in the last few months to send out a stream of bulletins about the 
deterioration of human rights under the military authorities blocking the 
return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister, declined to answer when asked if 
he believed the provocation was enough to justify American intervention to 
remove the military leaders of the impoverished Caribbean country. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly also declined to speculate on 
whether the expulsion has brought the Clinton Administration closer to mounting 
a Haiti intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she said, "we certainly condemn the illegal de facto regime in 
Port-au-Prince for . . . its stated intention to expel the . . . human rights 
observers from Haiti. . . . Their cynical action, I think, is a clear 
indication that the human rights situation in Haiti is deteriorating even 
further." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali met with acting OAS Secretary 
General Christopher R. Thomas to work out a response to the Haitian decree. It 
was widely assumed that they would decide to comply with the expulsion and 
remove the observers for their own safety as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, after a gang of shouting roughnecks on the Port-au-Prince docks 
prompted President Clinton to order the tank landing ship Harlan County to 
abandon its attempt to land a contingent of American and Canadian peacekeepers, 
the United Nations and OAS removed the observers from Haiti as a precaution. 
But the observers returned early this year and have been monitoring human 
rights violations since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo said Haitian military authorities handed the decree to U.N. officials 
in Port-au-Prince on Monday morning. The decree, he said, was "signed by the 
dictator in Haiti, Mr. Jonassaint." The military installed Supreme Court Judge 
Emile Jonassaint as provisional president May 11 in an act condemned by the 
Security Council and Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
 Caputo said the Jonassaint decree had three provisions: It declared the 
observers undesirable; it ordered their expulsion within 48 hours, and it 
called on the Haitian army to enforce the order. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port-au-Prince, mission officials told reporters that the military 
government had informed them it regarded the mission as illegal and a threat to 
national security. The officials said they also were told that the Haitians 
wanted to avoid "an incident or a provocation." On Friday, the General Assembly 
had authorized an extension of U.N. participation in the mission for another 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 While doing so, the Assembly condemned the Jonassaint presidency, demanded the 
departure of the military leaders and called for the return of Aristide. The 
mission in Haiti is the only one that the United Nations ever has mounted in 
partnership with the OAS, whose membership includes most governments in the 
Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports from Reuters news agency in Port-au-Prince, a senior 
government official said the observers would lose their diplomatic status in 48 
hours, which would subject them to expulsion as ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that it might be difficult for them to leave because of the 
sanctions that have ended most flights, the official said, "We can always put 
them at the airport and give them sleeping bags." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pentagon reported that the amphibious assault ship Inchon, with 
2,000 Marines aboard, had reached its destination off the coast of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insisted that they have ordered the Marines to these waters to 
prepare to rescue Americans should their lives be threatened. But the buildup 
has also fed rumors of a possible U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly, of the State Department, said the Coast Guard picked up 1,740 Haitians 
over the weekend, down significantly from previous days. Since June 15, when 
the Administration resumed interviews of Haitians fleeing by sea, 19,200 have 
been picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly said there still is a possibility that Panama might provide a haven. 
"But in terms of the immediate time frame, I think . . . the situation is 
reflected by . . . the decision of President (Guillermo) Endara," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Endara, after first pledging to take in 10,000 Haitians, changed his mind last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, who will succeed Endara Sept. 1, has 
implied that he would accept some refugees.

SHOWDOWN AT HAND OVER INDIAN VIDEO GAMING BOOM; GAMBLING: OFFICIALS TARGET 
MAJOR EQUIPMENT SUPPLIER AND OUTSIDE CASINO MANAGER. TRIBES INSIST DEVICES ARE 
LEGAL.

<P>
 When video gambling machines started popping up in California's Indian 
gambling halls in 1991, San Diego County sheriff's officials thought they could 
halt use of the "electronic slots" by raiding three reservations and seizing 
288 of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bad bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, while authorities continue to insist that the machines are 
illegal in California, at least 16 of the state's tribes have them. And nowhere 
has California's emergence into the age of casino gambling been more evident 
than in San Diego County. Today, competing television ads openly tout the Las 
Vegas-style gambling on the same reservations raided in 1991, except that these 
days they feature more than 2,300 of the high-tech moneymakers -- as many as 
the famed Mirage hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The machine gambling has become so widespread -- and profitable -- that 
wagering at tribal casinos is expected to pass the $1-billion-dollar mark in 
the state this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But after three years of unbridled growth and official inaction amid a tangle 
of legal cases, a showdown finally appears to be at hand over the slot-type 
gambling -- mostly pitting authorities against the tribes and their non-Indian 
casino managers, but also pitting factions of law enforcement against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 * In March, police in Los Angeles and Ventura counties seized records and 
computer boards from the offices of a Chatsworth business that supplies 
gambling machines to several tribal casinos, including the Barona Big Top here, 
a circus-themed addition to a bingo hall long run by the Capitan Band of 
Mission Indians. This one reservation now has more than a thousand of the 
flashing, beeping machines that offer electronic versions of poker, keno and 
the old classic slot game, in which players try to win "progressive" jackpots 
by matching three spinning symbols -- diamonds, gold bars and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 * In May, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles indicted the outside managers of 
another casino, on the Morongo Reservation, on racketeering charges that carry 
up to 20 years in prison. The charges spotlighted the astounding economics of 
the machines: Federal prosecutors said the 140 installed at Morongo, a fraction 
of the number at some other reservations, generated $10 million in the last 
year -- and that principals in the management firm, E. C. Investments Inc., may 
have skimmed millions of the take from the Palm Springs-area tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 * The head of the National Indian Gaming Commission, created by Congress to 
oversee tribal gambling, promptly said that more indictments could follow, 
especially of "non-Indians who are, in fact, ripping off the tribes." Then on 
June 16, top representatives of the four U.S. attorney's offices in California 
met in San Francisco to coordinate a campaign against the machines, which had 
become "of great concern to us," said Michael J. Yamaguchi, the U.S. attorney 
for Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks after the unprecedented meeting, however, the U.S. attorney in 
San Diego, Alan D. Bersin, announced his own agreement with the three tribes 
that have led the move into the machine age -- an agreement far more 
conciliatory than the hard-line approach supported by his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the June 30 pact, sealed by handshakes during a tour of the 
reservations, tribal leaders promised to temporarily halt expansion of their 
casinos. Bersin, in turn, pledged to take no action against the controversial 
devices pending the outcome of the tribes' three-year court battle to force the 
state to accept the video gambling, now before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bersin said Monday that even the Wilson Administration, which has steadfastly 
opposed the machines, should welcome the deal because the tribes agreed that if 
they lose in court "there would be a withdrawal" of the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is we're talking about very extensive operations," he said. "To the 
same extent one would not shut down the business of a defense contractor 
pending final adjudication, nor should we in this context." 
</P>
<P>
 But while the local pact was applauded by tribal leaders, it enraged other law 
enforcement officials around the state, along with Anthony J. Hope, the 
Washington-based chairman of the National Indian Gaming Commission, the top 
regulator in the field. He accused Bersin of naively "endorsing . . . illegal 
gambling" for years to come by taking a hands-off stance while drawn-out 
appeals of tribal lawsuits are argued to the U.S. Supreme Court. "He can't do 
that!" Hope declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope said Monday he may soon seek $250-a-day fines, per machine, against 
tribes using the devices without state approval -- meaning daily sanctions of 
more than $250,000 for some. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite such threats, almost monthly a new tribe gets into the electronic 
slot business, seeking a share of the take from the gambling devices that 
generally earn from $100 to $400 a day. At that rate, they pay for themselves 
in weeks and then each brings in profits of $100,000 or more a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Over Memorial Day weekend, the Santa Ynez Band of Mission Indians unveiled 210 
machines on its reservation in Santa Barbara County in time for the prime 
tourist season in adjoining Solvang. In a Northern California resort, a band of 
Pomo Indians is putting finishing touches on an 18,000-square-foot casino 
alongside sparkling Clear Lake -- the third casino in remote Lake County alone, 
where the crowds that fish for bass each morning create the alluring promise of 
a new Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Indians, these machines bring in more revenue than anything else," said 
Dan Tucker, chairman of the Sycuan Reservation outside El Cajon, which has the 
glitziest of the San Diego County gambling halls. 
</P>
<P>
 But after recent events, Tucker acknowledged, "We're at the edge of a 
situation that could go either way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the current showplace of Indian gambling is 3,000 miles away, the 
industry's explosive growth had its roots in California. A legal fight between 
the Cabazon band and Riverside County a decade ago produced a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision -- and a federal law -- declaring that tribes could offer 
high-stakes versions of any gambling legal in their state. 
</P>
<P>
 The first results were cavernous bingo halls that drew thousands of customers 
by offering $50,000 jackpots while competitors -- charity games -- were limited 
to $250 prizes. In California, nearly 100 reservations and small rancherias 
also were free to offer poker and off-track betting, other forms of gambling 
indisputably legal here. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, however, gambling promoters pushed tribes to offer more 
extensive wagering. After all, Las Vegas was not built on bingo but on 
faster-paced money-makers such as blackjack, craps . . . and slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Where that term used to mean the "one-armed bandits" with levers on the side 
and rotating reels, a new generation of machines allows players to simply touch 
a screen to set the lemons and other symbols spinning. Or gamblers can wager as 
little as 25 cents at poker machines that offer a 500-1 payoff for the top 
hand, a royal flush. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by computer programs to dole out just enough winners to keep customers 
glued to their seats, such machines account for 68% of the gross in Atlantic 
City casinos and a remarkable 82% in Laughlin, Nev., the blue-collar gambling 
town on the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slot machines are easier for new gamblers to adapt to," said William R. 
Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and Commercial 
Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno. Lower labor cost "also is a very 
important part. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is that if you have the option to introduce slot machines, you're 
certainly going to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 But in many states, such as California, laws explicitly ban casino gambling. 
As a result, a legal cat-and-mouse game began in 1991 at the onset of 
negotiations of compacts between tribes and the state called for under the 
federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said he would 
never agree to the use of the machines. Some tribes began using them anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 That October, a San Diego County sheriff's task force raided the Sycuan, 
Barona and Viejas reservations and seized the 288 machines. Similar raids were 
staged in Lake and Fresno counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A torrent of litigation followed: U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff refused to 
return the machines to the San Diego reservations, but said the raids were 
improper because only federal authorities had criminal jurisdiction over tribal 
gambling. Federal prosecutors, however, were not ready to join the crackdown -- 
they wanted guidance from the fledgling National Indian Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Washington-based commission came out against the use of 
machines without state approval, California's tribes were back in court to 
force Sacramento's hand. They argued that technology used in the California 
Lottery's own keno game had "opened the door" for tribal use of electronic 
slots. In a ruling that emboldened the tribes, a federal judge in Sacramento 
agreed and ordered the state to negotiate in good faith with them. The state 
quickly appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the legal fight is far from resolved -- the 9th Circuit appellate 
judges are expected to issue their opinion any day now -- many of the state's 
tribes felt vindicated. In came more machines. By the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few years, they had become impossible to resist, largely because of a 
role model across the country, in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 There, after a court fight and hard lobbying, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe 
won the full range of games for its Foxwoods Casino, in exchange for sharing 
25% of the slot revenue with the state. Today, 3,051 gambling machines anchor a 
casino-hotel-entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing 140,000 customers a week, Foxwoods earns more than $1 million a day 
from its slots, accounting for most of the $650-million profit that will make 
it the most successful casino in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the totals are far lower in California, tribal officials at Cabazon 
and Viejas say machines account for 75% of their revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabazon reports that $63 million was wagered last year at its casino in Indio. 
Officials will not disclose the net profit, but it was enough to fund a child 
care center, a museum, free housing and $60,000 payments to each of the 30 
tribe members. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Viejas Casino & Turf Club in Alpine, 30 miles east of San Diego, the 
1,000 machines generate about $100 each per day, a public relations agent said 
-- meaning they should bring in $36 million in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Sycuan, once a rocky square mile of wasteland outside El Cajon. 
Its casino handled $120 million in wagers last year, earning $11 million for 
the tribe, according to chairman Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 With 230 machines, Sycuan is outnumbered by its San Diego County rivals, but 
heavy traffic means each machine earns $300 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every other business gets to use computers and new technology," Tucker said, 
"but Indian tribes haven't been allowed the opportunity to move into the 
20th-Century electronic age." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate often gets mired in semantics. Tribal officials painstakingly avoid 
using the term slot, pointing out that the machines used here don't pay out 
coins, for instance, but credits. Some machines -- video pull-tabs -- are 
downplayed as mere electronic "dispensers" of the lottery ticket-like cards 
sold at bingo halls. 
</P>
<P>
 John James, the Cabazon chairman, complained that the way state and federal 
officials look at it, "even a Coke machine is a slot machine. . . . You put 
money in, you get something back." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hope, the federal regulator, has grown tired of what he sees as a word 
game -- and many tribes' flouting of the law. "I was in Barona two months ago. 
I saw a lot of machines. All illegal," the commission chairman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope applauded the May 11 Morongo indictment as "heroic work" by federal 
prosecutors in Los Angeles at a time when some of their counterparts elsewhere 
are reluctant to scrutinize tribal gambling for fear they will be accused of 
picking on a historically abused group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles team handled the sensitive prosecution by avoiding targeting 
the Native Americans themselves -- through a raid, for instance -- and instead 
focusing on the outside suppliers and gambling promoters who may be earning 
just as much, or more, from the disputed gambling. Among the allegations in 
this case is that the outsiders cheated the tribe in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors said the management firm first persuaded the Morongo 
tribal council to lease, rather than buy, 140 video keno, poker and 
"pot-o-gold" machines. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an arrangement sometimes preferred by tribes because they would not 
absorb the loss if the machines were seized. But a study by the Interior 
Department's inspector general in Michigan and Wisconsin suggested that such 
arrangements are virtual giveaways by the tribes. It found 13 leasing contracts 
for video gambling machines that could have been purchased for $3.2 million -- 
and instead were being rented for $40.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Morongo's case, this provided a way for the casino operators to increase 
their take above the 30% of the profit called for in a 1992 management 
contract, according to the indictment charging E. C. Investments Inc. and four 
individuals with illegal gambling, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Without telling the tribe of their personal interest, the defendants allegedly 
set up a company with a post office box and a bank account in Washington, D.C., 
to buy machines for about $5,000 each and lease them to the casino -- for 
another 25% to 30% of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 With the machines taking in more than $10 million, the group received $3.3 
million in lease payments between April 27, 1993, and May 1, 1994, according to 
the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Jonathan Shapiro said the tribe cooperated fully and that 
the charges were part of "an extensive and ongoing investigation," suggesting 
that there may be more to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Already under review are records seized in March from San Fernando Valley and 
Ventura County locations that enabled a Chatsworth firm, SSK Game Enterprises, 
to supply video slots to Barona and several other tribal casinos. Hit were wood 
shops that made the cabinets, offices turning out computer boards and trucking 
firms that carted the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation "was having slot cabinets shipped without the computer boards 
installed until they arrived on Indian land to avoid violating California Penal 
Code statutes," according to a search warrant affidavit filed by Los Angeles 
Police Detective William D. Westermann, a veteran gambling investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for SSK predicted that authorities would find no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas the Morongo indictment "cries out for relief . . . if you believe that 
these people lied to the Indians and, in effect, defrauded them," the Valley 
firm had no management relationship with the tribes, said attorney Jon Artz. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders also called the Morongo case an anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give Morongo a little credit. . . . The bottom line is that the reservation 
caught these people," said David Dominguez, chairman of the Santa Ynez tribe, 
which had hired Morongo's management firm to open its casino Memorial Day 
weekend, but "terminated the contract" after the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be the operators," Dominguez said, adding that the indictment 
did not deter the tribe from leasing -- with an option to buy -- 210 gambling 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to generate some income for this whole Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 That is one point not in dispute -- the machines bring in the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the setting of the Barona Big Top, which opened in January, will 
never be confused with the Vegas Strip. It is situated above San Diego's 
eastern suburbs, off a winding, two-lane road that crosses open cattle country. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you pull up, a valet parks your car. Inside, attendants push change 
carts over black-and-fuschia carpeting. Other casino workers offer free 
beverages to gamblers. There are uniformed security guards and cameras 
everywhere, an ATM machine so players can replenish their funds, a cash cage, a 
buffet line offering reasonably good, cheap food. And everywhere, gamblers are 
perched on stools, feeding machines $5 and $20 bills, pushing buttons and 
watching the screens flash with a crazy assortment of symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the hypnotic trappings of Las Vegas is missing -- the sound of coins 
clanking into steel buckets. Instead, large payoffs are signaled by the 
click-click-click of credits registering on the payoff window of each machine, 
which spits out a small white ticket. A floor attendant then cashes the ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra step hardly seemed to bother a housewife planted at a video poker 
machine on a recent afternoon. She had arrived with $100 and, 6 1/2 hours 
later, was holding $300 in fives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just sit here and lose myself," she said as she played another round of 
poker. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound resembled a machine gun as the cards came up on the screen, 
rat-a-tat-tatt. She got four of a kind and won another $50. 
</P>
<P>
 The video slots are a big winner for her and the tribe -- at least for the 
time being. Electronic Gambling 
</P>
<P>
 At least 16 California Indian reservations or rancherias feature electronic 
gambling machines. 03,26,16,20 Reservation or Rancheria County Number of

2 FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS ELECT RUSSIA BACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in Ukraine and Belarus, whose leaders conspired to break up the Soviet 
Union 2 1/2 years ago, have elected presidents favoring closer ties with 
Russia, official returns showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnabout is expected to give Moscow greater sway over its old empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonid Kuchma, a 55-year-old former missile factory director who campaigned 
against a "suicidal course of isolation from Russia," won 52% of the vote to 
upset President Leonid Kravchuk in a close contest in Ukraine, one of the most 
stubbornly independent former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Lukashenko, 39, an obscure onetime collective farm director, ran a 
crudely populist campaign to become Belarus' first president, defeating Prime 
Minister Vyacheslav Kebich by a landslide in a race between two advocates of 
monetary union with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Both winners in Sunday's runoffs often spoke Russian on the campaign trail, 
urging angry voters to dump incumbents whom they blamed for undermining the 
ideals of independence by running corrupt administrations and stagnant, 
un-reforming economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Moscow -- joined by a host of politicians from former Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky -- 
welcomed the outcomes. They predicted a tighter alliance among the three Slavic 
nations at the core of the former union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that the Soviet Union will ever be restored, but I am sure the 
republics are getting closer to a confederation of some kind," said Sergei B. 
Stankevich, a member of the Russian Parliament's foreign affairs committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Economics Minister Alexander N. Shokhin said the Kremlin will seek 
early meetings with both new presidents. In the case of Ukraine, he said, 
Russia is eager to discuss "which of our old pains can be rapidly cured." 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging ties will be closely watched by the West, which has often fretted 
over Russia's neo-imperialist ambitions as a potential source of violent 
conflict with its smaller neighbors. Ukrainian nationalists warned that their 
country, which voted sharply along regional and ethnic lines, could split apart 
if Kuchma moves too close to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma's victory also worries the West because he favors re-examining 
Ukraine's commitment to ship to Russia the nuclear weapons it inherited from 
the Soviet Union. While supporting eventual disarmament, Kuchma said in the 
campaign that Ukraine is getting too little money from the West in return. 
Apparently hoping to help Kravchuk, President Clinton and other leaders of the 
seven leading industrialized nations meeting in Naples, Italy, announced on 
election eve a $4.2-million aid package for Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuchma rode to victory on a wave of economic discontent in the eastern and 
southern Ukrainian provinces where ethnic Russians are a majority. He won 90% 
of the vote in the disputed Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and 79% in the 
coal-mining district of Donetsk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine is 80% dependent on the raw materials of Russia," Kuchma said in a 
televised debate last week. "This is oil, this is lumber. Even beyond our 
1,000-year shared history, we are obliged to our great neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk, who quarreled repeatedly with Moscow and portrayed the challenger as 
a traitor who might give up sovereignty, got as much as 96% of the vote in some 
regions of the nationalist western half of the country, which was Sovietized 
only after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kravchuk and Belarus leader Stanislav Shushkevich who met with Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin in December, 1991, to declare independence from a 
dying Soviet Union and set up the loose, ineffectual Commonwealth of 
Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Yeltsin has reasserted Russia's hegemony over its 
neighbors, sending troops to intervene in ethnic conflicts and posting border 
guards along most of the perimeter of the former Soviet Union. Moscow has also 
pressed other republics for more favorable trade conditions by threatening to 
withhold oil and gas supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with higher inflation and weaker currencies than in Russia, voters in 
energy-poor Belarus and Ukraine opted for closer banking and trade ties with 
Moscow rather than strong free-market reforms at home. Neither Lukashenko nor 
Kuchma, who was ineffective as Kravchuk's prime minister for 11 months, offered 
a detailed economic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, Belarus' Kebich negotiated a treaty with Russia that would abolish 
the local currency and adopt the Russian ruble. Shushkevich, the independence 
leader who was ousted last January as Speaker of Parliament, opposed the treaty 
and finished a distant fourth in first-round voting June 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukashenko, a fiery anti-corruption crusader who threatened to expel crooked 
officials to the Himalayas with no time to pack, won 80% of the runoff vote -- 
a huge protest against the political Establishment. Kebich, who became prime 
minister in 1990, polled 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials made no secret of their preference for Kebich but were 
pleased that Lukashenko gave general endorsement to the currency treaty, which 
has not been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ukraine, Kuchma has called for settling a potentially violent dispute over 
the Black Sea naval fleet by leasing Russia not only a share of its warships 
but also the Crimean port of Sevastopol, a prize that Kravchuk has refused in 
endless negotiations to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 Times special correspondent Mary Mycio in Kiev and Sergei Loiko of The Times' 
Moscow Bureau contributed to this report. Profile: Alexander Gregoriyevich 
Lukashenko 
</P>
<P>
 Born: Aug. 30, 1954, in eastern Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 Title: First president of Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Graduated from Mogilev Pedagogical Institute in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Career highlights: Held various Communist Party jobs after college. A country 
boy, he went into farming in 1982, becoming deputy chairman of Udarnik 
collective farm. Became director of the Gorodets State Farm in 1987. Elected in 
1990 a "people's deputy" to Belarus Parliament. Was lone Belarus deputy to vote 
against December, 1991, agreements in which Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
and leaders of Belarus and Ukraine codified breakup of Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal: Married with two sons. A dark-faced man with a heavy, 18th-Century 
mustache, he is often compared to Russian neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky for energy and fiery appeal in often grammatically flawed speeches.

EXILE ENDS AS ARAFAT LEAVES TUNISIA FOR GAZA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader who has wandered in exile across Arab 
shores for almost three decades, made an emotional departure from his 
headquarters here Monday and flew toward a new, permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling how the Palestine Liberation Organization was ejected from Jordan, 
booted out of Lebanon and left to simmer on the shores of North Africa for more 
than 12 years, Arafat bade farewell to Tunisian President Zine Abidine ben Ali 
and boarded a plane for Cairo. He was stopping there before leaving for home -- 
in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, there is a return without going to another exile, a 
return from beloved Tunis to the sacred land of Palestine," Arafat said at his 
last news conference in the Tunisian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Ali, who draped a medal of honor on the beaming PLO leader during an 
elaborate farewell ceremony at the presidential palace, recalled the desperate 
days of 1982 when the PLO arrived here, fleeing the war in Lebanon. The 
Tunisian leader congratulated Arafat on the long diplomatic drive toward 
Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go home in peace," he said. "All our congratulations to Palestine on the 
occasion of your triumphant return. And all our congratulations too to her 
valiant people upon the return of her combatants. Now, by the grace of God, 
there will be no more wandering, no more exile. Goodby, until we meet again in 
Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, dressed in characteristic green fatigues and black-and-white kaffiyeh, 
saluted solemnly as the Palestinian anthem, "Baladi," or "My Country," was 
played on a tinny sound system in the chandelier-laden reception hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the airport, Tunisian jets screamed in salute overhead as Arafat's 
stylish young wife, Suha, who waved at her husband's side at the top of the 
boarding ramp, wiped back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the PLO will maintain its political, international relations and 
refugee departments in Tunisia, Arafat's departure and the shift in focus 
toward autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza means the end of an era for 
Palestinian politics -- and in many ways an end to the PLO as it has existed as 
a revolutionary movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's fighters have already trailed in from the far corners of the Arab 
world to take on the new mantle of police in Gaza and Jericho; the PLO staff 
left behind in Tunis and at embassies around the world is largely unfunded and 
embittered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the end of the PLO, but the PLO is not the Bible, and it is not 
God-given. If it doesn't change according to circumstances, it will die 
anyway," one of Arafat's most senior aides said. "The PLO has to adapt and lead 
the new situation if it wants to continue to be viable." 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO Executive Committee, shrunk by nearly half because of opposition to 
the peace plan it signed with Israel, is largely being absorbed into the new 
Palestinian Authority in Gaza and Jericho, though it will keep operating as the 
PLO government. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat has pledged to convene the Palestine National Council, the PLO 
parliament in exile, to rewrite the Palestinian charter on armed struggle. But 
PLO leaders admit there is no consensus for convening the council now and 
little hope of gaining admittance for all its members to Arafat's new 
headquarters in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, the PLO hierarchy left behind when Arafat departed with most 
of his remaining top aides Monday -- those who left included information chief 
Yasser Abed-Rabbo and Labor Minister Samir Ghosheh -- is skeptical about the 
prospects for success of the traveling road show that left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next two months for Arafat are going to be very, very difficult -- going 
to Gaza, empty-handed and with a big smile," a PLO official who will stay in 
Tunis said. "Arafat gave promises to the Israelis and the Palestinians while he 
was outside. Now he's inside, and both sides will be asking him to fulfill his 
promises." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat was mindful of the financial problems ahead, even as he looked ahead 
with bravado. "The Palestinian struggle will continue until the Palestinian 
flag is raised in all the Palestinian lands," he said. "We are facing a major 
struggle that is no less important than the last one -- the battle for 
reconstruction, to rebuild our country, which needs a lot of resources that are 
not available now." 
</P>
<P>
 He pledged repeatedly that he and Ben Ali will "pray together in Jerusalem." 
</P>
<P>
 The promise echoed Arafat's words as he launched his last trip into exile in 
1982. Besieged by Israeli troops and finally his own rebel forces -- backed by 
the Syrians in northern Lebanon -- Arafat boarded a ship at Tripoli, Lebanon, 
to the volley of Palestinian machine-gun fire and vowed: "The struggle is not 
over. We will continue until we reach Jerusalem, the capital of our Palestinian 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 The sunny North African nation of Tunisia, 1,200 miles from the Gaza Strip, 
was little recognized on the Arab map then. It since has welcomed thousands of 
PLO fighters-turned-bureaucrats and offered Arafat a base from which to launch 
his global travels seeking support and backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Arab nations before it that had hosted the troublesome guerrilla 
group, Tunisia paid for its hospitality. Barely three years after the PLO 
settled in at its initial headquarters at Hammam Shatt outside the capital, 
Israeli F-15 fighter-bombers launched an attack that demolished much of the 
administrative facilities and left more than 70 people dead, 25 of them 
Tunisian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunisia was subject to other violence in subsequent years: an Israeli commando 
raid in 1988 that killed Arafat's deputy, Khalil Wazir (Abu Jihad), and a 1991 
attack, probably launched by the militant Abu Nidal organization, that killed 
two other senior PLO leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Tunisians breathed a sigh of relief when Arafat's plane left. They have 
often complained that the PLO brought hitherto unknown violence to Tunisia and 
drove up rents by paying top dollar for spacious villas in some of this city's 
best neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Arafat aide tried to explain why so many PLO officials have been 
wrenched by this happy departure: "It has been part of the psyche, part of our 
existence, part of the good treatment we never witnessed in most of the Arab 
countries before. People found self-respect in Tunis instead of persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time," he added, "people are full of pain and bitterness about 
the uncertainty in the new situation."

BAN ON STRIKER REPLACEMENTS HEADS FOR VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most heated and emotional political battles between labor and 
management in a generation will climax today when the U.S. Senate casts a 
critical vote on legislation that would prohibit corporations from replacing 
striking union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both corporate America and organized labor have poured their lobbying 
resources into the bitter congressional fight, one both sides see as critical 
to determining who will have the upper hand in the American workplace of the 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Business groups fear that the striker-replacement bill would give unions 
unbridled power and sharply reduce management's authority over its workers. 
Union leaders, joined by the Clinton Administration, believe that passage of 
the bill is vital to the survival of an American labor movement badly shaken by 
the growing willingness of employers to resolve labor disputes by firing 
striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill would make strikes risk-free and tip the balance of power at the 
bargaining table to the unions," warned Dan Yeager, a spokesman for the Labor 
Policy Assn., a management lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 William Klinefelter, chief lobbyist for the industrial-union department of the 
AFL-CIO, countered: "This goes right to the heart of what the trade union 
movement is all about -- this issue is such an emotional one for our members 
because almost all of them have been on strike at one time or another in their 
lives." 
</P>
<P>
 While the struggle intensifies, Rosemount, a Mississippi River town south of 
Minneapolis, finds itself on the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while business groups argue that companies only rarely use 
replacements for strikers, union officials warn that the story at the CF 
Industries, Inc., fertilizer plant here is an example of an all-too-frequent 
scene today: one in which U.S. firms ranging from Caterpillar Inc., to 
Greyhound Lines Inc., are displaying an increasing willingness to replace 
striking workers and eliminate their unions -- or at least threaten to do so -- 
whenever contract negotiations bog down. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid spread of such tactics during the last decade has had a "chilling 
effect on unions and contract negotiations," said Bernard Brommer, president of 
the Minnesota AFL-CIO. "Now most unions simply won't go out on strike. They'll 
keep their workers in no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rosemount, far from the arcane debate in Washington over legislative 
language, the issues are being played out in real life for workers like Doug 
Greene and supervisors like Gary Cater. Management and labor are locked in an 
economic war with a rising toll in financial hardship and emotional stress on 
all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four union workers are fighting to regain the jobs that they lost two 
months ago when management fired them and brought in permanent non-union 
replacements immediately after their local union called a strike. Sixteen years 
after their last strike, the workers have found, to their horror, that it is no 
longer an effective weapon against management. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the walkout began, CF Industries made it clear that it was ready 
to take a strike here in its only unionized facility. Weeks before the union 
decided to walk, the firm began advertising for replacement workers and 
building living quarters for out-of-state replacements in the plant's parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had absolutely no choice, the union struck us at the height of our busy 
season," said Dan Van Tassel, spokesman for CF Industries at its headquarters 
in Long Grove, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now each day, picketing CF Industries workers like Ken McCloud -- under the 
watchful eyes of a phalanx of security guards and cameras -- angrily scream at 
their replacements driving in and out of the plant's gates and berate 
supervisors for refusing to reopen contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, scab! Scab! How does it feel?" McCloud shouted one afternoon at a 
passing truck. The replacement worker in the driver's seat stared stonily 
ahead, refusing to return McCloud's glare from inches away. 
</P>
<P>
 As the strike drags on, the emotions on both sides are reaching a jagged edge, 
leading to increasingly dramatic confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you doing this to us?" Greene shouted in one exchange with Cater. 
"All we want to do is work. Let us do our jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Cater, clearly tense, stopped his truck outside the plant gate to shout back 
at McCloud for insulting his wife. "I'll meet you any day if you talk about my 
wife!" he screamed. "Leave my family out of this!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we? You haven't left our families out! There are 24 families out 
here, not 24 guys!" was Greene's retort. His wife, Gail, and their two young 
sons watched the confrontation from the roadside. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time passes, the guys are getting more and more frustrated; they don't 
know what's going to happen," said Gail Greene, who now supports the family 
with her job as a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Life on the picket line is particularly hard for Greene and the other union 
members because their lost jobs at CF Industries were so good -- and offered a 
ticket into the middle class. Workers here had been union members since the 
Rosemount plant opened in 1962 and they had enjoyed high wages -- as much as 
$36,000 a year with overtime -- for relatively unskilled work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just blows my mind that we are out here," said Scott Dohman, a striking 
equipment operator. "I was proud to tell people I worked at CF Industries." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Stoffel, a CF Industries crane operator for 11 years, added: "This is the 
best job I've ever had. I would have been here 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But trouble hit last winter when the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union, 
which represents the CF Industries workers, rejected a company demand for a new 
contract allowing the firm to hire non-union employees to work alongside union 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were willing to compromise. . . . We don't understand why they went on 
strike over that," Van Tassel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with their only steady income coming from $305 a week in unemployment 
benefits and $50 in strike pay, the CF Industries workers are beginning to feel 
the pinch. "I'm probably going to lose my house," Stoffel sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, Stoffel and other workers here look to Washington and passage of 
the striker-replacement legislation for their salvation. While the legislation 
would not prevent firms like CF Industries from replacing workers temporarily 
during strikes, it would require management to hire them back after a 
settlement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had that bill, we would be back at work right now," said Paul Linder, a 
CF Industries striker and father of four. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington, the debate over the striker-replacement bill has worn down 
into an ideological war of words and competing studies, as both management 
groups and labor fight to win over a handful of key swing votes that will be 
needed today to break an expected Republican filibuster in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organized labor is trying to achieve politically (with this legislation) what 
it can't in the marketplace, which is to gain more members and more clout," 
said Jeff Joseph, a top lobbyist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet union lobbyists point to a new survey by the Bureau of National Affairs, a 
Washington research organization, showing that 82% of companies surveyed said 
they would either use replacement workers or threaten their use in upcoming 
contract talks with their unions if Congress does not pass the striker 
replacement ban. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's showdown in the Senate -- the striker-replacement ban already has 
passed the House -- union lobbyists concede that they can count on just 56 or 
57 votes, short of the 60 votes needed in a critical vote to break a filibuster 
and allow a full vote on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill does go down, the workers at CF Industries recognize it will have 
a direct impact on their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is going to happen to the middle class if companies can just do this all 
the time?" Greene asked. "We will have two classes in this country, the high 
and the low. . . . All the companies will bust their unions."

NEW CANCER SUIT FILED AGAINST SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time, a worker suffering from cancer is suing the operators of 
the San Onofre nuclear power plant on grounds that he contracted the disease 
because the plant was negligent in the way radiation was handled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit to be filed today in federal court against Southern California 
Edison, 62-year-old Glen James of Dominguez Hills alleges that he contracted 
chronic myelocytic leukemia because of his exposure to radiation at San Onofre. 
He is joined in the suit by his wife, Doreth. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rosenblum, an Edison vice president, denied that the company was 
responsible for James' cancer. "Thirty percent of all Americans get cancer," 
Rosenblum said. "With a work force as large as ours, it's not surprising these 
lawyers could find another cancer patient to file a lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 James worked at San Onofre from 1982-83 as an engineer for Bechtel Power Corp. 
and from 1985-86 as an engineer for Fluor Technology Inc. During the latter 
period, the plant suffered chronic problems with microscopic bits of 
radioactive fuel called "fuel fleas," which led the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission to fine and chastise Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 James is represented by the Los Angeles law firm Howarth & Smith, the firm 
that represented Rung C. Tang, 44, a former inspector for the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission who was stationed at San Onofre from 1985-86 and later 
found to have chronic mylogenous leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Tune, a partner in the firm, said the damages to be sought in James' 
case will be $10 million to $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably won't die today or tomorrow," Tune said, "but it's our 
information that he has been told by doctors that because of his age and 
medical condition, he is not a candidate for a bone marrow transplant, which is 
the only thing that could save him." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the claims in James' suit are identical to those in Tang's suit: that 
Edison officials knew there was a severe contamination problem, that radiation 
detectors were faulty, and that the company cared more for profits than for 
workers' safety. Edison has denied all such assertions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang sued Edison, the plant's operator and majority owner, for $15 million. A 
federal court jury deadlocked 7 to 2 in her favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors later said that some of the most persuasive testimony came from Dr. 
Harry Demopoulos, a New York pathologist and cancer causation expert who 
testified that Tang's cancer was caused by exposure at San Onofre. Demopoulos 
will offer similar testimony in James' case, Tune said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demopoulos' testimony in the Tang case was vigorously contested by Edison and 
its cancer expert Dr. Robert Gale, a professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of retrial in mid-March, Edison and Tang's attorneys reached an 
out-of-court settlement. The amount was not disclosed and the company admitted 
no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nuclear industry critics predicted that the settlement -- thought to be 
the first time a cancer lawsuit has resulted in a nuclear plant operator paying 
damages to a former worker -- would provoke other lawsuits against the nation's 
119 nuclear plants.

FBI CELEBRATES CAPTURE OF 'THE SHOOTIST'; CRIME: BANK ROBBERY SUSPECT IS 
NOTORIOUS FOR ALLEGEDLY FIRING GUNSHOTS INTO CEILINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man once known only as "the Shootist" was such a notorious bank robber that 
the FBI held regional conferences on how to capture him. The next one was 
supposed to be in San Francisco, but it has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents arrested Johnny Madison Williams Jr., the man they dubbed the 
Shootist, over the weekend in Seattle. Now, they say, it turns out that his 
wife may have been an accomplice in what agents called the longest serial bank 
robbing spree in FBI history. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is suspected of robbing more than $750,000 from 56 banks, including 
eight in the Los Angeles area, according to the FBI. Agents from six law 
enforcement agencies from three states were on hand to arrest him Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's garnered a great deal of interest in the states he hit," said Jan 
Caldwell, an FBI special agent in San Diego, where the warrant for Williams' 
arrest originated. Now that he has been nabbed, Caldwell said, agents in the 
areas where he worked are ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and his wife, Carolyn, have been charged with four counts of armed 
robbery, and Caldwell says they are suspected in many more. Johnny Williams' 
attorney could not be reached for comment. Carolyn Williams' attorney declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Williams is suspected of starting his robbery spree in 1986 in Dallas, 
Caldwell said. After five robberies in Texas, he opted for changes of venue and 
style, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Diego Trust in November, 1987, Williams began to earn his nickname, 
Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect entered the bank and fired what was to become a trademark shot 
into the ceiling, Caldwell said. Then he ordered patrons to lie down, vaulted 
the teller counter and went from teller to teller, ordering them to put cash in 
his bag, Caldwell said. He drove off in a getaway car, Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams allegedly repeated that routine 50 more times, Caldwell said, and his 
wife was in at least some of the getaway cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very meticulous in his planning, and he ran his bank robberies like a 
business," Caldwell said. He kept a ledger and extensively studied the floor 
plans of banks before he robbed them, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 That meticulousness may prove costly, officials say. The Seattle U.S. 
attorney's office says it has submitted pages of Johnny Williams' diary that 
list his robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI bank robbery investigators say Williams' robberies were atypical. Most 
bank robbers quietly hold up one teller, frequently by slipping them a note 
demanding money while the robber waits in line, said Sam Stanton, supervisor to 
San Diego's FBI bank robbery squad. Most serial robbers rob for eight months to 
two years before getting caught, said Dick Thurston, an FBI spokesman. Williams 
is suspected of an eight-year spree. 
</P>
<P>
 And Williams had favorite regions, Caldwell said -- Texas, Southern California 
and Washington state. She said Williams needed money for his gambling habit, 
which she said was probably the motive for his robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Winn, manager at one of the locations he allegedly chose in 1987 and 
1988, said people at the Marguerite and Avery branch of First Interstate Bank 
in Mission Viejo always worried that the Shootist would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing everybody said this morning was 'Yeah! He's off the streets!' 
" Winn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much is known about the Williamses. The FBI says Johnny Madison Williams 
Jr. was born in Waukegan, Ill., raised in Dallas, and is believed to have lived 
a short time in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 For years law enforcement agencies could not identify the Shootist. But in 
May, the suspect was featured on a segment of "San Diego's Most Wanted." The 
San Diego office of the FBI received an anonymous tip on the Shootist's 
identity, Caldwell said, and after two months of investigation, FBI and other 
law enforcement agents gathered in the lobby of a Seattle hotel where the 
Williamses were staying. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnny Williams came downstairs to use a typewriter, Caldwell said, "he 
had a welcoming committee." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Williams faces up to 25 years in jail and a $250,000 fine for 
each robbery. "I think his career as a bank robber is over," Caldwell said.

CHP OFFICER SHOT TO DEATH AFTER STOPPING STOLEN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol officer who had stopped a stolen car was killed by 
a shotgun blast to the face Monday in the first slaying of a CHP officer in 
almost two years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Officer Richard Alan Maxwell, 33, a five-year veteran, also was 
believed to be the first homicide of a Bakersfield-based patrolman, said 
division Cmdr. John Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell was pronounced dead at a hospital about 45 minutes after getting 
involved in a confrontation when he stopped a stolen car in a residential area, 
said Cpl. Dave Carr, CHP watch commander. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did request backup," Carr said. "When the backup officer got there, he put 
out the call: 'Shots fired. Officer down. Need an ambulance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were arrested in connection with the shooting, Kern County 
sheriff's spokeswoman Patty Chase said Monday night. Booked on suspicion of 
murder was Bruce Sons, 39, of Bakersfield. Also arrested in connection with the 
case was a 16-year-old Bakersfield resident, Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sons allegedly was the driver of the car and the juvenile was the passenger, 
said Sheriff's Sgt. Glenn Johnson. Sons' father, Jim Sons, was detained for 
questioning but released, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred in the driveway of Jim Sons' house, where a brief 
pursuit ended, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 17-year-old who witnessed the confrontation, the CHP officer 
got into an argument with someone in Sons' car and then "backed up to his car." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one suspect went around the corner of a garage with the officer in 
pursuit, the witness said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I heard seven, maybe nine gunshots," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson and Patrolman Doug Brewer confirmed that some of the shots the 
witness heard were from Maxwell returning fire, but the officer apparently 
missed his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 The last homicide of a CHP officer was July 23, 1992, when Fidel Aleman was 
gunned down in Los Angeles, said CHP spokeswoman Nancy Levitt. She said three 
officers died in traffic accidents last year while on duty.

LEGISLATURE'S $8-MILLION GUARANTEE FOR THE FOUNDATION, WHICH SERVES IMMIGRANTS 
AND THE POOR. THE FBI IS INVESTIGATING ALLEGATIONS THAT IT MISUSED FUNDS.

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has thwarted an attempt by the Legislature to guarantee an 
$8-million contract for a chain of politically connected day-care centers under 
FBI investigation for possible misuse of government funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who signed a new $57.5-billion state spending plan Friday, used his 
line-item veto to delete a provision requiring the state Department of 
Education to renew the contract of a nonprofit foundation that operates 
day-care centers for 2,300 immigrant and poor children statewide. Three of the 
centers are in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In his veto message, Wilson said the mandate would "circumvent current law and 
regulations" by placing limitations on the department's authority to grant or 
renew contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Department of Education said a final decision on the 
foundation's contract will not be made until after a Sacramento Superior Court 
judge rules in a lawsuit that the foundation has filed. The foundation sued the 
department after it was notified that the state agency was considering not 
renewing its contract. 
</P>
<P>
 James Mattesich, an attorney and lobbyist for the Foundation Center for 
Phenomenological Research, said the veto came as a surprise and disappointment, 
especially because past governors have approved similar provisions for other 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hoped and expected that the governor would approve the decision of the 
Legislature to require an additional one-year funding period for the foundation 
center," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the education department began procedures to stop the renewal of its 
1994-95 contract with the foundation after examinations of the center's 
financial records by the state controller's office and an outside consultant 
questioned whether money intended for children was being diverted for other 
purposes. Over the last three years, the foundation has received more than $20 
million in state and federal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, which raided the foundation's offices and seized its records a year 
ago, has been investigating similar questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature took the unusual step of requiring a state agency to contract 
with a specific organization at the urging of state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris 
(D-Oakland), who insisted that the group needed to be protected from what he 
believed was undue harassment by state bureaucrats and federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Petris said he had seen no evidence of any wrongdoing by the 
foundation and could only conclude that it was having trouble with state 
education officials because "somebody in the department didn't like them." He 
blamed department officials for instigating the FBI investigation in an attempt 
to discredit the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he has seen the FBI produce evidence of wrongdoing, Petris said he would 
not be impressed by the investigation. "The problem is too many people, the 
minute they hear FBI, they wet their pants. . . . Well, that's not me," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petris acknowledged that he had not reviewed the financial reports by the 
controller's office and an outside consultant, but said he would expect any 
department audit to be negative. He said he preferred to believe an independent 
auditor hired by the foundation who told lawmakers that his audit of foundation 
books had uncovered nothing questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Petris' staff director, Felice Tanenbaum, said she advised Petris to take up 
the foundation's cause after reviewing hundreds of letters of support from the 
parents of children who have been served by the day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she also placed great faith in assurances that she had gotten from 
the foundation's lobbyist, Donne Brownsey, that there was no wrongdoing. She 
described Brownsey, who formerly worked on the staff of state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys), as someone she had known for years whose judgment she 
trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not involved in the latest legislative action, Roberti and 
other Democratic lawmakers over the years have been strong supporters of the 
foundation and have intervened in the past when the Department of Education 
threatened adverse actions. The foundation's largest center, in South-Central 
Los Angeles, is named the David Roberti Child Development Center, after the 
senator.

PARADISE ON PCH; RV CAMPGROUND ON HIGHWAY SHOULDER IS AN EVER-SHIFTING VILLAGE 
ON WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Jack Schneider, flanked by a receding blur of motor homes, stood by the 
boulders that guard the shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway above Ventura and 
bubbled with the giddy cheer of a man who has it all. 
</P>
<P>
 At hand, just paces from the whoosh of cars and not far from the thunder of an 
occasional train, was a tumble of loved ones -- children, grandchildren -- 
milling about their piece of asphalt while the scent of steaks eddied in the 
wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Before them, like a jewel under the sun, was the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the beach, a man at the other reach of the economic spectrum, Robert 
Cameron, 28, gazed out at the sand, the sea, the Channel Islands peeking 
seductively through the blue. At his side was his answer to Schneider's 30-foot 
Pinnacle motor home -- a third-generation bicycle loaded down with some of the 
necessities of a hardscrabble life, and some of its eccentricities. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Rincon Parkway, a one-mile stretch of Pacific Coast Highway 
between Faria and Hobson county parks, five miles north of Ventura. It is a 
novelty, officials said, in that they know of no other beachfront shoulder of a 
state highway that has been designated by local ordinances for motor-home 
camping. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years since becoming an "overnight parking zone," as Ventura County 
officials call it, this spot has become an ever-shifting village on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Where long-term campers once took up permanent residence, there is now a study 
of contrasts between the well-off and the not-so-well-off; between the young, 
the working, the retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like it was tense (in earlier times) because you had the homeless 
types, the hippie types," said Simi Valley resident Ron Williams, 60, who was 
sharing his motor home on a recent weekday with his son and his son's friend. 
"But now it's more like the working types, the retired types." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials could not be happier, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned that long-term campers were crowding out surfers, sunbathers and 
other day-users -- in addition to causing sanitation problems -- the county 
Board of Supervisors moved in 1984 to strictly limit the number of days that 
motor homes could remain along the parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 They set aside 112 spaces on the beachfront shoulder -- far fewer than before 
-- and visitors now must pay a fee and stay no more than five consecutive days 
from April to October and no more than 10 from November to March. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a greater, more fluid mix of people, said park operations 
supervisor Pam Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the families, like the Schneiders. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the retirees, like Manhattan Beach residents Maynard (Smitty) Smith 
and his wife, Polly, who have been coming to this stretch since 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 There are the newcomers, like 56-year-old Doug Payne of Glendora and his 
6-year-old daughter, Christal, their dog, Storm, and Sammie, their hamster. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are the "snow birds" who travel in their motor homes year-round, 
like 63-year-old Mary, who declined to give her last name but said her mailing 
address is in Newbury Park, and her husband, 65-year-old Marv. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 10 years into their mobile lifestyle, they have settled into a circuit 
that takes in Las Vegas, Tehachapi, Lancaster, Simi Valley and Oregon, to name 
a few. "The Rincon" is a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not necessarily conspicuous, there are the former users, too, Gallo 
said -- the "long-termers" whom her park rangers try to keep in line with the 
five- or 10-day limits, although not always with success. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, they move on," she said. "At times, they don't. It's a game." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the other guests, however, are clean and orderly, mindful of 
the length-of-stay limits, parks maintenance supervisor Ed Evans said. The only 
problem, he added, are the occasional users who empty motor home septic tanks 
into the portable toilets spaced along the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our most popular camping area," said county recreation services manager 
Blake Boyle. So much so, he added, that it is "the only campground that we 
operate that returns a profit. . . . It's almost always full." 
</P>
<P>
 That might surprise those who seek the more out-of-the-way setting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shirlee Zahnter, 63, of Chatsworth, is not one of them. Neither is her 
57-year-old husband, Ron, who proudly announced, "We call this 'RV-ing,' not 
camping." 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawn might be a plastic green carpet and their plastic awning -- with 
its "whirligig" mobiles -- might shudder whenever a delivery truck zooms by at 
50 m.p.h. But to the Zahnters and others who regularly frequent this ribbon of 
highway, it is the drama that is endlessly unfolding just beyond their "front 
yard," just beyond the boulders that separate the street from the sand, that 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see everything in the world out there," Shirlee Zahnter said, sitting in 
her patio chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, as if to prove her point, the dark fins of two dolphins cut 
through the water just beyond the surf. Farther out, a pelican dived for fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really love are the whales," she said. Not only has she seen dolphins 
"playing around the whales," but she also has seen "dolphins jumping right over 
one surfer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicles that appear along the parkway, like the visitors themselves, vary 
widely. They range from the $250,000, 43-foot "rigs" with all the luxuries -- 
microwave ovens, satellite dishes -- to the $7,000, 13-foot Scamp that Smitty 
Smith brought up from Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sign-off spot," said the 66-year-old Smith. "You turn off the 
radio, the TV, the sirens, and you listen to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, 62-year-old Polly, said it is the neighborliness of the people -- 
including those who walk along the bike lane near the motor homes -- that 
especially charms her. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the other four county-run campgrounds, the parking area along the 
Rincon has no running water or electrical hookups, so it costs relatively 
little to operate, said Boyle of recreation services. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Oshita, manager of the county administration and planning section, said 
expenses for the 1992-93 fiscal year for the park rangers, garbage pickup, 
emptying of the eight portable toilets and insurance were just over $150,000, 
compared to revenues of almost $220,000. He said the latter were from park fees 
-- $11 a day from April through October and $8 a day the balance of the year -- 
that campers deposit into the fee vault at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1984, long-term campers had seized on this segment of PCH to park their 
motor homes and live without a mortgage, property taxes or homeowners 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a fisherman myself," said Oshita, who has been with the county since 
1976, "and I would go along the sea wall and would see trash along the place. I 
would see trailers blocked up. I asked them how long they'd been there and 
they'd say, 'Three, five years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose 3rd District includes the Rincon 
Parkway and who was instrumental in imposing the new restrictions on lengths of 
stay, said of the earlier days: "We were serving a segment of the homeless 
population, but we weren't serving the general population."

N.J. GOVERNOR URGES GOP TO STRIP ANTI-ABORTION PLANK; POLITICS: WHITMAN 
COUNSELS HER PARTY TO LET VOTERS KNOW THAT 'EXTREMISTS' ARE NOT IN CONTROL. SHE 
ALSO ADVISES CAUTION ON WELFARE REFORM. 
</P>

<P>
 Plunging into a sharpening debate over the political role of religious 
conservatives, Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican governor of New Jersey, 
Monday called on the GOP to delete the anti-abortion plank from its 1996 
platform and warned that the party must convince voters it has not been 
captured by "extremists." 
</P>
<P>
 In a breakfast interview with Times reporters and editors, Whitman also 
counseled the party to move cautiously on efforts to discourage out-of-wedlock 
births by cutting welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Though New Jersey was the first state to deny additional benefits to women who 
have children while already on welfare, Whitman said it is not yet clear 
whether the program -- which went into effect last August -- is working. Until 
more evidence is in, she said, it would be premature to require all states to 
adopt the so-called family cap, as Republicans in Congress have proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What works in New Jersey isn't necessarily going to work in Nevada or Texas," 
she said. "We (governors) need to have the ability to address the problems as 
we see them." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman, who emerged as a rising GOP star last fall with her come-from-behind 
win over Democratic incumbent James J. Florio, dismissed as "silly and 
premature" talk that she might seek a spot on the 1996 GOP presidential ticket. 
But in a brisk, assured presentation, she signaled an intent to make her 
presence felt in the sharpening intraparty discussions over abortion, welfare 
reform and the role of religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 On each of those issues, Whitman -- a fiscal conservative who has pushed 
through an across-the-board reduction in state income taxes -- came down firmly 
on the side of the party's outnumbered moderate wing. (At one point, she 
referred to herself as a "Rockefeller Republican" -- a political species of 
Northeastern moderate Republican usually considered almost extinct.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman said that she believes a moderate Republican could win the party's 
presidential nomination -- but that it may first take another electoral 
disaster, like the 1964 wipe-out of Barry Goldwater, to dislodge the party's 
dominant conservative wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to understand what it takes to win nationally, and that's why . . . 
it may take another year like '64 to really convince people that extremism, as 
perceived or real, is not going to win. It cannot win nationally," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the party's most divisive social issue, Whitman called for the GOP in 1996 
to abandon entirely the rigid anti-abortion position in its party platform. "I 
would hope . . . there's going to be enough of a voice to get that plank 
knocked out of the platform entirely," she said. "It's not a partisan political 
issue, and it doesn't belong in a party platform." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman, though, acknowledged that the increasing prominence of religious 
conservatives in the GOP would make it difficult to change the party's 
direction on abortion. "Of course, the trouble with it is that as you look at 
people like the religious right . . . , they can only win in caucuses and they 
can only win in conventions and platform committee meetings," she said. "That's 
where they can concentrate their forces." 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, Whitman said, critics have been too quick to label 
conservative victories as a "takeover" of the GOP by religious conservatives. 
But she criticized the tone of the 1992 GOP convention, where social 
conservatives like Patrick J. Buchanan and televangelist Pat Robertson played 
prominent roles. "I think the way the party presented its face at the 
convention in Houston (in 1992) really predetermined the election," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, she said, the party had to make clear its independence from "extremists . 
. . (who) have (only) one or two issues about which they care. . . . We're 
going to have to be very careful as we move forward to ensure that the public 
knows there's a lot more to the Republican Party than that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On welfare, Whitman also struck a centrist note. In addition to counseling 
caution on expansion of the family cap proposal, she also expressed doubts 
about another priority of conservatives in Washington: cutting off benefits 
entirely to young women who bear children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 While indicating that she might support allowing states to experiment with 
such an approach -- which is based on proposals from conservative social policy 
analyst Charles Murray -- she questioned its premise that eliminating welfare 
benefits would significantly discourage out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 "It goes far beyond, I believe, just the dollars that come in," she said. 
"That's not the incentive for the majority of those children that are having 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration -- another issue that has polarized the GOP -- Whitman said 
that New Jersey would join legal efforts by California, Florida and other 
states to compel the federal government to reimburse them for providing 
services to illegal immigrants. But, while insisting that she was not 
criticizing California Gov. Pete Wilson, Whitman clearly distanced herself from 
his sharp rhetoric on the issue, saying it is easy for leaders to "fan the 
flames" with "a little demagoguery." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "When you lead a state that has 150 different languages spoken in 
it, you want to understand how important immigration has been and where our 
strength is and our diversity."

SOUTHWEST GEORGIA ENGULFED AS WATERS CONTINUE TO RISE; DISASTER: OFFICIALS IN 
ONE TOWN WORK TO SECURE A PLANT WHERE POTENTIALLY TOXIC AMMONIA IS STORED. 
STATE IS IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORST NATURAL CATASTROPHE.

 The death toll from what is being called the most devastating natural disaster 
in Georgia's history climbed to 30 Monday as floodwaters continued to rise, 
engulfing town after hapless town in the southwest portion of the state and 
threatening a huge fertilizer plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bainbridge, where nearly a third of the town's 14,000 residents have been 
evacuated, the Georgia National Guard labored in 90-degree heat to build a 
20-foot bulwark around a fertilizer plant containing 9 million pounds of 
ammonia. The chemical reacts violently to water and its fumes can be poisonous 
if inhaled. Company officials said they thought the plant was secure. 
Nevertheless, the town was on alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got our things ready," said Annie Cohen, a seamstress who came downtown 
Monday evening to watch the floodwaters rise. She does not live in the flood 
area but nevertheless was ready to evacuate at the first hint of trouble at the 
plant. "We'll only be taking a few clothes to put on." 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is on the banks of the swelling Flint River, which is expected to 
crest in Bainbridge on Thursday. But already the water has risen higher than 
anyone here can remember. Cheney Griffin Park, which fronts the river, is under 
water. Only the rooftops of the picnic pavilions are visible. North of 
Bainbridge on Route 91, the entire town of Newton is under water, its 500 
residents homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coming down here every day and it's getting worse and worse every 
time," said Bobby Inlow, an insurance company office manager who stood watching 
the river Monday behind the yellow tape barrier the National Guard had erected 
to keep the curious away. "We've still got eight or 10 more feet to go" before 
the river crests, he said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Bainbridge zoning administrator Charles Seymour said residents have been 
calling him to ask how high the water will get, and if their house is safe. "I 
wish I could tell them," he said. "But we've never been through anything like 
this before." 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall, at 135 feet above sea level, and most of downtown may stay dry, he 
said. But an area called the Big Slough, northeast of town, has already started 
to become inundated, he added, and there is no history to suggest what might 
happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 National Guard troops from the 550th Engineer Battalion built dams 
made of sandbags and red Georgia clay to protect the fertilizer plant. 
</P>
<P>
 While a National Guard military policeman in a Humvee vehicle guarded one gate 
to the plant, a plant worker stood guard at a second gate. He scoffed at 
reports of danger. "There's no way in the world this (ammonia) could blow or 
seep," he said. "If we had four times as much water it ain't going to move that 
tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Fire Chief Doyle Welch said the chemical was a concern, but company 
officials believed the precautions were enough to prevent a catastrophe at the 
200-foot-tall stainless steel ammonia tank. When the river crests, water at the 
plant is expected to be five feet deep, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be 100% certain because nobody has ever encountered this before," 
said David Prichard, a spokesman for Vigoro Industries, which owns the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five Georgia counties have been placed in a state of emergency. 
Thirty-one counties have been declared federal disaster areas. "Over the past 
six days Georgia witnessed a natural disaster like no one has ever seen before 
in our history," Gov. Zell Miller said in a news conference at the Capitol in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 10,000 state employees are involved in the rescue effort, which 
Miller said is the largest ever undertaken in the state. "It is unprecedented 
in its scope," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 3,000 National Guard troops are being employed throughout southwest 
Georgia in search and rescue missions as well as water distribution and 
security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood also soaked 300,000 acres of farmland, dealing blows to the state's 
famed peanut and peach crops. Crop damage could reach $100 million, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 175,000 people were without drinking water in the devastated section of 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bainbridge, state troopers patrolled neighborhoods and military police set 
up barricades near the river, hoping to prevent more deaths from the flooding 
spawned by tropical storm Alberto a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Disaster aid centers opened Monday in Albany, Americus, Jonesboro and Macon to 
help flood victims apply for government grants and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The death count reached 30 Sunday night when two bodies were discovered in 
Americus, 129 miles south of Atlanta; a man whose tractor-trailer was washed 
off a road and a 3-year-old boy who was in a car with his mother that was swept 
into a creek. The mother's body was found Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen of the 30 deaths in Georgia occurred in or just outside of Americus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Albany area, 50 miles northwest of Bainbridge, the Flint River finally 
began to recede early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Florida Panhandle, several towns were either half-submerged, or 
expecting to be. "Water? We got plenty of water," said Blountstown police 
dispatcher Pat Padgett. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apalachicola River in Blountstown crested Sunday afternoon after forcing 
the evacuation of about 120 homes. Three emergency shelters, set up in the 
local high school and in two churches, housed 140 people overnight Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rivers in the Florida Panhandle, being fed by the overflow from Georgia, 
were still rising. The Chipola River, which meets the Apalachicola south of 
Blountstown, was not expected to crest until Tuesday. The tiny towns of Altha 
and Chipola were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley reported from Bainbridge and Harrison from Atlanta. Times special 
correspondent Mike Clary contributed to this story from Miami. How to Send 
Relief to Flood Victims 
</P>
<P>
 Readers wishing to help victims of the Southern floods may do so by calling 
the Red Cross at 1-800-842-2200 or 1-800-257-7575 (Spanish) to charge a 
financial contribution to a credit card, or by sending a check made payable to 
American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund, P.O. Box 37243, Washington, D.C. 20013

ENVIRONMENT; AGENCIES THAT POLICE AIR, SEA MAY ISSUE 'TICKETS' TO POLLUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government's environmental sentries have a new request for 
polluters: license and registration, please. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Coast Guard and the Environmental Protection Agency, taking a hint 
from the highway patrol, want to start issuing tickets. As the federal 
government's chief watchdogs of air and sea purity, the agencies are charged 
with punishing oil spillers and waste dumpers. Officials say "pulling over" 
environmental lawbreakers and imposing on-the-spot fines will cut paperwork and 
protect the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard is testing the waters with a "notice of violation" initiative 
at three ports around the country, including Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coast Guard officers arrive on the scene of an oil spill, they assess the 
size of the accident and write the tickets -- but unlike their radar 
gun-wielding counterparts, they do not have to lie in wait for lawbreakers. 
Ocean-going vessels are required to call the Coast Guard whenever they spill 
hazardous substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Although major environmental catastrophes such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill 
make headlines, more than 90% of the oil accidents the Coast Guard deals with 
involve fewer than 100 gallons, Lt. Cmdr. Rick Gaudiosi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators may pay the penalty, which can range from $50 to $1,000, within 30 
days or appeal for a federal hearing. Tickets can only be issued for spills of 
less than 100 gallons, which are typically caused by small leaks or piping 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing policy, lawbreakers wait months for the Coast Guard to assess 
the amount of a fine and process the paperwork required to issue a penalty. 
Ticketing eliminates much of the red tape and puts more authority in the hands 
of individual Coast Guard officers, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot more open than the old way when people never knew what they 
were getting," said Petty Officer Randy Young, who recently issued a $250 
ticket to a commercial vessel that had spilled nine gallons of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really reasonable thing to pay for a spill." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, whose office has issued about 40 citations since March, patrols off 
Long Beach. The other ports in the pilot program are Charleston, S.C., and 
Galveston, Tex. The Coast Guard will evaluate the six-month program and 
consider making it permanent policy later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Public response has been overwhelmingly positive so far, Gaudiosi said. 
Although no one is happy to pay fines, "they like the instant gratification" of 
on-the-spot tickets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the EPA, officials also are discussing giving agency field inspectors the 
authority to issue on-site citations for minor violations of the Clean Air Act 
and impose fines of up to $5,000 per day. Agency officials have not defined a 
"minor" violation, but they expect most citations will involve improper 
record-keeping and other paperwork-related offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is pleased with its ability to punish big-time lawbreakers, winning 
98% of its legal cases, spokeswoman Wendy Butler said. But issuing tickets 
would allow the agency to streamline its pursuit of small-time violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to plug the holes," Butler said. "It might not be that 
individual violations have a tremendous environmental impact, but the 
cumulative effect of a lot of small violations" is significant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program is successful, the agency is likely to consider extending 
ticket authority to field officers who would be able to dock polluters for 
breaking clean water and conservation laws as well, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also is considering monetary rewards to citizens who report 
violations of the Clean Air Act that result in fines or criminal convictions. 
EPA officials would pay up to $10,000 to anyone who tips off the agency. 
Informants would be required to provide highly detailed accounts of a 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The whistle-blowers approach could save the EPA money, said one official, 
noting that federal agencies are operating under increasingly tight financial 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't do all the enforcement ourselves," he said.

UPDATE; TEAMSTER LEADER'S MANTLE OF REFORM STARTING TO FRAY; ELECTED ON PLEDGE 
TO CLEAN UP UNION, RON CAREY IS CRITICIZED FOR ALLEGED MAFIA LINKS AND BEING 
SLOW TO ATTACK CORRUPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ron Carey was elected president of the Teamsters in 1991, advocates of 
reform inside and outside the nation's largest trade union breathed a sign of 
relief. Hailed as "Mr. Clean" after a series of scandal-tainted Teamster 
chiefs, three of whom went to federal prison, Carey pledged to rid his union of 
mob influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, midway through his first term, Carey is being dogged by allegations that 
his own rise to power has been stained by Mafia connections and that he has 
been slow to attack corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey counters that political enemies, looking to the 1996 union vote, are 
trying to do him in through a smear campaign -- seeking to discredit his reform 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the criticism comes from more than political enemies: His detractors have 
included some highly credentialed authorities -- a Mafia turncoat for whom the 
FBI vouches, a nationally known former prosecutor and a veteran federal judge. 
The Justice Department is aware of the allegations and is examining them, an 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen members of Congress have written the department to urge a 
thorough review. Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), a ranking member of the House 
Judiciary Committee, has asked Atty. Gen. Janet Reno "to examine the material 
closely and look into the matter personally." 
</P>
<P>
 According to FBI records, Alphonse (Little Al) D'Arco, a former organized 
crime bigwig who has become a protected government witness, has asserted that 
Carey earlier in his career honored illegal picket lines thrown up by the 
Lucchese crime family. Carey formerly headed New York Teamsters Local 804, 
whose members handle air freight. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Arco's statements are contained in a confidential report prepared by two FBI 
agents on Jan. 7, 1992, soon after the mobster began to cooperate with the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to D'Arco as "CW" (cooperating witness), the agents wrote: "When CW 
used to put up illegal pickets/strikes, CW would call Carey to advise him of 
same, and Carey would honor the strike without even investigating the nature, 
purpose or legitimacy of the strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Carey claims he never has met or spoken with D'Arco. Yet critics point to 
circumstantial evidence that Carey has had other ties to the Lucchese 
syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Carey took office as president of the 1.4-million member union, 
Frederick B. Lacey -- a former federal judge who helps oversee Teamster affairs 
-- vetoed Carey's appointment of veteran Teamster William F. Genoese as trustee 
of Local 295. Lacey said Genoese had "a sad record" of fighting corruption 
while representing cargo handlers at John F. Kennedy Airport and that he had 
lied under oath about his efforts to secure his appointment by Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey overruled the appointment on grounds that it "would further an act of 
racketeering activity" within the Teamsters. Federal investigators had linked 
Genoese to the Lucchese family. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey then withdrew the appointment, calling it a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Eugene H. Nickerson appointed Thomas Puccio, a respected 
ex-prosecutor, to replace Genoese as permanent trustee of Local 295, a 
scandal-scarred union whose past president was found to be a Mafia member. 
</P>
<P>
 And Puccio filed a brief in federal court last month that said Carey, as 
national president, also had been slow to attack corruption in a "sister local" 
of 295 controlled for years by the Lucchese family. 
</P>
<P>
 Puccio said Carey dragged his feet for months in replacing Anthony Razza as 
leader of Local 851. Razza subsequently pleaded guilty to corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's critics also have dug up court records from a 1975 criminal case in 
New York showing that Carey appeared as a character witness for John Joseph 
Conti, who was identified as a "soldier" in the Lucchese crime family by the 
Senate permanent investigations subcommittee. Conti was later acquitted of 
charges that he extorted bribes from small businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey's aides and supporters claim Puccio's charges are politically motivated, 
that he is simply trying to extend his power as a court-appointed trustee over 
the second union, Local 851. 
</P>
<P>
 And Carey said in a statement that he has acted to place more than 30 Teamster 
locals in trusteeship because of financial malfeasance or other wrongdoing by 
local union officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge David Edelstein of New York, who exercises judicial 
supervision over the Teamsters, has said that the new union chief seemed to be 
ignoring his pledges of reform. Carey's actions "presage toleration of 
organized crime's influence in union affairs and complacency in the face of 
corruption," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelstein recently has been less critical and has upheld moves by Carey to 
abolish the mid-level layer of Teamster regional conferences across the 
country, and with it the conference officials who often draw high union 
salaries. Carey has said these leaders, who he claims are responsible for most 
of the personal "smears" against him, are not needed by the rank-and-file 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the validity of the so-called smears of Carey, a three-member 
independent review board that works under Edelstein's auspices reported this 
week that its inquiry "does not support our recommending charges against 
Carey."

ISRAELIS KILL 2 IN WEST BANK RAID; RESIDENTS UNDER CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israeli troops searching for Islamic militants clamped a curfew on the largest 
West Bank city Monday, raiding a home and killing two Palestinian men inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The two dead were believed responsible for attacks on Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 The 110,000 people in Nablus, 40 miles north of Jerusalem, were under curfew, 
with all movement banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence dropped in the West Bank with the start of Palestinian autonomy, but 
it escalated last week with the shooting deaths of a 17-year-old Israeli girl 
and a soldier. It was not immediately clear if the army search and attack 
Monday were linked to those deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Nablus' old quarter said about 30 soldiers surrounded a one-room 
house around 2:30 a.m. while others took over nearby rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened fire on the house about 2 1/2 hours later, throwing in grenades, 
then followed up with bullets and rockets, said Ali Awkashi, a 62-year-old 
grocer who witnessed the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 Awkashi said the firing stopped after about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdel Karm Ayesh, owner of a pastry shop, said an ambulance was called and two 
bodies were taken away. The army then ordered everyone off the street, ran 
wires into the house and blew it up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men killed were identified by neighbors as Bashar Amoudi, 25, from 
Nablus, and Ali Othman Assi of Bani Hasan village near Ramallah. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are believed members of Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist movement that 
opposes the peace accord signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization and has vowed to continue attacks on Israelis.

 French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said France has fulfilled its mission 
in war-torn Rwanda and that it is time for the United Nations to send troops 
and humanitarian aid to head off a fresh crisis. "What is at stake is the 
credibility of the United Nations," Balladur told a news conference in New 
York."France has shouldered her responsibility . . . more or less alone because 
no one was doing very much." But Balladur and Foreign Minister Alain Juppe no 
longer insisted that all French troops will leave by July 31. Instead, Juppe 
told reporters that there would be a "progressive" withdrawal as U.N. forces 
arrived. Balladur also promised that France will turn over to a war crimes 
commission any information it has on those responsible for the massacres of 
hundreds of thousands.

S. KOREA BACKS NORTH'S DELAY OF SUMMIT; ASIA: FOREIGN MINISTER HAN SUNG JOO 
SAYS IT'S UP TO PYONGYANG TO 'RESURRECT THE MOMENTUM' FOR TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo on Monday welcomed North Korea's 
"postponement," rather than cancellation, of the first-ever meeting of leaders 
of the two countries but said South Korea will not be in a hurry to hold a new 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said North Korea must now "resurrect the momentum" for progress 
that was broken by the death of its "Great Leader," Kim Il Sung, 82. He said 
the North also must create a "new environment conducive to a summit." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea, for its part, must be convinced that the North's new leader is 
running his country "stably and firmly," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after North Korea notified the South that it "could not avoid 
postponing" the summit scheduled for July 25-27, Han said "the idea of holding 
a summit meeting . . . is still valid." But he said the unprecedented session 
will not be rescheduled automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Discussions on a subsequent summit meeting" will have to be held, and such 
talks will occur only "if and when a new environment that is conducive to 
holding a summit is created," Han said. Asked if his comments meant that South 
Korea was "going back to Square One," Han replied: "Maybe we will go back to 
Square Two." 
</P>
<P>
 Han urged North Korea to resume quickly its talks with the United States to 
resolve suspicions about the North's nuclear program. "The first order of 
business is to resolve the nuclear issue," he said, but set no deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit's postponement and the interruption in U.S.-North Korea talks broke 
a "momentum" that "has to be resurrected," he said. "We hope the new leadership 
in North Korea will cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Han said Kim Jong Il -- the son of the leader who founded and ruled North 
Korea throughout its 46-year history and left it with a sagging economy and one 
of every 22 citizens in the armed forces -- is "most likely" to ascend to 
power. But he said South Korea could not judge if the younger Kim, 52, would 
add to instability on the Korean peninsula. "We really don't have a clear track 
record on Kim Jong Il," he said. But he said "there is no basis for predicting 
. . . a radically different policy than that of the deceased president." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Pyongyang, Kim Jong Il, anointed to succeed his father 20 years 
ago, was shown on North Korean television for the first time since his father's 
death. Dressed in a gray Mao suit and wearing a black mourning band on his left 
arm, Kim led a procession of officials viewing the body of the late president 
in a glass-covered coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing next to him was O Chin U, defense minister and revolution-era comrade 
of his father. O ranks second in the North Korean hierarchy and is the most 
influential leader in the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 MBC-TV, which showed the film in Seoul, said mourners began to pay homage in 
the Presidential Palace at 9 p.m. Monday. The mourning period will continue 
until a state funeral Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniformed students and teachers of the North Korean Military Academy appeared 
en masse before the 66-foot-tall statue of Kim Il Sung in front of North 
Korea's Revolution Museum, wailing, crying and prostrating themselves over the 
death of their "Great Leader." The scenes were replayed on South Korean 
television, which monitors broadcasts in the North. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seoul, Han confirmed that all North Korean media on Monday had started 
referring to Kim Jong Il as "His Excellency" or by the term previously reserved 
for his father, "the Great Leader." Until now, the younger Kim has been called 
"the Dear Leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Support from the 1.1-million-strong armed forces, regarded as the only 
organization capable of enforcing unity in North Korea, is considered essential 
for Kim Jong Il to rule. He commands the military but was appointed to head it 
only in December, 1991, without ever having served in its ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Across a demilitarized zone separating the divided nation are the 625,000 
armed forces of South Korea and 37,000 American troops, pledged by treaty to 
help defend the South against any attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Clinton Administration officials said they do not expect any 
immediate change in North Korea's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every sign so far points to continuity," Winston Lord, assistant secretary of 
state for East Asian affairs, told reporters at the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Administration is not seeking a formal reaffirmation from Kim Jong 
Il of his father's pledge to freeze the nuclear program while negotiations are 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every indication . . . (that) the continuing freeze of North Korean 
nuclear activities is continuing and will continue," he said. "North Korea 
certainly knows that this is a premise for our talks, and we see no reason to 
believe that this is going to be interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord said the American government "does not have a good feel" for the younger 
Kim. "Very frankly, there is not a good profile on him," he said. "And you hear 
conflicting reports often based on hearsay or rumors, so I think one should 
reserve judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said intelligence reports suggested that Kim Jong Il had played a 
significant role on nuclear and other issues. "That would suggest possible 
continuity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord noted one potentially positive sign: North Korea's government-run 
domestic radio network broadcasted the text of Clinton's message of condolences 
on the elder Kim's death. Lord called the decision to broadcast the statement 
"quite unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Another official said it appeared to reflect the value the North Koreans 
attach to such forms of international recognition, one reason Clinton sent the 
conciliatory message.

 Gunmen killed seven foreigners, including two dining in a restaurant near the 
capital, embassy and official sources said.Four Russians and a Romanian were 
killed on their way to work when men disguised as police stopped their 
state-owned bus, separated them from their Algerian colleagues and 
"machine-gunned" them, an embassy spokesman said. Later in the day, four 
Algerians, including the head of the state veterinary school and a senior 
ministry official, were also shot to death. The day's toll raised to at least 
49 the number of foreigners slain in recent months in a dramatic escalation of 
a campaign by Muslim fundamentalists against the government.

54% OF CITIES EXPECT TO FINISH YEAR IN BLACK, SURVEY PREDICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than half of America's cities will live within their means this year, 
according to a report released Monday, but finishing in the black often will 
come at the expense of crime prevention programs and other municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget managers in 54% of the 551 cities surveyed in the National League of 
Cities' annual study of urban fiscal conditions forecast that revenues will 
stay ahead of spending. In last year's survey, about 66% of cities projected 
that they would finish in the plus column. Survey results from the last two 
years suggest that some stability in municipal balance sheets is returning 
after several years of widespread stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending will continue to outpace revenue in many cities, however, because of 
the skyrocketing costs of health care for city employees, unfunded mandates and 
repairs to streets and other public facilities, local officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debt threatens more cities in the West than anywhere else, the survey shows. 
This year, 25.6% of the region's cities will end the year in the red, up from 
22% in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials said they are fairly optimistic about the city's fiscal 
health. The balance for the fiscal year that ended June 30 -- $68.9 million -- 
surpasses last year's bottom line of $40 million, because of money saved from 
layoffs. About $64.6 million of the balance is already committed to programs in 
the budget that took effect July 1, however, leaving the city with less than $4 
million in a reserve coffer that is supposed to contain around $30 million, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense cutbacks, earthquakes and fires have had a pronounced effect on city 
budgets in Los Angeles and throughout California. And city managers are left 
with a limited number of revenue-raising tools because of tax caps and other 
state measures approved by voters, said Newark, N.J., Mayor Sharpe James, the 
league's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the overall trends, the worst appears to be over," James said at a 
news conference. "But just because you can balance your checkbook doesn't mean 
you can feed the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 To end the year in the black, many cities have delayed hiring new police 
officers, closed children's recreational facilities and rolled back other 
services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials saved $4.5 million by cutting back on street resurfacing 
from 135 to 100 miles per year but estimate that the long-term costs of road 
repair will be significantly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, 43% of the cities reported cuts in spending, which often 
indicates deferred maintenance. Donald J. Borut, executive director of the 
league, called the cutbacks "one of the short-term balancing Band-Aids that can 
lead to higher costs in the long run."

 The United States acknowledged Monday that government scientists used a 
French-provided virus to invent the American test kit for the AIDS virus, and 
Washington agreed to increase payments to the French under a 1987 
royalty-sharing formula. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement is intended to "normalize the sometimes rocky relations" 
between the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Pasteur Institute in 
Paris, said Dr. Harold Varmus, NIH director. 
</P>
<P>
 The two agencies have been at odds since 1983 over credit for discovery of the 
human immunodeficiency virus and the subsequent race to patent a test for the 
virus. In 1984, the U.S. Patent Office granted the patent to the American team. 
</P>
<P>
 While NIH scientist Robert C. Gallo has been cleared of allegations that he 
stole the virus from the French, Gallo has conceded that he "likely" used a 
virus he received from Pasteur researcher Luc Montagnier in inventing the 
American HIV test kit. Gallo and Montagnier ended up sharing credit for 
discovering the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The official NIH acknowledgment that Gallo had used a French-provided virus 
was "something that has never been said before by the U.S. government," 
according to Washington attorneys Michael Epstein and Robert Odle, who 
represented the French in the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete vindication of the Pasteur Institute," Odle said in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo issued a statement, saying: "It is now time for this episode to be 
permanently closed. Pasteur scientists and I should focus all our energies on 
seeking a cure for AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 The two nations reached a settlement seven years ago to share in the royalties 
for the HIV test kit, based on sales in each country. But largely because more 
American than French test kits are being sold, the U.S. has received $20 
million in royalties to the Pasteur's $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus said that the new royalty-sharing arrangement is expected to provide 
the French several hundred thousand dollars more per year. 
</P>
<P>
 His announcement included an open acknowledgment by the NIH and its parent 
agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, that "scientists at the 
NIH used a virus provided to them by Institut Pasteur to invent the American 
HIV test kit." 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus said that the acknowledgment came "in light of the current state of 
knowledge," including an independent study in 1991 that supported the French 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new arrangement, each side will continue to keep the first 20% of 
royalties from sales of test kits in each country. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 80% of each side's royalties will be pooled and distributed in a 
different manner, with Pasteur getting 50%, the NIH 25% and the World AIDS 
Foundation the final 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The old formula gave 25% of the pooled revenues to the World AIDS Foundation, 
which funds education and research in the developing world, and 37.5% each to 
France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Varmus said that the new formula is intended to give the United States and 
France "approximately equal shares of the test kit royalties over the lives of 
the patents." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the new agreement "fair and equitable" and expressed the hope that 
it has put "this distraction behind us."

SMOOTH SAILING FORECAST FOR BREYER IN PANEL'S HEARINGS; JUDICIARY: SOME 
SENATORS PLAN TO QUESTION HIGH COURT NOMINEE'S TENDENCY TO FAVOR BIG FIRMS. 
LITTLE SERIOUS OPPOSITION IS EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Anticipating the least contentious confirmation of a Supreme Court justice in 
20 years, the Senate Judiciary Committee will open hearings today on the 
nomination of its former chief counsel, Judge Stephen G. Breyer of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the senators have said that they will oppose the 55-year-old appeals 
court judge, although a few have said that they intend to put him through a bit 
of "sensitivity training." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), for example, plans to question Breyer 
about his tendency to rule in favor of big companies and against smaller 
competitors in antitrust cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hopes to sensitize him about the need to protect the little guys," said 
Nancy Coffey of the senator's staff. But even Metzenbaum, who initially 
criticized President Clinton's choice of Breyer, has said that he plans to vote 
to confirm the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer is also expected to be questioned about a possible conflict-of-interest 
involving his investment in Lloyd's of London, an insurer of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 As a judge, Breyer did not rule on cases where Lloyd's had a clear and direct 
interest but he did issue several opinions that limited the liability of 
companies for cleaning up toxic waste dumps. Some of these companies were 
insured in turn by one of Lloyd's syndicates, groups of people who assume 
responsibility for specific risks. White House officials said that Breyer's 
personal investments were not affected by those rulings because he was not a 
member of the syndicate in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 For many investors in Britain and the United States, the once-reliable Lloyd's 
has proved to be a disastrous investment in recent years. Because those who 
back Lloyd's are ultimately liable for covering losses, some wealthy investors 
have been virtually wiped out when a particular syndicate has been forced to 
pay for losses related to asbestos or pollution cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts are apparently divided over whether Breyer should have removed 
himself from cases involving the cleanup of toxic wastes. Some have said that, 
since he had no direct investment in the companies that were parties to the 
lawsuit, he had no conflict of interest. However, others have maintained that 
he should have stepped aside because he could have benefited indirectly if 
Lloyd's was spared further losses, even if he was not an investor in the 
specific syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 In his written responses to the Judiciary Committee, Breyer played down the 
issue. He noted that he has potential further losses of as much as $114,000 
stemming from his earlier Lloyd's investment but he also has insurance of 
$189,000 to cover possible losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the hearing is expected to go smoothly for Breyer because the 
committee's Republicans, led by Sen. Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, enthusiastically 
praised his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, liberal advocates have been lukewarm to Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1990, the Supreme Court has lost its three most passionate voices for 
justice: William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun," said 
Nan Aron, director of Alliance for Justice, a coalition of civil rights and 
public interest lobbies. "We need a justice (to) carry on their vision . . . 
and help resurrect the court as a promoter of the rights of and liberties of 
ordinary Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 While Aron said that she supports Breyer's nomination, she expressed 
disappointment that the court now will have no true liberal in the image of 
Brennan, Marshall or Blackmun. 
</P>
<P>
 By his record and reputation, Breyer is a smart, skeptical judge who rules 
narrowly. As an academic, he made his mark as a critic of far-reaching federal 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocate Ralph Nader has said that he will play the role of skunk at 
the garden party by testifying against the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is a corporate judge who was picked by a corporate lawyer," Nader 
said, referring to White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler.

GROUPS SPONSORING ANTI-GAY MEASURES FALL SHORT OF GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Groups hoping to pass anti-homosexual initiatives in 10 states this year have 
fallen short of their goals, filing enough signatures to get measures on 
ballots in only two states. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250,000 petition signatures were due Monday in Michigan, the last of 
the 10 states where ballot language has been filed.But George Matousek of the 
Michigan Family Values Committee, which started the petition drive, said Monday 
the effort had been put on hold because the wording was identical to a Colorado 
law that was declared unconstitutional by that state's Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days of reckoning came last week in what has become a battle between 
gays and the conservatives who are backing initiatives to deny what they call 
"special rights" for homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of such measures failed to file signed petitions in Missouri and 
Washington state on Friday, but did submit enough signatures to qualify for the 
ballots in Idaho and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Goldberg, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, 
said her group would fight the ballot measures, first by challenging petition 
signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambda is leading the gay community's fight against Colorado's Measure 2, a 
1992 amendment that banned the state and local governments from prohibiting 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. Amendment 2 was the model for the 
measures proposed in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Michigan and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Other states where attempts were made to get an anti-gay rights measure on the 
ballot are Arizona, Nevada, Florida and Ohio.

LAST SOLDIER TO DIE AT LEAVENWORTH HANGED IN AN APRIL STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was 18 when he joined the Army, 19 when he was court-martialed and three 
days past his 26th birthday when he was hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only time he ever was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 His birth certificate said he was "colored," and his death certificate said 
"negroid." Karl Menninger, the renowned Kansas psychiatrist, lobbied the 
Kennedy White House not to take the life of this "undistinguished epileptic 
Negro soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the last man to die by military execution and the only one put to death 
for rape during peacetime. 
</P>
<P>
 He died for raping a white girl in Austria, a country that had no death 
penalty. Indeed, on the eve of the hanging, the victim and her parents urged 
President John F. Kennedy to spare him. 
</P>
<P>
 He was Pvt. John Arthur Bennett. Born into a share-cropping family in southern 
Virginia, he hoped the Army would pull him out of poverty. Instead he spent 
most of his Army years on military Death Row, six years in which six other 
black soldiers were hanged while all four of the white men -- many of them 
multiple murderers -- were saved. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came down to his own final day, April 12, 1961, it would be one of the 
busiest afternoons in the new Kennedy Administration. Soviet cosmonaut Yuri 
Gagarin had beaten the U.S. into space, and the President was preoccupied with 
planning for the Bay of Pigs invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, who from his isolated cell could not know of that day's crush of 
history, wired the White House, begging for mercy "while I still have a few 
hours left." The reply -- from a White House underling -- was a terse and swift 
no. And then, as the clock moved past midnight on a stormy Kansas night, 
Bennett was hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 It took him 16 minutes and 5 seconds to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember they started to rush him up the ramp toward me," said the hangman, 
a retired Army first sergeant who, because of his past, lives in anonymity 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept looking around and back and forth and he kept saying, 'Where's the 
chaplain? Where's the chaplain?' 
</P>
<P>
 "But the last person he saw was me." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett had been convicted in January, 1955, for the rape and attempted murder 
of an 11-year-old Austrian girl. Heavily intoxicated, he crossed a field 
searching for a brothel outside his Army base, came instead across a series of 
private homes, then staggered back across a little creek. There, he stumbled 
across the girl, who was returning home from Christmas shopping. He raped her 
and tried to drown her. 
</P>
<P>
 His military trial was held in just a month. The court-martial jury 
deliberated 25 minutes. Bennett never testified in his own defense. The 
sentence: Death. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months later, his mother, Ollie Bennett, told Red Cross authorities 
that as a child, John would "hear voices in his sleep." He often rose out of 
bed in search of the speaker. Other times he had night terrors and was hard to 
wake. He "was afraid of storms," his mother said, "and when approached would 
run and hunt a dark place to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always different," she said. "He would get very mad with the others, 
and then they would let him alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The family history was replete with alcoholism, hypertension and mental 
illness, and Bennett suffered from epilepsy. He dropped out of school in the 
seventh grade and learned to drink "corn liquor" and aspirin with wine. He 
fathered a baby out of wedlock before he left to join the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball was his greatest passion. For recreation he would throw a baseball at 
the prison walls, slamming it so hard that it would bounce right back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Each year another black soldier was taken out to the gallows. Bennett's time 
was drawing ever near. The military appellate courts confirmed his death 
sentence. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the death warrant. The federal 
courts in Kansas and Washington refused to reopen his case. Twice he was given 
last-minute stays of execution, once while he was eating what was to be his 
last meal. 
</P>
<P>
 A third date was set: a minute after midnight on April 13, 1961. Bennett found 
a civil rights attorney from Danville, Va., J. L. Williams, who uncovered new 
evidence suggesting his client might have been having a seizure at the time of 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, officials debated how best to proceed. According to transcripts 
of White House conversations between Lee White, a presidential counselor, and 
Army Brig. Gen. Alan Todd, race was an overriding issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume Negro soldiers are more difficult because of education and having 
leanings toward getting into trouble," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true," said Gen. Todd, "but it's something that, without hard and fast 
statistics, you just can't talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 In another conversation, White added: "The last thing I would want to do is 
let this boy out because he is colored." 
</P>
<P>
 They also thought that if the Army could contact the victim and her family and 
the family would agree to mercy, then maybe Bennett should not be hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Days before the execution, the family responded, asking that Bennett be 
spared. 
</P>
<P>
 From the mother: "I suffer terribly with my only child, but Bennett's death 
cannot give us back her health." 
</P>
<P>
 From the father: "I know how hard it is for the parents when their own child 
is so close to the verge of death." 
</P>
<P>
 From the victim: "Even his execution could not eradicate what has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 After closely considering the appeals, Kennedy still did not act. "I think the 
President did what he thought was right," White said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In one final shot on his last day, Bennett wired the President. "I beg in the 
name of God . . . " he began the short telegram. It ended: "Will you please in 
the name of God and mercy spare my life?" 
</P>
<P>
 The President, busy with world events, did not reply. It fell to White to turn 
down Bennett's last plea. The word came just after Bennett had finished a final 
dinner of fried shrimp, fresh frozen peaches and his favorite, hot rolls and 
biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 He was whisked from his cell and into the rain and up the scaffold. He had 
been so afraid of rainstorms, and so by his side hurried the Rev. Thomas 
Carter, the prison chaplain, using a penlight to read -- shout, actually -- the 
23rd and 46th Psalms as they rushed Bennett to the arms of the executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier's last words: "May God have mercy on your souls."

ABSENTEE DEFENDER TAKES ON HIS CRITICS; LAW: HOLDER OF LUCRATIVE O.C. CONTRACT 
SAYS HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE IN COURT TO DO RIGHT BY POOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Suntanned and immaculately coiffed, Hermes necktie knotted tightly to a stiff 
collar, William Walton Stewart is sitting in his spacious conference room 
feeling bewildered and more than a little betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is Don Guillermo -- as he is known to some in the Orange 
County courthouse -- the man who has managed to hold onto the county's contract 
to defend poor people accused of crimes, while running an import-export 
business from Bogota, Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 years, he's been a player in Orange County's close-knit legal club, 
making all the right moves to keep the pact that pays his firm nearly $1 
million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent years cultivating relationships with state lawmakers, local 
judges and county supervisors; has raised funds for all the right war chests; 
his expensive slip-ons have even walked precincts. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if he hasn't spent much time in the courtroom the past few years? 
Stewart says his associates have kept the cases rolling and have done a capable 
job defending their clients. And if Stewart has been busy with outside ventures 
-- selling lobsters, flowers and fruit imported from Colombia, and lately 
marketing a brand of waterproof asphalt in Las Vegas -- why should anyone care? 
</P>
<P>
 And why, Stewart asks, are a handful of judges and county bureaucrats suddenly 
turning up the heat and talking about taking away his contract? 
</P>
<P>
 "Idiots" is how he once described his critics on the bench. (He now offers a 
public apology to the judges for his "no-class" statement.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, people have been taking shots at me for a long time," Stewart said, 
his golden hair glowing in the dim light of the dark-paneled conference room. 
"Because of my connections in Colombia, people have even accused me of dealing 
cocaine. I don't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never perceived myself as an (expletive), but I think people are a 
little upset because they would like to have what I have. You see, I could bury 
people in this county, but who's got time to play those games?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart's handling of the county's biggest criminal defense contract has come 
under fire in recent weeks, as the county grappled with how to cut the costs of 
providing attorneys for criminal defendants who can't afford to hire their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Two judges on a special committee which oversees the contract system recently 
accused Stewart of farming out much of the caseload to lawyers outside his 
firm, while retaining a cut from the county contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Stewart faces perhaps his greatest political challenge when Central 
Court judges -- concerned that his law firm's failure to have enough attorneys 
to cover scheduled court hearings is slowing down the criminal justice process 
-- will discuss whether to put the contract out for bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Their discussions could result in Stewart losing the lucrative county 
contract, but few -- certainly not Stewart -- are prepared to count him out 
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if I wanted to get out of this contract, I wouldn't get out now," the 
Pennsylvania native proclaimed, "not while all this stuff is going on, no way." 
</P>
<P>
 Local judges and attorneys familiar with Stewart's manner say such rhetoric is 
part of the man's public persona -- a man who is used to getting what he wants 
and is accustomed to using whatever influence is needed to close the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're asking whether he has been kissing up to the right people for a 
long time and making the right financial contributions to the right people, I 
would say he has," said attorney Heidi Mueller, who in 1979 appeared before the 
Board of Supervisors to oppose Stewart's first bid for the contract and would 
like to compete for the contact should it go out for bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows how to schmooze. He's never had the reputation of a trial attorney," 
she said. "He's a good businessman. And unfortunately, I see our profession 
moving in that direction. You have to remember that we're talking about (legal 
representation for) poor people here. But you might as well be selling shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Said another attorney familiar with Stewart's work: "I can't think of another 
attorney in this county who would refer to two sitting judges as 'idiots.' 
That's contempt!" 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart responds by saying that, in fact, defending poor people accused of 
crimes could not be further from his other business interests. "By and large, 
the people who are bad-mouthing me are the people who are going to be doing 
this (criminal law) . . . for the rest of their lives. I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is his import-export operation in Colombia. A $50,000 investment 
got Stewart started flying lobsters to Miami and New York three years ago. 
Pretty soon, he was into flowers, then fruit pulp, and soon after that, Stewart 
was negotiating a deal to import Marlboro cigarettes into Russia. The cigarette 
deal, Stewart said, fell apart when President Mikhail Gorbachev was ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 This can't be real, you say? Stewart spreads the contracts and multinational 
correspondence across the conference table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty wild, huh?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 And wild doesn't begin to describe his encounter, says he, with notorious 
Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar. Stewart and friends were enjoying a night of 
dancing at a local disco on Bogota's North Side when a public address 
announcement invited everyone to stay for complimentary food and drinks. The 
conditions: No one uses the telephone and no one leaves until 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, (Escobar) walks in with an entourage of about 100 guys, all 
carrying semiautomatic weapons," Stewart recalls as if it were last week. "The 
body guards were handing out gold Rolexes to the women. They picked up the tab 
for everything. Dom Perignon, anything you wanted. Those were the good old 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he's already counting the millions to be made distributing a 
waterproof asphalt called Dermasphalt from a new corporate headquarters in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all the talk about his million-dollar ventures, there are 
curious other aspects to Stewart's financial profile. 
</P>
<P>
 The very building which houses his law firm on Broadway in Santa Ana, one of 
the properties held by his real-estate company, is part of a pending bankruptcy 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 In another matter, Stewart owes about $90,000 to Wells Fargo Bank for 
defaulting on a credit account -- a matter, the attorney said, that should be 
resolved shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is embroiled in a particularly nasty $12-million lawsuit against the 
Bank of Caldas in Colombia. Two years ago, Stewart said, the bank agreed to 
loan him $1 million against an interest in his law office property, but the 
bank allegedly paid out only $230,000. The dispute has led the bank to file a 
countersuit, which required him to appear in a Colombian court. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the summons was sent to the wrong address in Colombia. When he 
did not appear in court, a warrant was issued for his arrest. He said the 
threatened arrest is merely an attempt to get him to drop the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stewart's financial woes are side issues to the criticism that he 
virtually absented himself from the courtroom, while retaining some of the 
indigent-defense contract's proceeds for his services as an administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart defends his handling of the contract, saying his firm has performed 
ably enough over the years and deserves serious consideration in any future 
plans for indigent-defense assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 He readily admits that the daily trench warfare of defending the poor isn't 
exactly his style. That's why he hired an office of attorneys and refers many 
contract cases out to about a half-dozen others for a cut of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judges Margaret Anderson and Pamela L. Iles, the "idiots" 
Stewart spoke of, said the system of "subletting" cases blurs the lines of 
responsibility for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you give a contract like this to somebody," Anderson said recently, "you 
expect that person to show up in court, working the cases. People say he hasn't 
been in court for years on one of these cases." 
</P>
<P>
 About four years sounds right to Stewart. But his absence -- while peculiar to 
judges and attorneys who hold contracts in other courts -- is part of Stewart's 
corporate style. 
</P>
<P>
 "My strengths are in delegation and administration," Stewart said. "If the 
contract required me to be in court, I'd be there. But it doesn't. . .. You 
see, it's common practice for somebody to come in and talk to the rainmaker and 
somebody else represents them." 
</P>
<P>
 The rainmaker, in this case, is Don Guillermo , and the cases of indigent 
defendants have been pouring into his firm since 1979, all compliments of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, the county has paid out more than $2 million to 
Stewart's firm. And before that, Stewart says, the contract paid even more 
because of a higher volume of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been good to the county, and the county has been good to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, Iles and some county officials believe the county may have been too 
good to the attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's skimming is what it is," Anderson said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart views the recent criticisms as part of a broader effort by Anderson 
and Isles to defend the public defender's office from increasing calls for 
privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton has encouraged such outside contracting as 
a way to cut local government costs. At Stanton's prodding, the privatization 
movement has picked up momentum this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has not set well with Anderson and Iles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon it's going to sound like an Earl Scheib operation around here," 
Iles said recently. " 'I'll defend that man for $29.95.' It's not a question of 
what kind of defense you are providing. It's becoming a question of how low you 
can go." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart sees himself as a convenient whipping boy for the judges' fury but 
says that he harbors no plans for a coup against the public defender's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could the public defender's office be privatized? Yes. Could I do it? Yes. 
Would I do it? No. I don't think it would be appropriate to dismantle the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying we can put on an O.J. Simpson-type of defense for anyone," he 
said. "But we've never been accused of short-cutting anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Several central Orange County Municipal Court judges said, however, they have 
experienced court delays when Stewart's attorneys have not been on time, or 
available when needed to handle a case. Still other judges defended Stewart, 
citing the burdens facing attorneys who are juggling heavy caseloads. Last 
year, court officials said, Stewart's firm handled more than 1,200 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judges always want instant service and that is not always possible," said 
Judge Gary Ryan, recently elected to the Superior Court bench. "Over the years, 
I'd say they've been better at some times and worse at other times." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart says his firm has always tried to accommodate the courts and will 
continue to do so even while his contract appears to be in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to have some more lawyers in Central Court. If I really wanted 
to make some more money, I would take the experienced guys out and put more 
inexperienced people there." Stewart said he wouldn't really consider doing 
such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But why then would a man with seemingly more million-dollar deals in the 
making want to continue taking the punishment he has absorbed in recent weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep my presence here in Orange County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And within his far-flung business empire, where does he rank the interests of 
poor defendants? Without hesitation, Don Guillermo responds: "Right up there 
with Dermasphalt."

FBI CELEBRATES CAPTURE OF 'THE SHOOTIST'; CRIME: EIGHT-YEAR SPREE OF BRAZEN, 
METICULOUS HEISTS, INCLUDING SOME IN ORANGE COUNTY, BROKE FROM THE STYLE OF 
MOST BANK ROBBERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man once known only as "the Shootist" was such a notorious bank robber that 
the FBI held regional conferences on how to capture him. The next one was 
supposed to be in San Francisco, but it has been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents arrested Johnny Madison Williams Jr., the man they dubbed the 
Shootist, over the weekend in Seattle. Now, they say, it turns out that his 
wife may have been an accomplice in what agents called the longest serial bank 
robbing spree in FBI history. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is suspected of robbing more than $750,000 from 56 banks, including 
some in Irvine, Laguna Niguel, San Juan Capistrano and Mission Viejo, according 
to the FBI. Agents from six law enforcement agencies from three states were on 
hand to arrest him Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's garnered a great deal of interest in the states he hit," said Jan 
Caldwell, an FBI special agent in San Diego, where the warrant for Williams' 
arrest originated. Now that he has been nabbed, Caldwell said, agents in the 
areas where he worked are ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and his wife, Carolyn, have been charged with four counts of armed 
robbery, and Caldwell says they are suspected in many more. Johnny Williams' 
attorney could not be reached for comment. Carolyn Williams' attorney declined 
to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Williams is suspected of starting his robbery spree in 1986 in Dallas, 
Caldwell said. After five robberies in Texas, he opted for changes of venue and 
style, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Diego Trust in November, 1987, Williams began to earn his nickname, 
Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect entered the bank and fired what was to become a trademark shot 
into the ceiling, Caldwell said. Then he ordered patrons to lie down, vaulted 
the teller counter and went from teller to teller, ordering them to put cash in 
his bag, Caldwell said. He drove off in a getaway car, Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams allegedly repeated that routine 50 more times, Caldwell said, and his 
wife was in at least some of the getaway cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very meticulous in his planning, and he ran his bank robberies like a 
business," Caldwell said. He kept a ledger and studied the floor plans of banks 
before he robbed them, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 That meticulousness may prove costly, officials say. The Seattle U.S. 
attorney's office says it has submitted pages of Johnny Williams' diary that 
list his robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI bank robbery investigators say Williams' robberies were atypical. Most 
bank robbers quietly hold up one teller, frequently by slipping them a note 
demanding money while the robber waits in line, said Sam Stanton, supervisor to 
San Diego's FBI bank robbery squad. Most serial robbers rob for eight months to 
two years before getting caught, said Dick Thurston, an FBI spokesman. Williams 
is suspected of an eight-year spree. 
</P>
<P>
 And Williams had favorite regions, Caldwell said -- Texas, Southern California 
and Washington state. She said Williams needed money for his gambling habit, 
which she said was probably the motive for his robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Winn, manager at one of the locations he allegedly chose in 1987 and 
1988, said people at the Marguerite and Avery branch of First Interstate Bank 
in Mission Viejo always worried that the Shootist would return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing everybody said this morning was 'Yeah! He's off the streets!' 
" Winn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much is known about the Williamses. The FBI says Johnny Madison Williams 
Jr. was born in Waukegan, Ill., raised in Dallas, and is believed to have lived 
a short time in Southern California. They also say he ran a carpet-cleaning 
business in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 For years law enforcement agencies could not identify the Shootist. But in 
May, the suspect was featured on a segment of "San Diego's Most Wanted." The 
San Diego office of the FBI received an anonymous tip on the Shootist's 
identity, Caldwell said, and after two months of investigation, FBI and other 
law enforcement agents gathered in the lobby of a Seattle hotel where the 
Williamses were staying. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnny Williams came downstairs to use a typewriter, Caldwell said, "he 
had a welcoming committee." 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Williams faces up to 25 years in jail and a $250,000 fine for 
each robbery.

THE WEEK AHEAD: PYONGYANG; 'GREAT LEADER' RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The funeral of Kim Il Sung, who led North Korea under a Communist system for 
more than four decades before his death Friday, will be held Sunday in the 
national capital, but little has been disclosed about the services. The 
official media so far have announced only that the day will be marked with a 
gun volley and a three-minute blowing of train and boat whistles. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign dignitaries have not been invited to attend, and all foreigners have 
been banned from travel in the country in the weeklong period of mourning that 
began with the death by heart attack at 82 of the man North Koreans knew as the 
"Great Leader." 
</P>
<P>
 His body will lie in state at the presidential palace in Pyongyang, but 
official reports have not made clear whether ordinary North Koreans can enter 
the building. His son, Kim Jong Il, is expected to take over the reins of 
government.

THE WEEK AHEAD: PARIS; GERMANS BACK IN PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been 49 years and 11 months since the goose-stepping German army was 
driven from the streets of Paris by the Allies in World War II. Now, on 
Thursday, German soldiers will be back for the first time, marching down the 
Champs-Elysees as invited guests of the French government in the annual 
Bastille Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The participation of the German army in France's Republic Day festivities, 
barely a month after German leaders were shut out of D-Day commemorations, is 
viewed by many in France as a chance to bury the past. An opinion poll 
conducted by Le Figaro newspaper last week found 58% of the French believe it 
is a good idea to let the Germans join the parade, as against 34% who are 
opposed.

WORLD VIEW; TRADING WITH TINY HANDS; NEPAL AND MANY OTHER POOR COUNTRIES HAVE 
BECOME DEPENDENT ON CHILD LABOR. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 That chic and sumptuous high-pile carpet that adorns the lawyer's office in 
Stuttgart, Germany, or the beachfront condo in Redondo Beach may have begun its 
life here on a high-backed vertical loom worked by Meena, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Six days a week, the village girl and seven friends, who sleep in a single 
cramped, dark room in a dirty dormitory whose halls smell of urine, get up at 6 
a.m. and, after gulping down a meager breakfast of warm tea, begin work. 
</P>
<P>
 Meena, a small girl with straight black hair who is timid as a rabbit, sits on 
a rough plank, facing her loom. Guided by a chart on which each dye color bears 
a different number code, she begins to tie strands of triple-ply yarn to make 
that most luxurious of household items, the hand-knotted carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Her small fingers flying, again and again she ties knots -- an average of 60 
to each square inch. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m., after hourlong breaks for lunch and dinner that she and her friends 
have to speedily cook for themselves, the 13-year-old's workday is over, 14 1/2 
tedium-filled hours after it began. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomorrow will be much the same for her, hunched over the loom in a long, dim 
room where the floor is made of filthy bricks and where the only sounds as 
dozens of youngsters work in silence are the foreman's cries and the thud of 
metal mallets swung by the children to pack the knots more densely. 
</P>
<P>
 Meena, daughter of peasants from Nepal's impoverished hills, doesn't know it, 
but she is a valuable cog in her country's economy. Just as the bedrock of the 
Old South was cotton and tobacco and England's fortune was spun in the "dark 
satanic mills" of the Midlands, the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal has come to 
count on carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at the same time, like many other developing countries, this nation has 
rapidly grown dependent on cheap, easily exploitable child labor. An estimated 
160,000 Nepalese children work in carpet mills, sometimes alongside their 
parents at home looms but often in appalling conditions of servitude little 
better than slavery, according to the Child Workers of Nepal Assn., a social 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hand-knotted carpets are made out of the sweat and blood of children," 
charges Suman Srivastva, director of an Indian training institute for children 
freed from bonded labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepal is not unusual. According to a study just released by the world's 
largest trade union federation, 100 to 200 million children ages 4 to 15 work 
in streets, factories, mines and rock quarries from Brazil to the Philippines 
-- often under dangerous conditions and for a miserable wage or no compensation 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which 
claims to represent 120 million workers in the United States and 123 other 
countries, calls such widespread child labor "the best-kept secret" of modern 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, the federation found, minors in developing countries are 
exploited to make goods that are then shipped for sale to richer lands, 
including the United States, whose youngest citizens are protected by child 
labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, union investigators found, children work up to 24 hours a 
day in peak season to sew lingerie for a German multinational to sell in Europe 
at a more than 1,000% markup. In Bangladesh, they reported, 40% of 700,000 
garment workers are children, and most of their output is shipped to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pakistan, say activists who oppose child labor, youngsters who work in 
sporting-goods companies that export field hockey sticks, soccer balls and 
volleyballs to America may never have any free time themselves to play games. 
In Peshawar and Lahore, children perform the initial manufacturing work on 
surgical instruments but have poor access to health care themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With its carpets, Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, has scored a 
coup in overseas markets. Growing from a fledgling industry with a modest 
initial load of exports in 1964, Nepal's carpet-makers last year shipped 34.2 
million square feet -- enough carpets to cover nearly 600 football fields, goal 
post to goal post -- and earned $204 million, or 60% of Nepal's export income. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign consumers, especially Germans, who buy 80% of Nepal's carpets, have 
fallen in love with their warm, muted colors, thick woolen pile and abstract, 
non-Oriental motifs. From this boom, Meena and other child workers benefit 
little more than did the Lancashire millworkers of the Industrial Revolution or 
the antebellum slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, the young Nepalese said they are paid just enough to buy food, 
pay rent (their landlord owns the carpet factory) and purchase cloth to make 
into clothes. For each square meter (about a square yard) of carpet that she 
ties, Meena is supposed to be paid the equivalent of $7.40. In two weeks, she 
is lucky to finish a square meter. Abroad, that much of her handiwork retails 
for $153 to $184, according to factory owner Nyami Tashi Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers scour the countryside to keep the 1,200 carpet factories in Bhaktapur 
and other Katmandu valley locales filled with small hands, social workers 
report. Some brokers pay ignorant or gullible parents for the children; others 
promise to send home a percentage of their wages. Often, no money is sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bosses prefer children," said Anju Shrestha, program officer with the 
Nepal Center for Women and Children Affairs. "Their hands are considered to be 
defter, and they are more patient."  
</P>
<P>
 Country girls, who are commonly submissive and quiet, are believed to make the 
best carpet workers of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the Katmandu valley, the children often become bonded labor, working 
long hours for no pay to reimburse a theoretical debt that they or their 
parents are supposed to owe to the broker or factory owner. "In most cases, 
they never see the money they are supposed to earn," Shrestha said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Meena, the gap between her wage and the value of what she makes is too 
abstruse to understand. For this girl who has never been inside a schoolhouse, 
the high point of the week is Saturday night, when she watches Nepalese movies 
with the other child workers on their factory owner's television. 
</P>
<P>
 Her back always hurts, she complains, like those of all the young girls, who 
took precious time from their lunch break one day last month to sit on tattered 
mats and learn the Nepali ABCs in a room overlooking tangles of drying yarn 
dyed aqua, violet and teal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Meena's friends now coughs all night but doesn't know why. Another has 
hands that hurt, especially in the winter. Social workers say the children 
often develop eye problems from having to stare for years at their looms in the 
twilight of the carpet factories, and cases of premature arthritis are common. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laws in Nepal prohibit the employment of children under 14 and limit 14- to 
16-year-olds to 36 hours' work per week. Some government officials or carpet 
magnates routinely cite such legislation to maintain that, since child labor is 
illegal, it cannot exist. But it is readily evident that the laws are massively 
flouted. 
</P>
<P>
 N.C. Lamichhane, member secretary of Nepal's Carpet and Wool Development 
Board, a quasi-governmental body, adopts a franker approach than most. "We 
never say we don't have child labor," Lamichhane said. "We do. Our study shows 
it is 11% (of what he said was a 200,000-member work force). That's due to our 
poverty."  
</P>
<P>
 It's also due, he acknowledged during an interview, to government connivance 
with factory owners over the years to ignore violations of child-labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In developing societies, it should be noted, child labor has ardent defenders 
with plausible arguments. Alka Raghuvanshi, arts editor of the Indian newspaper 
The Pioneer, says: "It is important to remember that child labor, as it is 
understood in the West, is not applicable in the Indian context. . . . If a 
child is helping his father on the loom or the wheel, is he or she to be 
considered child labor?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who clamor that all children should be educated, Raghuvanshi cites 
the sad example of the weavers of Andhra Pradesh, who after a few flush years 
sent their children to school. Even with diplomas, the students couldn't find 
jobs, she said. And they hadn't served the long apprenticeships needed to 
become top-notch silk weavers. They ended up, she said, making cheap towels and 
loincloths. 
</P>
<P>
 Third World countries also have viewed with suspicion Western campaigns such 
as the Brussels-based labor confederation's to eradicate child labor and 
improve the lot of their work force, considering them a masked attempt to wipe 
out one of the few advantages they enjoy in an increasingly global economy: low 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in the poorest of countries, for many children, the possibilities 
outside of employment are often scant. School exists for the lucky few. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a child is not employed, it will beg, or lie in the street, or use drugs," 
contended Lama, the owner of Meena's factory, as he stood in the middle of a 
garage where finished carpets were stacked for export. 
</P>
<P>
 Lama thinks the government should supply teachers to instruct children at the 
factories so that they can learn and earn at the same time. The 2% export tax 
he has to pay on his carpets could be applied to pay for the program, he 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepal's carpet industry was growing at a feverish rate, reaching 30% to 40% 
per year, but the breakneck pace seems to have ended this year. One reason 
appears to be a devastating eight-minute expose aired on German television last 
April that reported that 90% of Nepal's export carpets were woven by children 
working in conditions akin to slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wreaking havoc," complained B.P. Khanal, spokesman for the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carpet Board's Lamichhane denies that but concedes that export growth has 
slowed in the last 10 months to about 8%. And he knows his industry has taken a 
painful public-relations hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trade is 100% export-oriented. Unless the foreigners buy, we can't sell," 
he says. "And who is buying our carpets? The young generation. And they are 
very serious about such issues." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, U.S. diplomats in Katmandu say they have warned the Nepalese 
that unless they adhere to their own ban on child labor, they could have 
problems in foreign markets. Mounting consumer awareness is one reason. Another 
is a bill introduced by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), that would ban U.S. imports 
from industries employing child labor. The bill is awaiting action in the 
Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepalese carpets had been assessed a 5.1% duty in the United States, but since 
July 1, they have been allowed in tariff-free on the strength of the Nepalese 
government's certification that the carpets are indeed made by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 American buyers now absorb less than 2% of the Nepali output. Ironically, just 
as the opportunity dawns for the Nepalese to sell more carpets in the United 
States, their product may be getting the same politically unsavory reputation 
that non-union-picked grapes or lettuce once had. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nepalese think this is a problem fomented by their competitors and it 
will go away," a U.S. diplomat said with a disbelieving shake of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 After the German telecast, the Nepalese Ministry of Labor mounted a loudly 
advertised crackdown on underage workers, with at least 150 factories 
reportedly visited by government inspections. "Seventy-five percent of the 
children employed in the industry have now left," Lamichhane claimed last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meena and her friends have had a different view of the purported crackdown. 
When the first government inspector they had ever seen showed up at their 
factory in early June, "he went right to the office," the girls said. "He never 
looked at us." 
</P>
<P>
 As they talked with a visitor to their ABC lesson, one teen-aged mother nursed 
a baby she would later place in a sling by her loom. Their ramshackle dwelling 
lay down a dirt road in one of Nepal's most historic towns, temple-rich 
Bhaktapur, 10 miles east of Katmandu, where Bernardo Bertolucci filmed some of 
the scenes for his visually stunning epic "Little Buddha." Little of that 
beauty rubs off on the carpet makers' lives. Their workday world is the 
factory, the squalid dorm, a solitary water pipe in the smelly courtyard and an 
outdoor privy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the cycle of child labor that Meena is caught in could 
continue indefinitely because of Nepal's poverty and the lack of many real 
employment alternatives. But Lamichhane is skeptical. Unlike many government 
officials and carpet manufacturers, who are portrayed by Katmandu-based 
diplomats as consummate ditherers, the carpet board official dreads the 
possibility of a Western boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our major industries are tourism and carpets," he says. "If we are not 
careful, we'll lose both. We must do something." 
</P>
<P>
 His suggestion, similar to a plan already being implemented in India, is a 
label certifying that a carpet was not made with the labor of children (that 
is, children under 14) and that the dyestuffs used are environmentally 
friendly. The German-Nepalese Chamber of Commerce has endorsed such a plan, and 
the Harkin bill also has a "child labor-free" labeling scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Nepal, however, putting such a project into execution is problematic. Many 
doubt the government or the factory owners can be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an agreement already with our buyer that we will have no child labor 
in our products," Lama, Meena's boss, maintains. It's not clear whether he's 
trying to deceive or doesn't know he has 13-year-olds in his own 150-member 
labor force. In any event, he was able to ship 80,000 square feet of rugs to 
Germany last year without any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Meena lives and works with two older sisters, so her life is not as lonely as 
some children's. The girls have been home only once in the past year, for a 
religious festival in October. It took them a day on a bus and two days walking 
through the hills to reach their native village in the Ramechap district. 
</P>
<P>
 Like her friends, Meena would like to go home for good but says she has no 
other skills besides tying yarn into carpets. At 13, she already seems to be 
worried about how she will earn her way in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor asks her how she would change life in the factory if she were the 
owner. The girl is silent a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Meena finally says, she can't imagine being the boss. Warning: Children at 
Work 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some examples of developing countries that use child labor, as 
reported by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. 
</P>
<P>
 INDIA: A quarter of the world's child labor force is said to be in India. 
About 1 out of 4 children ages 5 to 15 reportedly are working. The total is 
thought to be between 17.5 million and 44 million. Legislation in 1986 banned 
child labor, but some employers openly defy the law. 
</P>
<P>
 MEXICO: Children under 14 are banned from working. Children 15 and 16 may work 
up to six hours a day, provided they don't work overtime or at night. 
Enforcement seems reasonably adequate for large and medium-sized companies, but 
less certain for small ones. There are significant numbers of underage street 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 NEPAL: The law allows employment of minors at age 16 in industry and 14 in 
agriculture, but for not more than 36 hours per week. Some government officials 
and carpet magnates routinely say that since child labor is illegal, it cannot 
exist. But it is clear that the law is massively flouted. 
</P>
<P>
 PHILIPPINES: The constitution forbids employment of children under 15 except 
under the responsibility of parents or guardians, and then only if the work 
does not interfere with schooling. But children as young as 4 were found 
working in factories. Many children work in the garment industry, making 
women's clothing and lingerie for European multinationals.

ETHNIC DISCORD; HOPE MAY BE TOO LATE COMING TO BUKHARA JEWS; REVIVAL OF 
SYNAGOGUE CLOSED UNDER STALIN IS A POSITIVE SIGN BUT NOT ENOUGH TO STOP EXODUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN MacWILLIAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An unmarked doorway in a dusty alley opens into one of this ancient Central 
Asian city's two synagogues. In the open courtyard, a young Israeli teacher 
instructs a small gathering of adults about Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
 Against one wall are piled hundreds of old religious books, awaiting proper 
storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the books of our ancestors," said a student. "When people emigrate, 
they can't take them, so they leave them here." 
</P>
<P>
 This synagogue in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, closed in 1930 
during dictator Josef Stalin's anti-religious campaigns, reopened three years 
ago and is in the final stages of redecoration. It is known as the Young 
Synagogue; Bukhara's main synagogue stayed open during the Stalin era. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Bukhara Jews, an ancient community that has inhabited Central Asia for 
centuries, the restored synagogue is a hopeful sign. But for many, it has come 
too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bukhara Jews are packing their bags, leaving their ancestral homeland in 
search of a better life in America and Israel. More than 20,000 have left in 
the past three years, about half headed for each country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a chain reaction," said Rabbi Itskhak Abramov. "People leave 
because their mother or brother or sister has left. If somebody has a good life 
over there, they invite their relatives to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Soviet Union broke up three years ago, Jews have left in huge 
numbers. But while the pace of emigration from Russia has slowed in recent 
months, the tide is still rising in Central Asia, riding a frothy crest of 
nationalism, resurgent Islam, war and poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukhara Jews are leaving faster than anyone else. "It is quite possible that, 
within a few years, there won't be any left," said Leonid Stonov, a human 
rights activist in Moscow for the U.S.-based Union of Councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Asia is a vast region of mountains, deserts and oases between European 
Russia and South Asia. Its caravan cities grew rich in the Middle Ages on the 
Silk Road trade between Asia and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish traders first came to the region through Persia. They flourished as 
merchants and cloth dyers, cobblers and barbers in all the major cities of 
Central Asia. Some were cosmopolitan, as shown by a dictionary they published 
in 1907 in six languages -- Persian, Arabic, Turkish, French, Russian and 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Jews suffered various restrictions imposed by the despotic emirs of Bukhara 
but did well in the 19th Century under the Russian Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1917 Revolution, the Soviet government closed the borders, ending 
the trade that was the lifeblood of the Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukhara Jews still live scattered throughout Central Asia, but their three 
biggest communities are in the ancient cities of Bukhara, Samarkand and 
Tashkent. Their mother tongue is a dialect of Persian, unlike the European 
Jews, who came to Central Asia after the Russian conquest and usually speak 
Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim majority in Bukhara and Samarkand consists of Turkic-speaking 
Uzbeks and Persian-speaking Tajiks. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 3,000 to 4,000 Jews are left in Bukhara, and most are already 
making plans to join relatives in Israel or New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bukharans have been living in Jerusalem since the 1890s, and in New York, a 
small community has grown up in the Forest Hills section of Queens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner from Bukhara's main synagogue is the small Jewish cultural 
center. Jews who are preparing to leave for America gather there in the 
evenings to study English. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many problems here and no future, not just for our children but 
even for us," said Alexander Tamayev, 40, who is bound for Queens this summer. 
"And everybody's relatives are in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Khaimov, 38, hopes to leave for New York this fall with six other 
family members, to join three relatives who are already there. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has been granted refugee status by the U.S. government and will be 
sponsored by Khaimov's brother, who left Bukhara four years ago. The brother 
went with his wife, who had been sponsored by her parents, who had gone 
previously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't sponsor anyone," Khaimov said with a smile. "I'm the last." 
</P>
<P>
 Buying a plane ticket out isn't easy in Uzbekistan, where the average monthly 
salary amounts to less than $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who go must sell or leave behind most of their possessions. Customs 
rules are obscure, and officials often do not allow antiques or valuables to 
leave the country, or expect to receive a bribe to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have lived well and who have a lot of jewelry and antiques cannot 
take them to another country, so they must sell them here cheap, and they 
arrive poor," Tamayev said. "It depends on the customs officer. If he wants, I 
can take five suits. If he doesn't want, I can take only one." 
</P>
<P>
 Uzbekistan's post-Communist property laws are still unclear. Some emigrants 
are told by local officials they must sell their houses before they leave, or 
else their unoccupied property will be taken over by the government. This 
forces them to sell cheaply and leaves them nowhere to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'm afraid," said Zina Khaimov, Rafael's wife. "I'll lose 
everything, and there we have nothing. We'll have to start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Zina Khaimov is a nurse and Rafael a pediatrician, but both will have to 
undergo years of study before being allowed to practice their professions in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few Jewish community leaders who are staying put is Mikhail Abramov 
of Samarkand University, a historian of the Bukhara Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 He lives in an old house in Samarkand's Jewish quarter that is beautifully 
decorated in the traditional style, with carved wooden columns and pictures of 
Jerusalem painted on wall panels under an ornate ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 His family came to Samarkand in 1846 via Kabul, Afghanistan, after fleeing 
Iran during a period when Jews were being forced to convert to Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Abramov says he would leave for Israel if he could take his library of 
6,000 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wouldn't be allowed to take more than a few, so I have to stay," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how many Bukhara Jews remain in Central Asia is unclear, but estimates 
range between 6,000 and 13,000. Most of the Jewish community has already left 
Uzbekistan's poor mountainous neighbor, Tajikistan, since a bloody civil war 
began in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ethnic groups, including ethnic Russians, are also leaving, prompted by 
rising nationalism, an economic crisis, inflation, shortages of everything and 
the belief that opportunity and tolerance for minorities will be limited in the 
independent Central Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Bukhara Jews eventually disappear entirely from their ancestral 
homeland? 
</P>
<P>
 "In Israel, they say that, in five years, there will be no more Jews in 
Bukhara," said Zelman Dabakarov, 26, the young Israeli teaching religion in the 
refurbished Young Synagogue in Bukhara. 
</P>
<P>
 But some see new opportunities in the post-Soviet period. Itskhak Abramov was 
a carpenter until the Young Synagogue reopened in 1991 and he became its rabbi. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to predict whether all the Jews will leave," he said. "Only 
God knows. We want to live here. That's why we're rebuilding this synagogue."

THE WEEK AHEAD: PASADENA; CELESTIAL SPECTACULAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astronomers around the world will strain Saturday for a glimpse of a rare 
celestial event: the collision between a comet and the planet Jupiter. Several 
hundred scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena will be 
involved, including those working with the Galileo spacecraft, which will have 
the closest view of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 For five days, a stream of 21 mountain-sized fragments that form the comet 
Shoemaker-Levy 9 will streak into the giant planet's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists aren't sure what will be visible to Earth-based observatories. But 
they hope for an interplanetary light show that will yield new insights into 
celestial cataclysms that have scarred the planets of the solar system over the 
eons and, on Earth, may have wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

POSTSCRIPT; CHILEANS CAN GO HOME AGAIN, BUT IT'S NOT EASY; WITH DEMOCRACY 
RESTORED, EXILES ARE RETURNING. BUT DESPITE GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE HELP, SOME 
FIND THE ADJUSTMENT DIFFICULT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Gen. Augusto Pinochet seized power in 1973 and imposed the harsh 
dictatorship that was to send more than 200,000 Chileans fleeing into exile, 
Roberto Carcamo was only a child. But when Carcamo grew up, he also fled. 
</P>
<P>
 His activities as a member of a Socialist youth organization had gotten him in 
trouble with the police. He spent nine years in Norway before returning to 
Chile in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Chilean exiles have put down permanent roots abroad after years in the 
diaspora. But thousands, like Carcamo, have yielded to the age-old tug of 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our culture makes us return," said Carcamo, 33. "My roots, my language, my 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The returning exiles are known as los retornados . While their homecoming may 
not be as wrenching and tumultuous as their exodus was, it is a mass migration 
filled with human drama, historical significance and metaphorical meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 If the exiles were living sparks thrown out into the world by Chile's 
political firestorms, the retornados are the harbingers of Chilean freedom and 
reconciliation, coming back like swallows in the spring as repression eased 
near the dictatorship's end. And they have kept flocking in during the four 
years since democracy's return. An estimated 80,000 exiles are back so far. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most prominent is Hortensia Bussi de Allende, widow of the Socialist 
president who died in the 1973 coup. Other retornados have become Cabinet 
ministers and members of Congress. And those who have achieved notable success 
in business include the president of the Chilean Telephone Co., one of the 
country's biggest corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 For many returnees, however, coming home is harder than they imagined. Finding 
work and housing are big problems. Many who lived in Europe or North America 
have trouble readjusting to life in a developing country. They often say they 
feel like strangers in their own land. Some have encountered discrimination. 
More than a few have decided to leave Chile again. 
</P>
<P>
 If they go, of course, they do not receive benefits that have been provided 
for Chilean refugees during the past two decades by numerous countries. In 
fact, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued a formal 
recommendation in May that governments end refugee status for Chileans. That 
step may influence more Chilean exiles to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chilean government, international agencies and non-governmental 
organizations have developed programs to assist the returnees. But now, some of 
those programs are being phased out. A special government bureau created for 
that purpose is preparing to shut down. Those who do not return by August, 
1995, will receive no U.N. aid for the move. 
</P>
<P>
 With the consolidation of freedom and democracy in Chile, officials say, it is 
time to acknowledge that Chilean expatriates no longer deserve the special 
treatment offered to those who left because of political persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all benefits for returnees will end, but because they are being cut back, 
officials fear a rush of new retornados seeking to receive the benefits while 
they last. 
</P>
<P>
 Retornados formed a line one recent afternoon in the waiting room of the 
National Return Office, the government agency that coordinates aid. They were 
there to ask for help -- in getting official documents in order, getting their 
belongings through customs, finding work, and obtaining housing, legal aid and 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Carcamo and his wife were in the line. The onetime Socialist militant was 
seeking help to go into business, applying for technical aid and a low-interest 
loan to start a private home for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't with the goal of becoming a capitalist and a big businessman," 
Carcamo said. "It's just to survive, to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The National Return Office and other agencies have helped more than 1,000 
returnees start small businesses. "There are shoemaking businesses, photo 
shops, many medical centers," said Carlos Espinoza, assistant director of the 
Return Office. "There are restaurants, stores, accounting services." 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Aravena, who was exiled in neighboring Argentina, joined forces with two 
retornados from Mexico to start a Mexican restaurant. Called Las Mananitas, the 
restaurant has become well known and fashionable since it opened in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God, here we are," said Aravena, 41. "I think we're doing pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Daville, 56, isn't doing so well. Daville returned from Brazil early 
this year with hopes of starting a metalworking shop. He has been offered a 
low-interest loan from the Chilean state bank, but he has been unable to find a 
co-signer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a stranger here now -- no one knows me," Daville said. "If no one knows 
you, who is going to give you an opportunity?" 
</P>
<P>
 Daville said he came back because "you miss many things, the culture, the 
customs, the food." But Chile has changed since he left in 1975, he said. "Now 
people are all materialistic. No one lends a hand." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would return to Brazil if it weren't for his wife and daughter, who 
want to stay in Chile. "I have work in Brazil, but my family is here now." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have returned without their children, who have grown up and married 
abroad. "When these people come back after 20 years, they have more loved ones 
where they came from than here, and they get depressed," said Espinoza at the 
Return Office. "It is like starting a second exile." 
</P>
<P>
 The Return Office was created by Congress in 1990 with the stipulation that it 
would be disbanded after four years. Six branch offices in the provinces have 
closed in recent weeks, and the main office in Santiago is to shut down Aug. 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza said a wave of new returnees is expected as exiles rush to make it 
back in time to receive the office's help. "Right now many are coming back from 
the United States," he added. Although the United States gave official refugee 
status to only 350 Chilean exiles, Espinoza said up to 25,000 Chileans live 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 He calculated that at least 8,000 retornados will arrive before the Return 
Office closes. That would bring the total since the early 1980s to about 
88,000, according to Espinoza's calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 But that will not conclude the return migration movement, he predicted. He 
estimated that about 220,000 people went into exile after the 1973 coup, and 
many more are likely to return. "We don't think we have solved the problem, 
only pointed the way, because the problem of returning will never end," he 
said. His office is preparing recommendations for continuing aid to returnees 
by other government agencies and non-governmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is concerned about this," he said. "It is looking for a way to 
continue helping and supporting these people who want to return to the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 He observed that many exiles have professional and technical education and 
experience that could be valuable for Chile's development. A 1991 law provides 
for revalidation of professional degrees earned in foreign universities. "We 
recently validated professional No. 1,000," Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governments of Germany, the Netherlands and Norway have helped create 
employment in Chile for 10,000 retornados by subsidizing their salaries so that 
business could afford to hire them. But there are other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Reveco, director of research and projects in a foundation that helps 
retornados, said many Chilean business people have looked with suspicion on 
returnee job applicants because of their leftist past. "A retornado for them is 
a little bit outside the law," said Reveco. 
</P>
<P>
 His foundation, called FARET, has organized seminars for business people with 
the goal of changing that image. As a result, he said, many employers now 
realize that returnee workers often bring modern technology and disciplined 
work habits acquired abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, finding a job can be hard because returnees lack connections. "Here in 
Chile, everything works through connections," he said. "If you don't have 
connections, doors don't open." 
</P>
<P>
 Reveco, 48, is a retornado himself. After arriving from France in 1991, where 
he worked with the United Nations as an economist, he spent two years looking 
unsuccessfully for a job in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think that when you come back to your country, everything will be easier, 
and really, it's harder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 FARET has worked with the National Return Office and other agencies to provide 
returnees with counseling, health care, legal aid, job training and business 
help. The foundation is now designing new projects and seeking new sponsors.  
</P>
<P>
 Much assistance for retornados has been channeled through the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM), a worldwide agency formed by 52 member 
governments. With funds from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and other 
sources, the IOM has arranged free transportation to Chile for 15,000 returnees 
and provided temporary medical insurance and other assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Veglia, an IOM official in Chile, said funds are running out. In the 
future, he said, the IOM will work only with retornados from countries that 
contribute funds. And the Chilean office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees, which provides money for the transportation of returnees to Chile, 
has announced that Chilean exiles who want free plane tickets home must apply 
before August and move before August, 1995. After that, the commission will 
provide no assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice came with the recommendation that countries end refugee status for 
Chilean exiles except in special cases. "It no longer considers that 
international protection needs to be given, because the causes no longer 
exist," said Helena Reutersward, the commissioner's liaison officer in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Reutersward said each country will decide whether to comply with the 
recommendation and whether to offer Chilean exiles resident status or help them 
return to Chile. "Our intention is not to obligate people to return," she said, 
but she acknowledged that the measures may result in increased numbers of 
returnees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can see that there is a tendency to increase, but we don't see that there 
will be an enormous avalanche," she said.

but he kept his camera focused on the four Tutsis who had been stopped in 
Rwanda and were sitting together under a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, a group of Hutu villagers wandered over and began beating the 
four men and women with sticks. They beat them until they were dead. Then, as 
Strieker's camera rolled on, several Hutu boys beheaded the corpses with their 
machetes and wiped the bloody blades on their pants as unemotionally as if they 
were doing the laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Strieker, CNN's Nairobi bureau chief and a former Citibank executive in 
Africa, has been covering wars from Liberia to Somalia for the past nine years 
but has never seen a conflict like Rwanda's, in which death is so intimate and 
filmable and is carried out, neighbor against neighbor, in such a casual 
manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has had occasion to wonder, as have other Africa-based journalists, 
why the world found this particular tragedy so compelling while many other 
African conflicts -- particularly ones that do not involve a Western power -- 
earn nary a mention in newspapers and on TV in Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, more than 100,000 Tutsis were murdered in Burundi, Rwanda's 
neighbor, with rampaging mobs wielding machetes, but the slaughter received no 
more than a paragraph or two in most newspapers. And while scores of 
journalists have chronicled the plight of 300,000 Hutu refugees on the 
Tanzanian-Rwandan border, other huge concentrations of misplaced Africans on 
the continent have never been covered at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the sheer magnitude and vividness of the massacre explains, in 
part, why Rwanda has been in the news while other African tragedies have gone 
by almost unnoticed," Strieker said. "But the more I think about it, the more I 
think it has a lot to do with the presence of so many journalists in South 
Africa for the election." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers agree. To them Rwanda says a great deal about the vagaries of 
covering Africa and the power of television in determining which events receive 
wide coverage and which don't. Stories that confirm the notion of Africa as a 
primitive place -- be it the brutality of Uganda's deposed dictator Idi Amin or 
rebels cutting off the ears of Liberia's late leader Samuel Doe -- 
traditionally have found a broader audience than those dealing with political, 
economic or social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Rwandan bodies started floating down the Kagera River and into 
Lake Victoria, in May, two widely covered events in Africa had become 
journalistic non-events: The Americans had pulled out of Somalia, ending 
interest there although the killing continued, and the huge international press 
corps that had descended on South Africa expecting to cover a civil war found 
little left to report when the elections came off peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda was where everyone headed. Unlike those in Burundi, where the October 
massacres were carried out in countryside that was difficult to reach, the 
killing fields of Rwanda were accessible. They reached from Kigali, the 
capital, to the interior where the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front 
assigned press officers to border crossings to escort journalists to massacre 
sites. Convenience of access became an important element in the widespread 
attention Rwanda would receive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The killing in Rwanda is no different than what has gone on for years, with 
machetes, with neighbors slaughtering neighbors, in Rwanda and Burundi," said 
Mohammed Amin, Africa bureau chief for Reuters Television and a legendary 
combat cameraman in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember sitting here 15 or 20 years, trying to 'sell' a story on 
massacres in Rwanda or Burundi to some editor in London, and there'd be no 
interest. They wouldn't want to spend the money to cover the story. No one 
cares about more killing in Africa, they'd say." 
</P>
<P>
 But Amin believes times have changed because the electronic media, with their 
instant satellite communications, now often dictate what African stories 
receive worldwide attention. It is the vivid TV images from Africa that set the 
news agenda and give the initial exposure to an event that eventually leads to 
an international humanitarian or military response. 
</P>
<P>
 Amin, who lost his left arm after being wounded in the Ethiopian war three 
years ago, recalls TV's role in exposing the 1983-85 famine in Ethiopia. The 
government had denied its existence, and a handful of newspaper stories on the 
famine had received scant attention. NBC and the BBC initially rejected a 
five-minute piece Amin had done for Visnews on starving Ethiopians. But when 
the BBC did air the piece on its noon news, as a virtual filler on a slow news 
day in October, 1984, the international reaction was immediate and 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists from around the world began pouring into Ethiopia, and within days 
international relief agencies had mounted one of the largest humanitarian 
efforts in African history. The famine, which claimed hundreds of thousands of 
Ethiopian lives, was one of the most widely covered African stories of the 
decade and played a role in the eventual downfall of Ethiopia's Communist 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Ethiopia was similar to Rwanda today," Amin said, "in that the pictures 
create the demand for more pictures and the news coverage feeds on itself as 
more journalists write more stories that end up eliciting a response from the 
United Nations or whomever. But I think it's quite possible that if there 
hadn't been such vivid pictures from Rwanda early on, the massacre might have 
gone largely unreported."

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; TWO U.S. ASTRONAUTS LEARNING TO SAY 'BEAM ME UP' IN 
RUSSIAN; THE PAIR ARE STUDYING HARD TO BECOME THE FIRST AMERICANS TO FLY TO THE 
MIR SPACE STATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Compared to mastering what's known as "the great and mighty Russian language," 
flying a Soviet-designed rocket to the Mir space station and spending three 
months in space will be a cinch. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that is how it looks these days to veteran U.S. astronauts Norman 
Thagard and Bonnie Dunbar, in training since March to become the first 
Americans to fly to the Mir next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the first grade and grad school at the same time," Dunbar said 
recently, referring to the combination of elementary Russian and advanced space 
science that makes up her day. "The language is the biggest impediment -- 
getting past the language." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian is no polyglot's picnic. The endings of nouns change, letters mutate 
unexpectedly and the basic vocabulary has little in common with English. If it 
is enough to make college students break into a sweat, think of the language 
stress involved for Thagard, 50, and Dunbar, 45, whose lives could at some 
point depend on understanding a Russian command or warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no alternative to knowing Russian by the time we fly," Thagard, a 
physician, said with grim determination. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first-string astronaut -- Dunbar, a biomedical engineer, is his backup 
-- Thagard expects to fly to the Mir with two cosmonauts next March and then 
spend three months there with its Russian crew. That would be longer than any 
American has spent in space. The NASA record, set in 1973-74 aboard Skylab, is 
84 days; the Russians set the world record of 366 days aboard Mir in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is notable in other ways too. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans and Russians haven't worked so closely together in space since the 
U.S. Apollo spacecraft linked up with the Soviet ship Soyuz in 1975. Thagard 
will blast off in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft but expects to fly home on the 
American shuttle Atlantis, which will attempt to dock at the Mir. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the first time that NASA will have a chance to do comparably 
serious in-orbit research on the physical effects of extended space travel 
since Skylab. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the American trip to Mir, combined with a reciprocal program for 
cosmonauts to fly on American space shuttles, will help lay the groundwork for 
the ultimate in U.S.-Russian space cooperation: an international space station, 
expected to begin construction in 1997 and to be known as Alpha. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming at the end of the Cold War, we're forging a new relationship," Dunbar 
said, and "we (two) just come as part of a big program." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair talk like the government employees they are, in diplomatic tones 
devoid of hype or even much excitement about the drama of their circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But drama there is, if only in that they are pioneers in America's 
acquaintance with Russian cosmonauts and are paying the typical pioneer's price 
in discomfort, isolation and fear of pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The two live about 20 miles from Moscow in a characteristic Soviet-era 
high-rise apartment building in the campus-like town of Zvyozdny Gorodok, or 
Star City, former home to the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin. As in most of 
these buildings, the elevator can break down, and the hot water sometimes goes 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Thagard was joined just recently by his wife and 14-year-old son, but Dunbar 
remains half a world away from her husband, astronaut Ronald Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls can be problematic; poor Soviet phone lines make connections iffy, 
and the satellite phone they have with them is too expensive to use much. 
</P>
<P>
 Both describe the reception they have received from their Russian colleagues 
as "cordial" but do not sound as if they have been given any star treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, they have also not been hampered by security restrictions, 
unlike their American predecessors at Star City -- three astronauts who visited 
occasionally to work on the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The only warning the astronauts have received, Thagard said, is not to take 
the electric train from Star City to Moscow -- a ride often populated by drunks 
and toughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're worried a lot about our safety," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two astronauts have also chosen not to drive in Russia because the traffic 
rules are slightly different from those in the United States. Instead, they use 
Russian drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they were asked, you're brave enough to face the perils of space but not 
the perils of Moscow's roads? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no avoiding the risks of riding a rocket," Thagard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts must face another great challenge before entering space: oral 
exams at the end of their training, all in Russian, an ordeal that has no 
parallel in National Aeronautics and Space Administration training. 
</P>
<P>
 They also cope daily with lectures in Russian on the technical aspects of 
their work. Thagard, who had already studied some Russian, does much of the 
translating for Dunbar. When he gets stuck, a Russian translator steps in. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the studies are not conceptually hard for them. "The principles 
are pretty straightforward whether you're flying here or there," Dunbar said. 
"Physics is physics, and chemistry is chemistry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither would nibble at questions about whether Russian equipment is more 
primitive than its U.S. equivalent. Thagard repeated that "the fundamental 
problem is one of language, not technology." 
</P>
<P>
 A typical day for the pair might include four hours of Russian and two hours 
of practicing on a Soyuz simulator; or two hours of studying the Mir's 
life-support systems, some independent study, two hours of familiarizing 
themselves with the Mir and two hours of serious physical workout. 
</P>
<P>
 They have also experienced the special Russian psychological training for 
long-haul space crews, which the astronauts said consists largely of yoga 
relaxation techniques. In the fall, they will begin working with their future 
flight crews. 
</P>
<P>
 Thagard's research aboard the Mir will focus on the effects of prolonged space 
travel on the human body, in hopes of finding more ways to stem the bone loss 
and deterioration of the cardiovascular system that come with prolonged 
weightlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian doctors have been testing cosmonauts during the eight years that Mir 
has been in orbit, but they did before-and-after comparisons rather than 
in-flight exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the most extensive metabolic study in space," Thagard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic of the joint project works like this: America has the space shuttle, 
which can deliver cargo loads easily, but has no space station to fly it to, 
while the U.S. shuttles offer Russia improved cargo capacity to and from its 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much a mutually cooperative program," Dunbar said. Four other 
astronauts will follow Thagard and Dunbar to Star City for training in coming 
months, and 10 shuttle-Mir dockings are planned.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunbar and Thagard are already planning the friendly gesture to cement that 
cooperation. When they return from their flight, Thagard said, they will lay 
flowers at Star City's monument to Yuri Gagarin -- just as all the other 
cosmonauts do.

EXPLOITERS WON'T GET THIS ACTIVIST'S MARK; INDIA'S KAILASH SATYARTHI HAS 
DEVISED A LABEL CERTIFYING THAT A CARPET WAS MADE WITHOUT CHILD LABOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 14 years ago that Kailash Satyarthi and his followers began staging 
daring raids on Indian workplaces to free children who were being treated 
little better than slaves. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the tall, bearded activist from central India estimates, he has 
helped retrieve 25,000 children, including 7,000 from the carpet industry, and 
reunited them with their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not enough, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, muses the chairman of the South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude 
(SACCS), he would go to a station to catch the train home after raiding a 
carpet manufacturing plant in Uttar Pradesh state, where children are forced to 
work no less than 12 and as many as 20 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeling pleased with himself for having freed 10 children, Satyarthi would 
then watch, aghast, as a labor broker arrived in Varanasi or Mirzapur on an 
inbound train with 50 new youngsters to satisfy the industry's endless hunger 
for labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are freeing children at the cost of our lives, but the number of child 
laborers keeps rising," Satyarthi says. When he speaks of the risks involved, 
he is not speaking idly. Two of his comrades have been killed -- one shot to 
death, the other beaten so badly he succumbed to his injuries. Employers, or 
their agents, were to blame, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution to India's child labor problems, the coalition's founder has 
concluded, lies not in India but in the United States and other foreign 
countries that buy 98% of India's carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Germany, he noticed during a 1990 visit, tomatoes are labeled to alert the 
consumer that they are environment-friendly and healthy. "I said, 'If you are 
so concerned about your health and environment, why not show the same concern 
for children?' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this year, Satyarthi expects the result of his lobbying, 
negotiating and coalition-building involving Indian and foreign grass-roots 
organizations and charities to be available to consumers in Europe and North 
America: a label, called the "rugmark," certifying that a carpet was made 
without child labor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All other carpets from India and neighboring Nepal and Pakistan should be 
boycotted, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put your legs on a beautiful Indian carpet, you are crushing the 
backbone of a child," he insists. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 Indian carpet makers have agreed to the rugmark scheme, Satyarthi 
said in a recent interview at his group's New Delhi headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The cooperating companies have provided a list of their weaving units so that 
inspectors from his group can verify that no children are employed on their 
premises. That's necessary, he says with a wry smile, because the industry 
can't be trusted to police itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the All India Carpet Manufacturers Assn. talked about putting on the 
label, I was 100% sure that not only would it be a fake label but that they 
would build a new factory to make it where children would be employed," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The rugmark, Satyarthi says, will be awarded by an independent body that 
includes representatives of carpet manufacturers and exporters; 
non-governmental social service organizations; U.N. agencies such as UNICEF and 
the International Labor Organization, and the Indo-German Export Promotion 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it is going to function," Satyarthi said with confidence of his 
brainchild. "We are sure that the Americans and Europeans will find labeled 
carpets in their shops by Christmas." Others involved in the program said 
Satyarthi's timetable might be optimistic, but they agreed it is only a matter 
of time before the rugmark reaches stores in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 SACCS, which comprises about four dozen organizations in South Asia, estimates 
that 80 million young children are working in India, Nepal, Pakistan and 
Bangladesh. As children and families have migrated to the cities over the past 
15 years or so, they have met the growing employment needs of the region's 
export industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governments need dollars at any cost. So they give these industries all 
possible facilities, legally and sometimes illegally," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Satyarthi has heard the arguments in favor of child labor, including those 
made by free-market advocates, and thinks they are all moonshine. "The 
relationship isn't capitalist, one of employee to employer. It's feudal," he 
says. "The child is like a slave." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, when the Indian carpet industry was exporting $100 million worth 
of production, a commissioner of the Supreme Court of India estimated it was 
employing 75,000 to 100,000 children. Now exports have tripled and so has the 
number of child weavers, to an estimated 350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase has come in spite of a 1986 law, the Child Labor Regulation and 
Prohibition Act, that bans employment of children in dangerous or 
health-endangering industries, including carpet manufacturing. Similar 
legislation to protect children under age 14 exists in the other countries of 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a single violator of the 1986 act has been punished," Satyarthi says. 
"Not a single person has been imprisoned in India or Pakistan under such laws." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the lack of official and public concern in India, he believes, 
is that most of the bonded children are from the loathed untouchable caste or 
from equally low-status tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Satyarthi made his first raid on a carpet factory. Thirty-two 
children ages 6 to 12 from the village of Chichori in Bihar, India's poorest 
state, had been procured by middlemen who offered a bit of money to their 
parents, then whisked the youngsters away. When the children rebelled at having 
to work long hours for little or no pay, they were branded with red-hot irons 
or hung upside down from trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such raids, he says, may be the only way to guarantee the youngsters a few 
years of normal childhood. "If a child has become a carpet weaver, the master 
never lets him go unless he falls sick," Satyarthi says. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, he says, after seven to eight years of intensive weaving work, the 
children's eyesight becomes impaired, and they have inhaled so much woolen 
fluff that their lungs are damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being able to count on his own group's courageous if piecemeal efforts -- 
and seeing government as too often a crony of the carpet makers -- Satyarthi is 
now banking on Western consumers to help release hundreds of thousands of 
Indian children from bondage by making child-woven carpets impossible to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people can be so concerned about fur," he asks, "why not about children?"

SPEAKING OF; INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the globe, millions of people are on the move. Today, about 100 million 
live outside their countries of birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Their motives are many, but the most popular one is economic opportunity. 
Refugees fleeing war or persecution doubled in number in the turbulent 1980s, 
but they still represent only a minority of all migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the discoveries in a new report, "Global Migration: People 
on the Move," by Population Action International in Washington, D.C. The report 
tells who is going where--and why. 
</P>
<P>
 There's plenty to keep track of. The number of long-term migrants from 
developing to developed countries has mushroomed four-fold since the the early 
1960s, the study says. The engine of this trend is inequality: Rich nations got 
richer over the decades while poor nations fared poorly or stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
 Political conflict, labor surpluses, exhaused farm land and government 
policies aimed at family unification also cause migration. 
</P>
<P>
 To put it all in perspective, though, migrants represent only 2% of the 
world's population. Most people never leave their home country. TYPES OF 
MIGRATION 
</P>
<P>
 * Between wealthy nations 
</P>
<P>
 Migration of workers between industrialized countries is growing, especially 
in Western Europe, where the emergence of the European Union has blurred 
traditional political and economic boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 * To wealthier nations 
</P>
<P>
 The number of long-term migrants from developing to developed countries 
increased from about 230,000 a year in the early 1960s to roughly 940,000 by 
the late 1980s. Today North America, especially the United States, is the 
greatest magnet. In Europe, North Africans and Turks moved to France and 
Germany in large numbers in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985, migration to 
Europe has diversified to include Asians and new destinations, such as Italy 
and Spain, which formerly were sources of migrants. 
</P>
<P>
 * Between developing countries 
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America and Africa, most flows have been between neighboring 
countries. In sub-Saharan Africa at least 10 million people are believed to be 
migrants or refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In Latin America, wealthier countries such as Argentina and Venezuela absorb 
people from nearby nations. WHERE THEY GO 
</P>
<P>
 Often, migrants go right next door--as with Mexicans entering the United 
States. But political and historical ties, such as those between Britain and 
Commonwealth countries, can send people around the world. Culture and language 
also matter; many French-speakers move to France, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal migration in the United States is estimated at about 200,000 to 
300,000 a year, compared to legal immigrants, who in 1992 numbered 974,000.

NATIONS (1992) 
</P>
<P>
 The number of international refugees continued to grow after the Cold War 
ended. Conflicts that followed the collapse of authoritarian regimes in Eastern

 Water Quote -- A story published in Saturday's Times incorrectly quoted the 
Rev. Darrel Meyers, a Van Nuys pastor who recently toured the Middle East. The 
correct quote is, "The average Israeli settler consumes 27 times the amount of 
water that Palestinians use." Meyers also stated that an Israeli foreign 
minister told him half the water in the Gaza Strip is wasted.
