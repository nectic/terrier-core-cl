D.A. ASKED TO INVESTIGATE SUSPECTED VOTER FRAUD; ELECTION: A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF NEW REGISTRATIONS TURNED IN BY 'BOUNTY HUNTERS' APPEAR QUESTIONABLE, 
COUNTY OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>

 Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder Beatriz Valdez on Tuesday said her 
office has uncovered pockets of fraudulent voter registrations in Burbank, 
Pasadena and other locations around the county and she has forwarded the 
results of a preliminary investigation to the district attorney for possible 
criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez found that a quarter of the 143 people registered at one Burbank 
apartment complex by paid agents, known as "bounty hunters" in the political 
campaign trade, were questionable and likely fraudulent. Similar findings were 
uncovered at a Pasadena location. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, only about 4% of registrations are found to be questionable in spot 
checks by the registrar, officials said. Among the reasons for invalidating 
some of the registrations were improper signatures, underage applicants and 
lack of residency or citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 The questionable registration forms from Burbank and Pasadena had been issued 
to the Assembly Statewide Voter Registration Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison Harvey, chief of staff to Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), 
who heads the committee, acknowledged that there may have been a problem with 
two employees identified in the registrar's report. She said the committee had 
not been contacted by either the district attorney or the registrar regarding 
the registrations, but added that the committee will cooperate in any 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another organization investigated by the registrar, the Diverse Strategic 
Organization, also was found to have submitted a high number of improper voter 
registration forms. 
</P>
<P>
 In a check of 1,300 registrations filed by this group, about 12% contained 
incorrect information or listed an unusable address. Nearly 70% of the 
questionnaires mailed by the registrar to check on accuracy of the 
registrations were not returned. That is about double the usual rate, according 
to Darlene Bonds, assistant registrar-recorder, and will be among the 
statistics brought to the attention of the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Griego, who identified himself as the manager of Diverse Strategic, 
would not comment on the registrar's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Field, the deputy district attorney who heads the special investigations 
division that probes public corruption, said he had not yet seen the 
registrar's report, but added, "I'd be very interested to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, the registrar must issue voter registration forms to 
virtually any group that requests them. It is routine to issue thousands of 
cards at a time to these political and civic organizations, according to Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the organizations, including those cited in the report, pay canvassers 
to sign up voters. Often they are paid by the card, or "bounty," as a 
registration form is referred to in the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said that her organization ran about 15 crews of 10 to 12 workers each 
in the state this year, registering 223,540 new voters. Some workers were paid 
a flat rate of $6 an hour, others $2.50 per registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey said her group does a spot check of about 10% of the cards turned in by 
canvassers, to try to weed out problems. "They're stealing from us, too," when 
the canvassers bring in bogus registrations, Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never fails in this sort of drive that someone will do this," said Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who asked the registrar to investigate the 
allegations that were brought to his attention by constituents, said he 
believes the problem is widespread. He said he suspects many illegal immigrants 
are registering to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney has to make this a top priority," said Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harvey said the allegations may be more politically motivated. "We've been 
very successful in registering Democrats this year," said Harvey. "That's why 
they are upset."

 Drive-by humor: Two automobile drivers involved in a wreck at 2nd and Spring 
streets weren't exactly cheered by an MTA bus that passed by. Speaking into his 
microphone, the bus driver blared at them: "You should have taken the 
b-u-u-s-s-s! You should have taken the b-u-u-u-s-s!"

 As a public relations coup for the local transit system, it was every bit as

 A burger and . . . what?All great institutions must change with the times or 
risk withering away. So it is that Tommy's Original World Famous Burgers on 
Beverly Boulevard has started serving french fries, 46 years after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Koulax, the late founder, once said: "French fries would really slow us 
down. Besides, I got no room for a fryer." But there's a recession on now. So, 
a fryer has been installed in a back kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cart french fries up to the front kitchen," said granddaughter Dawna Fyke, 
one of the owners. "We have bins up there that can hold fries for nine 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy wasn't the only landmark holdout. The  
</P>
<P>
 Original Pantry Cafe on Figueroa Street refused to serve soft drinks for its 
first 48 years -- until 1972, when the health-minded founder died. 
</P>
<P>
 And Philippe, near Union Station, banned ketchup for its first 83 years, 
contending that the red stuff had no place on French dip sandwiches. (Sacre 
rouge!)  
</P>
<P>
 Then one day, in 1991, ketchup appeared during the breakfast hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard did it," part-owner John Binder said later, referring to his brother, 
who had staged a mini-coup. "My grandfather would be turning over in his 
grave." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people like it on scrambled eggs," explained Richard Binder. "Besides, 
it disappears at 10:30 (a.m.)."

 Celebrities everywhere: Also in the stands at the Rolling Stones concert 
attended by Simpson defense attorney Robert Shapiro were ex-Simpson defense 
attorney Howard Weitzman and Simpson friend Al Cowlings. None of them were 
sitting together.

<P>
 Could have been anyone's family outing: Actor Tim Allen, with a group of 
youngsters and adults, was observed at a pumpkin patch in Sherman Oaks, loading 
up his vehicle. He had plenty of room.

 It was a stretch limo.

 In the spirit of ghosts-and-goblins night, an L.A. company called 
Skeleteens/2nd Generation is marketing a spooky nonalcoholic beverage that 
depicts a radically slimmed-down version of a famous singer saying: "It ain't

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
5TH DISTRICT MAY SEEK YAROSLAVSKY REPLACEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley community and business leaders will meet next week to 
discuss what support they can lend to a proposal to appoint an interim member 
to replace departing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky.  
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is intended to gauge how strongly residents and business people 
feel about the issue.It will be Tuesday at the law offices of Reznick & Reznick 
in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky will leave office Dec. 4 to become a Los Angeles county 
supervisor, creating a council vacancy that will most likely last until July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's usual practice in such cases is to name the city's chief 
legislative analyst to run the vacant council office. But Ron Deaton, the 
legislative analyst, would not have a vote. Among the names that have been 
mentioned as replacements are retiring Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman, former state Sen. Alan Sieroty and state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys).

SCOTT HARRIS: THE NEXT VACATION PARADISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you listen to the true believers, Santa Clarita is like heaven, only not so 
exclusive. Sinners sneak in, but aren't welcome. The sun shines, the grass 
glistens, the graffiti is quickly erased. Santa Clarita boasts good schools and 
a nifty shopping mall. The FBI says this town is one of the safest in the whole 
U.S.A. -- and yet it's right here in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Santa Clarita is still something of a secret. Santa Monica is known 
for rent control, Santa Ana is a hot wind and a city, and Santa Catalina 
Island, as the song says, is 26 miles across the sea. But Santa Clarita? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know where Magic Mountain is?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the locals always say. Viper and Colossus, the amusement park's 
famous roller coasters, may sound more familiar than Santa Clarita. But all of 
that may soon be changing, because the civic boosters here entertain a new 
dream: Santa Clarita as "a tourist destination." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some casinos might help. As far as beaches go, there's Castaic Lake. When some 
Santa Claritans staged a family film festival early this year, they winked and 
sold sweat shirts comparing their event to Cannes. But the boosters are serious 
about tourism, and there are some Santa Claritans who shudder at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod and Hans, for example. When I told my friends about the tourism bureau, 
their reaction was a mix of alarm and disbelief. Like many people who moved to 
this place up Interstate 5, Rod and Hans thought they'd distance themselves 
from the troubles and indignities of Los Angeles, and that includes tourists. 
They like the fact that people still wonder where Santa Clarita is. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who would like to slam the barn door shut and say, 
'We're here! That's it!' " says Gail Foy, a spokeswoman for the city. She knows 
all about residents like Rod and Hans, and says they should be pleased about 
the tourism bureau. "We like tourists. They come, they spend their money, and 
then they get the hell out." 
</P>
<P>
 This is, I'm told, the sophisticated perspective. You can't freeze time, and 
you can't turn back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Santa Clarita is a suburban "edge city." The valley already has 170,000 
residents, 120,000 of whom live within Santa Clarita's sprawling 45-square-mile 
city limits. A planning study figures the valley will have 270,000 residents by 
the year 2010. That's only 16 years away. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody, of course, is for "controlled growth," but few agree about what 
that means. A slow-growth initiative failed here in 1992. But in any case, City 
Hall's power is limited. Newhall Land and Farming Co. is the 800-pound gorilla 
of civic affairs here. A few years ago, when Santa Clarita vainly tried to come 
up with a city slogan, one wise guy had this suggestion: "What's Good for 
Newhall Land Is Good for Santa Clarita." 
</P>
<P>
 It built Magic Mountain. It built the master-planned community of Valencia, 
one of the towns that forms Santa Clarita. And just outside city limits, west 
of Interstate 5, plans are moving forward on "Westridge" -- 1,800 homes and a 
golf course. And to the west of Magic Mountain, the company envisions "Newhall 
Ranch" -- a planned community of 24,000 homes on 12,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Mountain, with plans to add a major water park, a la Raging Waters, 
remains Santa Clarita's biggest attraction. The tourist bureau will hype such 
events as its family film conclave and its Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film 
Festival. In Bakersfield and Fresno, brochures have been displayed touting such 
Santa Clarita attractions as the Saugus Speedway, horse trails and Castaic 
Lake. The grand strategy envisions the construction of more hotels that would 
provide jobs and bolster the tax base. Can a convention center be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we're looking at sort of a mini-convention center right now," 
acknowledges Viki Rudolph, the chamber of commerce manager. "There are some 
studies I'm not able to tell you about, but they're happening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First an amusement park. Then a convention center. Who knows? If Newhall Land 
agrees to build a stadium, maybe Santa Clarita could land the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Claritans can only hope that Newhall Land is a wise gorilla. The 
residents I've met still complain that there's no Nordstrom at Valencia Town 
Center, the shopping mall, but on the whole they say it really is a great place 
to raise a family. They want to keep it that way. The aggressive anti-graffiti 
crusade and La Mesa Junior High's school uniforms are part of a social strategy 
to keep the evil influences of the big, bad city at bay. But meanwhile, Santa 
Clarita is getting pretty big in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
 If there ever comes a time to wonder when Santa Clarita started to go to hell, 
everyone will offer a theory. An acquaintance of mine used to work in the 
Valencia library. When the new mall opened, she says, the teen-agers 
disappeared.

NOW A HISTORY FOR THE REST OF US; NEW STANDARDS LOOK TO COMMON PEOPLE'S ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. history is the history of the Americans, all of us. That simple and 
uncontroversial-sounding thesis has in fact something revolutionary about it. 
Gary B. Nash, director of the UCLA National Center for History in the Schools, 
is not exaggerating when he calls the just-released "National Standards for 
United States History" for grades 5 through 12 "nothing short of a new American 
revolution in history education." 
</P>
<P>
 The revolution they represent is a historiographic rather than a political 
revolution, and as such is part of a world movement. The short and simple 
annals of the poor, as poet Thomas Gray called them in his "Elegy in a Country 
Churchyard," have been growing steadily longer and more complex as historians 
have turned their attention away from kings and battles and toward the common 
people and their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 FIXING A DISTORTION: In the American context, this new inclusiveness 
necessarily and properly entails a new attention to groups such as black 
slaves, native peoples and women. Their relative absence from history books has 
distorted the history of a nation defined in so many ways by their 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are happy to report that this new inclusiveness entails no new, 
politically correct exclusions. When the guidelines suggest that a 
fifth-grader, to demonstrate knowledge of the Constitution, be ordered to "draw 
upon a variety of historical sources such as paintings, biographies of major 
delegates, and narratives of the Constitutional Convention to construct a 
description of who the delegates were and why they were assembled in 
Philadelphia," nobody is air-brushed out of the famous paintings. The framers 
are all still there. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RUSH REACTION: Some critics have suggested otherwise. Rush Limbaugh, the 
right-wing talk show host, says that the still-to-be-ratified standards -- 
whose development was begun by the Bush Administration and completed by the 
Clinton Administration -- should be "flushed down the toilet." On a more 
serious plane, Lynne V. Cheney, former head of the National Endowment for the 
Humanities, cries political correctness and maintains, in particular, that the 
standards slight the Constitution. But political correctness is social 
censorship, and these standards censor nothing. As for the Constitution, would 
that college graduates could all meet the standards for knowledge of the 
Constitution that are set here! 
</P>
<P>
 When the standards project was first announced by the Bush Administration, we 
were skeptical. It seemed all too easy for the federal government to issue new 
standards rather than assist the states in meeting the standards most had 
already set. However, national standards are reasonable in principle, and these 
voluntary standards quite probably go beyond anything that any state has yet 
dared. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether teachers and students can put such high standards into practice is 
another matter, of course, but standards should challenge even the brightest. 
We commend UCLA's National Center for History in the Schools for setting the 
toughest standards seen in years.

POLITICS WATCH; JUMPING THE FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a year of destructive partisan politics, it is refreshing to see Rudolph W. 
Giuliani, the Republican mayor of New York City, drop a political bombshell by 
endorsing his state's Democratic governor, Mario M. Cuomo, for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not naive enough to think Giuliani did so entirely out of altruism.He 
openly dislikes the Republican candidate, a state senator from Upstate New York 
who Giuliani fears would undermine the city's efforts to close a $1-billion 
budget gap. And Giuliani is a bitter rival of the GOP candidate's mentor, U.S. 
Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato. Still, the mayor's willingness to risk his political 
future by crossing party boundaries in a Fiorello La Guardia-like gesture is a 
striking example for gridlock-bound Washington and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 There is recent precedent for such an action. Both Giuliani and his fellow 
big-city Republican mayor, Richard Riordan of Los Angeles, backed President 
Clinton in helping pass the crime bill despite partisan opposition from 
Republicans in Congress. And two top Republicans, Jack Kemp and William 
Bennett, came out against California's Proposition 187 despite the fact Gov. 
Pete Wilson is campaigning for it. 
</P>
<P>
 All this highlights the gulf in modern politics between private thought and 
public behavior. Kemp and Bennett could have kept their counsel; Giuliani could 
have voted for Cuomo and expediently remained silent. "That's one of the 
reasons why people are so turned off about politics today," Giuliani said, 
adding, "Because we don't act like we're real people."

FLOWER BLOOMS IN MIDEAST DESERT; ISRAEL AND JORDAN SIGN PEACE TREATY ENDING 
ALMOST FIVE DECADES OF HOSTILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid prayers, with homage to the dead of past wars and with eloquent 
expressions of hope for the future, Israel and Jordan have signed a peace 
treaty ending almost five decades of hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a moving ceremony in the stark southern desert landscape the two 
countries share, a mood heightened by the personal memories of the leaders 
whose vision and determination made the accomplishment possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein both remember the bitter 
beginning of the conflict they have now finally concluded. Rabin was a soldier 
in Israel's 1948 war of independence, Hussein the grandson of the king who led 
Jordan into that war and who just three years later would be murdered by a 
political extremist, an act that would bring the young prince to the throne. 
Both have seen more than enough of war and suffering. Both now hope to see the 
peace they have agreed upon take firm hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreements pointing toward broad bilateral cooperation seek to anchor the new 
treaty in common national interests. But opponents of peace remain unmollified. 
Muslim fundamentalists in Jordan, like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip and 
Lebanon, scorn any peace with Israel. A majority of Jordan's 4 million people 
-- between 60% and 80% -- are of Palestinian origin. Many have voiced 
reservations about the peace agreement. So it will take committed effort and 
time and above all a continued climate of political moderation to make this 
peace work. 
</P>
<P>
 Syria, which President Clinton visits today, can play a major role either to 
promote or to try to undercut regional political moderation. King Hussein 
showed great courage when he chose to proceed independently of his radical 
neighbor. Will President Hafez Assad now decide that the time has come to show 
the same vision in putting Syria firmly on the road to peace?

 Re the survey on American's sexual practices (Oct. 7): Am I the only one who 
realizes that its impossible for men to have more sex partners (on average) 
than women do? I mean, if women only have two sex partners, and men have six, 
where do the extra four wome come from? Somebody's not telling the whole truth 
here. ROBERT WITTMOND Lakewood

STATE SMOKING RULES INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I concur with The Times' portrait of Proposition 188 as tobacco's Trojan 
Horse (editorial, Oct. 15) and urge that voters pitch Philip Morris' glossy 
flyers into wastebaskets unread. 
</P>
<P>
 Big dollars for tobacco industry PR and confusing wording could lead unwary 
voters to act contrary to their own beliefs. Most can agree that tobacco is bad 
for the health. Moreover, Proposition 188 specifically shelves stricter state 
and local laws already on the books. Do we wish to roll back hard-fought-for 
progress? 
</P>
<P>
 Similar experiences in my role as water district director have led me to a 
wary attitude vis-a-vis corporate self-interest as it may impact sound public 
policy decision-making. Recent efforts by Philip Morris subsidiary Miller 
Brewing Co. have increased (water reclamation) project costs to local taxpayers 
by forcing the district to defend a not well-founded California Environmental 
Quality Act challenge of our district's project environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit delays a critical project designed to limit the need for pricey 
future water importations from the Colorado River into the San Gabriel Valley; 
essentially drought-proofing the area. The project has garnered environmental 
community support and support from the L.A. County Medical Assn., Metropolitan 
Water District and others. Our local attempt to implement both state and 
federal policy guidance has been frustrated by an uncompromising wall of 
corporate decision-makers motivated by greedy self-interest and no concern for 
the needs of the larger community.

 * Proposition 188 is not just about the rights of smokers or nonsmokers. It is 
about all of our personal rights. If anyone had predicted 10 years ago how 
intrusive government would become in our daily lives, no one would have 
believed him. 
</P>
<P>
 If we continue to allow our individual rights to disappear one by one, we will 
surely be living in a police state. When government is allowed to dictate to 
private business, would it not be possible that it could also dictate as to 
what goes on in our homes, how much fat we could consume, or how much exercise 
we must engage in? 
</P>
<P>
 We are being led down the primrose path "for our own good" based on flawed 
research. We are not only accepting of these dictates, we are embracing them. 
Please, if you are a smoker or a nonsmoker, vote yes on Proposition 188. Let's 
send a message to government and say, "Stop. You have gone too far."

 * Glionna was so busy focusing on the crow's feet on Mick Jagger's fans that 
he failed to see the big picture. Those original bad boys of rock, the Rolling 
Stones, are once again blazing a new trail. This time they're proving that you 
can rock and roll at any age. I saw the Stones in 1974 and 1994, and they are 
way cooler in '94. And so am I.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: PROP. 187 IS A SEARCH FOR SCAPEGOATS; WHEN THE 
ECONOMY STARTS TO CRUMBLE, OUR TOLERANCE FOR THOSE WHO ARE DIFFERENT 
EVAPORATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Why are we so mean? 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, this close to the election, a majority of voters, goaded by 
Gov. Pete Wilson, were determined to pass a proposition drastically cutting 
welfare payments. At the last moment, the voters came to their senses. 
Realizing that 70% of welfare recipients are children and that making them go 
hungry does not represent serious welfare reform, they voted the governor's 
proposition down.  
</P>
<P>
 This time a majority, again fired up by a governor who apparently knows no 
limits of decency, tell pollsters that they intend to vote for Proposition 187, 
which purports to curtail illegal immigration but which does nothing of the 
sort. Maybe the tide will turn by Election Day as people come to recognize that 
immigration reform means closing the border and sanctioning employers rather 
than forcing children out of the schools and onto the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But why must we go through this demeaning exercise in which a basically decent 
and generous people surrender to vituperation? 
</P>
<P>
 We know why the governor takes these stands; he is an intrinsically unpopular 
fellow bereft of warmth or conviction who connects with the voters only with 
appeals to base fear. But why do so many voters buy it? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, sadly enough, can be found in a trip to the Holocaust Museum in 
Washington. When Germany was prosperous, its society was highly civilized in 
the sense of being open to those who were different. But when the economy 
crumbled, civility evaporated, and the hunt was on for scapegoats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, we are very far from being in a comparable situation. But there are 
troubling signs of economic distress and failed expectations on the part of too 
many Americans raised to believe that constant material improvement is a 
birthright. And it is this discontent which fuels the bonfires of the 
demagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the stark findings of the recent census report on income and poverty: 
Median household income in the United States, in real dollars, has declined by 
more than 7% since 1989. For households in the central cities, real income is 
down an astounding 12%. What this documents is a reversal of the American dream 
that has been under way since the end of the '60s. It is a national, not a 
regional phenomenon, meaning it has nothing to do with illegal immigration, 
which seriously impacts only a few states. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, there has been a sharp increase, again nationally, in class 
differences. The latest census figures show that almost 40 million Americans 
live below the official government poverty level, almost 7 million more than 
five years ago. In California, one in five live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 We are increasingly a society of the working poor scratching an existence out 
of low-wage jobs. No wonder that many citizens who qualify for welfare reject 
such jobs, leaving them for the undocumented who, despite the lies of the 
pro-187 people, are not eligible for the dole. Want to stop illegal 
immigration? Then raise the minimum wage to a living wage and enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Our economic malaise has nothing to do with immigration and everything to do 
with the end of U.S. predominance in the world market. The stark result: the 
loss of good-paying manufacturing jobs and the end of trade unions as major 
players in setting wage rates. We are no longer a society where an ordinary, 
working person can live proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the clear tracks to a better life for one's children. Now, colleges 
are expensive and offer no guarantee of a good-paying job. Gone also is the 
security that hard work guarantees a job until retirement. For many people, 
this is a frightening turn of events and they thrash about for explanation of 
how this could have happened. Who is to blame?  
</P>
<P>
 Historically, in this country as elsewhere, the easiest target is the 
stranger. Strange by color, religion, language, country of origin -- the 
"other." Two years ago, the target of opportunity was the welfare mother. 
Today, it's the illegal immigrant.  
</P>
<P>
 The governor is thrilled that this hunt for scapegoats resonates: that Latinos 
who are legal might turn on those who are not, or that blacks could be induced 
to lash out at browns. He acts as if the ugly notion of divide and conquer is 
his own salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 As editorial writers for the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and 
virtually every paper in this state have written, along with conservative 
commentators including Abe Rosenthal, William Safire and Jack Kemp, Wilson's 
championing of Proposition 187 represents a profound moral failure. Whatever 
his and the proposition's fortunes in this election, Wilson's career now bears, 
indelibly, the mark of shame.

COLUMN RIGHT/ BENJAMIN ZYCHER: GOV. WILSON, COME CLEAN ON THE TAX HIKE; INSTEAD 
OF IMMIGRANT-BASHING, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CATASTROPHE LEFT BY HIS BUDGET 
'SOLUTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Milken Institute for Job and Capital Formation in Santa Monica.

 Old Glory. Bumper stickers and rubber chicken. Wet kisses lingering on the 
faces of helpless infants. Such are the traditional signs of an imminent 
election, a noble exercise of American democracy that for Yogi Berra fans is 
half business, half farce and half entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the fun and pride are dimmer this year. The traditional Reaganite 
optimism about greatness and opportunity for all is nowhere to be heard; 
instead, we have the largely artificial issue of illegal immigration, promoted 
with a crass demagoguery shameless even by California standards. Even the 
official estimates imply that illegals impose upon the public purse a net cost 
equal to a trivial 0.4% of state gross product. Does the government not waste 
that and a good deal more each year? And that excludes the benefits that 
illegals provide for the economy as a whole. By far the vast preponderance of 
illegal immigrants come to California in search of productive work. Who can 
believe that to be bad for us? 
</P>
<P>
 Let us talk instead about a real issue, to wit, the whopping tax increase that 
is almost certain over the next two years, engineered last spring by Gov. Pete 
Wilson to be pushed through after this election is safely past. 
</P>
<P>
 Climaxing a five-year descent from an AAA bond rating to one of the four 
lowest among the states, California ended its 1993-1994 fiscal year with a 
budget deficit so large that a two-year swing loan of $7 billion was obtained 
to "balance" the budget. This loan will cost taxpayers almost $500 million in 
interest and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the deficit is so large, the lenders insisted on provisions for 
automatic spending cuts should the state begin to run out of money in fiscal 
years 1995 or 1996. Accordingly, a provision in the new two-year budget will 
force across-the-board reductions in non-education spending when -- not if -- 
the state runs out of money sometime in 1995 or 1996. In addition to the 
immunity of education spending, debt repayment cannot be cut because the effect 
on the state's credit standing would be catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidate for state controller, Tom McClintock, points out in 
California Political Review that the spending reductions thus must come from 
the non-education operations side of the state budget. That means that severe 
pressure will be placed on prisons, mental facilities, state police, etc. -- 
precisely the state services that loosely can be categorized under a "public 
safety" umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the politicians generally and Gov. Wilson in particular once again 
are playing the Washington Monument Game: They deliberately have created a 
situation in which they will threaten to cut the most important public services 
(public safety) first in order to create irresistible pressure for a major tax 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Would some crack reporter please ask the governor which taxes he will propose 
for increases? An extension of the sales tax to services? "Modification" of 
Proposition 13 protection for property owners? If he claims that the budget is 
balanced, please remind him that the budget assumes an optimistic 5.9% revenue 
growth and an illusory $3.6 billion in federal bailouts. And if he claims to be 
the victim of the recession and of cuts in defense spending, please point out 
that Michigan, Massachusetts and Virginia recently have gone through economic 
downturns and defense cuts equal or worse proportionately, but Govs. John 
Engler, William Weld and Douglas Wilder, respectively, held firm on or cut 
spending and taxes. The result? Those states' economies are in far better shape 
than that of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite happy to beat up on politically unpopular illegals, the governor has 
been a good deal less macho when it comes to standing up to the Sacramento 
spending constituencies. The irony is that even as Wilson accuses Kathleen 
Brown of planning to raise taxes, a Gov. Kathleen Brown would find it next to 
impossible to get a major tax increase through the Legislature, even if she 
would prefer to do so, because the Republicans would stop it. She then would 
have to cut spending in a serious way and thus would find it necessary to 
reject the pleas of myriad interest groups demanding that they be exempted from 
the budget knife. 
</P>
<P>
 If the reporters only would do their jobs, perhaps half business, half farce 
and half entertainment can be ours to enjoy once again.

 Last week, I stood waiting for my sisters in front of their high school. At 
the school entrance, an American flag was swaying proudly and gracefully in the 
air.As the students began to come out, one young girl yelled, "What's this 
stupid flag doing here? There should be a Mexican flag here, not this." A boy 
nearby pulled the pole out and let our precious flag fall to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 For the longest minute of my life, I watched as several students trampled my 
flag. After they finished, I bent over, picked up my battered flag and put it 
back in its place, because here is where it belongs.  
</P>
<P>
 I felt anger and frustration. Everyone has forgotten that this flag represents 
freedom to the oppressed, a second chance to hard-working people and, most of 
all, our home. The blood that runs through my veins may be Cuban, but the pride 
I have in my heart is very much American.  
</P>
<P>
 When I took my citizenship vows, I took an oath to uphold the laws of this 
country. If you want to fly your native flag, do so in your heart; if you live 
here, you owe this country respect. If you cannot give such respect, you are 
free to leave.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SLIPS 2.36 AS BOND YIELDS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Blue-chip stocks closed lower Wednesday as the rise in long-term bond yields 
to well over 8% and the weakening dollar appeared to drain more money from Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.36 points to 3,848.23, declining 
for the fifth consecutive session. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Big Board volume totaled 322.53 million shares, down from 326.10 
million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-company stocks outperformed blue-chip issues. Broader market indexes 
finished higher. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.09 points to 462.62. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index rose 0.40 point to 253.91, the Nasdaq composite 
index climbed 4.98 points to 763.24, and the American Stock Exchange's market 
value index added 0.68 point to 453.53. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the session, stocks mirrored bonds, rallying briefly on 
weaker-than-expected economic data but retreating after the Treasury's auction 
of five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, Treasury bond yields were higher amid persistent concerns that 
the Federal Reserve Board is acting too slowly to curb inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The worries came despite a report showing lower-than-expected orders for 
durable goods, a sign of economic weakness that ordinarily is welcomed by 
inflation-wary investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitting a new 2 1/2-year high, the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 8.06% from 
8.04% on Tuesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 
3/16 point, or $1.88 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said orders to U.S. factories for big-ticket durable 
goods rose only 0.1% in September, following a revised 6.4% rise in August. The 
September data was below most market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stock market is hostage to the bond market," said Alfred E. Goldman, vice 
president at A.G. Edwards & Sons. "Bonds are not ready to stabilize at the 
moment. . . . At this level, stocks have not discounted the unknown top of the 
bond market." 
</P>
<P>
 James Solloway, research director at Argus Research Corp., said the market was 
"bouncing around with bonds, and bonds are bouncing around with the dollar." 
</P>
<P>
 The lower dollar also kept stocks from rebounding from their recent downturn, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a strong bond market rally and a strong dollar rally to get the 
market to rally successively," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Reich & 
Co. "Just a relief rally isn't going to do the trick here." 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 96.85 Japanese yen, up from 96.83 on Tuesday. 
It fell to 1.491 German marks, down from 1.495. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the dollar "probing new lows against the yen and approaching new 
lows against the mark," investors are not convinced that the federal government 
will intervene aggressively to protect the currency. That discourages foreign 
investors from buying dollar-denominated securities, including U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford Motor, the last of the Big Three to issue third-quarter results, rose 
3/8 to 29 1/4 after posting a $1.124-billion profit that beat Wall Street 
forecasts. Chrysler rose 1/4 to 47 3/4, while General Motors dipped 5/8 to 40 
3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continental Airlines tumbled 2 1/4 to 15 3/8 after its third-quarter 
earnings disappointed investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * McKesson jumped 5 3/8 to 105 1/4, boosted by a New York Times report that 
Eli Lilly & Co. had agreed to accept regulatory restrictions on its proposed 
purchase of McKesson's PCS Health Systems. Eli Lilly fell 1/2 to 60. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sara Lee reported quarterly earnings of 33 cents a share, compared to 24 
cents a year ago, and Goldman Sachs added the stock to its "recommended" list. 
It rose 1 1/8 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boeing rose 1/8 to 43 1/4 after reporting earnings that beat most Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * DuPont declined 1/8 to 73 1/8 after the company reported record 
third-quarter profit of 95 cents per share, contrasted with a loss of $1.01 a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sprint, which announced a venture with three major cable operators to 
develop telephone service for local markets, fell 7/8 to 32 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Surgical fell 2 5/8 to 23 7/8. Insiders are selling the stock, 
suggesting that a rumored takeover of the company is not imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, German shares ended sharply higher, with the DAX 30-share 
average up 45.87 points to 2,020.50. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average 
gained 14.20 points to end at 19,746.35, while London's Financial Times 
100-share average closed off 1 at 2,999.9. Mexico's Bolsa index rose 1.62 
points to 2,580.

reorganization and then spearheaded the airline's low-fare CALite service that 
began a year ago, resigned Tuesday as the carrier's chief executive and vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old Ferguson, chief executive since mid-1991, said he will remain 
a Continental director but wants to "explore other career challenges." He also 
was named a principal at Air Partners L.P., the investor group that is 
Continental's major stockholder. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline's president, Gordon Bethune, 53, will take over strategic and 
day-to-day operations for the Houston-based carrier, which emerged from 
bankruptcy reorganization in April, 1993.

WESTSIDE WATCH: HARMAN HOPES TO CASH IN ON HER FUND-RAISING EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) still has a hefty war chest with less than 
two weeks left in the campaign for reelection in the 36th Congressional 
District, which includes Venice, Marina del Rey, Westchester and Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has $365,234 in cash compared with Republican challenger Susan Brooks' 
$68,065, according to the latest campaign statements, which cover Oct. 1 to 
Oct. 19. In that period, Harman spent $206,358 to Brooks' $54,943. A large 
portion of what Harman has left is expected to go toward TV advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 And both campaigns stepped up their fund-raising efforts. Harman raised 
$101,920 and Brooks, a Rancho Palos Verdes council member, collected $52,835. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BABBITT AT BALLONA: Yet another Friend of Jane came to stump for her last 
week: Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 As skaters whizzed by in Venice, he praised Harman's environmental record and 
her persistence at lobbying him about the Ballona Wetlands, set to be restored 
as part of the Playa Vista development project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ballona Wetlands is something she's been after me (about) for some time," he 
said after a speech at the Fig Tree Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the morning, he joined Harman at the wetlands and pledged to speed up 
the Ballona restoration project, promising to set up a system of parallel 
processing of government permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt is the highest-ranking Clinton administration official to campaign for 
Harman. He predicted that the anti-Clinton tide will recede come Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Saturday night tear-on-the-town against the political system is 
giving rise to kind of a more reflective Sunday morning," he said. "People are 
saying, 'Wait a minute, it's the only system we have.' "

 SIGN WARS: You would expect a race for high school student body president to 
have its juvenile moments. But congressional politics is supposed to be 
highbrow, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe it.  
</P>
<P>
 Witness, the behavior this week at the Cal Lutheran University debate between 
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and his GOP challenger, Richard 
Sybert. The pair are competing in a tough race for the 24th Congressional 
District, which includes Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert enthusiasts fired the first shots by taping signs advertising their 
champion in a neat row across the rear wall of the CLU auditorium, where 
numerous other candidates in local races had set up booths of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 When late-arriving Beilenson supporters saw the Sybert signs, they began 
slapping up their own signs on the same wall but in a space not claimed by 
Sybert's placards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Beilenson people failed to see that debate sponsors had put up a sign 
nearby saying that the rear of the auditorium was reserved for "special 
interest groups" to set up informational booths. 
</P>
<P>
 By plastering the congressman's posters just above the "special interest 
groups" sign, Beilenson-ites created the impression there was an alliance 
between their campaign and special interests. The irony: Beilenson prides 
himself on not taking special interest money. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing their mistake, the sheepish Beilenson team moved their signs beneath 
the existing row of head-high Sybert signs. "We're on top," a youthful Sybert 
partisan exulted. More glares and flushed faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a debate organizer pronounced the rear wall area off-limits to all 
candidate signs. Within minutes, the partisans had dutifully pulled down their 
respective signs and scattered like so many chastised children.

FIRST PERSON / SHARON YAMATO DANLEY: PROJECT HELPS WOMAN TEAR DOWN A WALL OF 
SILENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON YAMATO DANLEY, The author recently traveled to Heart Mountain, Wyo., 
to dismantle two barracks used at an internment camp there to house Japanese 
Americans during World War II. One of the barracks has been reassembled across 
the street from the Japanese American National Museum in Little Tokyo, where it 
will be part of an exhibit slated to open Nov. 11 titled: America's 
Concentration Camps: Remembering the Japanese American Experience. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I learned that my family was interned in a concentration camp from my 
first-grade teacher, some 10 years after the war. Throughout my childhood, my 
parents, now dead, had managed to build a wall between me and the memory of 
that horrible time in their lives. So when I saw the plea for volunteers to 
participate in a project to dismantle two of the barracks in Heart Mountain, 
Wyo., and rebuild them at the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, 
I jumped at the opportunity to grab whatever I could of the truth that I feared 
had died along with my parents. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a third-generation Japanese American living in Venice, where I write and 
and run my own transcription business. I was born in 1949, after my family was 
released from the camps. Four of my older sisters, however, lived through the 
forced detention and told me what little I knew about those three years. One 
sister, about 5 at the time, remembered eating frozen canned fruit cocktail as 
the only relief against the blistering heat. My family was sent to a camp in 
Poston, Ariz. -- like Heart Mountain, one of a number of remote sites selected 
for the concentration camps. My mother, born and raised in the milder climate 
of Los Angeles, would only say that the camp was "so hot." My father, who moved 
to Los Angeles from Hawaii and opened a small travel and employment agency in 
Little Tokyo, would say nothing at all about his detention. 
</P>
<P>
 At Heart Mountain we were greeted by dry, 80-degree weather, but the 
temperatures seemed higher as we ripped through weathered tar paper, pulled up 
thousands of rusty nails from every corner of the hastily constructed barracks 
and dragged heavy wood planks to a flatbed truck. Unlike my sisters and 
parents, we were provided with bottled spring water and ice, fresh apples and 
oranges, sweet rolls and doughnuts as we toiled in the dust. There were 25 
volunteers in all, most of them men in their 60s who had been interned at Heart 
Mountain. I was accompanied by two cousins, one of whom was born there. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was hard and long, though sometimes punctuated by laughter. So 
intently did we attack the job, in fact, I couldn't help thinking that we were 
trying to shelter ourselves from the truth of the concentration camp 
experience. As a contingent of Nisei men, all former camp internees, labored 
from dawn to dusk, I thought of my father. He was a proud and passionate man 
who despite two heart attacks refused to give up his hard life -- his long 
hours of work in Little Tokyo, his frequent trips to the track, and his 
excessive fondness for drink. I reflected on how often I lose myself in my work 
or social life to avoid the demons that creep in when I stop. They ask: How 
could such a thing happen to my parents, whose only crime was being of Japanese 
descent? How could my parents allow this to happen? And how could I so easily 
inherit their shame? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the deepest fear, the hardest to admit, was that somehow we deserved 
this. My parents' silence only emphasized what I felt inside, that the shame of 
what happened to them was something you didn't talk about. They taught me 
gaman, to grin and bear it in the face of adversity -- which only made my 
feelings of sadness build inside me. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, sometimes that repressed shame raises its head in anger. Anger at an 
American Legion plaque along the Wyoming highway that implies that the 
barbed-wire enclave at Heart Mountain benefited those who were "loosely 
confined" there. Anger at governments that allow injustice. Anger at those who 
still hate Japanese people. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the shame manifests itself in an overwhelming depression, a feeling 
that no matter how hard I try to be "good," to please others and to fit in -- 
that I will always fall short. This is the legacy of my parents' wall of 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, standing in the empty barracks for the first time, I knew why my mother 
and father chose not to speak. The raw wood floor, the cramped living space, 
the dust that crept through the walls, the emptiness -- I imagined their first 
glimpse of a barracks like this, their new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain is just too great," said one man who could have been my father, 
standing in the ruins and fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one could deny that preserving these barracks fostered joyful 
camaraderie and a tremendous sense of accomplishment, this project meant so 
much more to him. The barracks were not just artifacts to be put on display in 
a museum. They were a tangible part of his life, a part that he would rather 
have forgotten but knew he could not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I am near the end," he said quietly, there was no denying that his 
past, especially the painful part, was far too important to be allowed to rot 
and be thrown away. Thanks to this experience, he said, he was now ready to 
share his Heart Mountain memories with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the four short days it took to dismantle these barracks, I touched the 
silent pain of my parents' lives. At Heart Mountain, I took a hammer and tore 
down a wall.

VOTERS WEIGHING $10 HIKE IN PARCEL TAX TO AID SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica and Malibu voters will decide next month whether to increase the 
$58 parcel tax to $68. Known as Proposition K, the ballot measure would extend 
a parcel tax that was first approved in 1984 at a level of $58, and was 
extended in 1988 for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by two-thirds of the voters, the new tax will be levied for four 
more years, beginning July 1, 1995. In addition, the school board may adjust 
the tax annually for inflation. School officials said the $10 increase would 
add about $300,000 to the budget. They said the money will be used for, among 
other things, hiring teachers and purchasing books, science equipment and 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax has generated about $1.8 million annually for the school district, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents cite a 1990 bond measurre passed by Santa Monica and Malibu voters 
that gave the school district $75 million to upgrade aging school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Goldfarb, a Malibu resident, said that because of mismanagement, the 
school reconstruction project has fallen behind schedule. "Money alone cannot 
rectify incompetence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 bond issue proceeds were earmarked for construction. CAROL CHASTANG

BACKING OF RENTERS GROUP CRITICIZED IN BOARD RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do renters rights have to do with education? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty, if you're a candidate for a seat on the Santa Monica/Malibu Unified 
school board or Santa Monica Community College Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Santa Monicans for Renters Rights group (SMRR) has endorsed three 
candidates for the school board and three college trustee hopefuls. Some who 
did not receive SMRR's backing are criticizing the intervention by the renters 
group, which has been endorsing local candidates for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "SMRR is endorsing people based on their political views, not on their 
capabilities," said Neil Carrey, a 51-year-old tax attorney running for the 
school board.  
</P>
<P>
 Not true, said SMRR co-chair Nancy Greenstein. SMRR "is more than a 
rent-control organization," said Greenstein, who added that education is an 
important concern of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to support people who would be good for the school board," she 
said. "We aren't interested in taking over." 
</P>
<P>
 SMRR's endorsements are by no means the only issue being discussed by Santa 
Monica's school board and community college candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the highest-profile question in the race is how to maintain the 
district's financial health in a climate of scarce resources. In the community 
college contest, meanwhile, attention is focused on the search for a new 
college president and the progress -- and cost -- of earthquake repairs at the 
college, which officials say sustained about $75 million in damage in the Jan. 
17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Monica/Malibu school board contest, seven candidates are 
competing for four seats. Two are incumbents -- Brenda Gottfried and Pam Brady. 
(The other two board members whose terms are expiring, board President Patricia 
Hoffman and Michael Hill, decided not to seek reelection.)  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Carrey, general contractor Harlan Dorin, management consultant 
Julia Brownley, retiree Lacy D. Goode and reading specialist Terri L. Cohen are 
running for the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 All the candidates except one -- Goode -- support extending and increasing the 
parcel tax, an issue that will come before voters on Nov. 8. (See box.) Goode 
says that Santa Monica residents have paid enough in parcel taxes and that the 
board should learn to live with the revenues it receives. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates say that the $10 increase in the parcel tax is crucial; 
if it fails, the district will not have enough money to hire teachers, buy 
computers and maintain facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates all generally agree that the district could do more to tap 
alternative funding sources, such as business partnerships and government 
grants and programs. They also have expressed concern that some of the 
construction is behind schedule in upgrading the district's schools. That 
project is being financed with a $75-million bond issue that was approved in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The only issue to spark major disagreement in the race has been the SMRR 
endorsements. The group is backing Gottfried, Brownley and Dorin. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to run things," said Goode, who until last August was a member 
of the Santa Monica Rent Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Brownley, however, said SMRR merely "endorsed those who they believed to be 
the best candidates." She said the renters group never demanded that candidates 
accept its agenda in return for support. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the community college board, nine candidates are running for 
four open seats. Two are incumbents. Carole Currey, a board member since 1979, 
is making a try for her fifth four-year term, and Ralph Villani is running for 
a second term. (Board of trustees chairman Alfred Quinn and vice-chairman Colin 
Petrie are not seeking reelection.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the field are retired teachers Nancy Cattell and Dorothy 
Ehrhart-Morrison; William E. (Bill) Whalen, a retired warehouse supervisor for 
the college; Herb Roney, a former administrator at the college; community 
development administrator Clyde Smith; businessman Patrick Ortega, and business 
manager Erik Kowalewsky. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates say the college's most immediate challenges are finding a 
replacement for college President Richard Moore and carrying out the major 
repair and reconstruction work needed in the wake of the Jan. 17 quake. Moore 
announced in August that he would be leaving to become president of the 
Community College of Southern Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing little disagreement, the candidates say that, in both efforts, the 
college must work closely with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the school board contest, the SMRR endorsements have been the sole 
source of friction in the race. SMRR backs Cattell, Ehrhart-Morrison and 
Whalen. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Villani: "I can understand SMRR endorsing City Council candidates, or 
those running for the state positions . . . but school boards?"  
</P>
<P>
 Ehrhart-Morrison disagreed, saying that SMRR, like other groups that have 
endorsed her, "have an interest in quality education in Santa Monica." SMRR, 
she added, "does not have an agenda."

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; PROP. 187 PROTESTERS MAY FACE DETENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Up to 500 Venice High School students this week protested Proposition 187 as 
unconstitutional. Yet they may end up in detention, copying the U.S. 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The students gathered for almost four hours on the school's north lawn 
Tuesday, until administrators and Los Angeles Police Department officers began 
breaking up the rally around noon. No injuries or arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who demonstrated between classes will not be punished, school 
officials said. But those who skipped class to protest face "in-house 
detention," where the penalty is to copy the U.S. Constitution for the entire 
school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Students said campus sentiment had been building in recent weeks against 
Proposition 187, the controversial state ballot measure that would bar illegal 
immigrants from receiving many public services, including education. Roughly 
60% of the 2,400-member student body is Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Student organizers complained that a handful of protesters marred the rally by 
becoming rowdy and hurling bottles at police. During the protest, a small band 
of students dashed through hallways and smashed classroom windows with a 
flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not criminals, we're just fighting for our rights," said Margarita 
Garcia, 18. "When the cops came, people got mad and didn't want to go inside." 
</P>
<P>
 "Education should not be taken away from the people," said 16-year-old Nora 
Frausto, who carried a Mexican flag and a sign reading "Pete Wilson -- Por que 
no me quieres? " ("Why don't you love me?"). Gov. Wilson is a leading supporter 
of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, a police helicopter whirred overhead as puzzled neighbors emerged 
from their houses. After a minor auto accident nearby snarled traffic, police 
blocked off Venice Boulevard between Beethoven Street and Walgrove Avenue. LAPD 
Capt. Richard LeGarra said officers got involved to prevent students "from 
taking over the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the crowd size from police, students and teachers ranged from 100 
to 500. One group of several dozen students splintered from the rest and began 
marching west toward Lincoln Boulevard. Officers rounded them up and herded 
them to bleachers behind the school, where Principal Bud Jacobs, carrying a 
megaphone and a note pad, urged them to go back to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Mr. Jacobs, quit pushing me!" complained one boy being led into the 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not pushing you. I'm hugging you because I love you," Jacobs joked. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs told a reporter that the rally had not gotten out of hand but was 
"beginning to get disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said students told him Monday about the planned protest, and that he 
responded that the rally must be peaceful and not interfere with school. SCOTT 
COLLINS

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; FINGERPRINTS LEAD TO ARRESTS OF 2 IN BEATING 
DEATH, ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Days after Edward Broderick's bound and beaten body was found in his Santa 
Monica duplex, police arrested two Panorama City men in connection with the 
slaying and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerprints found in Broderick's home linked the suspects to the Oct. 20 
killing and led police to the apartment in the San Fernando Valley early Monday 
morning, said Santa Monica police spokesman Sgt. Gary Gallinot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police surrounded the apartment and a hostage negotiating team contacted the 
men inside, persuading them to surrender, Gallinot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Smith, 24, and Norman Tooks Jr., 28, were booked on suspicion of murder 
in the death of 38-year-old Broderick. A third man arrested at the same time, 
Mark Anthony Henderson, 30, was booked on charges of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 All three men were on parole for previous crimes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Broderick's body was discovered in his duplex in the 1400 block of Tenth 
Street, by a friend at 7:45 p.m. on Oct. 20. A coroner's report indicated he 
died from asphyxiation and from blunt-force trauma, Gallinot said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; CITY'S UTILITY TAKEOVER PLAN GETS A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Edison is fighting it, but Culver City Mayor Albert Vera's 
proposal to have his city take over local electric utility service got a boost 
this week from Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing in Los Angeles held by the Assembly's Committee on 
Utilities and Commerce, which Moore chairs, Vera called it "illegal and 
immoral" that Edison controls electric service in Culver City.He said the 
utility's local customers are captives of Edison's high rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the hearing, Moore mentioned Vera's frustrated efforts to 
buy out Edison. She also pressed representatives from Edison and other 
investor-owned utilities to explain why they charge rates that are higher than 
city-run systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Mayor Vera) has a valid point," said Moore after the hearing. "I'm 
for lower rates for residential ratepayers . . . however it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison representative at the hearing -- Gary Schoonyan, manager of energy 
regulatory planning, system planning and fuel supply -- told the committee he 
was not familiar enough with Culver City's situation to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schoonyan did outline the reasons for Edison's higher rates. The utility 
is bound by long-term contracts that force it to pay higher-than-market value 
for its power sources, he said. Thus, Edison pays $1.5 billion a year more than 
it should to generate power, costing ratepayers an additional 2 cents per 
kilowatt hour, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why it makes sense for Culver City and some others to run their own 
electric systems, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the cost is lower for municipals, how do we justify not allowing it to 
occur?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for the local takeover of electric service is still being studied 
by the City Council. MARY MOORE

 CULVER CITY: The motto of the City Council here is "Just Say No" when it comes 
to Propositions 187 and 188 on the November ballot. Council members voted this 
week to send letters to the editors of local newspapers, asking that voters 
oppose the two controversial propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's discussion of Proposition 187 brought six students to the 
meeting from West Los Angeles College, Santa Monica College and Culver City 
High School. They applauded the council's decision to oppose the measure, which 
would leave illegal immigrants without access to health services and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ever need me to speak for you on behalf of the Latino community, I'd 
be happy to do that," Richard Alvarez, one of the students, told the council. 
Alvarez requested that the council permit the students to lead a "peaceful 
demonstration" against the ballot measure in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 While the council is concerned about illegal immigration, Proposition 187 is 
not the answer, explained Vice Mayor Steve Gourley. However, the Culver City 
Chamber of Commerce has taken a position in favor of the measure. MARY MOORE

<P>
 Sarah Young of Malibu remembers the Halloweens of old, watching her mother, 
hunched for hours over a sewing machine, making costumes for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a role Young relishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an arduous task," she said. "Our mother was always busy sewing the 
kids' costumes. My mother was at home. I don't have time to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 So before Halloween, Young takes her son and daughter to a Santa Monica 
costume store where they assemble their outfits '90s-style -- with a 
professional costume designer who takes their ideas, makes a costume and rents 
it to them for about $50 for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with 11-year-old daughter Sarah, who is going to be a spider this 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool," she said. "It's one-of-a-kind. You don't see people 
walking around in spider costumes." 
</P>
<P>
 And if her mother also has to drop by a hardware store to pick up some chains 
for Sarah's brother, a ghoul, that's OK. It's all in the Halloween spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a family thing because we do it together," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween has changed with the times. Increasingly in recent years, families 
have rented and purchased costumes rather than stitching and cutting their own 
ghoulish garb. 
</P>
<P>
 A major reason is that fears of crime have pushed Halloween indoors, says 
Fredrick Koenig, a professor of social psychology at Tulane University in New 
Orleans -- the nation's costume capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't trust each other any more," Koenig said. "We don't know our 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 With the trend toward indoor parties, costumes that would have been fine for a 
night of trick-or-treating might look a little tatty. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in adults donning Halloween attire is also spurring business for 
children's costumes, said Michael Bernacchi, a professor of marketing at 
University of Detroit Mercy in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you (rent or buy costumes) for yourself, the chances are you would do it 
for your kids or grandkids," said Bernacchi, who puts out a newsletter that in 
a recent issue addressed Halloween sales. "Guilt-buying is big business." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, costume sales have jumped about 10% annually, he said. That's 
only part of the good news for merchants. And, because of the new emphasis on 
indoor celebrations, Halloween is not only the biggest day for candy sales, 
it's now in the top five for beer and soft drink vending. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, Bernacchi said, is that Halloween has become an important bridge 
for retailers between back-to-school sales and Christmas. "Holidays are the 
impetus to our retail economy," he said. "It behooves us to go from holiday to 
holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Although sales and rentals of fancy costumes are contributing to the growing 
market, less expensive costumes sold by a variety of stores are also playing a 
part. Bernacchi said one drugstore he visited was crammed with paper-and-glue 
costumes selling for $20, twice what he'd expected. 
</P>
<P>
 That's bad news for upscale costume dealers like Ursula Boschet, owner of 
Ursula's Costumes at 9069 Venice Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone sells them now," Boschet said. "They shouldn't do that. We don't 
sell groceries." 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, she's competing with grocery stores, drugstores and countless 
other retail outlets to sell Mighty Morphin Power Ranger outfits, which are 
easily kids' favorite this year. At Ursula's the suits go for $24. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go nuts for it -- a weird little karate show," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boschet has much less competition at the top of the market. For example, she 
has a robot costume going for $49 and a boys' King Ferdinand costume, complete 
with hat, medallion and all the trimmings, for $70. 
</P>
<P>
 She can do even better for customers who don't want something off the rack. 
Some Hollywood stars and other clients have her design custom children's 
costumes that sell for a few hundred dollars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who put down that kind of money might have more in mind than stylish 
trick-or-treating, Koenig said. "It's not unusual to use your kids as a display 
of your affluence," he said. In some cases, he added, parents think, "I can't 
have my kid going out there in a drugstore costume." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boschet says custom costumes aren't just for Halloween. They'll survive 
the clothes washer and be hanging in the closet when kids want to dress up on 
other occasions during the year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said she decided to rent custom costumes from Make Believe Inc., 3240 
Pico Blvd., after buying her daughter a cheap bear costume a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ripped," she said. "It was very uncomfortable and hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Make Believe makes many of its children's costumes for the stage, said 
co-owner Ruth Talley. The store then rents out the durable outfits, which range 
from Oliver to Little Orphan Annie. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want quality," she said. "It's not just for Halloween." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of her packaged costumes are also made to last, she said. The $53.99 
Faerie Princess is popular with grandparents who want to buy a dress that won't 
be thrown away after Halloween, while boys who want a tough cowboy outfit can 
pick up chaps and a black leather vest for around $40. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dressing Room, 962 Gayley Ave., Georgia Dowell also gets customers 
looking for upscale outfits for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The $52 Maid Marian is popular, she said, and boys like the double-breasted 
pin-stripe gangster suit, $46 with hat. Civil War fans ages 4 to 6 might prefer 
the Robert E. Lee, which costs $32. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have some customers who want very nice things for their children," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Tudor was looking for nice costumes for her two young sons on a recent 
evening, but she also had to consider the price. A single mother working full 
time, she doesn't have the time to sew and she was hoping to find a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 She was delighted to get an $8.88 tiger costume at Pic'N'Save, but she was 
still searching for a turtle outfit for 7-year-old Spincer when she stopped by 
Robinson Beautilities at 12320 Venice Blvd. The store has clowns, flappers, 
cheerleaders and doctors from $10.95 up. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Baldi considered making a costume for her 3-year-old son, Max, until he 
told her what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided he wanted to be a mailman," she said. "It seemed like a little too 
much work. A ghost would have been great. That I could have handled." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other retailers and harried parents, Robinson's owner Belle Fisher 
said it makes sense for most people to buy costumes instead of making them. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you buy the material and put the time into it, it really isn't 
worth it," she said.

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; ADULTS' TASTES IN COSTUMES CAN BE DOWNRIGHT HORRIFYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a few Halloween celebrants this year want to dress up as O.J. 
Simpson and his murdered ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Westside costume shops are refusing to oblige, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Dowell, owner of the Dressing Room in Westwood, said she had been 
getting up to seven calls a day from customers looking for O.J. and Nicole 
outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad taste doesn't describe it," she said. "It goes much beyond that. It's 
hard to believe, but this is a town that sells Jeffrey Dahmer trading cards." 
</P>
<P>
 So goes the fast-growing adult Halloween costume trade. Grown-up Halloween 
partyers increasingly want to look the part, but sometimes their requests cross 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ursula's Costumes in Venice is also turning down requests for O.J. and Nicole 
wear. For customers with more traditional tastes, owner Ursula Boschet is doing 
a brisk "Gone With the Wind" business, partly for people going to a party with 
that theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance costumes, which rent for $50 and up, are also popular, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most sought-after adult costumes this year are simply large 
versions of things kids want to wear -- an Arabian prince and princess or Capt. 
Hook, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult costumes also lean to the romantic, such as Antony and Cleopatra, or 
risque, as in the case of French maids and Playboy bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle Fisher, owner of Robinson Beautilities in Venice, says her most popular 
adult costumes are Scarlett O'Hara, which rents for $30, and Freddy Krueger, 
$50. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher is also turning down O.J. and Nicole requests, but she does offer 
costumes of John Wayne Bobbitt, the Virginia man whose wife last year attacked 
him with a knife and cut off his penis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do him," she said. "We think he's funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween is too much fun to leave to the kids, says sociologist and Halloween 
guru Fredrick Koenig of Tulane University. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, it was a children's holiday. The children made war on the 
adults," he said. "Now the adults have taken over, probably because it was so 
much fun when they were kids." JOHN BUZBEE

SCHOOLS: TEACHERS HELPING STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was delighted to read your extensive coverage of Broadway Elementary School 
("Frowns Turned Upside Down," Oct. 6). In the midst of a neighborhood plagued 
by sporadic gang violence, the principal, teachers and other school staff are 
offering an island of hope for their wonderful students. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often people will give up on a school because of the conditions around it. 
Your article showed how a school can focus positive energies from throughout 
our community and make a real difference for children. I hope your coverage 
will motivate more people and organizations to come forward and offer their 
assistance to Broadway and other schools throughout the Westside. There is no 
better investment of our time and energy.

POLICE: QUESTIONS IN HIRING OF FORMER LAPD OFFICER WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our council in Culver City has avoided the reasons why so many residents have 
shown anger and are upset with the hiring of Timothy Wind. Wind was one of the 
four Los Angeles police officers seen beating Rodney G. King on videotape. The 
irregular and secretive manner in which he was hired and the rationale for his 
selection are issues that have not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 10, in the presence of TV, newspaper and radio reporters and a full 
City Council chamber, the comments opposing the hiring of Wind outnumbered 
those for him by 6 to 1. An often-expressed concern among many who spoke was 
that Wind's hiring sends out a message that Culver City condones police abuse. 
Those objecting to the hiring of Wind presented petitions with more than 700 
signatures to the council. Petitions were gathered in a very short period of 
time as an expression of community outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council failed to respond to the many questions raised about the 
irregularities in the process used in the hiring of Wind. Little or no 
consideration was given by the council in regard to the fact that this rookie 
of only three months' experience was discharged by Chief (Daryl F.) Gates for 
unnecessary use of his baton. Nor did they seem to consider it important that 
Chief (Willie L.) Williams denied reinstatement application. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council responded in a patronizing way. We did not get definitive 
answers to the many questions raised at both this council session and one held 
in September. At the most recent meeting, community opinions were heard, the 
council members then made their statements prior to voting. At no time were 
members of the public allowed an opportunity for further interaction with the 
council. The council then voted unanimously to support Police Chief Ted Cooke's 
decision to hire Timothy Wind, thus giving their consent. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a public relations issue which may develop into a demand for a 
civilian police review board.

UTILITIES: DWP OFFICIAL RESPONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to what was presented in your coverage of the seven municipalities 
fighting for lower electric rates from Southern California Edison Co. ("7 
Cities May Lobby Edison for Discounted Electric Rates," Oct. 16), the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power does pay property taxes in the counties 
of Los Angeles, Inyo, Mono, Riverside and San Bernardino, as well as in Nevada 
and Arizona. It does not pay taxes for properties owned within the city of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the DWP does support municipal services through a traditional 5% 
transfer of its gross revenues to the city's general fund. Over the past 15 
years, the DWP has contributed more than $1 billion to the city. This year, a 
record $197 million is slated to be transferred to support critical city 
operations such as police and fire. This amount is far greater than what would 
have been paid in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the record straight is important. Despite its contributions to the 
city, the DWP has managed to keep its residential rates lower than those of 
Southern California Edison. We will continue to implement cost-cutting measures 
to keep rates low.

OUT AND ABOUT / MR. BONES PUMPKIN PATCH: WHERE HALLOWEEN FANTASIES LIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mr. Bones Pumpkin Patch in Westwood turns the annual search for a ghoulish 
gourd into an escape to Fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The patch, at Wilshire Boulevard and Comstock Avenue, features rows and rows 
of pumpkins surrounded by bales of hay, barnyard animals, giant rocking horses 
and apparitions that include a bicycle-mounted skeleton and a scarecrow. 
</P>
<P>
 For pint-sized pumpkin hunters, it's a thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to come here and hang out with the kids," said Poppy Morgan, a Los 
Angeles native who now makes his home on Maui but returns each year to help run 
the cash register. "It keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the year, the Westwood lot stands dusty and deserted. But Rebecca and 
David Campbell, who lease the site, arrive each October. They sell pumpkins for 
Halloween and remain through the holiday season to sell Christmas trees. The 
Campbells live the rest of the year on their Silverton, Ore., farm, where they 
grow organic produce, pumpkins included, and Christmas trees.  
</P>
<P>
 Selling pumpkins has helped stretch -- and enliven -- their sales season. Said 
Rebecca Campbell: "Doing the pumpkin patch gave me a chance to be a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Campbells bring in three tractor-trailer loads of pumpkins -- 5,000 in all 
-- to meet demand. They say most of their pumpkins, which weigh from half a 
pound to 250 pounds, are generally larger than those offered at local 
supermarkets, whose pumpkins usually weigh less than 30 pounds. Prices range 
from 50 cents to $75, depending on the size of the pumpkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Campbell recommends selecting a pumpkin that is hard. She advises 
against carving it until the day before Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Bones Pumpkin Patch, Wilshire Boulevard and Comstock Avenue, Westwood. 
Hours are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily through Halloween. Pumpkin prices vary.

REGIONAL REPORT; LAWNDALE; CITY SEEKING TO REMOVE ASTROTURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SWEET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the entrance of his Lawndale furniture store, Bill Henderson can see what 
has been lampooned by some as a civic joke and derided by others as a civic 
tragedy -- a swatch of worn, weathered Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks crummy," Henderson said of the dreary artificial lawn that carpets 
the median of Hawthorne Boulevard in front of his store. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawndale -- called "Astrodale" by some -- is a city divided. 
</P>
<P>
 On the northern half of Hawthorne Boulevard, the median is landscaped with 
grass and boulders, Italian cypress and eucalyptus trees. But south of the San 
Diego Freeway, a different spectacle unfolds: balding, faded plastic grass, 
littered with cigarette butts, discarded gum, wrappers and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the United States put a man on the moon, Lawndale carpeted the 
median of its entire strip of Hawthorne Boulevard -- also known as State 
Highway 107 -- with Astroturf. The idea was to save the city maintenance costs, 
the same reason a number of baseball and football stadiums installed the fake 
grass around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But once it became obvious the turf served as a magnet for litter, the city 
had to invest in vacuum cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the City Council decided to landscape anew the medians at 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Marine Avenue. Now, with the remainder of the 
Astroturf nearly 25 years old, the council has asked the state to give up 
control of Lawndale's section of the highway -- a decision that may hasten 
removal of the remaining Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, which currently is responsible for the road, is agreeable. 
</P>
<P>
 But before Caltrans can transfer authority over the roadway, state law 
requires that the agency restore it to a good state of repair.  
</P>
<P>
 Would this include removal of the Astroturf?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's negotiable," said Russ Snyder, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lawndale covered the median -- which once served as a trolley route, 
bridle path and drainage ditch -- with Astroturf in 1970, the product's 
manufacturer, Monsanto Co., gave the city a plaque. Below a strip of Astroturf, 
the citation read: "World's First Astro Grass Traffic Median Installation." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, the color had faded, so the city tried to paint the Astroturf green 
in preparation for the carrying of the Olympic torch through the city. 
Aquamarine ground cover resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Harold Hofmann can't remember the last time the city -- which is paid by 
Caltrans to maintain the highway -- vacuumed the Astroturf. Five years ago, he 
recalled, workers used fire hoses to wash away the trash that had accumulated 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, much of the plastic grass has snapped off. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's left are the circular nubs that once held it. In one spot, the turf 
has split and a strip of concrete shows. 
</P>
<P>
 A Monsanto official said the company stopped manufacturing polyethylene for 
landscaping 15 years ago and said he was startled that Lawndale's turf is still 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got 25 years out of it? That's fantastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is removed, Hofmann has an idea of what the city's reaction will be.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll all say 'Glory, hallelujah!' " he said.

REGIONAL REPORT; CERRITOS; COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR FACES CONFLICT PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cerritos College administrator has been placed on leave pending an 
investigation into conflict-of-interest allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet Be, vice president of student services, allegedly steered foreign 
students to a company he owns to evaluate their transcripts and complete their 
academic files, college President Fred Gaskin said. The company, International 
Service Center, charged students as much as $120 for its services, Gaskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students received letters warning that their transcripts from foreign high 
schools had to be evaluated by the company for them to remain at the college, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the district attorney's office and the Fair Political Practices 
Commission have been asked to investigate the allegations, college officials 
said. Be and his attorney, Glenn Rothner, did not return repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's board of trustees, which placed Be on paid leave Oct. 19, plans 
to meet with him in closed session Nov. 10 to discuss the allegations, Gaskin 
said. The president said he also has ordered the college admissions staff to 
stop sending letters that tell foreign students to send transcripts to Be's 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Be, who was hired in January, 1992, as director of admissions and records, 
apparently began sending the letters to foreign students in January, 1993, 
Gaskin said. The letters told students that high school and college records 
"must be evaluated by the International Service Center." Be had added the 
requirement to a policy that previously required only proficiency in English 
for foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, the admissions office, over which Be had authority, also 
amended the college's general catalogue, adding the requirement that 
international students have their foreign high school work evaluated, Gaskin 
said. The president said he rescinded the policy last week. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials have sent out letters to the 1,400 foreign students who have 
enrolled at Cerritos since 1993 to notify them that they are not required to 
have their transcripts evaluated. The letter also asked students whether the 
company had actually provided the evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they do not know how many students paid for evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Be founded the International Service Center in 1990, according to documents 
filed with the Los Angeles county clerk. The documents listed Be's Canoga Park 
residence at the time as the address of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said college counselors received complaints from students who said 
they never received transcript evaluations after paying for them. Officials 
said they were unable to contact the company because no phone number is given 
on its forms and the address provided on applications is a post office box in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Be was promoted last July to vice president of student services. His salary is 
$90,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before coming to Cerritos College in 1992, Be was assistant director of 
admissions and records at Cal State Northridge. He had been a transcript 
evaluation clerk from 1978 to 1980 at the university, a Cal State Northridge 
spokeswoman said. JOHN COX

REGIONAL REPORT; SAN MARINO; VOTERS WEIGH 4TH POLICE, FIRE TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While city council members in the San Gabriel Valley hear rumblings about 
recalls when they so much as discuss taxes, San Marino Councilman Eugene H. 
Dryden slings the "T" word around without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, voters in his city will decide whether to tax themselves 
several hundred dollars a year to pay for police and fire services. Such a tax 
requires approval of two-thirds of the voters, but Dryden, a supporter of the 
tax measure, Proposition I, isn't too worried. 
</P>
<P>
 City residents have passed the tax three times since 1982. The last time, in 
1990, 76% of the voters cast ballots to spend the money that would keep San 
Marino -- well, San Marino. It is a city with neatly manicured lawns and grand 
homes served by its own police, fire and paramedic agencies, and where 
emergency response times are measured in seconds and serious crimes are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in San Marino are unique in that they are very concerned about 
preserving the city as it is," Dryden said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a median household income of $127,104 and a median home price of more 
than $500,000, San Marino can afford such preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city typifies a situation that is growing increasingly common in 
California: With less state money to even things out, the gap between the have 
cities and the have-not cities is widening. 
</P>
<P>
 "As worried as San Marinians are about crime, they don't confront the crime 
faced by low-income communities that cannot afford these fees and taxes," said 
Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino traditionally ranks among the most crime-free towns in Los Angeles 
County. Tax advocates say that is partly a reflection of the 13,000-resident 
city having its own 26-officer Police Department. Those officers plus 22 
firefighters and nine paramedics working shifts around the clock within a few 
minutes of any street help keep home values up and insurance costs down, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Sierra Madre, the city nearest in size to San Marino, has 11 
sworn police officers and a volunteer Fire Department with a full-time chief 
and two fire inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Response times are much longer in other areas," said Mike Johnson, a former 
San Marino councilman. "We've got to have (the tax)." 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino Police Capt. Gary Isaacs said the departments respond to emergency 
calls within two minutes -- "three minutes, top" -- while surrounding cities 
allow up to a six-minute response time. Pasadena police answer emergency calls 
in three to five minutes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Marino tax was originally enacted in 1982 after Proposition 13, which 
was approved in 1978, rolled back real-estate assessments and set strict caps 
on property taxes. San Marino was hit particularly hard by the property tax 
rollback because with relatively little business, it had a small sales-tax 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 The public safety tax accounts for 25% of the city's budget because in recent 
years the state has grabbed more of the city's tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 If the levy is not renewed and expires in 1995, "the city will lose 
approximately 50% of its police and fire budget and 90% of the paramedic 
service budget," said Bob Twist, chairman of San Marino Citizens for Public 
Safety, the committee for Proposition I. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal opposition group has emerged to fight Proposition I. However, 
resident Gene G. Ruckh has written an argument against the proposition on the 
ballot, asking why the city has not presented residents with a comparison of 
the cost of contracting out services. 
</P>
<P>
 . 
</P>
<P>
 If the measure is approved, it will generate $2.1 million a year in taxes 
added to property tax bills. In fiscal year 1995-96, homeowners would pay $324 
to $881, depending on the size and location of the lot, city officials said. 
The average homeowner would pay $447 annually.

SUBWAY PLAN FOR VALLEY OKD; TRANSIT: MTA BOARD PICKS BURBANK-CHANDLER ROUTE, 
REJECTING AN ELEVATED LINE OVER THE VENTURA FREEWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long political battle over the future of mass transit in the San Fernando 
Valley ended Wednesday in victory for a line to be mostly subway and defeat for 
an elevated railway proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted to approve the mid-Valley 
subway option from Universal City to Canoga Park along Burbank and Chandler 
boulevards. The vote was 8 to 5, although neither side dared predict victory 
until the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great day for the Valley," said Los Angeles County Supervisor and MTA 
Chairman Ed Edelman, the most outspoken defender of the subway alternative, 
after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, an MTA member, introduced the winning 
motion to adopt the subway route and move forward with the environmental 
studies that must be conducted to qualify the project for federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly the right decision," said Riordan, who had supported the 
proposed elevated line over the Ventura Freeway during his election campaign 
last year, but announced Tuesday that he had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he reversed his endorsement because the subway will cost far 
less than believed, serve more heavily populated areas and provide an alternate 
transit corridor in the event of damage to the freeway. It also is supported by 
most homeowner and civic groups in the Valley -- a key political base for the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who has lobbied for years for the rail line 
above the freeway median, lambasted Riordan for "lacking vision." He accused 
the mayor of going "back on his word," and cited a non-binding referendum in 
1990 when the freeway rail option drew the most ballots from Valley voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich characterized the decision as a triumph for interest groups with 
stakes in subway construction. Pointing to the problems plaguing work on the 
Metro Red Line in Hollywood and elsewhere, Antonovich said extending the subway 
into the Valley will be an expensive boondoggle that will drain scarce funds 
from other important transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayers were hit between the eyes by the big liberals who never bat an 
eye spending other people's money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich pressed the case for an elevated freeway line as a cheaper 
alternative and contended that an at-grade railway would cost even less, 
possibly as much as $500 million less than a predominantly underground system. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent studies erased the huge financial advantage planners once ascribed 
to an aerial system. Fellow MTA directors rebuffed Antonovich's last-ditch 
attempt to delay a vote for 90 days to further study the at-grade freeway 
option, a relatively recent idea that he had pushed to make the Ventura Freeway 
route more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to selecting the subway alignment, Riordan's motion called for 
exploring the postponement of some station openings to save money. It also 
asked planners to consider using less costly construction techniques, such as 
putting the rail line in a covered trench rather than traditional deep-bore 
tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's backing of the below-ground route was key to its success before 
the MTA board, which has wrestled with the issue for a decade. Despite a bloc 
of five subway votes going into the meeting, victory was not assured, as both 
sides frantically counted votes and consistently came up short of the majority 
of seven needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the discussion, lobbying continued intensely as board members 
passed notes, drew aside for whispered consultations and jotted facts and 
figures on sheets of paper. The proceedings took on the air of a courtroom 
drama as Antonovich and Edelman chided each other, quizzed planners and 
consultants, produced visual aids to bolster their cases and delivered what 
sounded remarkably like closing arguments to the panel of MTA directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Wilson, a Northridge real estate broker who sits on the MTA board as one 
of Riordan's appointees, gave a slide presentation -- unusual at an MTA meeting 
-- that touched on topics ranging from cost analyses to educational 
demographics, to press the case for a mid-Valley subway line. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade of elected officials from the Valley -- including Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) -- also made appeals, mostly on behalf of the 
Burbank-Chandler route. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen audience members testified, to scattered cheers and jeers 
from the packed hearing room. One man was dragged away by police officers when 
he refused to leave the lectern after Edelman cut off public discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, voting for the subway were Edelman, Riordan, Wilson, Los Angeles 
Councilman Nate Holden (sitting in for Councilman Richard Alatorre, who 
underwent oral surgery and was absent from the afternoon meeting), Los Angeles 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky (standing in for Riordan appointee Stan Sanders), 
county Supervisors Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Gardena City 
Councilman Jim Cragin. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the motion were Antonovich, county Supervisor Deane Dana, Huntington 
Park Councilman Raul Perez, Glendale Councilman Larry Zarian and Duarte 
Councilman John Fasana.

OUTCRY PROMPTS MAYOR TO REVISE HOMELESS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Riordan Administration, under pressure from outraged advocates for the 
homeless, is repackaging a controversial plan to build a Downtown Los Angeles 
homeless drop-in facility as a rest stop and service center for transients 
instead of an overnight campground. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Rae James said she will present a resolution to the city's 
Community and Economic Development Committee today stating that the mayor's 
office has no intention of building an encampment where police will force 
Downtown homeless people to live.  
</P>
<P>
 She said the facility would only be used as a place where transients could 
rest briefly on a grass lawn, shower and receive job training and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make it clear we are not building a camp," said James, who met 
with homeless advocates in a closed-door meeting Wednesday intended to dispel 
their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the advocates, however, accused the mayor's office of playing a 
rhetoric game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could call it an industrial resort, if you want," said Alice Callaghan, 
director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a Skid Row social service center. "Their 
intention is very clear: They want to reduce the visibility of the homeless by 
sending them to the city's 'humane alternative.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, an internment camp is still an internment camp." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy started several weeks ago, when the mayor's office -- under 
pressure from the Downtown business community -- released its plan to spend $4 
million of a $20-million U.S. Housing and Urban Development grant on a homeless 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the mayor's plan, the city would buy a vacant lot in the industrial zone 
east of Downtown and transform it into a fenced, landscaped area where homeless 
people could sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility would include a 50-bed shelter, showers, restrooms and lockers, 
along with a service center where homeless people could receive drug and job 
counseling. The center would serve up to 800 people a day. Vans staffed by 
social workers would be provided to shuttle homeless people to the site, James 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview earlier this month, James herself described the outdoor 
portion of the facility as a "campground." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, she sought to back away from that description. 
</P>
<P>
 "A campground makes it sound like people can stay there, which they cannot," 
she said. "But can they rest there? Yes, they will probably be allowed to rest 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Backtracking on another aspect of the original proposal, James said Wednesday 
that homeless people may not be allowed to sleep on the lawn overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "How long they will be allowed to rest depends on the implementation plan," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's proposal is expected to be considered next month by the City 
Council after it is reviewed by two council panels: the Community and Economic 
Development Committee and the Housing and the Community Redevelopment 
Committee. Because the plan is part of a joint city-county program, it also 
will require approval by the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles Coalition to End Homelessness said that although 
they support a facility where homeless people can receive services, they are 
opposed to any outdoor sleeping facility -- even if transients are only allowed 
to rest there for short periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see it as a first step on a slippery slope down to concentration camps in 
rural areas for homeless people," said Gary Blasi, a UCLA law professor and 
coalition board member. "No one wants to take that first step." 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the mayor's office of seeking to hide Downtown's homeless problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's dealing with homelessness as an aesthetic problem for the Downtown 
business community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gene Boutilier, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless Services 
Authority, defended the mayor's plan, saying it could provide crucial services. 
He said he has no objections to giving homeless people an outdoor area where 
they can rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm the government and I tell you, 'Here's a patch of grass where you will 
stay,' then I would be opposed to that," he said. "But if I build a park and 
you chose to lie down and take a nap, and you have other alternatives, I think 
that's fine."

LOOKING YOUNGER; ASTRONOMY: DATA FROM THE HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE SUPPORTS 
RECENT FINDINGS THAT THE COSMOS IS FAR NEWER THAN SCIENTISTS THOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have produced the most compelling 
evidence yet that the cosmos is younger than scientists previously thought, 
calling into question the estimated age of the stars and the Big Bang theory 
itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Their calculations, made public Wednesday, are significantly more accurate and 
broader in scope than two other recent estimates of the age of the universe. 
Taken together, all three studies strongly suggest that the expanding fabric of 
the universe -- that void between the stars and galaxies -- may be considerably 
younger than the stars themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 An international team of 22 scientists, led by Pasadena astronomer Wendy L. 
Freedman at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution and Barry F. Madore 
at Caltech, used NASA's orbiting telescope and a special camera designed at the 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory to determine just how fast the universe is expanding 
with unprecedented accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 That allowed them to determine that the universe is between 8 billion and 12 
billion years old. This contrasts with more conventional estimates, based on 
the age of stars and less precise measurements of intergalactic distances, 
which range from 16 billion to 20 billion years old. 
</P>
<P>
 While the work has Hubble scientists celebrating, the new calculations are 
beginning to create a major headache for cosmologists. The Hubble study, 
combined with the most precise measures available from ground-based 
observatories, apparently indicates there is a possibility that the way 
scientists view the universe is somehow flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the ages of the stars too high? Is there an unexplained force at work to 
accelerate matter in the cosmos? Or is the Big Bang theory itself incorrect?  
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be a controversy growing here," said UC Berkeley astronomer 
Alexi V. Filippenko. If the current results are confirmed and refined through 
additional observations, "then we will really have a dilemma," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might lead to a revolution in cosmology which would be a very very 
exciting thing," Filippenko said. "We may have to consider some new perhaps 
wild ideas. Maybe there is another force pushing the universe out or something 
like that. That's exciting. That's what science is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman's team used the space telescope to develop the most precise yardstick 
yet for measuring the size, scale and age of the universe by determining the 
distance from Earth to a distant spiral galaxy called M100.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the lens of its recently refurbished Wide Field/Planetary Camera, they 
scanned 40,000 stars to locate 20 rare pulsating cepheid guide stars in M100, 
located in the Virgo cluster. Astronomers can use the variable stars to 
estimate the distance from Earth to the dense stellar cloud. It is the most 
distant galaxy in which the cepheid variable stars have been detected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The speed at which they pulsate reveals their distance," Freedman said. "The 
trick is to find them." The stars are so distant and so faint that "only space 
telescope can make these types of observations routinely." 
</P>
<P>
 The accurate measurement of the distance to M100 -- 56 million light-years -- 
allowed them to calculate the velocity at which the universe is expanding, 
called the Hubble constant, which is a measure of how the universe has grown 
since the primordial Big Bang. That expansion was discovered by astronomer 
Edwin Hubble, for whom the orbiting telescope is named.  
</P>
<P>
 The NASA team's calculations, published today in the journal Nature, indicate 
that the universe is expanding so fast that a galaxy about 1 million 
light-years away will appear to be receding from Earth at approximately 60,000 
m.p.h. If it is twice that distance, it will appear from Earth to be moving at 
twice that speed. The galaxy M100 is receding at a speed of about 3 million 
m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "This galaxy is the most distant object that anyone ever expected (the) space 
telescope to be able to get to, and it was dead easy," Madore said. "Now we 
know we can do Virgo. And in fact it was so easy we know we can go three times 
farther than Virgo. The space telescope is working at a level that is 
unprecedented, unexpected and beyond specification." 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers emphasized that although the current assessment of the Hubble 
constant and the universe's age is the most carefully calculated to date, they 
still have at least three years of additional work with the space telescope 
before they will have an answer they consider definitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hubble constant has been fraught with controversy for some time," said 
John P. Huchra, a Harvard University astronomer on the Hubble team. "There are 
also other forces that affect the way galaxies move and we have to work on that 
as well."  
</P>
<P>
 The speed at which the galaxies recede, for example, is "modified, twisted and 
warped" by the force of gravity in ways not yet well understood, he said. 
Without knowing exactly how much matter the universe contains, scientists can 
only guess as best they can how gravity affects the rate at which the universe 
is expanding.

A NEW CYCLE; A LAUNDRY RISES FROM THE RUBBLE OF A LIQUOR STORE BURNED IN RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They celebrated a victory Wednesday on South San Pedro Street, directly across 
from the Thankful Missionary Baptist Church and next door to the Watson Bros.' 
hand carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Whang's new O-Matic Laundromat rose from the ashes of his Ma's Liquor, 
a store that had burned down at 89th Street and San Pedro in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 As victories go, the opening of a laundry normally doesn't register that high 
on the public attention scale. And no one at Wednesday's opening -- city 
officials, bankers, representatives from redevelopment groups or community 
activists -- tried to portray the new laundry as an economic panacea for 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And there were certainly skeptics who wished the $750,000 venture well but 
doubt that the business makes economic sense except as a money-losing tax 
write-off. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a community where the concentration of liquor stores has long been seen 
as tangible evidence of malign neglect, finding the money to convert a liquor 
store to a laundry is an important triumph, however symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," Sylvester Watson, who has run the carwash next door since 
1957, said of the new building. He said he was sorry to see Whang's liquor 
store destroyed because Whang "helped people when they didn't have money. He 
treated people like they wanted to be treated. I'm so glad to have him back." 
</P>
<P>
 The parking area in front of the laundry was decorated with bouquets of 
balloons that were later handed out to toddlers who were brought over from the 
Green Meadows preschool across the street. And Pepe Garibay and his Mariachi 
Pueblo Nuevo serenaded guests who snacked on hors d'oeuvres served by members 
of block clubs on 91st and 92nd streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a day of celebration," said Los Angeles City Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, but the question for Jae Yul Kim, president of the Korean 
American Grocers' Victims Assn., was whether the new business would generate 
enough cash flow to be viable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he'll succeed, but I hope that he does," said Kim, whose 
group is made up of merchants whose businesses were destroyed during the riots. 
"We don't know about this kind of business." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Whang, who still owns a liquor store in the San Fernando Valley, can 
use the laundry as a tax write-off if it loses money. Unlike Whang, he said, 
most of his 177 members "have to survive from one business." 
</P>
<P>
 Whang conceded that the numbers associated with his new business leave him 
worried. He has a $350,000 disaster recovery loan from the U.S. Small Business 
Administration and a $300,000 loan from the Community Financial Resources 
Center, a nonprofit organization of bankers, city agencies and community 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city waived $130,000 in sewage hookup fees for his 56 washing machines, 
and he has put $100,000 of his own money into the business conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was faced with difficult choices, he said. After the riots, a City 
Council program discouraged rebuilding of liquor stores, and liquor license 
renewals became very difficult to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had given up the liquor store and abandoned the property, I don't make 
anything," he said. Insurance covered only $200,000 of the $700,000 loss, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly his mood brightened to match that of the festive occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK," he said. "I'm optimistic. If I worry too much, I can't do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he doesn't expect to realize a profit from the store and will be happy 
if the business can cover his $6,000-a-month overhead. If that happens, he 
said, he will have $300,000 in equity after six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Whang said the waiver of the sewage hookup fee was an important reason he 
chose to build a laundry, but he added, "My main reason for a laundry is that 
it is a proper business at that location." 
</P>
<P>
 The new laundry symbolizes how a community of African Americans and Latinos in 
South-Central, a Korean American merchant and the business conversion program 
run by the Korean Youth and Community Center can work together in a way that 
benefits them all, said Karen Bass, executive director of the Community 
Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass' organization has spearheaded recent efforts to combat the proliferation 
of liquor stores in South-Central Los Angeles. There are about 500 liquor 
stores in an area bounded by the Santa Monica Freeway, Imperial Highway, 
Alameda Street and La Brea Avenue, Bass said. Before the riots, there were 
about 700, she said, adding that 200 were destroyed and 25 have been rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 She recognizes that only so many laundries can be built, but that there are 
other alternatives to liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community needs so many things -- restaurants, dry cleaners, movie 
theaters . . . on and on," she said Wednesday. "I want to see this area look 
like West L.A. I shouldn't have to drive to West L.A. to go to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting the laundry built "was a long, hard struggle," said Bong Hwan Kim, 
executive director of the Korean Youth and Community Center. He said his 
organization and Bass' community coalition "inherited the baggage of 
black-Korean tensions that date back before the riots." 
</P>
<P>
 But members of both organizations recognized that they "couldn't allow 
hyperinflated racial tensions to get in the way of (residents and merchants) 
getting on with their lives," he said. "People don't know each other. A 
disproportionate amount of blame was put on racial issues when it's really an 
economic issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest thing in trying to redevelop South-Central and find models for 
businesses other than liquor stores, he said, "is trying to work through the 
land mines these racial tensions create." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass and others said the laundry is a small but important step toward 
negotiating those minefields more skillfully, and one area resident said it is 
already evidence of better understanding between blacks and Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Whang and I had to learn to communicate," said Elizabeth McClellan, a 
member of the Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, 
who opposed rebuilding a liquor store on the site. "We had to learn to be 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 McClellan said she has lost all patience with media reports of tensions 
between African Americans and Korean American business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not racial," she said. "It's more an issue of not being able to 
communicate."

ARCHDIOCESE TO CLOSE HIGH SCHOOL SEMINARY; PRIESTHOOD: RISING COSTS, DECLINING 
ENROLLMENT AT MISSION HILLS CAMPUS ARE CITED. PROJECTS WILL BE LAUNCHED TO AID 
RECRUITMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the spring of 1954, an 18-year-old seminary student graduated from a newly 
opened campus in the San Fernando Valley. He continued through the Los Angeles 
Catholic seminary system to become a priest, bishop and eventually the cardinal 
of the Los Angeles archdiocese. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it fell to Cardinal Roger M. Mahony to announce earlier this month that 
he must close his own alma mater, Our Lady Queen of Angels High School Seminary 
in Mission Hills. It was a sad task made sadder by a central fact behind the 
closure: Fewer teen-age boys nurtured in the seminary are following in Mahony's 
footsteps all the way to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 A church study showed that rising costs were surpassing financial resources to 
operate Queen of Angels, and that no more than 5% of the freshmen expected to 
enroll in the next decade could be counted on to complete priesthood training, 
which requires 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen of Angels was already one of the last of the nation's so-called junior, 
or minor, seminaries. In 1968, there were 133 Catholic high school seminaries 
in the United States, but only nine will remain -- none in the western states 
-- when the campus closes in July.  
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly have been a dying breed," said Father John Klein of Chicago, 
president of the Assn. of High School Seminaries. "The resources become 
scarcer, and this is one place where the cuts occur."  
</P>
<P>
 There are 155 students at the Mission Hills campus, slightly more than five 
and 10 years ago, and well above the late 1970s, when there was a perilous drop 
to fewer than 100 students. The Jan. 17 earthquake forced the archdiocese to 
assess its financial resources for recovery. An archdiocesan committee 
recommended that the high school seminary be closed and that new projects be 
launched at parish and private Catholic high schools to encourage young men to 
consider the priesthood. In September, the seminary board endorsed the 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and faculty "were pretty much saddened," said Father James Anguiano, 
the seminary's rector. "There are a lot of memories here."  
</P>
<P>
 Anguiano and Jerome Porath, superintendent of Catholic schools, have pledged 
to help seven lay teachers and 20 staff workers find new jobs and to relocate 
about 100 of the 155 students to other Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates who intend to become priests of the Los Angeles Archdiocese go from 
the high school to spend eight years at St. John's Seminary in Camarillo. The 
trouble is, not enough of them do.  
</P>
<P>
 If they do not make it through the system of training for priesthood, "then 
maybe there's a better way," said Sister Leo Francis O'Callaghan, who teaches 
chemistry and is dean of students. She leafed through several lists of past 
graduating seniors, counting no more than two each year who became priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the president of the school's student body, Matthias Mendez of 
South-Central Los Angeles, is having second thoughts about becoming a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found that I'm not ready yet," Mendez said, standing in the hallway of the 
seminary's Spanish mission-style building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a priest requires a lot of sacrifices and self-discipline. It's not 
totally out of my mind; it's still possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Queen of Angels seminarians get only a partial taste of what it might mean to 
lead the priestly life. They live on campus Sunday through Thursday nights, 
then leave for the weekend after Friday classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an opportunity to appreciate our families and our homes more, and 
at the same time get a sense of brotherhood by living most of the time with 
other seminarians," Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Cranham, business manager for the seminary for most of the last 30 
years, said that times have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years ago, boys came here intending to become priests," she said. 
"Today, it's a discerning process for them: 'Do I really want to be a priest?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people becoming priests and nuns reached a high-water mark in 
the mid-1960s; at Queen of Angels, enrollment reached 362 students in 1965. The 
ensuing decline coincided with church controversies over reforms introduced by 
the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) and the American sexual and social 
revolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the high school's enrollment has rebounded in recent years (partly 
because of an influx of minority students, including 55 Vietnamese now 
enrolled), the man in charge of recruitment for the Los Angeles archdiocese 
said church leaders hope to reach even greater numbers of young men while 
spending less money and using fewer personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard to replace the kind of peer support you get at an 
actual school," said Father Richard Martini, who was rector of the seminary 
before becoming vocations director this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The vocations office hopes to establish nurturing groups at high schools and 
periodic retreats, among other strategies.  
</P>
<P>
 "The new plan would call for groups of a minimum of 50 students in each of the 
five regions of the archdiocese, which would mean that we would be dealing with 
250 students, compared to the 150 or so in the seminary now," Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a risk -- we know what we had before and we liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess some things you leave up to God," he said. "But we really won't be 
able to make comparisons until 18 years from now."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; COUPLE SUE 
CATALINA EXPRESS OVER FATAL BOAT ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Puente couple said Tuesday that a Catalina Channel Express vessel 
"carelessly" sped close by their small, crowded pleasure boat off San Pedro 
last month, capsizing the little boat in an accident that took the life of 
their 3-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony and Elena Romero made their claim in a wrongful-death lawsuit filed 
Tuesday in Long Beach Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romeros say their 24-foot boat -- with 19 people -- was floating near a 
navigation buoy about three-quarters of a mile outside one of the entrances to 
Los Angeles Harbor on Sept. 4 when a 100-foot Catalina Express vessel sped by 
"at such high speed and in such close proximity" that the wake swamped and 
overturned the smaller boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Romero died when he was trapped in the submerged cabin, and three 
children were hospitalized with hypothermia after spending several hours in the 
water before help arrived. The couple deny Coast Guard suggestions that their 
boat may have been overloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Catalina Channel Express declined comment pending further 
study of the lawsuit. The Coast Guard said it has yet to determine the cause of 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 However, navigation charts warn that the pilot area in which the Romeros were 
fishing is reserved for vessels -- like the Catalina express boat -- that are 
entering or leaving the harbor. Officials said there are no specific speed 
limits outside the harbor.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FILMING FOR X-RATED 
MOVIE CREATES A STIR IN BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a city that flaunts its ties to the entertainment industry, Burbank police 
clerk Norma Brolsma did not think twice about granting a permit to yet another 
filmmaker wanting to shoot in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 What Brolsma said she did not know was that the scenes were for an X-rated 
movie involving oral copulation and intercourse at the city's water and power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoot for "Fantasy Chamber" by the Ultimate Video production company last 
weekend alarmed some plant employees who arrived for work Sunday morning to see 
sexual gymnastics involving groups of two and three actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the type of image we want for the city," said Ron Stassi, general 
manager of the city's Public Services Department, who fielded several 
complaints from his employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Two city workers told The Times that as they reported to work Sunday morning, 
they saw an actress having sex with two men at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Dave Newsham said he saw nothing wrong with his department's 
handling of the application. Brolsma said she was aware that mild nudity would 
be involved in the filming. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Bud Ovrom said the permit "slipped through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 "But its not a major crisis. We'll find a procedure to correct it in the 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's policy for granting film permits, which is now limited to 
determining how many people are in the cast and crew, whether special effects 
or stunts will be done, and if interior or exterior shots are needed, will be 
reviewed, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Nick and Anthony Pinkowski, who operate Ultimate Video in Chatsworth, 
contend that they made it clear to the Burbank Police Department that they were 
in the adult entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantasy Chamber" refers to a sensory deprivation tank in the movie that 
enables anyone who steps inside it to visualize sexual fantasies. Burbank's 
water and power plant on North Lake Street seemed to be the perfect spot to 
film them, the brothers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The power plant has been used for filming scenes for the movie "Thelma and 
Louise" and another picture starring Hulk Hogan. Burbank issues permits for 
filming between 175 and 200 productions a year. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 6 ARRESTED IN RAID ON 
LARGE DRUG LABORATORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A methamphetamine lab in Southeast Los Angeles that was producing as much as 
100 pounds of the drug a week was raided Tuesday night by narcotics officials, 
who arrested six people and are still searching for the suspected mastermind. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusually large operation is yet another sign that California has become 
the major national distribution center for methamphetamine, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gallardo said the state's Clandestine Lab Task Force, which he supervises, 
has raided 105 labs statewide this year, compared to 103 in all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now it is a major problem" in California, Gallardo said. "In the last 
month, we've hit a lab this size or greater at the rate of one a week . . . and 
we're still missing a whole lot of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The raid in Los Angeles on Tuesday was unusual, officials said, because most 
labs located in the city are "bathtub" operations that produce no more than a 
pound or two of the drug per week. A telltale pungent odor, caused by mixing 
hydrochloride gas, Freon and other chemicals, gives away bigger manufacturers 
in dense urban settings, so most large labs are in remote locations, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents arrested six people on drug manufacturing and distribution charges. A 
seventh suspected member of the manufacturing ring, whom officials would not 
identify, remains at large. Investigators seized equipment, chemicals and 
$70,000 at a furniture factory at McKinley and Slauson avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the industrial building, investigators said they found the suspects 
operating from a maze-like warren of small rooms, some of which were used as 
laboratories and others to store the toxic chemicals used to make the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Making crystal methamphetamine is lucrative. A pound of the pure drug can be 
sold wholesale for as much as $10,000. On the street, prices average $100 a 
gram. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force learned of the McKinley Avenue operation when a police officer 
reported smelling a methamphetamine lab in the area. After getting a search 
warrant, authorities arrested a man leaving the warehouse with approximately 
$60,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, about 10 p.m., members of the task force demanded that the suspects 
open the steel gate of the warehouse driveway. After stalling for a few 
moments, which investigators believe allowed the ringleader to escape, the 
suspects opened the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs were being cooked in a bathroom outfitted with heating mantles, 
condensers, glass tubing and four 22-liter boiling flasks, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was not a bathtub operation," said one agent. "They knew what . . . they 
were doing and they'd been doing it for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last six years, the methamphetamine industry has been dominated by 
undocumented Mexican nationals, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Five of those arrested Tuesday were Mexican nationals: Elizabeth Barrios, 18; 
Jesus Perez-Nunez, 20; Alex Sanchez, 21; Hector Landa, 25, and Vicente Sarrata, 
43. Also arrested was Jacquelin Artecona, 24. Their arraignment is scheduled 
for today.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
ROBBINS WON'T APPEAL LOSS OF REAL ESTATE LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Sen. Alan Robbins has decided not to seek the reinstatement of 
his real estate license, which was stripped by state officials this year 
because of his political corruption conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 State real estate Commissioner Clark Wallace ruled in March that Robbins' 
license should be revoked because his crimes went to the heart of the issues of 
truthfulness, honesty and moral turpitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal documents, Robbins argued economic hardship and asked for at least a 
restrictive license that would have allowed him to perform limited 
transactions. Robbins, who amassed his wealth through real estate deals, has 
argued that without the license he will be unable to repay the approximately $4 
million he owes the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip Griffin said Robbins' attorneys would have had a 
difficult time recovering the license through appeal unless they uncovered an 
error in law or abuse of discretion. But Robbins could still recover the 
license by waiting two years and reapplying.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; FORMER 
CHARITY WORKER CHARGED IN ALLEGED SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn filed criminal charges Wednesday against a 
man who allegedly tried to pocket donations intended for a charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn alleged that Barry Aldon Thomas, 31, ran the "first charity scam of the 
holiday season."  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles man, who once worked for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., 
allegedly sent out appeals for donations in the association's name.  
</P>
<P>
 The letters were written on what appeared to be legitimate association 
stationery and were accompanied by an authentic copy of the organization's 
federal tax-exempt status.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas allegedly claimed that the association had moved to Beverly Hills, and 
he asked that prospective donors send money to the new address, which turned 
out to be a mail drop that he rented, Hahn said.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began after a worker at a Warner Bros. Studio Store got a 
letter and checked with the association to verify the letter's claims.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was charged with two counts of attempted theft and charity fraud. He is 
scheduled for arraignment Nov. 14 in Los Angeles Municipal Court.

KIDNAPERS RETURN THEIR MONSTER STASH IN AZUSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-foot Frankenstein balloon kidnaped from an Azusa rooftop Sunday morning 
was found in a local McDonald's parking lot Wednesday with a note explaining 
why the kidnapers returned him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roses are red, vampires' teeth are too," began the note."We'd love to have 
Franky for Halloween but so would the kids who loved to be scared. So we're 
giving him back . . . BOO!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Franky," as he has been dubbed by the city's recreation staff, was stolen 
from the top of the Security Pacific building in the 300 block of North Citrus 
Avenue, Azusa Police Sgt. Patrick Doyle said. Franky's job was to direct 
residents to Azusa's Haunted House, a fund-raiser for the recreation 
department, Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the city offered a $250 reward for the return of the $6,000 
inflatable monster. Doyle said nobody had requested the reward.

BLACK PANTHER MURAL BACKERS REJECT FUNDING; POLITICS: ARTS GROUP ACCUSES THE 
CITY OF TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE PROJECT, WHICH IS TO INCLUDE A DEPICTION OF 
HUEY NEWTON HOLDING A GUN. COUNCILMAN HOLDEN HAS BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC.

 Saying a battle with city officials was threatening to cripple their 
organization, members of a nonprofit public arts group Wednesday turned down 
city funding for a controversial mural of the Black Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With great pain, I say, 'We give up,' " said Judy Baca, founder of the Social 
and Public Arts Resource Center, which annually produces a slate of 
city-sponsored public art projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca said city officials had threatened to pull the plug on SPARC's $250,000 
contract for the current budget year unless SPARC dropped the mural from its 
list of city-funded projects. An official at the city's Cultural Affairs 
Commission, which approved the mural earlier this month, said the contract has 
been held up by paperwork. The mayor's office, which must sign the contract, 
did not respond to a request for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca said the mural probably will still be painted, without public funding, on 
the wall of a barbershop at 11th Avenue and Jefferson Boulevard near the 
Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Noni Olabisi's tribute to the Black Panthers attracted considerable 
opposition and won approval from the city Cultural Affairs Commission only 
after nearly a year of debate. It was criticized for its title ("To Protect and 
Serve") and the fact that it featured Panthers co-founder Huey Newton with a 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca criticized Councilman Nate Holden, in whose district the barbershop is 
located, for trying to stall the project even after it gained Cultural Affairs 
Commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he wants the City Council to formally ask that the mural site be 
changed.  
</P>
<P>
 He likened placing the mural in a drug- and gang-infested area to "shouting 
fire in a crowded theater," and asked rhetorically why the only murals of 
blacks "that show hanging, lynching and pain are the ones in South-Central?" 
</P>
<P>
 Holden denied trying to hold up SPARC's funding, but said he would have done 
so if the group had not backed down. "Then I would question their motives, 
their . . . concern for my constituency." 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-foot-long mural, which would be accompanied by text explaining the 
Black Panthers' history, has Newton as its centerpiece, but also includes 
scenes of the Panthers' breakfast program and a Panther rescue of a black man 
from a Ku Klux Klan noose. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca is one of Los Angeles' most renowned visual artists, being the principal 
leader on such works as the half-mile-long "Great Wall of L.A." along the 
Tujunga Wash. SPARC has done 73 murals in its Neighborhood Pride program since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said the Panthers mural was planned for a location he called a "crime 
scene," referring to an Oct. 13 police raid on the barber shop, Hair 
Expressions. The raid resulted in two arrests and the confiscation of several 
bags of marijuana on customers and two handguns, one in a store cabinet.  
</P>
<P>
 Baca charged that police staged the raid in response to the Cultural Affairs 
Commission's approval of the mural a week earlier, and accused police of a 
smear campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Trinka Porrata denied the accusation, saying residents had 
complained about the shop for months, but that the LAPD South Bureau narcotics 
squad was too strapped for personnel to go to the shop before Oct. 13. The 
barbershop's owner, meanwhile, said police had only come by before for 
haircuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca defended the mural, saying that although it has been pulled from her 
group's Neighborhood Pride program, she would be happy to help work on it. She 
called the mural "a way to dispel violence. The role models the kids have right 
now are gangsters. There have never been perfect leaders -- look at Nate 
Holden." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the fact that Newton holds a gun across his chest in the mural does 
not make it threatening, noting that Army recruiting posters show figures 
holding guns. "It's all a question of who's holding them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Baca and Holden claim that community opinion is on their side. Baca's 
group says it held more than a dozen meetings to get community input. Holden 
insists that residents have been clamoring against the mural, and that several 
church officials have also opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not right-wing and I'm not coming after her (artist Olabisi), and the 
church members are not right-wing," Holden said. But "when we're in a war we 
have to use whatever weapons we can," he told the City Council on Wednesday, 
saying that banned assault weapons should not be favorably displayed on murals.

DANCE REVIEW; 'KAGUYAHIME' ASCENDS TO THE HEIGHTS; JIRI KYLIAN'S NEDERLANDS 
DANS THEATER TRANSFORMS A THEATER . . . LITERALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jiri Kylian's dance drama "Kaguyahime" is a tale of miracles and the first one 
is his transformation of the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 To house Kylian's 1988, two-act vehicle for Nederlands Dans Theater, the 
adjustable proscenium of Segerstrom Hall was opened on Tuesday as never before, 
to its maximum, 68-foot width. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the scenic and lighting hardware above the stage were lowered into 
view, forming sculptural configurations and moving cloudlike formations in 
designer Michael Simon's epic tribute to the magic of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The score by Japanese composer Maki Ishii began with the distant whine of a 
flute, building over about 100 minutes to an onstage storm of galvanic 
taiko-style drumming by the 17-member Circle Percussion group before subsiding 
again. Conducted by Michael de Roo, it occasionally flirted with multicultural 
New Age platitudes, but mostly sustained an invigorating focus on rhythmic 
propulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditioned by their constantly changing spatial and sonic environments, the 
22 dancers in the cast nonetheless moved with the exhilarating technical 
freedom remembered from the company's last Southland visit, 14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The director of Nederlands Dans Theater since 1975, Kylian is celebrated 
justly for fusing modern dance and ballet techniques. "Kaguyahime" affords many 
astonishing group passages in which the weighty, twisty angularity of 
contemporary motion suddenly heats up, accelerates and explodes into 
ballet-based jumps and air-turns. 
</P>
<P>
 The brilliance of this group dancing is another miracle of "Kaguyahime," 
though it often undercuts the downbeat message that Kylian is at pains to 
deliver. Based on a 10th-Century Japanese myth, his narrative involves a 
disastrously irresistible young woman who turns out to be supernatural: a 
moonbeam in human form. 
</P>
<P>
 Her presence in human society allows Kylian to comment on our compulsion to 
possess the unattainable, on sexual hostility and tribal hatred, on ecological 
exploitation and brute power at its most pitiless. 
</P>
<P>
 A moonbeam may seem much too delicate to stand up to all that malignant force, 
but in the most spectacular theatrical coup of the evening, she proves more 
than equal to the task: 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from a huge, billowing canopy of golden silk, a character named the 
Mikado (Paul Lightfoot) ensnares and manipulates the distraught Kaguyahime 
(Fiona Lummis) until her submission or rape seem inevitable. But with a sudden 
tilt of upstage mirror-panels, a blinding, unearthly glare swallows up and 
neutralizes the Mikado once and for all. It also envelops everyone in the 
audience but, this time at least, we are allowed to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 You could argue that Kylian doesn't really tell the story clearly until this 
episode and that Kaguyahime's long ascension solo at the end is the weakest 
choreography of the evening. You might even complain that much of the spectacle 
is diversionary and that Kylian's dances for the warring social factions are 
just too kinetically overwhelming for us to ever consider what they're supposed 
to mean. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough, but "Kaguyahime" is much bigger than Kylian's expressive 
intentions. He wants to tell us that life is hopeless and human nature 
impossibly corrupt -- but what we see is a theater of wonders and a company of 
superb artists sharing an ideal of human creation. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice is easy. Through the heartbeat of its drumming, the unstinting 
energy of its dancers and, yes, the inspired fervor of its choreography, 
"Kaguyahime" ends up life-affirming in spite of itself. And that may be the 
greatest miracle of all. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nederlands Dans Theater repeats "Kaguyahime" tonight at 8, then presents a 
five-part Kylian program on Friday and Saturday , as well as Sunday afternoon 
at 2. Tickets: $18 to $55. Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town 
Center Drive, Costa Mesa. (714) 740-2000.

RETROSPECTIVE OF A VIRTUOSO; ART REVIEW: LACMA'S R.B. KITAJ EXHIBITION 
REAFFIRMS HIS MASTERFUL ABILITY, BUT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS INTIMATE, 
CONFESSIONAL TOUCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The art of American expatriate painter and draftsman R.B. Kitaj is under 
review in a full-dress retrospective of more than 100 works at the County 
Museum of Art. Organized for LACMA by Stephanie Barron, the museum's 
coordinator of curatorial affairs, it originated at London's Tate Gallery and 
will travel to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Its catalogue is 
handsome. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985 Kitaj, who lives in London, was elected to membership in the Royal 
Academy, only the third American so honored in as many centuries. (The others 
were Benjamin West and John Singer Sargent.) The exhibition visits Los Angeles 
as part of the UK/LA 1994 Festival celebration of British arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ceremonial first-cabin treatment of Kitaj's art comes as something of a 
blow. Many who have admired the artist's work for decades assumed he would 
always be one of those very gifted, slightly underrated figures esteemed by 
those with the discrimination to appreciate such unfashionable virtues as being 
able to draw and taking an intensely literate approach to the visual arts. 
Finding him in this condition is a little like discovering a secret love 
starring in a Las Vegas extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj's great virtue as an artist has been his ability to create the 
impression of cleaving to the Beat Generation's archetype of the outsider. He 
was born in Cleveland in 1932, and as a teen-ager he shipped out as a merchant 
seaman. Like a character out of Conrad, he became a ferocious autodidact, 
devouring Lost Generation literature in his bunk and losing his virginity in a 
Havana brothel. You have to like a guy like that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s his art studies were interrupted when he was drafted into the Army 
and did a peacetime stint stationed in Germany. Mustered out, he settled in 
London, the perfect move for an artist of wide interests and a dedication to 
obscurity. British artists from William Blake to Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud 
are famous for being obscure. London is a town for gregarious hermits. You can 
know every artist and intellectual in the city and still feel deliciously 
alienated. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj's first museum exhibition was organized by Maurice Tuchman and appeared 
at LACMA in 1965, the heyday of the Pop era. The reigning style was visible in 
the poster-like punch of Kitaj's compositions. Paintings such as "The Ohio 
Gang" and "Where the Railroad Leaves the Sea" seemed somehow derived from old 
American film noir. Images such as "The Murder of Rosa Luxemburg" confronted 
large social issues, but all the populist and intellectual allusions had 
clearly been translated to express the artist's private preoccupations. The 
work was basically autobiographical. Pop strove for an almost mechanically 
detached irony. Kitaj's work, by contrast, was heartfelt, intimate and a little 
neurotic. There was a muffled erotic charge to the pictures that felt troubled 
but authentically human in that era of go-go sex. The slight European mustiness 
and Angst of it all was oddly refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj's art has never lost that intimate, confessional touch. Portraits of the 
'70s such as "From London (James Joll and John Golding)" are tricked out to 
have large symbolic meanings. Their real strength, however, comes from the 
vivid sense of the contact between artist and subject. A picture such as "The 
Hispanist (Nissa Torrents)" wafts the viewer to the flat of a member of an 
inbred expatriate culture floating rootless except for the anchor of its 
thoughts and the company of fellow castaways. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to the catalogue, Kitaj is widely acquainted with the various 
spheres of art. He's visited film directors such as Jean Renoir, drawn poets 
such as John Ashbery and Kenneth Rexroth, organized a controversial exhibition 
of London artists and published various essays. In 1989 he brought out the 
"First Diasporist Manifesto." It was the result of a decade of rediscovering 
his previously ignored identity as a Jew. He began thinking about what he calls 
"The Jewishness of Jewish Art." It was as if the Existential outsider finally 
wanted roots. 
</P>
<P>
 His work became more expressionistic in form, making allusions to Soutine, 
Chagall and the Germans. There are subjects such as "The Jewish Rider," "The 
Jew Etc." and others such as "Germania (The Tunnel)" that allude to the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrospective does nothing to diminish admiration for Kitaj's art, but it 
does raise subtextual questions hovering around the issue of self-doubt. The 
show leaves the impression of compositions where everything is pushed to the 
margins, making a kind of centerless vortex of hesitation. Kitaj may explain 
too much, try too hard. His art seems to mistrust its own ability to tell us 
that it is about him.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He reminds us by painting his wedding, or some jokey pictures about his 
ailments. He wrote his own commentaries on the catalogue plates. It begins to 
grow narcissistic, like the novels of his friend Philip Roth. Both do their 
thing beautifully, but both can bumble into appearing more interested in 
talking about themselves than making art. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Kitaj's amazing virtuosity, this subtext is like a bird being in a 
quandary about flying. A straight-ahead portrait drawing such as the 
smoldering, sooty "Dominie (Dartmouth)" tells us everything we need to know 
about both artist and subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitaj seems to be getting a similar idea. Two recent paintings, "The Flat" and 
"London Landscape," compress his thoughts into quiet, condensed images that 
resonate all the more because they speak only the silent language of vision. 
</P>

 Snoop Tops Chart: His legal troubles have been well-documented, but that 
hasn't dimmed the popularity of Long Beach rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose 
"Murder Was the Case" album entered the nation's pop chart at No. 1 this week 
with a whopping first-week sale of 329,000 copies -- the third highest debut of 
the year behind R.E.M.'s "Monster" and Pink Floyd's "The Division Bell." 
"Murder" is the soundtrack to a short film starring Snoop, due to open in L.A. 
on Nov. 3, which also includes new songs by Jodeci, D.J. Quick, Dr. Dre and Ice 
Cube. Houston rapper Scarface's new "Diary" album sold 155,000 units to capture 
the No. 2 spot just ahead of rock group Queensryche's "Promised Land," with 
153,000 sales to enter at No. 3.

 Guns 'N the Vampire: Guns 'N Roses has recorded a version of the Rolling 
Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil" that will be featured in the upcoming 
"Interview With the Vampire" film. The group did the song at the request of 
David Geffen, the film's executive producer and head of the band's record 
label. "Sympathy" will be included on an otherwise all-orchestral soundtrack 
album, due in December. Sources close to GNR add that guitarist Gilby Clarke 
was not part of the recordings, adding weight to reports that he has been fired 
from the group.

 From Beatles Archives: The prized vaults of unreleased Beatles recordings will 
finally be thrown open Dec. 6 with the release of a two-CD collection of live 
performances by the group from '60s BBC radio broadcasts. Although these 
sessions have been widely bootlegged, this is the first official issue from the 
archives. More unreleased material is expected to be part of a planned 
anthology series that is scheduled to include "Free Like a Bird," a song that 
Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr have finished from a work tape 
made by the late John Lennon. TELEVISION

 ABC Plans Switch: ABC will pull the sitcom "Thunder Alley" off the air 
temporarily after its telecast Wednesday and replace it with a midseason sitcom 
from last season, "Sister, Sister," beginning Nov. 16. "Sister, Sister," 
starring Tamera and Tia Mowry as reunited identical twins, ranked No. 19 among 
all TV programs in the ratings last season. ABC ordered additional episodes of 
"Thunder Alley" and plans to bring it back in March in a more protected time 
slot. After finishing last season ranked No. 13, "Thunder Alley," starring 
Edward Asner and Robin Riker, dropped to No. 55 last week leading off Wednesday 
night at 8 p.m. A special, "World's Funniest Commercials," will fill the time 
slot Nov. 9. VIDEO

<P>
 The King 'Lion': Disney will continue its unconventional marketing of "The 
Lion King" with a March 3 home-video release. That will be just months after 
the summer blockbuster returns to theaters in late November and obviously is 
not timed as a holiday video (unlike Disney's release this week of "Snow White 
and the Seven Dwarfs"). Although the "Lion" release won't be officially 
announced for a few weeks, sources confirm the release date and a price of 
$26.99. . . . Meanwhile, the studio is considering a direct-to-video sequel of 
"The Lion King." Disney struck gold with its "Aladdin" sequel, "Return to 
Jafar," which sold 7 million copies. A second "Aladdin" sequel is already in 
the works. ART

 Dali Sculpture Swiped: While the Russian Union of Artists was toasting the 
closing of a Salvador Dali exhibition Monday night at the artists' union 
gallery in St. Petersburg, someone opened a display case and slipped away with 
an 8-inch figure of the Egyptian goddess Isis. The sculpture, one of 1,020 
pieces in the Dali show, was worth about $50,000, police spokesman Igor 
Komissarov said. Police said the thief apparently knew the combination to the 
lock that secured the display. STAGE

Struthers as the high school principal (Jan. 3-8); "Jelly's Last Jam" with 
Maurice Hines, Savion Glover and Freda Payne (Jan. 24-29), and "Hello, Dolly!" 
with its original star, Carol Channing (June 27-July 2). QUICK TAKES

 Robert Abernethy, once a familiar figure on Los Angeles TV and an NBC news 
reporter for 42 years, is retiring from the network Nov. 1. Abernethy, 66, who 
studied theology at Yale Divinity School in 1984-85, will do occasional 
religion stories for NBC News. . . . Joaquim de Almeida, currently appearing in 
the film "Only You," has been signed to replace the late Raul Julia in Columbia 
Pictures' tentatively titled "Return of the Mariachi." . . . Johnny Mathis and 
the Long Beach Symphony Orchestra perform Saturday night at the Long Beach 
Terrace Theater to benefit the Pediatric HIV/AIDS Center at Memorial Miller 
Children's Hospital. . . . "Eat Drink Man Woman," Ang Lee's acclaimed comedy 
that centers as much on tantalizing cooking as on family ties, has been named 
the official Taiwanese entry in the 67th Academy Awards, its distributor, the 
Samuel Goldwyn Co., announced. ART BERMAN

RECORD REVIEW; A SATISFYING AND SPIRITED HOMAGE

 *** Barrelhouse "Soul Pimps 'N' Blues Pushers" Steady Rollin' Records  
</P>
<P>
 A cheesy title isn't enough to detract from this classy, spirited homage to 
the definitive Southern soul sound of Stax Records. As unlikely as it might 
seem that an Orange County-bred white guy in his mid-20s could walk with the 
ghost of Otis Redding, Barrelhouse's Steave Ascasio does it with confidence and 
convincing soulfulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Grunting, hollering, pleading with the ardor-filled note-stretches that define 
soul singing, allowing breaks and imperfections in his delivery to remain 
because of the intensified, spontaneous feeling they can convey, Ascasio does 
what soul men do, and makes it sound as if he was born to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 He also writes all the band's material, showing a good ear for melodies and 
harnessing them to lyrics that are simple but appropriate backdrops for the 
real content, which is the rich feeling summoned by his singing. Barrelhouse 
delivers on the promise shown on "Blues on 10th 'n' Central," a cassette it put 
out earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On that release, the guitars-and-drums lineup was too slender to muster a 
satisfying re-creation of the Memphis soul sound. For the CD, and for stage 
shows over the last few months, Barrelhouse has expanded to include horns and a 
piano. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a full band sound that emphasizes crisp ensemble work while 
wisely keeping Ascasio's voice at the forefront. These guys aren't up to Asbury 
Jukes or J. Geils Band snuff as yet, but there are enough tasty elements in the 
playing: jangly guitar rhythms and terse, spiny lead breaks crop up; Jack 
Benson blows a handful of fluent, full-bodied saxophone solos. The keyboards 
are a bit muffled in the mix, but that can happen on an independently made, 
self-financed album like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barrelhouse guitarists shine best on "Blues 'Bout Rosie," an acoustic, 
Delta-style blues that isn't listed on the cover but pops up as a welcome aside 
midway through the album. Otherwise, contrary to the title, this is a straight 
soul album. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrelhouse maintains a good mix of moods and styles: exuberant, pumping 
numbers with that trademark horn punctuation, plaintive, lovelorn ballads, and 
variations like the sultry, sashaying funk of "Natural Lover Man" and the brisk 
but wistful "Can't Make You (Love Me)." 
</P>
<P>
 The question, of course, is whether Barrelhouse can branch out and make itself 
something more than a zestful re-enactment of a glorious chapter from the '60s. 
But at a time when most contemporary R & B is an empty, puffed-up display of 
hormonally overheated vocal gymnastics or ultra-smooth "Quiet Storm" crooning, 
lovers of old-line soul won't find many better offers than Barrelhouse's 
invitation to go living in the past.

TV REVIEW; PUFFERY AND A BIT OF INTRIGUING IRASCIBILITY IN 'ROLLING STONES'

 The Rolling Stones aren't about to be pulled by anybody into a serious, direct 
discussion of the question of aging in rock 'n' roll. But the makers of 
tonight's VH-1 special, "Conversations With the Rolling Stones," do elicit at 
least a bon mot or two on the subject: "It doesn't mean that I have to do the 
same delivery as a 21-year-old," says Mick Jagger, pungently exasperated as 
usual, "but I'm not gonna fall down in the middle of it and die!" 
</P>
<P>
 No one dies this time, of course, in this 25-year reunion of sorts between the 
Stones and filmmaker Albert Maysles, one of the co-directors of 1969's "Gimme 
Shelter" film, which ended up documenting the Altamont mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring individual interviews set in a rehearsal studio, the new half-hour 
(directed by Kathy Dougherty and Susan Froemke with Maysles, with off-camera 
interviewing by Kurt Loder) is interesting puffery, hardly long enough to be 
more than anecdotal but full of intriguing irascibility anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 What do we learn? That Jagger didn't care much when Bill Wyman quit the group 
("It never worried me at all. I just saw it as an opportunity to get a good new 
bass player. I mean, it's not the most difficult job in the world."). That 
Charlie Watts would much rather listen to Louis Armstrong than the Stones, and 
hasn't even cracked the shrink-wrap on their latest album. That Keith Richards, 
despite looking legendarily like death warmed over, claims to not yet have been 
afflicted by the aches and pains everyone warns him about. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just enough here for armchair psychoanalysts to start chewing on: 
Jagger as the raconteur who can't quite completely disguise his contempt for 
certain questions, even as they launch him and his goofy bad-boy grin into 
funny stories; Richards as the man who would be casual; Wood as still the baby 
of the family, happily along for the ride and afraid to publicly admit Jagger 
and Richards don't get along or , worse, that they do; Watts as the reluctant 
millionaire who'd rather be thumping le jazz hot , if not required in Wyman's 
absence to remain on as resident stoic. 
</P>

 * "Conversations With the Rolling Stones" airs at 7 and 10:30 tonight on VH-1, 
with "Gimme Shelter" airing at 5 p.m.

DANCE REVIEW; BOCCA: SHAKY GROUND ALL AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The earth seemed to move during the Tuesday performance of Ballet Argentino, 
its second mixed program at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this is not meant poetically, but as one explanation for all 
the small stumbles, tiny tilts and general shakiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Take star player Julio Bocca, in a suite of dances from Act III of "Raymonda," 
by Lidia Segni, after Petipa. No sooner had he traced out his technical 
territory with nifty double tours and airy grand jete s, than he tripped out of 
bounds into a shadow upstage. Indeed, Bocca seems to be a victim of his own 
virtuosity, flinging himself into impressive aerial maneuvers, out of which he 
often crashes. An ace pilot's flight plan gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 His partner, Eleonora Cassano, had fewer shaky moments, but her cool grace and 
high, pretty extensions could not make up for missing musicality.  
</P>
<P>
 The best "Raymonda" section was an elegant pas de quatre, crisply danced by 
Fabiana Bianchi, Erika Cornejo, Silvina Mazzuza and Silvana Vaccarelli. Then, 
in two solos, Natalia Magnicaballi and Cecilia Lucero were charming, despite 
missteps. And you get extra points for conveying charm while a raspy taped 
score reduces Glazunov's lush melodies to tinny tunes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For "Dos Mundos," slightly better recordings of excerpts from Vivaldi's "Four 
Seasons" and tango music by Astor Piazzolla were meant to set up "two totally 
distinct worlds." Choreographer Julio Lopez was done in by using the same 
energy and (uninspired) vocabulary for both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bocca was jazzy and arched in anguish, while trying to win Cassano with "the 
passion of tango." Intermittently, an automaton corps boldly clasped hands 
overhead, wiggled and spun to the passionate Vivaldi. Confusing, yes, and -- 
because of its melodramatic stalking, and non-sequitur semi-nudity -- not a 
little silly.

THEATER REVIEW; 'DOS CORAZONES' SHINES AT THE HUDSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you were to throw an armful of scripts into the air, watch them fall and 
then pick a few at random, you might come up with a more cohesive program than 
"Four-Thought," a quartet of one-acts at the Hudson Theatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Forethought is exactly what's missing from this motley bill. A good one-act, 
like a good short story, is not so much a narrative as an epiphany of character 
-- a well-chosen moment in which someone becomes him- or herself. A bad one-act 
has a way of melting an entire evening into soap opera or sitcom mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hellesen's "Dos Corazones" ("Two Hearts") benefits from comparison to 
its weaker cousins on the bill, but would still be a sturdy enough effort on 
its own. In fact, based on a production at Theatre 40, Hellesen's script was 
recently nominated for an Ovation Award. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new mothers -- Ana (Michelle Danner), a working-class Latina, and Cheryl 
(Wendy Clifford), a neurotic suburbanite -- befriend each other in the 
maternity ward, despite the fact that Ana speaks little English and Cheryl less 
Spanish. But, of course, they bond: Ana is the nurturing type, and Cheryl is 
clearly on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Her face a tragic, tear-besotted mask, Cheryl explains how alienation from her 
husband and mother has made her feel alienated from her newborn girl. Now that 
the baby is born, she reasons, it no longer belongs to her but to them, the 
chaotic and impersonal world outside the womb. What Ana brings to the picture 
is a reminder of the bond of maternity -- and the dread of mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 This equation might strike some viewers as a little too easy, too schematic. 
Yet director Larry Moss has deftly mined the humor and pathos from the script 
by Hellesen (formerly on the literary staff of South Coast Repertory). 
Clifford's performance, though, is a revelation, heartbreaking and hilarious in 
its intimate vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a gifted actress like Clifford can't save "Does This Woman Have a Name," 
Theresa Rebeck's preposterous waste of time and paper about a struggling writer 
(Clifford) who becomes a phone-sex operator over the objections of her 
yuppie-jerk boyfriend (David Kriegel). The implied theme -- that sexual power 
games hinder intimacy -- gets buried amid cardboard dialogue and sluggish 
direction from Jerry Levine. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of merely mediocre chamber pieces book-end the evening. Billy Hayes 
directs "Gangster Apparel," Richard Vetere's snappy but slight encounter 
between a couple of Queens hoods (Brian Drillinger and Jonathan Chapin) who 
discover that clothes make the (hit) man. "Pulp Fiction" serves up far better 
banal mobster banter than this. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the program is Lisa Reardon's darkly comic "Dove," concerning a 
Tribeca stockbroker (Ben Meyerson) slowly driven crazy by the early morning 
song of a mourning dove, which he alone can hear. While the conceit is 
interesting, director Levine vainly chases down a sense of mystery and tragedy 
that proves every bit as elusive as the bird of the title. 
</P>

Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Nov. 20. (213) 660-8587.

ART REVIEWS; FISKIN'S TRANSCENDENTAL PHOTOGRAPHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judy Fiskin's tiny black-and-white photographs, each no more than a few inches 
square, purport to document things: the architectural vernacular particular to 
the New Jersey shore, flower arrangements by hobbyists, L.A.'s "dingbat" 
apartment houses, pieces of overstuffed furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 One can read the work as a parody of Conceptual art, with its penchant for 
complete inventories and totalizing logic. Yet Fiskin's mock-classification 
system is too tender-hearted to really work that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Her photographs enshrine those things that have been chalked up as mistakes, 
idiosyncrasies and examples of poor timing. By rendering them in miniature, 
Fiskin ensures that we approach them closely, awarding them the kind of loving 
attention we normally reserve for more intimate encounters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a group of new photographs from the series "More Art," now at Patricia 
Faure Gallery, Fiskin is interested in those objects whose institutional status 
as art is ordinarily suspect: a piece of American mourning embroidery, a 
l9th-Century sandpaper painting, a wax effigy, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 What Fiskin photographs, however, are not the objects themselves, but 
illustrations of them taken from archival materials. Represented as 
black-and-white photographs of representations, they are doubly affectless. 
Even their kitsch value is as dubious as their aesthetic merit. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberated from the treacheries of both high art and low, these objects become 
surprisingly evocative, even elegant. Circumscribed by Fiskin's tight framing, 
and neat black picture frames, they hint at the ways in which photography 
permits all sorts of things to transcend themselves.

 Bunny Mischief: "El Dorado," Nayland Blake's new show at Christopher Grimes 
Gallery, features a cavalcade of adorable stuffed bunny rabbits engaged in 
everything from run-of-the-mill licentiousness to organized mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 One bunny sits in the corner, merrily smearing feces on the wall. Another 
rapes his double in a wintry forest. A trio of bunnies armed with rifles 
prepares to execute a blindfolded ex-comrade. A decapitated bunny head is 
stored in the refrigerator, presumably a victim of the Jeffrey Dahmer of 
rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a certain macabre charm to a toy rabbit wielding a knife or carting 
around a coffin. But it's a stretch to find more meaning here than in a hip 
novelty store's Halloween window.  
</P>
<P>
 The artist is best known for stainless-steel bondage sculptures, which evoke 
all manner of lurid narratives with admirable clinical detachment. This new 
work comes out of his interest in glove-puppets and marionettes, which operate 
in the strange space between prop and actor: They are characters, yet wholly 
subject to another's control. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake used marionettes to dazzling effect in a 1991 piece based on the Marquis 
de Sade's "Philosophy in the Bedroom." He urged the viewer to play puppet 
master, thus exchanging the role of voyeur for something far more active -- and 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, however, Blake seems to be at a loss. Perhaps the problem is that he 
ignores the riskiness of appropriating materials or themes closely associated 
with another artist. After Mike Kelley, it is difficult to use stuffed animals 
even if your purpose is to lampoon him (which I don't think Blake's is). 
</P>
<P>
 Blake has selected his creatures according to different criteria: His are 
brand-new, affectless bunnies, quite unlike Kelley's hand-made, 
down-on-their-luck fetishes. Yet if all Blake's work conjures is nostalgia for 
Kelley's ability to use mute objects to articulate complex ideas, something has 
gone very wrong. This show is a disappointment.

 Desert Narratives: For 20 years, photographer Richard Misrach has been 
involved in an epic exploration of the American desert -- its terrain, its 
light, the fires that ravage it, the garbage left by its despoilers. With 
"Desert Canto XVIII," he produces the most distilled photographs of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Misrach points his camera upward and shoots the desert sky at night or at 
daybreak, seen from vantage points as varied as the salt flats of Utah or a 
brothel in Nevada. The photographs are devastatingly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 A violet and yellow morning sky is as lusciously tart as a popsicle. Another's 
muted tones of gray and mauve are as indistinguishable as the notes of a 
glissando. A sky at dusk is a burst of orange dissolving into black. 
</P>
<P>
 It is immensely difficult to negotiate such beauty. Beauty is so complete that 
it resists all commentary, yet is so subjective that it poses the question of 
agency: In whose voice does natural beauty speak? 
</P>
<P>
 Misrach seems to deflect such metaphysical or spiritual questions by locating 
these images of nature firmly within the parameters of culture. All reference 
points outside the realm of art are repressed so that we read a white blur that 
is probably a shooting star as a scratch on the negative. 
</P>
<P>
 The images are nothing like traditional landscapes; they look instead as 
abstract as Color-field paintings. Several resemble Mark Rothko's hovering 
rectangles of color: They appear to be disembodied pictures of immateriality, 
if such things could be said to exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-consciousness with which Misrach mimes Rothko, however, suggests that 
the photographer doesn't think so. This makes his work much closer in spirit to 
Ad Reinhardt's "all-black" paintings, which are, of course, not all black. 
</P>
<P>
 Like them, Misrach's photographs of the sky are non-anecdotal narratives. They 
insinuate themselves into the mind's eye, telling stories in a language of 
signs particular to their medium. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'ICEBERGS' PLUMBS ROMANCE FOR LAUGHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The weight of underwater plankton can cause an iceberg to tip on its side, 
revealing the greenery of the previously unseen microscopic organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Or so we're told in "Green Icebergs" at South Coast Repertory. Just as the 
iceberg finally reveals its true colors, so do the people in Cecilia Fannon's 
captivating romantic comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of her characters are equally "green." Whereas the upheaval in 
these people's lives resuscitates two of them, two others turn their lives over 
without much of anything to show for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The action of Fannon's play occurs far from actual icebergs, in a seductive 
Tuscan town where two Orange County couples in their mid-30s, each married for 
nine years, are vacationing. 
</P>
<P>
 Justus (Jeff Allin) briefly mistakes Veronica (Nike Doukas) for his wife Beth 
(Annie LaRussa), while approaching her in a cafe. As they talk, ambivalent 
feelings about their marriages surface, kindled by Justus' book about Fra 
Filippo Lippi -- the Renaissance priest and painter who defied convention by 
seducing and marrying a nun. Soon the Americans defy convention too. 
</P>
<P>
 The new coupling becomes painfully obvious when the four tourists -- including 
Beth's husband Claude (Robert Curtis-Brown) -- share a dinner table. That 
night, drastic measures are taken. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, more than a year has passed, and the four reunite at the 
same hotel and cafe but under very different circumstances. Although Fannon 
plays her most predictable narrative card in the first act, she saved enough 
surprises for the second to keep interest high. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fannon clearly values long-term compatibility over short-term passion, 
she never sounds moralistic. She also displays a fine-tuned sensitivity to the 
general importance of keeping private affairs private, of considering other 
people's feelings even if they're no longer part of your life. When some of her 
characters try to cash in on their personal stories, we get a whiff of the 
concern felt in Alan Ayckbourn's "Man of the Moment," a year ago in this 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 This play isn't as funny as Ayckbourn's, but laughs abound, especially for 
Southern Californians who know, for example, what Souplantation is like. Only a 
few of the jokes stretch too far -- most notably an absurd story of why Claude 
stopped playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon writes different kinds of engaging talk for different kinds of 
characters -- Justus knows how to use big words, whereas Claude knows how to 
use brusque ones. She takes her biggest risk with an omniscient moderator -- a 
waiter (Hal Landon Jr.) who anticipates every order, has a handy homily for 
every occasion, even counsels one of the characters in a scene away from the 
cafe. As an abstracted memory more than a real person, he could become 
insufferable, except that Fannon recognizes this and deftly takes advantage of 
it in her second act. 
</P>
<P>
 This play won South Coast's final California Playwrights Competition (Fannon 
is from Newport Beach). Unlike some of the previous winners, it got a mainstage 
production -- and, as one expects from SCR, a classy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Director David Emmes directs a pitch-perfect cast. Doukas' throaty allure and 
Allin's loping charm heat up the first act, and LaRussa and Curtis-Brown 
carefully transform their characters' worst qualities into strengths in the 
second. Lighting designer Tom Ruzika got to play with romantic Italian light on 
Robert Brill's sun-washed set, and Ann Bruice's costumes help delineate the 
transformations of Beth and Justus in particular.

CLUB REVIEW; LUNAPARK AN ECLECTIC VENUE WITHOUT WESTSIDE SNOBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the ten months since L.A. club veteran Jean-Pierre Boccara opened his 
latest night-life venture, West Hollywood's LunaPark, the Parisian entrepreneur 
has consistently given club-goers an elegant and eclectic night out. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hoopla that accompanies a new "scene" in L.A., LunaPark has 
managed to maintain a trendy, chic atmosphere without the snobbery that plagues 
too many Westside clubs.The 400-capacity supper club is a lush-looking, gold 
and amber place, with a tiny, Euro-style cabaret room downstairs and a generous 
stage and dance floor upstairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The music mix is ambitious: from acid jazz to world beat, from pop to torch 
singing, LunaPark's weekly lineup manages to be varied while still maintaining 
a classy through-line. Although the crowd varies with the evening's performers, 
the Hollywood bimbo squad tends to roost elsewhere most nights.  
</P>
<P>
 Both supermodel Milla and actress Karen Black have found LunaPark a hospitable 
setting to test their singing aspirations, and a recent Saturday was typical of 
the club's variety-act tone: While a Brazilian 12-piece band moved dancers 
upstairs, an "Arab-Turkish" group wowed the downstairs audience with 
sword-wielding belly dancers of both genders.

 JONI MITCHELL 
</P>
<P>
 "Turbulent Indigo" 
</P>
<P>
 Reprise  
</P>
<P>
 Remember the mid-'80s Joni Mitchell, the suddenly cranky chanteuse who'd 
thrown over the personal musings everyone knew and loved for agitated social 
diatribes? Well, that Mitchell is back, kind of. But don't blanch yet, 
"Blue"-lovers: "Turbulent Indigo" is her best overall album in a good decade 
and a half, and an intimate -seeming one, the litanies of societal ills 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In her previous go-round as protest singer, Mitchell was engaged in an 
incongruous love affair with abrasive synthesizers, but here -- aside from "Sex 
Sells," the one track redolent of those heavier-handed days -- the electronics 
are reduced to brooding undergirding. Back up front are the singer's closely 
miked acoustic guitar as well as incomparable voice, with sweet help in the 
forecourt from saxophonist Wayne Shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot of tender anger here. Mitchell has written some of her most 
subtly beautiful melodies in ages in the service of sketching testy narrative 
miniatures about abuse, injustice, hypocrisy or (the world's oldest social 
disease) loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

SPOTLIGHT; MEDIUM TO WELL DONE; REPORTER ON PSYCHIC SHOPPING TRIP FINDS SOME 
QUALITY ADVICE IN SPIRITED PACKAGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's best to shop for a new car during clearance time. Spring is the 
propitious season in which to plant a garden. And if you're thinking of looking 
into unseen psychic forces, the time to do so evidently is now.  
</P>
<P>
 Long before the invention of Milk Duds and Power Ranger costumes, Halloween 
was originally called Sambain (pronounced sow-en ) after the Celtic god of 
death. Presaging the months of nature's decay and cold, ancient Celts, pagans 
and early Christians deemed Oct. 31 as a day when the departed drew near, and a 
time ripe for seeking divinations of love, luck, money and other pending 
concerns. According to some today, Halloween remains the Blue Light Special of 
the cosmic plane K mart.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sambain is a significant day. The veils are said to be very thin between the 
spirit world and the mortal world, so contacting departed souls, clairvoyance, 
any work with the other side would be considered very effective at this time," 
said Guy Richard, whose Costa Mesa shop Isle of Avalon is a magic-worker's 
supply house, stocking warlock robes, Dragon's Blood bath and shower gel and 
sundry items. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Costa Mesa Tarot reader Lorene Judd, "It's the day that the 
heavens open and you have the clearest access to all the souls that aren't 
in-body any more. That's why people think of ghosts and spooks and everything, 
because it's the day you can really connect and communicate with everybody 
that's out of body." 
</P>
<P>
 So let's, shall we? For those tired of the usual theme park Halloween 
diversions, we decided to check out some of the en-veiled alternatives.  
</P>
<P>
 You need look no farther than the Yellow Pages to find -- listed between Sperm 
Banks and Sporting Goods -- a Spiritual Consultants heading. Add the listings 
under Parapsychologists, Astrologers, Occult Supplies and Psychic Counseling 
and Healing, and you've got more advice than a body can handle.  
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago psychics weren't accorded much respect or profile in Orange 
County. The standard would be a palmist with a whitewashed house next to a 
railroad track. One might still expect the business to be centered in immigrant 
neighborhoods with a strong folk tradition, and there is indeed no shortage of 
those, though many don't advertise in the phone book. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real psychic hub these days seems to be Newport Beach, with spokes 
radiating out to Costa Mesa, Laguna and Irvine. Perhaps the Reagans' reliance 
on an astrologer made it acceptable in upscale communities. A cynic might 
suggest that psychics are going where the money is. Judd has a more interesting 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money and power don't have anything to do with it. There's an energy vortex 
here. If you look around you'll see a lot of health food stores here, yoga 
centers, holistic health, acupuncture and acupressure massage. If you know 
about meridians or power spots like Sedona (Arizona), you'll see there's a 
power spot in this area, and if you check out the grid you'll see there's an 
energy vortex, and when you're in a power spot in a vortex, it's easier to 
access this type of information. We're talking fourth and fifth dimension. 
There's a doorway here," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a hard position to argue with given that, as we spoke, someone was 
banging on a shaman's drum outside the psychic reading room we sat in, 
ensconced in Visions & Dreams Emporium, a Costa Mesa New Age shop. There, one 
can find taped channeled communications broadcast from the Pleiades star 
cluster, Tarot cards and abalone shards. "Abalone attracts angels," claims a 
placard. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd was one of five randomly selected psychics I visited for readings last 
week. I don't recommend seeing five psychics in a row. My psyche feels rubbed 
to a nub. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an interesting experience, though, both to contrast their various 
approaches and to note an impressive consistency between their collective 
readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you take this as a confirmation of things arcane, bear in mind that I 
am predisposed to believe in psychic occurrences, and have been ever since a 
high school friend and I were once standing beside a river and, for no reason 
on God's green Earth, simultaneously thought of Sebastian Cabot. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't question that there are connections in this world that aren't readily 
apparent, though -- as might be expected of one whose psychic experiences 
revolve around large, dead, bearded TV actors -- I don't regard them as taking 
precedence over the engagements and wonders of daily life. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't tell a couple of the psychics beforehand that I was a reporter, but I 
also didn't try to catch them up in trick questions or misleading information. 
Rather, I asked about things that honestly concern me, and those didn't happen 
to be the sort of concrete names-dates-places answers that would prove or 
disprove the accuracy of their skills.  
</P>
<P>
 As with any profession, there are doubtless hack psychics, though the ones I 
met seemed earnest in their work. Whether they are connected to another plane 
of being or not, to varying degrees I walked away from each reader with a 
respect for her intuition and advice. All I'll venture is that if you have a 
curiosity about things psychic, and the money to spend, getting a reading is a 
lot more fun than a session with an investment broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're the sort that enjoys pulling beards off Santas, I don't 
recommend going to psychics with the intent of proving them wrong. You likely 
won't get a good reading, they'll probably have ready reasons -- such as your 
bad faith -- why the reading wasn't good, you'll be out a chunk of money, and 
if their powers are real, who needs a psychic honked off at you? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you had a choice, wouldn't the first psychic you visited be named Yolanda? 
We thought so too, and so started our mystical journey in Anaheim with Yolanda 
Todorovich, a woman of Yugo-Serbian extraction who says her family has been 
doing readings in Orange County for three decades. She works with your choice 
of either Tarot cards or palms, and her reading came closest to one's 
expectations of the classic Gypsy palm reader. 
</P>
<P>
 Her place of business has burgundy carpeting, pink walls, a small furry dog 
with a face like Ernest Hemingway, religious icons, and a sign reading, "If you 
have a cold or flu please let me know right away."  
</P>
<P>
 "That's something we can't protect against," she revealed, sniffling.  
</P>
<P>
 Todorovich asked a few questions, the first being "How will you be paying for 
this?" (Like many readers, she takes plastic.) Most of the time, she gave 
answers.  
</P>
<P>
 Her observations were emphatic, dramatic -- colored with a revelatory or 
cautionary tone -- and she often dealt in specifics. If in the next three weeks 
I have a mishap swimming, an accident with a red car or a knee injury, we'll 
let you know. She also revealed that in past lives I've been a Chinese 
philosopher and an African witch doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 She said things about my pathetic love life that seemed pretty spot-on. On the 
career front, she, as all four psychics after her were to do, strongly 
suggested I leave my work and embark on a project on my own. There's nothing 
like using your employer's expense money to be told you should be ditching 
them!  
</P>
<P>
 Of the readers visited, Yolanda got top points for style of delivery: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to tell you something, mister. You're going away . You're going a 
distance . You're going to cross deep waters to a foreign country that's going 
to be ruled by a king or queen. And through this journey is where you're going 
to find your success. And, Jim, what's this thing with the desert?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the desert part could well be the planned trip I took to the California 
desert odd-spot, Slab City, a few days later. The distance could be a junket to 
royalty-ruled Thailand I've been trying to scam. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop was the Learning Light Foundation in Anaheim. The foundation -- the 
name was changed from the Psynetics Metaphysical Center early this year to 
avoid confusion with Dianetics -- has been in Orange County for 32 years, more 
than 20 of those in an old church on East Lincoln Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission statement is to promote education and research relative to the 
physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the individual," says Douglas 
Baucom, who co-helms the foundation with his wife, Susan. To that end they 
offer a wildly non-judgmental variety of services, spoon-bending parties, 
classes in Angel Awareness, a UFO Abductee Support Group and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Baucom doesn't believe there's more parapsychological activity around 
Halloween, "But I think there's an increase in our awareness of it," he said. 
The foundation is hosting a Halloween party with psychics on Saturday. Psychics 
are typically there for walk-in business on Saturdays -- designated Psychic Day 
-- and by appointment on other days. Two alternative churches meet in the main 
hall on Sundays. But on a recent weekday, the church stage was the quiet spot 
used for my reading.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman conducting it (uninterested in publicity, she asked us not to use 
her name) uses psychometry: She holds an object usually on your person -- car 
keys, in my case -- and senses things from it.  
</P>
<P>
 Particularly compared to the effusive Todorovich, her speech was tranquil and 
unaffected, and her answers dealt more in tendencies and waves than in 
specifics. She too saw me making a long-distance trip. "I saw the letter T, and 
the first country I thought of was a distance like Tahiti," she said, which is 
close enough to Thailand for me.  
</P>
<P>
 She also saw me making driving trips to Washington State, which I do often 
enough, and she made a solid hit on my food allergies. Though she was one of 
the psychics I didn't tell of my profession until later, she said, "I see paper 
and I see ink." She also saw me moving to the Southeast, which I have no 
intention of doing, though I'd like to chalk that up to my car key coming from 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's not the sort of stuff that lends itself to quantification, I was 
most impressed by her perception of my cluttered mental state, and the solid 
advice doled out on that account. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Melissa Scott's office is a far cry from the New Age vibe of the Learning 
Light Foundation. She works out of a very businesslike Costa Mesa office, and 
she typically works in a stylish business outfit. There's nothing like a 
Formica table top to make a crystal ball and set of Tarot cards look even more 
arcane. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, 30, says she has been psychic since childhood and a professional for 10 
years. Many of her clients are professionals as well; they come to her to help 
form business plans. Not surprisingly, there isn't much mumbo or jumbo to her 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's usually right, but adds that no one should ever cede his or her 
own decision-making process to a psychic's visions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about observation and information, and I believe you have to take 
everything with a grain of salt," she said. "I never say, 'You absolutely 
should do this,' because you have to use your own judgment and make those 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with advising me to make a career jump, she added further impetus: "I 
see someone new you'll be working with, a dark-haired individual that's in 
charge. This person seems to have a very intimidating, controlling personality. 
I would caution against being involved with this person."  
</P>
<P>
 A question often asked by cynics is: With such ready advice for others, why 
aren't all psychics rich? 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's answer: "I ask myself that constantly. There are people in this 
business who are making a lot of money with the 900 numbers and things like 
that. But I always think, 'Why don't I know the lottery numbers?' I don't know 
why I don't. But I think we always receive the information that is the highest 
good for us at that time. There are certain other things you're not to know 
until it's their time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a field that already is subject to much ridicule, it takes a certain amount 
of spunk to call your organization the Morontia Society. On this mortal coil, 
the society's sole representative is Bonita Kent. Morontia, she says, is the 
highest plane of being accessible to us, and the society she communes with 
there comprises angels and enlightened beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent is a sunny blonde who does her readings in the Laura Ashley-like 
environment of a typical Irvine condo. She says she connects through automatic 
writing, with her writing hand directed by departed souls, the Archangel 
Michael and a guide she calls Morontia Spirit Woman. It's an interesting show. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages Kent delivered, at least at my present Karmic level, often seemed 
like gobbledygook to me. Despite that, this was the one reading during which 
the hairs on the back of my head were doing pushups.  
</P>
<P>
 Kent doesn't go into a trance and isn't given to theatrics. Her speech remains 
conversational, people walk their beagles outside, and the only unusual sound 
is her pen forming loopy letters dictated from beyond. Yet it was decidedly 
eerie, even if the information coming in wasn't connecting. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not much on contacting departed spirits. I don't know many dead people and 
figure they probably have better things to do. And the famous dead? Where's the 
decency in pulling Jimi Hendrix back from his enlightened plane just to ask him 
what gauge strings he used? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one of the problems with the reading was that Kent started receiving 
messages from my departed maternal grandmother. She was a sweet woman, but a 
dithering one, about as comprehensible as a Wookie in this life, and evidently 
not much more lucid in the next.  
</P>
<P>
 Between Grandma, Morontia Spirit Woman and the Archangel Michael, I was given 
a load of oddly phrased advice that was sufficiently sound and generic that it 
shouldn't do anyone harm, but it also didn't seem to have much to do with me. 
My hairs enjoyed it though, as if they were getting an electric charge from 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are more satisfied with the contacts. Like Scott, Kent said that 
several of her clients consult with the beyond on business matters. The head of 
one family-held company, she said, "comes in every two weeks and consults with 
her departed brother. It's like a board meeting that he governs, and it's been 
totally on-target, developing the business plan and new divisions."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The readings Lorene Judd and others conduct at Costa Mesa's Visions & Dreams 
take place in a carpeted room, where no electricity invades. The room is lit by 
candles, and a wind-up clock ticks off the minutes like a psychic cab meter. 
Visions here are purchased at $1 a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Judd -- who also teaches yoga -- works with Tarot cards. Like Scott, she says 
the spirits are selective in what they allow to be revealed. "Readings 
sometimes are absolutely right on and the cards really talk. But sometimes it 
won't come through, if it's better for you to find it out on your own; or maybe 
what you have to learn is about some type of illusion and the illusion can't be 
lifted until you find your way through it or it wouldn't be fun for you. So it 
all depends." 
</P>
<P>
 Her reading for me touched on the same themes most of the others had. There 
were sprinklings of hard information, as when Scott had pegged my desires to 
move to northern California or Washington. But the intriguing part wasn't the 
revelatory stuff, it was the quality of the advice they gave, which in several 
cases I'd rate up there with the sort I get from longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there magic involved, or empathy and shrewd guesswork? I don't know, but 
it's a good show. And who wouldn't want to have a mysterious stranger tell 
them, "I see you've done a lot of soul searching lately?" It sounds a lot 
cooler than "I see you watch lots of TV." Getting Psyched 
</P>

MUSIC/DANCE; STICKLER FOR STANDARDS; CHRISTOPHER WARREN-GREEN DIDN'T LIKE THE 
PLAYERS HE INHERITED -- SO HE CANNED THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Warren-Green is unusual among conductors. He'd rather his 
musicians -- the London Chamber Orchestra -- didn't work too much. At least, 
not for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to have people who have their own careers," he explained. "I believe 
that's the only way to get a higher standard of player." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren-Green was 32 when he took over the group in 1988. Founded in 1921, it 
was the oldest chamber orchestra in Great Britain. But it had deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The orchestra was slightly in the doldrums," he said. "Players had left. The 
standards were not very high. To be honest, the very first time the job was 
offered to me, I didn't want to take it. Then they came back to me and said, 
'To be honest, we'd rather you re-form the orchestra.' So I sacked . . . all 
the players." 
</P>
<P>
 To revamp the group, which will be playing Friday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre under the auspices of the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
Warren-Green assembled a nucleus of only 13 musicians. Though the group 
performs at home with as many as 22 players, Warren-Green is bringing 14 
players on its first U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would far rather have really good quality players than augment the ranks 
and then risk somebody not being equal to the others," he said. When not part 
of the orchestra, the musicians pursue solo careers, perform in chamber groups 
or other orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of musical whiz kid, Warren-Green joined the prestigious Academy of St. 
Martin in the Fields as a fiddler when he was 19. He became concertmaster of 
the BBC Welsh Symphony at 21, concertmaster of the Philharmonia Orchestra of 
London at 24 and returned to St. Martin's as concertmaster at 30. He stayed 
there until he moved to the LCO. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that's not enough, he also teaches at the Royal Academy of Music and 
plays a Habaneck Stradivarius on loan from the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, he's another conductor-violinist in the tradition of Neville 
Marriner, who formed St. Martin's in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream was really to do both -- play and direct from the violin and conduct 
when necessary," Warren-Green said. "It wasn't one career or the other. More 
and more instrumentalists do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He plays standing up and insists that most of the other musicians stand up, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can make more sound that way. They play much better. We even record that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The recordings and concerts have earned enthusiastic reviews. But when the 
group began playing at rock festivals in Europe, several critics got upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Oh, they've sold out to commercialization.' Nothing could be 
further from the truth. You're taking a hell of a risk playing at a rock 
festival. Rock audiences essentially will throw bottles at you if they don't 
like you." 
</P>

 "Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings" (1956) 
</P>
<P>
 Verve  
</P>
<P>
 Both Basie and Williams were at career crossroads in the mid-'50s. In deciding 
to put together a new, more progressive big band, Basie had replaced his 
history-making lineup with a cast of relative unknowns -- including Williams, 
who found himself having to fill the shoes of the seemingly irreplaceable Jimmy 
Rushing.Both men rose to the occasion; the result was this landmark, top-shelf 
album. The new band -- which included trumpeters Thad Jones and Joe Newman, 
trombonist Benny Powell, alto saxman Bill Graham and drummer Sonny Payne -- 
adapted bop innovations into the groove with a brassier, more sophisticated 
swing while the honey-throated Williams proved to be a master of syncopated, 
voc-cool phrasing and down-home blues, with remarkable control at both ends of 
his multi-octave range. The choice and interpretation of material perfectly 
complemented the ensemble's talents: Leroy Carr's "In the Evening (When the Sun 
Goes Down)" and Basie's much-copied arrangement of Memphis Slim's "Every Day I 
Have the Blues" went on to immortality. Even though the transfer from album to 
CD is maddeningly harsh and scratchy, no jazz library is complete without this 
enduring milestone.

 Frank Capp and the Juggernaut orchestra will play a tribute to Count Basie

FILM SERIES; MASTER OF MYSTERIOUS; ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S INVENTIVE, CLASSY WORKS 
WILL PLAY AT -- APPROPRIATELY -- AN ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
covers film for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most movie terror is built on a worry most of us share -- that the ordinary 
can turn strange and dangerous in an instant. Bad filmmakers may blunder along, 
but the good ones massage us with hints of the unexpected, then come up with a 
move nobody saw coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Hitchcock had some of the best moves in the business. His pictures were 
like smooth card tricks: You could see the ace heading that way, but damn if it 
didn't end up over there. Hitchcock could both tickle and thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 Take "Psycho," which launches a three-week/three-film tribute Friday at the 
Newport Harbor Art Museum. The famous crazy-Oedipus thriller looks like a 
straightforward crime flick at the start. There's Janet Leigh, on the run after 
embezzling money from her boss. Hitchcock creates suspense by getting us to 
wonder about her ingenuity and her luck, if she can make her getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 But the movie takes a nervy turn at the Bates Motel. Anthony Perkins' Norman, 
who looks as creepily lifeless as the birds he stuffs, enters the scene and 
madness enters with him. We weren't predicting any of this, and Hitchcock takes 
us down one of the weirdest, most eerie paths in film. "Psycho" is a horror 
flick hooked to the fragility of the mind, and what could be scarier than that? 
</P>
<P>
 There's insanity in the series' next offering -- "Strangers on a Train" (Nov. 
4) -- as well, but of a different sort. Guy (Farley Granger) and Bruno (Robert 
Walker) meet by accident on a train. Good-natured and hopeful Guy doesn't 
realize he is dealing with a dreamy-eyed psychopath in a three-piece suit. What 
appears mundane soon becomes hazardous, and Guy gets sucked in by the evil that 
Bruno generates around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitchcock's inventiveness in this film is clear from the opening passage, as 
he and cinematographer Robert Burks follow the legs of Guy and Bruno as they 
move from their cabs to their train to their seats. Then, their shoes bump 
under a table and the camera jumps to their faces -- Guy a little confused and 
vulnerable, Bruno calculating and predatory. The game begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when everything gets risky, there's a calming layer of sophistication to 
"Strangers on a Train" -- another Hitchcock trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, "North by Northwest," which closes the series Nov. 11, gleams with 
class, but there's nastiness just under the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 This one stars Cary Grant as an advertising executive caught in a double case 
of mistaken identity: He is being chased by cops who think he's a killer and by 
spies who think he's an enemy agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Grant and co-star Eva Marie Saint look a bit wooden (Hitchcock never 
was known for deep characterizations; he moved his actors around like props), 
they bring the requisite suave touches to belie the rising peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Each film will be introduced by Arthur Taussig, an Orange Coast College 
instructor and publisher of "The Film Analyst" newsletter. More movie talk will 
follow each screening. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: A three-film tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: "Psycho" (1960), Friday, Oct. 28; "Strangers on a Train" (1951), 
Friday, Nov. 4; "North by Northwest" (1959), Friday, Nov. 11. All screenings 
begin at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Newport Harbor Art Museum, 850 San Clemente Drive, Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take Pacific Coast Highway to Jamboree Road and head north to 
Santa Barbara Drive. Take a right to San Clemente Drive and then a left. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $5 per screening ($3 for museum members, seniors and students).

WANNA DANCE?: SOUNDS LIKE SOME HAUNTS ARE GETTING INTO THE SPIRIT 
</P>

 Halloween thrills aren't just for kids. That might surprise some of you older 
party-poopers who prefer to torture yourselves and others with reminiscences of 
your long lost trick-or-treating youth. 
</P>
<P>
 But really, what are you missing? Not only are you old enough to buy your own 
candy, but you also can buy only your favorites. You can dress up in whatever 
you want (and not what your mom thinks is appropriate). And you're of age to 
get into any of the many dance haunts offering a frightfully fun time. 
</P>
<P>
 The most talked-about event of them all is Halloween Bash '94, to be held at 
the Red Lion Hotel on Saturday. It's like New Year's Eve in masquerade. Some of 
the county's top promoters banded together for this fright fest -- Scorchman, 
Tic Toc and Johnny's Joint. Sugar Ray (formerly the Shrinky Dinx) and Top Jimmy 
will perform live, while Mark Moreno deejays KROQ-variety tunes. The Red Lion 
will offer a two-person room rate of $35. The best costume takes $1,000. 
Advance tickets are being sold through Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who cherish the macabre spirit most -- and year-round -- are Gothic 
fans. For them, Apparition, the short-lived Fullerton Gothic nightclub open to 
all ages, rises from the dead on All Hallow's Eve at the Ice House, near its 
old grave site. Groove to local faves the Last Dance, Debautchery and 
Examination Death Cult, as well as Los Angeles-based 13 Knots and Praise of 
Folly. Dress to depress, as promoters request, and be a star. A student 
documentary will be filmed that night. Advance tickets are available at Ipso 
Facto in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who like a country-style fright night should amble over to the Crazy 
Horse on Sunday for the club's 14th annual Halloween party. Buck Naked and the 
Chapped Cheeks will crank out the live country music. Come between 5 and 7 p.m. 
for the complimentary chicken and rib buffet; spooky drink specials will be 
served all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Couple dancing is big among these folk, so it's no surprise that the top two 
slots in the costume contest go to couples. First-prize winners get $200, a 
custom Crazy Horse jacket and a weekend for two at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghouls who prefer dancing to disco, pop, house, alternative and the like can 
hit a number of clubs this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 If you like your midnight madness as slick as a vampire's greasy 'do, check 
out the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the Empire Ballroom presents the biggest total cash cache of the 
weekend costume contests, with $1,000 going to first place, $500 to second and 
$200 to third. Celebrity judges are "The Young & the Restless" stars Lauralee 
Bell (Cricket), Joshua Morrow (Nicholas) and Laura Bryan Birn (Lynn). 
</P>
<P>
 Also, terror twosome the Hanour Brothers will mark the occasion three times. 
Discount invites are available at the clubs. On Saturday, the fifth annual 
Haunted Dance Opera at the Shark Club will go up against the Haunted House 
Party at Metropolis. Each offers a $1,000 prize for the winning costume. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference lies in the music. The Shark Club will spin a mostly Top 40 
mix. Metropolis will feature resident house music deejays Doc Martin and 
Taylor, as well as the West Coast debut of Pierre -- billed as New York City's 
godfather of acid house. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolis keeps it going on Sunday with PleasureDome's Halloween Ball. 
Costumed revelers will get a chance at another $1,000 prize. Tribal drummer 
Shaheen will drum up lost souls and the fetish go-go boys will entertain them. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the Lava Room, DI Productions and Artist Groove Network present the 
Night of the Demons. Humble Gods and Rhythm Trak will perform live, while 
deejay Mark Moreno will control the recorded sounds. Denim X Change in Newport 
Beach has $6 advance tickets.

KID STUFF: HAVE NO FEAR -- FUN IS HERE; TREAT YOURSELF TO A CLEAN HALLOWEEN: 
GORELESS ENTERTAINMENT IS IN THE BAG 
</P>

<P>
 There have been at least as many ways to celebrate Oct. 31 as there have been 
Freddy Krueger sequels. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, Druids once marked the end of the Celtic year with massive 
hilltop bonfires (marshmallows, we would guess, were optional) and dabbled in 
equine and human sacrifice to placate the spirits of the deceased -- a practice 
that continued as late as AD 400 (although by that time it was oxen, not their 
countrymen, that were getting the ax). 
</P>
<P>
 Witchcraft was all the rage in the Middle Ages, and All Hallow's Eve was 
thought to be one of the cult's biggest blowouts. On this night in medieval 
Europe, witches were believed to cruise the skies on broomsticks co-piloted by 
black cats. (Folks believed the cats were witches in disguise, so they torched 
them, too.) 
</P>
<P>
 The witch thing, of course, continues to be a classic. As late as the 19th 
Century, rural residents in the British Isles plaited pitchforks with straw and 
placed them afire on hilltops to singe the brooms of low-flying witches. 
</P>
<P>
 In 20th-Century Orange County, black-peaked hats and warty rubber noses are 
still hot Halloween sellers, but the tradition of dressing up and making the 
trick-or-treat rounds is waning as parents become more wary of sending their 
kids out into the night armed only with a pillowcase and a plastic mask. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how to celebrate? You could pack the teen-agers off to Knott's for its 
annual thrill fest, but the younger ones (or you, for that matter) may not be 
ready for an evening of roaming mutants and synthetic gore. If so, there are 
dozens of local options, ranging from a garage version of "Phantom of the 
Opera" to spooky storytelling to a Halloween-themed science workshop. Here's a 
sampling. Phantom," Family Style  
</P>
<P>
 Three-car garages are good for more than storing junk and keeping bicycles 
from underfoot. If you're a lovesick musical hermit, they also make a dandy 
Halloween hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 So thought Peter Parker, a Cypress real-estate appraiser who turns his 
family's garage, 5803 Holmby Court, into the setting for a truncated "Phantom 
of the Opera." For the fifth Halloween running, Parker and a passel of his 
friends and family will stage their "Phantom," complete with music, lights, 
billowing fog and all manner of theatrical wizardry. Spectators (anywhere from 
2,500 to 3,000 each year) of all ages gather on Parker's driveway and spill out 
into the street to catch the 20-minute show, he says. (Viewers are asked to 
bring a canned food item to donate to the St. Iraneus Church of Hope project.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could design Halloween as a parent, this is what I would want: It's a 
little scary, so it keeps (kids') interest up and blood rushing, but there's a 
lot of great lights and color and music, too," said Parker, the father of three 
children, 7 to 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phantom" started out as a way to avoid schlepping his kids door-to-door on 
Halloween night. Parker built a coffin on his driveway and his neighbor, 
dressed as a vampire, rose out of it to hand out the trick-or-treat goodies. It 
was nice, but after Parker saw the real "Phantom" in L.A. a few years back, it 
wasn't nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, visitors to Parker's garage are greeted by a disembodied head (a video 
image projected on a plaster model fashioned for him by a college mortuary 
science class; he says he got the idea from Disneyland's Haunted Mansion ride) 
that synopsizes the "Phantom" legend. The scene switches to Christine's 
dressing room, where, with the help of a seven-foot-tall trick mirror and other 
special effects, the phantom and the heroine dance and sing until he disappears 
amid thunder claps and deranged laughter. Seconds later, his "corpse" swings 
out over the audience's head, the head comes back for a chat and the curtain 
falls. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Phantom" almost didn't sing this year. In the past, Parker has footed 
much of the bill for the show with help from a local real estate company, but 
he didn't have the extra cash this year. When friends on his softball team 
heard about this, they gave him his Halloween treat a little early. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys took (up) a collection and gave me a Halloween card with $1,000 
inside," Parker said. "People really come through for this show; I guess it 
wouldn't be Halloween without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 31 performances of Parker's "Phantom" begin about 5:30 p.m. and run 
continuously until 10 p.m. Call (714) 826-6911. Scaring Up a Good Story  
</P>
<P>
 Ghost stories and spooky tales will be told at several sites countywide this 
weekend, and kids are encouraged to turn out in costume for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at noon and 1:30 p.m., professional storyteller Jim Lewis will 
perform at a Halloween festival at Placentia Town Center (Yorba Linda Boulevard 
and Kraemer Avenue). Admission is free, and the event also includes a magician, 
games and Halloween contests. Call (714) 348-2972. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders Books and Music (25222 El Paseo, Mission Viejo) is hosting a Halloween 
costume contest Friday from 7 to 9 p.m., followed by a 10 p.m. spook-fest for 
ages 11 through adult conducted by professional storyteller Angela Klinger. On 
Saturday, there are readings of Halloween stories by Borders staff at 11 a.m. 
and 4 p.m.; the program, suggested for ages 4 to 10, will be repeated Sunday at 
11:30 a.m. and Monday at 2 p.m. Admission is free. Call (714) 367-0313. (Not 
Necessarily) Haunted Houses  
</P>
<P>
 There's nary a buzzing chain saw at these Halloween haunts, intended for 
children about 10 and under.

<P>
 The city of Anaheim's vaunted Halloween parade got the budgetary ax several 
years back, so the parks and rec folks are celebrating with a "House of Horrors 
and Halloween Carnival" on Sunday and Monday in Peralta Park (111 N. Pinney 
Ave.) in Anaheim Hills. Festivities include a "non-threatening" haunted house, 
carnival games and a costume parade (Monday at 4:30 p.m.) Hours: 4 to 9 p.m. 
both days. Admission: $2 to $3. Call (714) 254-5191.

EVENTS; LIVELY MANIFESTATIONS OF DIA DE LOS MUERTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Edition staff.

<P>
 While the Day of the Dead is a time for connecting with the past, event 
organizers at Cal State Fullerton also want it to be an opportunity for 
students and community members to think about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, the California Literature Project and several other campus 
groups are using the occasion of El Dia de los Muertos -- a Mexican holiday 
when people set up shrines in their homes and at grave sites for their dead 
loved ones -- to stress not only culture, but also the importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
 They are counting particularly on two talks by acclaimed Chicano writer Victor 
Villasenor to make their point. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, Villasenor will speak to about 500 high school students 
from all over Orange County on "The Power of Education." At 7 p.m., the public 
is invited to join CSUF students, faculty and staff members to hear Villasenor 
talk about "Latino Parents as Heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Villasenor's lecture to the high school students "has the potential to be a 
lightning rod," said Jim Sieg, chairman of the California Literature Project 
leadership committee at CSUF. "He relates well not only to Latino kids, but to 
young kids struggling with their own voices." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Villasenor's most well-regarded books is a novel called "Rain of Gold" 
(Arte Publico Press, 1991), which chronicles three generations of his family 
and its immigration to California. The book has been called a Mexican "Roots." 
His first novel, "Macho!" (Bantam, 1973), was published at the peak of the 
migrant farm workers' movement in California. 
</P>
<P>
 His lectures at Cal State Fullerton are similarly well-timed, said student 
Monica S. Hernandez, 25, a member of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan 
(MEChA), one of the many groups involved in putting on El Dia de los Muertos 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid an atmosphere of often-angry and heated debates resulting from 
Proposition 187, the state ballot measure that would eliminate educational and 
health services to illegal immigrants, Villasenor's message will be a positive 
one for immigrants and their children, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be any immigrant-bashing," she said. She also said the author's 
lectures should serve as "an awakening" among Latinos to the realization that 
"education is for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicanos need to empower themselves, and the only way to do it is through 
education," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone can convince students of the importance of empowerment, it is 
Villasenor, event organizers hope. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own written accounts, the author, now 54, struggled enormously through 
junior and senior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 His story should make students "reflect on their own lives and where they 
are," Hernandez said, "and where they could be tomorrow."

SURFING: LOTS OF ORANGE COLORS HAWAII CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time. Oh, yes, it's time. 
</P>
<P>
 Autumn's coming in gracefully, giving surfers morning offshore winds and 
relatively warm, 62- to 64-degree water temperatures, making it a spring suit 
kind of month. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockin' Fig said many surfers consider it the best time of the year: Gorgeous 
sunrises, clear views of Catalina and young surfers out of the water and back 
in school. And each week brings a possibility of a major storm from Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 The Figster: Take advantage of it, people!  
</P>
<P>
 But the Fig is a stoked guy for another reason. As announcer for the U.S. Bud 
Surf Tour, he'll be in Hawaii for the Bud tour finals at Makaha that started 
Monday and end Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 And with four of the top five competitors from Orange County, we might have a 
local Bud tour champion. What do you think, Fig? 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely! Who's in the Top 5?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, from No. 1 on down, it's Chris Brown of Santa Barbara; Jeff Deffenbaugh, 
Huntington Beach; Shane Stoneman, San Juan Capistrano; Richie Collins, Newport 
Beach, and Todd Miller, Costa Mesa. Fig, didn't you pick Deffenbaugh as a top 
finisher before the season kicked off? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup. It's good to see one of the boys from ol' HB really turning on this year. 
Deffenbaugh -- or JD, as he's known -- is a man to be reckoned with, though he 
is a late bloomer. Other pro competitors did well earlier in the year, but he 
came on strong at the end by getting into contest quarterfinals and finals. 
With his points in the World Qualifying Series, it looks like he'll be heading 
for the world tour.  
</P>
<P>
 What about the others? 
</P>
<P>
 Stoneman has been climbing up the ladder too. He's become more solid. Collins 
has been the definite threat all season long, though he had a little bit of bad 
luck. He is probably most people's pick to take the Bud title.  
</P>
<P>
 Todd Miller is an up-and-coming guy and Collins' protege. Miller's been 
turning in some solid performances, and this has got to be his best ranking so 
far.  
</P>
<P>
 And Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 As for the man in front, Chris Brown, he's got a beautiful style and surfs 
with speed and power. Plus, he has some outrageous moves and has been a 
standout. He has had problems this year with sponsorship and wasn't really 
quite as focused. Now he's the man who really looks like he's got it all 
together.  
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the Top 10 are Todd Prestage of Australia, Vince de la Pena of 
Laguna Niguel, Peter Mel and Chris Gallagher, both of Santa Cruz, and Pat 
O'Connell, also of Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Alisa Schwarzstein, a Bud Tour spokeswoman, said that in addition to 
Deffenbaugh, Collins and O'Connell have good chances of qualifying for next 
year's world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a snag, Fig. 
</P>
<P>
 What's that?  
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzstein said there's a little politics involving Brazil.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the other regions don't like the fact that so many Americans are 
qualifying for the world tour," Schwarzstein said. "On Oct. 18, the Brazilians 
announced that a three-star event had been elevated to a four-star, making 
those points earned in Brazil more heavily weighted for qualifying for the 
world tour." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the significance, the Bud tour's final is rated at only two 
stars. Ratings are based on size of purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could negatively effect guys like Jeff Deffenbaugh," Schwarzstein said, 
"because he is already in Hawaii getting ready for the Bud finals. But it also 
could hurt a host of other guys who have chosen to go to Hawaii instead of 
Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Cairns, the Bud tour's contest director, has lodged a complaint against 
this last-minute move. No word yet on what effect, if any, the complaint will 
have. Schwarzstein said the Bud Tour has counted at least 25 pro surfers out of 
the Top 100 on the world tour that the new rating could affect in the race for 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a pretty bad blow if it goes through," Schwarzstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Old Blood: Peter Townend, former world champion in 1976, Rusty VP and Prime 
Ticket announcer, has resumed competition but this time in the National 
Scholastic Surfing Assn. Another new entry in amateurs is Bob Hurley, 
Billabong's president. What's going on here? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibit: A new women's exhibit opened Oct. 15 at the Huntington Beach 
International Surfing Museum. The exhibit has plenty of hot photos, surfboards 
and memorabilia from some of surfing's "first ladies." Featured surfers include 
Joyce Hoffman, Linda Benson, Mary Ann Hawkins and Jericho Poppler-Bartlow. The 
museum is at 411 Olive Ave. Call for hours at (714) 960-3483. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Fig: I'll be saying hi to Buffalo and all the boys in Hawaii -- Derek, 
Johnny Boy and the crew. Mahalo and aloha!

DO IT!: TRIPS TO BOUNTIFUL: FALL RACES HAVE ATHLETES ON THE RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
Edition staff.

<P>
 Local runners have a fall bounty of races to choose from this weekend, from 
short-and-sweet 5K jaunts to an annual 50-mile trek through the Cleveland 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest event in the county this weekend is the 14th annual Heart & Sole 
Classic, to be held Saturday in Irvine. In past years, the event has raised as 
much as $225,000 for research, education and community programs for the 
American Heart Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 6,000 participants are expected, including about 300 corporate 
teams. The event starts at Jamboree Center in Irvine, just north of of the San 
Diego Freeway (motorists beware -- Main Street will be closed in the vicinity). 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of events from which to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 First up will be a 7 a.m. aerobics workout, followed at 7:30 a.m. by the 
Executive's Mile, a run/walk event for business leaders. At 8 a.m., it's a 25K 
bike ride that will loop around Upper Newport Bay. The 10K run, which starts at 
8:20 a.m., will route competitors out toward UC Irvine, while the 5K run/walk, 
starting at 8:30 a.m., stays close to City Hall and environs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, there is no entry fee, although participants are encouraged to 
collect donations. A $35 donation will secure an event T-shirt, and grand 
prizes will be awarded to the five participants who raise the most money. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, runners can look forward to a couple of additional choices Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Monster Mash Dash is a Halloween-themed 5K set to take off from South 
Coast Plaza Village in Santa Ana at 8 a.m.; a Planet Hollywood 1K follows at 9 
a.m. Among the attractions: a costume contest and a post-race party. Entry for 
the 5K is $20 with T-shirt, and $15 for the 1K with T-shirt. Information: (714) 
661-6062. 
</P>
<P>
 * The second annual Run Beneath the Peaks 8K is a scenic rolling loop course 
through the hills of Rancho Santa Margarita. Entry is $10 with T-shirt. 
Information: (714) 858-7386. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the granddaddy of local ultra races, the San Juan Trail 50 -- 
that's 50 as in miles -- which takes off at 6 a.m. Saturday from Blue Jay 
Campground, off Ortega Highway near the village of El Cariso. Only the hardiest 
of runners need apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are if you didn't already, know about this race you're not going to 
make this challenging test a last-minute addition to your schedule. However, 
race director Baz Hawley, the state's leading ultra-race impresario (and a man 
who spends his winters in Orange County), has in recent years initiated a 
series of shorter off-road runs for those who want to try the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 His next local race is an all-new venture -- in fact, he claims it is the 
first off-road marathon ever. Planned for Dec. 4, the run will start at Falcon 
Campground off Ortega Highway (about 3,300 feet) and hits its highest point on 
top of Orange County's highest point, Santiago Peak (at more than 5,500 feet, 
one of two peaks that make up Old Saddleback). 
</P>
<P>
 For information, write Hawley at P.O. Box 2821, Mission Viejo, CA 92692. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hawley said he may be able to accommodate a few last-minute entries 
for Saturday's race through Friday at the latest. He recommends picking up a 
race entry form at a Snail's Pace, a running shop in Fountain Valley. 
Information: (714) 842-2337. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Heart & Sole Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Oct. 29; registration begins at 6:30 a.m., 25K bike ride at 
8 a.m., 10K run at 8:20 a.m., 5K run/walk at 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Jamboree Center in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit north on Jamboree Road 
and turn into the Hyatt parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: Free, but donations requested. $35 minimum donation for 
T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 856-3555.

VIDEO REWIND; FOR CLASSIC THRILLS, DIG 'FIVE FINGERS' OUT OF THE TRENCH-COATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Halfway through the crisp 1952 cloak-and-dagger thriller "Five Fingers," a 
secret agent, tired of running through shadowy train stations and exotic 
marketplaces, cryptically tells his partner, "Nobody ever found anybody in 
Istanbul." 
</P>
<P>
 Classic spy-flick dialogue like that, a satisfyingly twisty plot and a 
dazzling lead performance by James Mason separates "Five Fingers" from the 
scores of trench-coat films that rely too much on genre gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz ("All About Eve") earned an Oscar nomination for 
his almost documentary-style direction of this suspenseful espionage tale, 
which recounts the real-life exploits of an embassy valet-turned-spy during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The darkly suave Mason shines as the dissatisfied Ulysses Diello, a butler in 
the British Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, who uses his post to gain access to 
top-secret documents. His midnight deliveries of microfilm to the nearby German 
Embassy quickly make him a rich man, but they also make him a target of agents 
on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the cast are Michael Rennie as a dashing British spy and Danielle 
Darrieux as the duplicitous Countess Stavinska. But Mason clearly steals the 
show with his polished take on Diello, a frustrated climber whose only 
allegiance is to greed. "There's nothing as real as money," the icy Diello 
tells a co-conspirator. He proves his belief in that motto by plotting to buy 
the love of his former employer, Stavinska, with a fortune made selling the 
Allies' D-Day plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mankiewicz captured a realistic feel by filming on location in the streets and 
alleys of Turkey, but as the film's final minutes lay out two wonderful, 
whiplash-inducing plot twists, it is clear the spies of "Five Fingers" roam a 
place called Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five Fingers" (1952), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. 108 minutes. Not

SPECIAL SCREENING: 'ENTRE NOUS': WOMEN ON THE VERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The key moment in Diane Kurys' intelligent "Entre Nous" comes during an 
elementary school pageant, when Lena and Madeleine meet. Destiny coddles the 
scene, and we know these two are meant for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurys' 1983 movie, screening Friday night as part of UC Irvine's "Cinema 
Potpourri" series, is all about female bonding filtered through a romantic 
gauze. The two women, married to flops of husbands and stuck in domestic 
routines, find psychological and erotic liberation through their relationship. 
Kurys wants the audience to know there's a good chance all sisters, at the 
heart of the matter, are soul-mates. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives this French film a special poignancy is that it's set during an era 
stifled by convention, making Madeleine (Miou Miou) and Lena's (Isabelle 
Huppert) connection that much more intriguing. The movie begins in the Pyrenees 
in the early '40s, when Lena, a Belgian Jew, avoids the concentration camps by 
marrying Michel (Guy Marchand), a French Legionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 This compromising decision is contrasted with tender scenes of Madeleine's 
love affair with a young art student, who is soon killed, leaving her with her 
own bargains to make. She marries Costa (Jean-Pierre Bacri), a failed actor and 
petty businessman, and settles down to a life unfulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 That is, until she meets Lena. From there, the story moves ahead as something 
of a feminist allegory, linking us to both (especially Lena) as they grow 
through each other's inspiration and devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture's look even changes at this point to underscore Kurys' excitement 
over their intimacy. Bernard Lutic's cinematography, somewhat harsher and 
deliberate early on, now seems lusher, more flattering as it dwells on the 
pretty faces of Huppert and Miou Miou. 
</P>
<P>
 But even while Kurys applauds their partnership, she points out that making 
such a choice comes with consequences. Both Lena and Madeleine ignore their 
children and deceive their husbands to embrace a love that can't help but be as 
selfish as it is liberating. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a vaguely unflattering edge to the women, which gives "Entre Nous" a 
patina of realism. The authenticity, unfortunately, doesn't reach to Michel and 
Costa, who are painted by Kurys with such coarse strokes that they seem shallow 
caricatures, especially when compared to the more subtly defined Madeleine and 
Lena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Costa and Michel are revealed as just part of the backdrop against 
which Lena and Madeleine's lives evolve. That's a clear weakness of "Entre 
Nous," but it isn't towering. The film is a fine example of this smart 
director's work, which includes the little-known "Peppermint Soda" (1977) and 
"Cocktail Molotov" (1980).

RESTAURANTS; AT CLAES, SEAFOOD IS BELIEVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beautiful homes weren't the only things lost in the Laguna Beach fires last 
year. Danish-born restaurateur Claes Andersen had to scuttle 30,000 bottles of 
top-quality wine from his personal cellar when it went up in flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, life goes on at Claes Seafood Etc., Andersen's dining room at the 
Hotel Laguna. The hotel -- and Claes Seafood's eclectic wine cellar -- were 
spared by the fire, and we can be grateful. The restaurant's wine list, honored 
continuously since 1988 by The Wine Spectator, remains an intelligently priced 
repository of older Bordeaux and California boutique wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Wines are important to Andersen and to his dining room. Plan to take a meeting 
with the enthusiastic young sommelier, Marcelino Cosio, when you dine here. 
Cosio hands out tasting notes with every wine he serves.  
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant was renovated a year ago, about the time it tacked "Seafood 
Etc." onto its name (formerly, the restaurant went simply as Claes). Gone are 
the pink hues that once dominated this beachside dining room, replaced by cream 
tones contrasting with the jet-black tables emblazoned with stars. The pounding 
surf has always been right outside the window, so it's a delicious turn of 
events that the menu has developed into a mostly seafood affair by executive 
chef Todd Clore. 
</P>
<P>
 We've kept an eye on Clore (a protege of Roy Yamaguchi, owner of Hawaii's best 
restaurant, Roy's) since he cooked locally at Pascal, and he's finally living 
up to all the promise. Clore has a knack for fish, not to mention the ability 
to startle. 
</P>
<P>
 He is known for serving seared ahi with a pomegranate-vinegar sauce, a 
combination you'd only expect if Japan had a head-on collision with the Caspian 
Sea. Basted halibut teriyaki is another of his eye-openers. The fish is served 
with Thai jasmine rice steeped in coconut milk, a natural partner for this 
firm-fleshed fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Clore has pared down the menu to a sensible total of eight appetizers, 14 
entrees. Virtually all of his items are stamped with originality. Fried Pacific 
oysters, perhaps the best way to start a meal here, are lightly dusted with 
flour before frying and served in the shell, sprinkled with finely shredded 
leeks and crowned with a dollop of orange Hollandaise. These oysters remind me 
of the curried fried oysters that you get as amuse-gueules in Michelin-starred 
establishments throughout Europe. In truth, they are even better than the 
overly complicated curried versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen likes smoked fish, as do the hotel's many Japanese clients, so Clore 
smokes fish such as salmon and trout on the premises, using hardwoods (pecan, 
apricot). His smoked salmon plate is composed of salmon so gently smoked it's 
almost gravad lax, sliced thin and topped with capers, chopped parsley and 
shallots. Ask whether there is any of the smoked mackerel the chef imports from 
Europe. It's not on the menu, and it's terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 Chilled steamed mussels with spicy marinara work perfectly well, but one can't 
help wondering how much better they would be if Clore used Prince Edward Island 
mussels in place of the larger, less flavorful Eastern mussels. Rock shrimp 
enchilada is the menu's one concession to Latin flavors. Under the hard 
tortilla shell containing the shrimp, there is a great, smoky tomatillo 
reduction, one of the best spicy sauces you'll ever taste. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a fish lover's menu, though Clore throws in rack of lamb with maple 
syrup and a seared filet of Angus beef for those who insist on red meat to go 
with a vintage Bordeaux from the restaurant's cellar. Halibut teriyaki might 
just be the fish menu's chef d'oeuvre . It's a thick filet, studded with white 
sesame seeds and covered with a teriyaki glaze that is subtle and complex, even 
by Japanese standards. I predict you won't leave a grain of the rich, smooth 
coconut rice accompaniment, a real scene-stealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Superior whitefish is browned to crackling on the skin side, while the 
flesh stays tender and soft on top. The cilantro-pistachio pesto that comes 
with it has a precious sound, but forget the word pesto -- this is a fine, 
imaginative sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Clore's imagination is not infallible. I'm still not sure about that 
crusty rack of Colorado lamb; it's tasty but eccentric, almost a dessert. My 
personal jury is also out on the ahi with couscous and pomegranate vinaigrette. 
The sauce is skillfully reduced, with a deeply pungent finish. If you don't 
mind a highly flavored sauce on a delicate fish, this one's for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fish are done with consummate skill: the thick grilled swordfish with 
garlic and thyme and the Chilean sea bass, lightly crusted with Parmesan in a 
wild mushroom sauce. I felt let down by the spicy clam linguine with onion, 
bell pepper, jalapeno and white wine. The elements taste good, but somehow they 
just don't come together.  
</P>
<P>
 Clore is also a solid dessert chef. He makes a delicious three-fruit cobbler, 
served warm with vanilla ice cream. Chocolate paradise is a terrine-shaped 
slice with a dense, fudgy richness; the macadamia nut cheesecake is fluffy. My 
choice is extra-light orange praline mousse cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Clore has developed into a real talent, possibly the best seafood chef we 
have.  
</P>
<P>
 Claes Seafood Etc. is expensive. Appetizers are $5 to $7, entrees $15 to $21.

 Halloween cuisine generally means candy -- aaargh! But this year, you can 
leave tooth decay and hyperactivity to the wee ones. Several local 
establishments have come up with alternatives for grown-up kids. 
</P>
<P>
 You can come as Apollo and make like Dionysus when Zorbas hosts a Greek 
Halloween Party and Costume Competition on Sunday and Monday, complete with 
belly dancing, Greek bouzouki music and Israeli, Armenian and Arabic songs. 
Dinner will be served from 5 p.m. to midnight, with lamb on the spit ($16.95) 
being the special. Festivities begin both nights at 7 p.m. and are free. 
</P>
<P>
 The All Hallow's Eve Storytellers present "Tales of Horror, Mayhem and 
Frightful Humor" at the Robert Mondavi Wine & Food Center on Saturday. Attire 
at the Masquerade Dinner is black tie and mask, and the event begins at 7 p.m. 
The cost is $80, which includes a three-course dinner, Mondavi wines, tax and 
gratuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Marriott Suites suggests you make a "Mystery Weekend" of it, 
but it's actually only a one-night stay, Friday or Saturday. The 
$159-per-couple package includes a suite, tickets to "Abra Cadaver . . . a 
Mystical, Magical Mystery" at Irvine's Mystery Cafe (where the characters serve 
a three-course meal) and breakfast in the hotel's Windows restaurant. Tips not 
included.

 According to Erica Bohm, co-author of "Healthy Dining in Orange County," most 
restaurant meals offer 1,000 to 2,000 calories with 50 to 100 grams of fat. 
Hardly healthful. One meal can easily exceed one or even two full day's 
recommended intake. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday at two Nordstrom locations, Bohm will present a free food sampling 
and seminar ("The Fat and Skinny Facts on Restaurant Dining"), including 
practical advice for dining out and staying fit. Seating is limited, and 
pre-registration is encouraged.

LOST IN O.C.: COMING TO PRAISE HALLOWEEN, OR BURY IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly

<P>
 I'd like to start today with a public service announcement: Spring forward, 
fall back. Saturday night. OK?  
</P>
<P>
 If you're at all like me, most years you never know darkness is upon us until 
you see the little reminder in Saturday's paper, gloating, "As you know, 
Daylight Savings Time ends tonight. Don't forget to set. . ." But I don't know, 
so I couldn't forget if I wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 And then I start getting paranoid: Everyone knew this but me? Have they been 
getting prepared for weeks, storing nuts in tree trunks and such, while I can't 
even figure out if falling back means my head is going to hurt more or less 
when the alarm goes off the next morning? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this season weird enough without having to go back on Daylight 
Squandering Time? I mean, in just a couple of days my doorbell is going to be 
ringing off the wall as a procession of Power Rangers, chain-saw murderers and 
Middle Eastern terrorists -- not to mention the electric meter guy -- show up 
at my door.  
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe they won't all show up. I was talking recently with actress Linda 
Blair, and she thinks Halloween as we know it is dying.  
</P>
<P>
 I always felt kind of sorry for Blair. Had the "Exorcist" star first made her 
splash today -- rotating her head while spewing thick green bile -- she'd be a 
shoo-in for at least senator in this state. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk about the negative campaigning now, but consider: 
</P>
<P>
 The Feinstein ad: "Huffington, the do-nothing, lying, greedy Texas oil 
millionaire Californians just can't afford, even with double coupons." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huffington ad: "Feinstein, the limousine-riding career politician who'll 
do anything to stay in power, and, besides, just lookit this ugly picture we've 
got of her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blair ad: "Bleaghgh-phuuuuggglh!! Your mother chucks socks in hell! 
Pfu-Bleauuuuugggggh!!!" 
</P>
<P>
 She'd be the hands-down winner, don't you think? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, her career peaked too early, and now she's stuck in Z-grade movie 
parts Herve Villechaize probably would have got, were he still alive, bless his 
little soul. And for the past couple of years Blair has been appearing around 
the country at Creep Festivals, such as the one presently winding down at Lion 
Country Center.  
</P>
<P>
 There, she signs autographs amid a gory tableaux of misbegotten mutants, 
spurting severed heads, Barney the dinosaur and other horrors. She thinks such 
events are the wave of Halloween future. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and I used to have fun as kids trick-or-treating, right? Well, some 
people had to take that joy away and make the streets unsafe and make it unsafe 
for people to stay home and open their doors for trick-or-treaters, because it 
can be endangering their lives. So I know that within a few years 
trick-or-treating will be no more," Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she predicted, families will abandon the tradition and turn their 
holiday over to the professionals, to the theme parks and Creep Fests. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to think she's wrong, for a number of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, some horrible things do happen on the streets during Halloween, 
and every other night of the year. But true Halloween horrors on the whole are 
still very rare occurrences -- I would guess less of a risk, statistically, 
than driving in your car. I don't personally know anyone who has had a bad 
Halloween experience, though I certainly know loads who have been in auto 
accidents. The conclusion I draw from this is that you should leave the car 
garaged and walk to work in a Mutant Ninja Turtle costume every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't stay home on Halloween; do you?" Blair asked me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yup." 
</P>
<P>
 "And open your door?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure do."  
</P>
<P>
 And I do -- or at least get my roommate to, while I take off and have fun. And 
no one's machine-gunned us yet. Maybe that's because we give kids Snickers. 
When those run out, some years I give out these god-awful CDs the record 
companies are always sending us music critics. When those run out, I've been 
tempted to hand out those cute little bottles of airline booze. Old enough to 
carry a laser sword, old enough to drink: That's what I figure. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I wouldn't actually give liquor to kids. These lame CDs are enough of a 
mood suppressant. But I do think we could all loosen up a bit, in a wary way. 
There's no denying these times call for heightened caution, but there's a 
difference between that and abject surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society has precious few traditions as it is, and I don't like ceding them 
all to corporate entities. Halloween is certainly a perq for those in the candy 
and costume industries, but it has still essentially been a community thing, 
one of folks on the block entertaining each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Music used to be that sort of a shared front-porch thing before it was 
thoroughly co-opted by industry. In most communities the Fourth of July has 
also become a hands-off, leave-it-to-the-pros event. There are fewer bad notes 
played; kids don't singe their hands or catch any roofs on fire. Instead we get 
to pay for a packaged experience and just sit there with our mouths agape. And 
now Halloween appears to be going that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Back when pagans and Celts were thinking Halloween up, the idea was that 
humans would don the image of the things that frightened them -- demons, 
faeries and such -- while others would placate them with gifts. Along with 
whatever ritual import it may have had, it was a canny way for people to 
inhabit their fears and manifest a control over them. 
</P>
<P>
 Try though we might to live in a culture divorced from the past, I think the 
old purpose of Halloween still carries on a bit, and it sure is needed. As icky 
as goblins might have been, kids today are daily reminded of very real monsters 
among us. Along with thoroughly gore-drenched entertainment, they've got to 
worry about night stalkers, freezer-stuffers, bus-bombers and TV images of 
whole populations slaughtering one another. Adults, once regarded as mentors 
and role models, are now suspect: Will your sports hero turn out to be a 
maniac? 
</P>
<P>
 So, do kids need a night they can pretend is theirs to rule? Does it do them 
good to get to briefly pretend to be something more powerful than their fears? 
I think so. 
</P>
<P>
 When I finally get my act together enough to have kids, I hope I can still 
take them trick-or-treating, rather than see Halloween become just another 
monster of merchandising.

3-HOUR TOUR: 2 PLACES TO PASS THE TIME, ONE TO PASS THE SCONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

frequently to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can pass time at the Environmental Nature Center, then watch time pass at 
Buck's Clocks in Newport Beach. And fat-free bear claws? It was only a matter 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
 8 to 8:40 a.m.: How fresh is fresh? You can pick up a complete schedule 
outlining availability of dozens of breads at Sun Flour Bakery; call in the 
morning to find out what time your favorite will come out of the ovens, then 
allow two hours for the bread to cool before slicing. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the breads are free of fat, processed sugars and dairy products. The 
bakery also offers nonfat pastries including raisin-pineapple scones more moist 
than most non- nonfat scones; its regular scones include chocolate chip pecan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We truck in organic grains from Montana and mill them right here so even our 
flour is fresh every day," owner Craig Clayton explained. "The moisture in the 
nonfat products comes from fruit or, in the case of the scones, nonfat yogurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheddar jalapeno onion bread and challah (Jewish egg bread) are available 
every day; pletzel (flat onion bread) and orange pecan are among those offered 
occasionally. Walnut spice bread is reputedly good for French toast and turkey 
sandwiches. Fat-free bagels include ones called 3 Seed and 9 Grain. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Flour is a busy place, and communication isn't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's your oddest item?" I asked with a reporter's curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focaccia, " said the clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not odd." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I thought you meant hot as in good . Our jalapeno Cheddar bread is the 
hottest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oddest! Oddest!"  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that kind of hottest. The cinnamon rolls go like crazy, so do the tea 
cakes, and we never have any focaccia left." 
</P>
<P>
 "Never mind. How's the chocolate chip bread?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oooh, that's gooood. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The chocolate chip is made with cinnamon, chocolate chips, walnuts, apples, 
raisins and raspberries, and it is good. 
</P>
<P>
 But the focaccia -- with rosemary, basil, onion, two kinds of olives, two 
kinds of peppers, two kinds of cheeses -- was too good to be true. And perfect 
with a cup of Huehuetenango coffee from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 8:40 to 10:30: The 2.5-acre Environmental Nature Center is both a conservation 
area and outdoor classroom for the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the intimate scale of the center, the trails through a dozen native 
plant communities provide a considerably longer walk than you would imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now there are autumn leaves on the ground. It is the nature of brooks to 
babble, and the one here is no exception. Look for frogs in the pond and 
trapdoor spiders in the chaparral. Also watch for the occasional spider web. 
The place is delightfully overgrown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We built the whole center over 23 years," explained Susan Clark. "It was a 
dump site. That's a recycling stream and pond and a static pond from the 
overflow. That's not algae, that's pollen. It looks funky, but it's meant to be 
that way. It's a pond in transition." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I noticed the discreet markers along the path, I was making a 
transition from "southern oak woodland" to "redwood forest . " There are also 
views over the fence of some very nice yards, apparently reciprocal: Treehouses 
seem pretty popular in this neck of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 10:30 to 11: If you think time flies at the Nature Center, check out Buck's 
Clocks. At any given time, there are more than 1,000 clocks at the shop, and no 
two faces are alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Flour Bakery has been in business one year; Buck's family has been in 
clocks for 102. 
</P>
<P>
 "My great-grandfather William Buchmeier Emenger was called Buck for short," 
Bob Emenger said. "Now everybody refers to me as Buck, and when my son Bill 
takes over, he'll be Buck, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The range in cost and age of items at Buck's is considerable. Watches not 
reclaimed after repair are priced just over repair cost. New clocks are on one 
side of the shop, antiques dating to 1689 on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandfather clocks start at $850; an example by Endicott -- the other two 
famous London clockmakers were Elliot and Elicott -- recently fetched $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 So if all those clocks are busy keeping time, how come they all strike at 
different times? 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people ask to hear this clock or that, what you do is move the hands 
around," Emenger said. "It's too much bother to set them all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 On a dog clock, circa 1926, the pup's stationary eyelashes mark the hours, the 
moving eyes indicate the time ($275). A National Time Recorder time punch dates 
from 1920 ($1,550), and an Art Deco clock from 1932 features three elephants on 
a tres moderne triangular clock ($5,000). 
</P>
<P>
 A gold clock featuring Cupid looking through the wrong end of a telescope took 
a prize at the 1855 Paris Expo ($9,750). A new clock called "The Rhythm" ($339) 
has toy men that rise up on the quarter hour, strike up Vivaldi's "Four 
Seasons" on little bells with little hammers, then slowly sink back into the 
base. 3-HOUR TOUR

SCOTT HARRIS: SANTA CLARITA, YOUR SECRET IS NOT SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you listen to the true believers, Santa Clarita is like heaven, only not so 
exclusive. Sinners sneak in, but aren't welcome. The sun shines, the grass 
glistens, the graffiti is quickly erased. Santa Clarita boasts good schools and 
a nifty shopping mall. The FBI says this town is one of the safest in the whole 
U.S.A. -- and yet it's right here in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Santa Clarita is still something of a secret. Santa Monica is known 
for rent control, Santa Ana is a hot wind and a city, and Santa Catalina 
Island, as the song says, is 26 miles across the sea. But Santa Clarita? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know where Magic Mountain is?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the locals always say. Viper and Colossus, the amusement park's 
famous roller coasters, may sound more familiar than Santa Clarita. But all of 
that may soon be changing, because the civic boosters here entertain a new 
dream: Santa Clarita as "a tourist destination." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some casinos might help. As far as beaches go, there's Castaic Lake. When some 
Santa Claritans staged a family film festival early this year, they winked and 
sold sweat shirts comparing their event to Cannes. But the boosters are serious 
about tourism, and there are some Santa Claritans who shudder at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod and Hans, for example. We play slow-pitch softball, and when I told them 
about the tourism bureau, their reaction was a mix of alarm and disbelief. Like 
many people who moved to this place up the Golden State Freeway, Rod and Hans 
thought they'd distance themselves from the troubles and indignities of Los 
Angeles, and that includes tourists. They like the fact that people still 
wonder where Santa Clarita is. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who would like to slam the barn door shut and say, 
'We're here! That's it!' " says Gail Foy, a spokeswoman for the city. She knows 
all about residents like Rod and Hans, and says they should be pleased about 
the tourism bureau. "We like tourists. They come, they spend their money, and 
then they get the hell out." 
</P>
<P>
 This is, I'm told, the sophisticated perspective. You can't freeze time, and 
you can't turn back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Santa Clarita is a suburban "edge city." The valley already has 170,000 
residents, 120,000 of whom live within Santa Clarita's sprawling 45-square-mile 
city limits. A planning study figures the valley will have 270,000 residents by 
2010. That's only 16 years away. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody, of course, is for "controlled growth," but few agree about what 
that means. A slow-growth initiative failed here in 1992. But in any case, City 
Hall's power is limited. The Newhall Land & Farming Co. is the 800-pound 
gorilla of civic affairs here. A few years ago, when Santa Clarita vainly tried 
to come up with a city slogan, one wise guy had this suggestion: "What's Good 
for Newhall Land Is Good for Santa Clarita." 
</P>
<P>
 It built Magic Mountain. It built the master-planned community of Valencia, 
one of the towns that form Santa Clarita. And just outside city limits, west of 
the Golden State, plans are moving forward on Westridge -- 1,800 homes and a 
golf course. And to the west of Magic Mountain, the company envisions Newhall 
Ranch -- a planned community of 24,000 homes on 12,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Mountain, with plans to add a major water park, a la Raging Waters, is 
the big tourist draw. The tourist bureau will hype such events as its family 
film conclave and its Cowboy Poetry, Music and Film Festival. In Bakersfield 
and Fresno, brochures have been displayed touting such Santa Clarita Valley 
attractions as the Saugus Speedway, horse trails and Castaic Lake. The grand 
strategy envisions the construction of more hotels that would provide jobs and 
bolster the tax base. Can a convention center be far behind? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we're looking at sort of a mini-convention center right now," 
acknowledges Viki Rudolph, the Chamber of Commerce manager. "There are some 
studies I'm not able to tell you about, but they're happening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First an amusement park. Then a convention center. Who knows? If Newhall Land 
agrees to build a stadium, maybe Santa Clarita could land the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Claritans can only hope that Newhall Land is a wise gorilla. The 
residents I've met still complain that there's no Nordstrom at Valencia Town 
Center, the shopping mall, but on the whole they say it really is a great place 
to raise a family. They want to keep it that way. The aggressive anti-graffiti 
crusade and La Mesa Junior High's school uniforms are part of a social strategy 
to keep the evil influences of the big, bad city at bay. But meanwhile, Santa 
Clarita is getting pretty big in its own right. 
</P>
<P>
 If there ever comes a time to wonder when Santa Clarita started to go to hell, 
everyone will offer a theory. An acquaintance of mine used to work in the 
Valencia Library. When the new mall opened, she says, the teen-agers 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>

to Harris at the Times Valley Edition, 20000 Prairie St., Chatsworth, Calif. 
91311. Please include a phone number. First an amusement park. Then a 
convention center. Who knows? If Newhall Land agrees to build a stadium, maybe 
Santa Clarita could land the Rams.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; FORMER GANG LEADER REACHES 
OUT TO YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running rapid-fire through the facts and philosophy of his life, Miguel Rios 
talks about his days as a gang leader in South-Central Los Angeles, his two 
dead brothers, the times he's been shot and how he draws on these experiences 
to reach teen-agers today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be real with these kids," said Rios, 35, head of United Parent 
Services of America, a small all-volunteer group he began three years ago in 
his Palmdale home. 
</P>
<P>
 The group opened an office on Palmdale Boulevard six months ago with 10 
volunteers. Without enough funding to light more than half the office, they 
talk with optimism about opening their first branch office to serve the Native 
American community in Gallup, N.M., within three months. 
</P>
<P>
 On their hot line, Rios and his group handle calls about drugs, runaways, 
conflicts with parents and pregnant teen-agers. He spoke about a recent call 
from a parent whose daughter was acting strangely. The daughter was reacting to 
PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios said he went to the home, had the girl drink milk and then walked her 
around to help her come down from the drug. He told the family they should try 
drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios, who works as a school security officer and as a checker at Ralphs in 
Encino, said summertime in Palmdale is the worst for youth because they have 
little to do. "Some of it we're still dealing with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a security officer at Highland High School, Rios has met many of the youths 
he has later helped. "He'll give you advice," said Tracey Maestro, 17, a 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at him as a big brother," said Monique Ramirez, 16, who was with 
Tracey and other teen-agers at the organization's office, planning a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any brothers anymore," said Rios, who lost his two brothers to 
gang-related violence. "These kids are like my little brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his best friends, Frank Murillo, had once been one of his bitter 
enemies. Rios and Murillo met formally for the first time at a district meeting 
for security officers just after Rios began his group. They looked familiar to 
each other, but only after talking for several minutes did they realize they 
used to be members of rival gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to see kids go to college," said Murillo, who now volunteers with 
Rios' group. An education can get you anywhere you want to go, he is fond of 
saying, but a gang can only lead you to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message has to be made that kids can change," said Rios, who remembers 
the words of a police officer at the scene of a shooting when he was a 
teen-ager: "One dead. One in jail. That's two down." 
</P>
<P>
 The words were devastating to Rios, who felt the world cared little about what 
happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
 But a teacher at Los Angeles High School gave Rios a chance to succeed. When 
that teacher later became a principal, he offered Rios a job. The catch was 
that Rios had to agree to finish school. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Rios' friends did not finish school. Several ended up in jail. "I 
should never have made it," said Rios, who displays his diploma on his wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, he said, society has branded teen-agers as not worth saving. "One 
girl said to me, 'The only time I get attention is when I get in trouble,' " 
Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
 He identifies with the teen-agers' anger and frustration. One answer, he has 
found, is to teach them about their culture and identity to help them learn how 
to live and to have pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Rios, who goes to great lengths to make contact with teen-agers he 
wants to help, went to a white supremacist club meeting to talk to youths. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of those youths later showed up at the office of United Parent Services 
of America and volunteered their time. In that office, no one talks about their 
previous gang affiliations or beliefs. All of that is left behind.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the thrills I get is when kids tell me, 'I want to be like you,' " 
Rios said. "That floors me."

AROUND THE VALLEY: SWARMS OF KILLER FEMALES AT THE BORDER -- AND THEY HATE 
JEANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The audience members gasped. Their mouths dropped open in shock and amazement. 
They laughed nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they scarfed more fruit salad and taquitos. 
</P>
<P>
 No, they weren't watching slasher movies or dissecting puppies over lunch 
Wednesday at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 About three dozen nurses, paramedics and firefighters had trooped into an 
auditorium for a lecture about killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
 The speaker was C. R. (Charlie) Duncan, the grizzled, folksy president of the 
Los Angeles County Beekeepers Assn. He explained to the emergency workers how 
to avoid getting stung to pieces by the bees, as some friends of his almost 
were on a bee-hunting trip to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 The relentless northward march of killer bees -- which have killed hundreds of 
people and thousands of animals in South and Central America -- has inspired 
fearsome headlines, public anxiety and a substantial amount of skeptical mirth 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, the bees reached Texas. Last year, they spread to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 But for reasons not completely understood, the bees have stalled at the 
Arizona-California border. Some experts speculate that a dry spring deprived 
them of food, water and shelter needed to safely cross the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the bees, whose ancestors evolved in tropical Africa, have reached 
the end of their genetic tether, and cannot thrive in colder climes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since swarming into Texas in 1990, the bees have killed only one person, an 
elderly man who suffered a heart attack after trying to clean out a colony with 
a torch. Another Texas man was stung 1,000 times but survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Killer bees have been on the loose and multiplying since 1956, when 26 queen 
bees escaped from a Brazilian entomologist's laboratory. The scientist, Warwick 
Kerr, had imported the queens from South Africa in an effort to breed better 
honey-producing insects. 
</P>
<P>
 The fugitives' offspring have since colonized two continents, 20 countries and 
more than 6 million square acres. There are millions in Texas, and perhaps a 
trillion south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africanized bees are cousins to the more docile European honeybee, widely 
used to pollinate American crops. While only a handful of European bees will 
attack a predator, Africanized bees sting en masse -- hundreds and even 
thousands at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the nastiest attack on record occurred in 1986, when a University of 
Miami graduate student on a field trip in Costa Rica stepped in a crack outside 
a cave, disturbing a killer bee colony. His foot wedged in the crack, the 
student was stung almost 8,000 times and died from the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," said Duncan, "is one bad bee." 
</P>
<P>
 As his listeners sat enthralled, Duncan related his own brush with killer bees 
in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been part of a group of about 40 beekeepers who wanted to study the 
Africanized bee up close and personal. The night before they entered the 
jungle, some of the party bragged that they weren't afraid of the killers, and 
wouldn't wear protective veils or gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Duncan and a pal spotted three bee colonies in a tree and headed 
toward them. When they were about half a city block away, Duncan pulled out his 
camera but dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he picked it up, he said, the angry bees had already zeroed in on 
the two men. Duncan's camera was covered with so many bees he couldn't hold on 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had so many bees on their veils they had to use their hands as 
windshield wipers, constantly sweeping the bees away in order to see.  
</P>
<P>
 "The man who said, 'I will not wear a veil,' I carried over to the truck with 
his head underneath my arms, trying to cover up his face," Duncan said. "He'd 
been stung many more times than a man should be in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 "The man who wouldn't wear gloves, we couldn't get the gloves on his hands 
because they were full of bees. And that night, sitting around the campfire, we 
had a totally different group of people. Some of them said, 'I'll sell the 
damned operation, I'll sell everything I've got. I'll not put up with this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After thus terrifying his audience, Duncan related a few tips on how to avoid 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, never wear new blue jeans on a picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Denim jeans contain a dye, he explained, that incites bees. Washing jeans a 
few times makes them safe to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark clothing and sunglasses also are no-nos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bees hate the color black," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, killer bees can be as snippy about your accouterments as a Paris 
fashion critic. They also hate leather (reminds them of cows and horses, which 
they don't like) and strong perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember: Bees fly at 15 m.p.h., so don't try to outrun them. Walk away 
from them, covering your head and face with a jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Killer-bee stingers, said Duncan, can penetrate almost any clothing, including 
leather. 
</P>
<P>
 If you get stung, don't pull the stinger straight out. That only causes it to 
pump more poison into your body from an insidiously designed sac. Use a 
fingernail or credit card to scrape the stinger out. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan said all this aggressiveness comes from female worker bees, not male 
drones, which are so lazy and helpless they can't sting and must be fed by the 
females. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds like a typical male," quipped a nurse in the audience. 
</P>

 Duncan said the male's main function is to mate with a queen. This he does in 
midair, at altitudes of 300 to 400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a male has mated, however, he literally explodes, and falls back to 
Earth, dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he has a smile that runs from ear to ear," said Duncan, to gales of 
laughter from his listeners.

IS NBA JOINING LOCKOUT CLUB?; PRO BASKETBALL: SOURCE SAYS OWNERS HAVE SCHEDULED 
A VOTE FOR MONDAY IF LABOR AGREEMENT ISN'T REACHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NBA might not be able to avoid the labor strife that wrecked the baseball 
and hockey seasons, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The league with the glitzy image and healthy bottom line is hurtling toward 
its first work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners scheduled a lockout vote Monday in Chicago if an agreement with the 
players' union isn't reached by then, a source close to the talks said. The 
season is scheduled to begin Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Commissioner David Stern and union head Charles Grantham were unavailable 
for comment. However, the sides have been talking in recent days, according to 
several sources on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks earlier, Stern had extended an olive branch to the union and 
boasted about the NBA's history of labor harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had a strike and never had a lockout," he said after an owners' 
meeting Oct. 5. "We know what a strike is. We know what a lockout is. But those 
particular weapons have never been called into action. We haven't and we don't 
plan to." 
</P>
<P>
 As with the baseball strike and the NHL lockout, the sticking point is the 
salary cap, which the NBA adopted in 1983. The league wants to close loopholes 
in cap rules, while the players are trying to abolish the cap through lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Grantham denied one agent's report that a lockout was 
threatened as early as Monday unless the union agreed to a no-strike, 
no-lockout pledge and dropped its lawsuits against the NBA. Grantham said that 
was "inaccurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Another agent, requesting he not be identified, said he understood the sides 
were nearing an agreement on the pledge and a one-year extension of the 
agreement that expired last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Williams of the Portland Trail Blazers, the association's president, said 
Wednesday he did not know the precise nature of the discussions between 
Grantham and Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know they were talking, but I don't know what the results were," Williams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hopeful we can make a deal before the season begins, but we can't 
comment on any negotiations," NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA has been without a collective bargaining agreement since the end of 
the 1993-94 season, and no formal negotiating has occurred since July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, both sides said they would be willing to begin the season 
without a deal and Stern discounted talk of a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the league challenging the 
salary cap, the college draft and restricted free agency. The NBA won in U.S. 
District Court and the case awaits a decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players sued the league this week, alleging it has artificially reduced 
this season's salary cap by a total of about $74 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball thus far has avoided the stoppages that have beset the other three 
major sports. Baseball players struck Aug. 12, that sport's seventh work 
stoppage since 1972. NHL owners locked out players on Oct. 1, the league's 
second work stoppage since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the NFL, which has an agreement through the 2000 Super Bowl, has labor 
peace. But football has weathered two preseason and two regular-season strikes 
since 1970 and achieved an agreement only after six years of lawsuits.

THOMAS PERFORMS AN ENCORE AS AL MVP; BASEBALL: WHITE SOX SLUGGER WHO CHASED 
TRIPLE CROWN IS THE FIRST REPEAT WINNER SINCE MARIS, OUTPOINTING THE MARINERS' 
KEN GRIFFEY JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The players' strike might have deprived Frank Thomas of the opportunity to 
become the first winner of the Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, but 
it did not prevent the Chicago White Sox first baseman from obtaining a 
milestone of comparable significance. 
</P>
<P>
 In results announced Wednesday, Thomas was voted the American League's most 
valuable player by a committee of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America, 
becoming the 11th player to win the award in consecutive years and the first in 
the American League since Roger Maris in 1960 and '61. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the shorter season diminished the accomplishment, Thomas said it was 
even sweeter the second time, although he "hated to see the season end like it 
did because I was having a career year. I felt like I was in a groove all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I got a full season award last year," he said. "If this was my 
first, maybe I couldn't have lived it down, but I thought my stats were 
deserving. I thought they were reflective of a full season." 
</P>
<P>
 A unanimous winner last year, Thomas received 24 of 28 first-place votes and 
372 points. Ken Griffey Jr., the Seattle Mariner center fielder who led the 
league with 40 home runs and hit .323, got three first-place votes and 233 
points to finish second. Albert Belle of the Cleveland Indians was third, and 
teammate Kenny Lofton, who received the other first-place vote, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, known as the Big Hurt, dominated the league's offensive statistics. He 
was third in batting at .353, second in home runs with 38 and tied for third in 
runs batted in with 101. He led the majors with a .487 on-base percentage and 
led the league with a .729 slugging average. He also led the league in runs and 
walks while striking out only 61 times in 399 at bats. He is the only player in 
major league history to hit .300 or more with 100 RBIs, 20 homers, 100 walks 
and 100 runs in each of his first four full seasons, reaching those levels in 
1994 despite appearing in only 113 games because of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he was not too upset over missing out on the Triple Crown but that 
it remains a goal he is confident he can obtain. His MVP carried a contract 
bonus of $100,000, and Thomas said, "I'll take whatever comes. The strike is 
tough on everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 His 1994 salary was $2.5 million. It jumps to $7.15 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (owner) Jerry Reinsdorf he wouldn't be overpaying me," Thomas said. "A 
two-time MVP deserves to be paid more than everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Maris, others who won consecutive MVPs were Mickey Mantle, Yogi 
Berra, Jimmie Foxx and Hal Newhouser in the American League, and Barry Bonds, 
Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy, Joe Morgan and Ernie Banks in the National League. 
No one has won three in a row.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The second-highest quarterback rating in the AFC wasn't good enough to save 
Jim Harbaugh's starting job with the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ted Marchibroda announced Wednesday that Don Majkowski would start 
Sunday against the New York Jets.Harbaugh, signed as a free agent after being 
released by the Chicago Bears in the offseason, had started eight games for the 
Colts (3-5), as well as all four exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason is our record. I feel that a change is needed," Marchibroda said. 
"I thought of many other changes, but the big impact one is the quarterback, so 
I went with the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little rusty," Majkowski said after his first practice after the 
decision. "I was a little tentative in some of my throws. Hopefully, I'm 
getting some of the butterflies out." 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me they wanted Don to come in and spark us," said Harbaugh, who has 
completed 109 of 169 passes (58.7%) for 1,293 yards with eight touchdowns and 
five interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't happy to get the news. Now I'll do my best to prepare to help Don. 
I'm not ashamed of the way I've played." 
</P>

<P>
 San Diego Charger quarterback Stan Humphries practiced Wednesday and said his 
bruised and sprained left ankle felt "pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries was hurt in the closing minutes of Sunday's 20-15 loss to Denver, 
the Chargers' first defeat this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel better than I probably thought I would," Humphries said. "But it could 
change tomorrow after running on it a little bit today. It could really swell 
up or whatever but it's just going to be one of those deals that probably will 
change from day to day."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wes Bender always wanted to be a fullback. Wanted it so bad, in fact, that he 
transferred from Burbank High to Burroughs rather than switch from fullback to 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, 24, is still a fullback. And Wednesday, after subsequent stops at 
Glendale College, USC and the Kansas City Chiefs, Bender officially joined his 
hometown team, the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys native was promoted from the practice squad after fullback Jarrod 
Bunch was waived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are expected to sign the 5-foot-10, 235-pound Bender, a blocking 
specialist, to a two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard work finally paid off," said Bender, who started 10 games for the 
Trojans in his senior season and rushed for 64 yards and a touchdown in 25 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 A free agent rookie with the Chiefs, Bender suffered a broken ankle in the 
preseason and was put on injured reserve. He joined the Raiders as a free agent 
last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tremendous blocker," Coach Art Shell said. "A very tough guy. We ask 
our fullbacks to do a lot of blocking. He will go in there and strike you." 
</P>
<P>
 Bender will back up starting fullback Tom Rathman and also play on special 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch, who was signed last month, appeared in three games for the Raiders but 
never carried the ball.

 The Oilers are continuing their "Who's The Quarterback?" show for another 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Cody Carlson, although reasonably healthy Monday night against 
Philadelphia, was pulled in the fourth quarter when the outcome was still in 
question and replaced by former emergency quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers still lost, 21-6, but Tolliver has played well in two relief 
appearances and is gaining support to start Sunday's game against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers again might wait right up to kickoff before making picking a 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to say," said Kevin Gilbride, the assistant head coach in 
charge of offense. "Billy Joe did some good things his second time in there. He 
certainly has done well every time we've put him in there."

WATER POLO ROUNDUP; SUNNY HILLS' REIGN ENDED BY LA HABRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Ploog scored eight goals in La Habra's 11-3 victory over Sunny Hills, 
which ended the Lancers' 24-year reign as Freeway League water polo champions, 
Wednesday at La Habra High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers' streak was the longest for any sport in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory by the Highlanders (4-0 in league) gives next Wednesday's game 
against Buena Park (4-0) championship implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills (1-3), which before this season had lost only one league game 
since 1970, had junior goalkeeper Cody Bitterlich as its lone returning 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to say we're down because we aren't doing well in our league 
this season," Lancer Coach Keith Nighswonger said. "Well, teams better get us 
this year because it won't be like this again." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra took the lead on goals by Rashad Captain and Matt Jewett. Ploog 
scored his first goal after a Lancer turnover to give the Highlanders a 3-0 
lead after one quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ploog then hammered a shot past Bitterlich after a Sunny Hills ejection, but 
the Lancers answered with two Marco Barrera goals to make it 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Ploog put the game out of reach, scoring five goals to give his team a 9-2 
advantage with 3 minutes 49 seconds remaining. DAN ARRITT

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; QUARTERBACK A QUESTION -- NEXT SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1994 season has at least four games left, but already the theme of USC's 
1995 preseason training camp has been set: 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the post-Rob Johnson era, present backup Brad Otton and Kyle Wachholtz will 
work to become Johnson's successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a three-season starter, will graduate in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton is a 6-foot-6 sophomore who has filled in impressively while Johnson 
recovered from a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachholtz, a 6-5 junior, was expected to be Johnson's backup this season. But 
Otton transferred from Weber State last spring and Wachholtz then was declared 
academically ineligible for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be great competition for that job next season," Coach John 
Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Boselli, the Trojans' senior All-American offensive tackle who received 
an $18,000 post-graduate fellowship this week by the National Football 
Foundation and College Hall of Fame, said he would use the grant for graduate 
school after a pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll save it, and use it when I'm done with football," he said. "I'll get an 
MBA, something like that. It's a great honor and I'm really thrilled about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli, one of nine recipients announced Monday, is the ninth USC player to 
be so honored. The last was John Jackson in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, Robinson said he will take this weekend's bye.  
</P>
<P>
 After USC's 61-0 rout of Cal on Saturday at the Coliseum, he sounded as if he 
would have liked to see Washington State, the Trojans' Nov. 5 opponent, coming 
down the Coliseum tunnel as the Bears were leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 His team has won three in a row and was obviously on top of its game.  
</P>
<P>
 However, this week Robinson said: "Fatigue is a problem late in the season for 
everyone, no matter how well you're playing. The fresher you are, the better. 
In that sense, a bye helps us. But there is that potential to get out of 
rhythm. . . . we need to make sure we hang on to it in practice." EARL GUSTKEY

 Tremain Mack, a reserve defensive back for Miami, has been suspended 
indefinitely from the team after an altercation with police that led to his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack was charged with battery on a police officer, resisting arrest with 
violence and driving under the influence. He will not play Saturday against 
Virginia Tech and is not practicing with the team this week, Coach Dennis 
Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Metro-Dade police, the altercation occurred early Sunday after an 
officer observed Mack driving erratically with a flat tire. Mack is scheduled 
to be arraigned Nov. 14.

 Only a week after having to deal with Arizona receiver Richard Dice, who is 6 
feet 2, UCLA's Teddy Lawrence will be looking uphill again on Saturday. Make 
that farther uphill, at 6-6 Justin Armour, Stanford's leading receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, a 5-9 cornerback, struggled with Dice, particularly on an eight-yard 
touchdown pass in the second quarter. Lawrence never had a chance on the 
perfectly thrown ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the only place where the receiver has an advantage on me: at 
the goal line," he said. "Any other place, I'm all right because I'm faster. If 
he gets a good jump and I get a good jump, he's going to get the ball because 
he's taller. But if his jump is just OK, I can deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody relishes playing against a receiver a half-foot or more taller, but 
it's nothing new for Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get it every day in practice from (6-2) Kevin Jordan and (6-5) J.J. 
Stokes," Lawrence said. "They're probably the best in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Terry Donahue on seeing Stokes catch a touchdown pass from Wayne Cook 
during practice: "Days of old, days of old." . . . Stanford linebacker Coy 
Gibbs on UCLA's six-game losing streak: "I wish they'd won last week. It might 
be easier for us." . . . UCLA's game at Arizona State on Nov. 12 will be at 7 
p.m. PST, an hour later than scheduled. The change is because the game will be 
broadcast on ESPN. . . . Saturday is UCLA's homecoming game. JIM HODGES

 Brian Burke, the NHL's senior vice president and director of hockey 
operations, said anti-Semitism underlies criticism of NHL Commissioner Gary 
Bettman published in Canadian newspapers. "It's not speculative.Based in large 
part on one gentleman's comments made directly to me, it's clear there's an 
anti-Semitic agenda," said Burke, who would not identify the sources or the 
exact nature of the remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no other explanation for the violent attacks (on Bettman). I'm 
sickened that in 1994 stuff like this is happening. Even some of the comments 
that have been written, to me, it's astonishing their editors haven't picked it 
up. Clearly, there's an ax to grind and there's an anti-American, anti-Semitic 
agenda. It's pathetic that would be tolerated." Miscellany

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN VOLLEYBALL HAS ITS EYE ON THE 
PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a long road back, but Chapman has a good chance to make the NCAA 
women's volleyball playoffs for the first time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 With four regular-season matches remaining, Chapman (20-7) is ranked No. 4 in 
the West Region of the NCAA Division III. Four teams from the West will qualify 
for the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, a Division III independent, plays its next three matches against 
teams from the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference -- 
Pomona-Pitzer, Whittier and La Verne. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team is ranked below the Panthers, so Chapman Coach Mary Cahill said she 
believes winning the three matches will keep her team on track for a playoff 
spot, regardless of the result of the season finale Nov. 4 against UC San 
Diego, which is ranked third nationally and first in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our own hands," Cahill said. "We don't have to upset San Diego or 
anything like that. We just have to make sure we play our game and I think it 
will all fall into place." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Panthers lost two of their three matches last week, Cahill 
believes they are coming around. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore outside hitter Shawna Parkinson, ranked in the top 20 nationally 
with a 4.3 kill average, and senior setter Christi Park, ranked in the top 20 
with 10.3 assists per game, are Chapman's top players, but others need to 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all capable of doing it," Cahill said. "They just have to be ready to 
go. It's nothing like last year. Our attack is pretty balanced." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Panthers depended on Parkinson for offense -- with 
predictable results. Chapman finished 4-20 in its final season as a NCAA 
Division II program. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the university announced its intention to switch to Division III, 
Chapman's program was a regular in the national rankings. When Cahill took over 
the program in 1989, she led the Panthers to Division II playoff appearances in 
her first two seasons, extending the Chapman streak to three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers missed the playoffs in 1991, and the slide picked up when the 
school stopped offering athletic scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahill is one of only three Chapman head coaches to stay through the 
transition and now the volleyball program appears on solid footing with a 
strong recruiting class and three returning players -- Parkinson, Park and 
sophomore Cathy Thielen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept telling them it would pay off this year," Cahill said. "I only got 
three back to accept the payoff but that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer playoffs: The Panther men's and women's soccer teams are still in the 
running for Division III playoff spots, Coach Gregg Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Playoff bids will be announced Sunday, and Murphy, who coaches both teams, 
hopes the strength of his teams' schedules will help gain a berth. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's team, 9-4-3, apparently is fighting for two spots, with UC San Diego 
and Claremont. The Panthers tied each team. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's team, 11-5 , plays host on Sunday to UC San Diego, which at 10-0-3 
has a good chance of getting a berth. SCIAC champion Cal Lutheran also is a 
strong candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have going against us is San Diego's record is better than ours," 
Murphy said. "But we have a good record, too, and I can't imagine them not 
taking us if we beat San Diego." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Home stretch: The Southern California College women's volleyball team has two 
crucial road matches Friday and Saturday. The Vanguards (16-8, 5-6 in the 
Golden State Athletic Conference) play at Westmont (17-13, 5-6) Friday and at 
Biola (13-10, 6-5) Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The top six teams from the conference qualify for the NAIA Far West regional 
playoffs. With three conference matches remaining, SCC is tied for fifth with 
Westmont, two matches ahead of seventh-place Pt. Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's football team faces its toughest home game of the season Saturday 
when the Panthers play La Verne at 7 p.m. La Verne (6-0) is ranked No. 2 in the 
Division III West Region. Quarterback Curtis Robinson, who missed last week's 
62-0 victory over Menlo because of an injured shoulder, probably will start, 
Chapman Coach Ken Visser said Wednesday. . . . The Concordia men's basketball 
team was picked to finish fifth in the Golden State Athletic Conference by the 
conference's coaches.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS; ELDERS EXPECTS BIG THINGS AT 
CROSS-COUNTRY MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Coach John Elders has high hopes for his team in 
Saturday's Big West Conference cross-country meet in Logan, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans don't expect to challenge favored UC Santa Barbara for either the 
men's or women's team championships, but Fullerton runners could take first in 
the individual events. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Heather Killeen will be favored in the women's division, and junior 
Mark Sinderson will be one of the top contenders among the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Heather and Mark are running very well now," Elders said. "With the 
exception of the Stanford meet when she finished 10th, Heather has won every 
race she's run this fall. That has been her only sub-par performance of the 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Killeen was second in the conference meet as a sophomore but was unable to 
compete last year because of a hip injury. "She's been looking forward to this 
weekend for a long time," Elders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinderson's showing in the recent Cal Poly Invitational at San Luis Obispo 
indicates he has improved considerably since he was 59th at Stanford. "In the 
Stanford meet, he finished behind five UC Santa Barbara runners," Elders said. 
"He turned it around in the Cal Poly meet, and beat all five of them, including 
Santa Barbara's top runner, Dave Cullum. Based on that, I think Mark should be 
one of the top contenders this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders said Sinderson has improved with a more demanding training schedule. 
His fifth-place finish at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo was the highest by a Big 
West runner in the men's division. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't in good shape when he came into the season," Elders said. "He 
started putting in more training mileage after the Stanford meet, and he's been 
improving since that point." 
</P>
<P>
 From a team standpoint, Elders said his goal is for the men and women to 
finish in the top three. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's team has some injury problems. Denisha Bendz has been slowed by a 
strained hamstring, but Elders still expects her to contend for the top five, 
barring additional problems. Tania Nahale, who has been struggling with 
injuries all season, now has tendinitis in an ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders is mildly apprehensive about what impact the altitude of almost 5,000 
feet will have on his runners, along with the temperature expected to be in the 
low 30s. "We'll go in only the day before, and we should be fine with the 
altitude on that basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's baseball team completed fall practice last week, and Coach Augie 
Garrido said it gave him a better perspective about where the team stands.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody went backward, and almost all of them appear to be better players than 
they were," Garrido said. "They're definitely ahead of most of the new players 
at this stage, but it takes awhile for them to adjust. I'm sure they'll be more 
ready when they come back in January." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans lost several regulars, including outfielder Dante Powell, catcher 
Bret Hemphill and infielders Jeff Ferguson, Jason Gill and Adam Millan. 
</P>
<P>
 The revamped outfield has Mark Kotsay, who led the team in hitting last season 
with a .372 average, moving from left field to center. Jeremy Giambi is in 
right, where he platooned as a starter last season. Left field is more 
uncertain. Matt Kastelic, a transfer from Rancho Santiago College, is a 
possibility there along with senior Tony Miranda and freshmen C.J. Ankrum and 
Steve Chatham. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches also are trying Ankrum at first base as they seek a replacement 
for Millan. D.C. Olsen is No. 1 there now. Junior Joe Fraser, another Rancho 
Santiago transfer, is in the lead to replace Ferguson at second, and sophomore 
Chris Remala is the leader to follow Jason Gill at third. Jack Jones started at 
shortstop last season as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Brian Loyd is the likely successor to Hemphill at catcher after 
backing up there last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido said Kotsay also will be used as a pitcher again, especially since 
Matt Wagner has been declared ineligible by the NCAA. Pitchers Mike Parisi, Dan 
Ricabal and Chad Rolish all signed pro contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton men's soccer team faces Indiana, ranked No. 1 in the nation, 
Friday in the MetLife tournament at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoosiers have been beaten only once in 17 games, losing to North Carolina, 
2-1, in their second game of the season.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a game we need to win, and would go a long way toward helping 
our season," Coach Al Mistri said. The Titans are 9-6-1 after losing, 2-1, at 
UCLA Friday, then winning at UC Irvine, 4-3, in overtime Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Larry Holmes, who turns 45 in a week, will challenge WBC heavyweight champion 
Oliver McCall on Jan. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 George Foreman, who will be 46 on Jan. 10, will challenge Michael Moorer for 
the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles Nov. 5 at Las Vegas in what will be his 
first fight in 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the 29-year-old McCall's first defense of the title he won on a 
shocking second-round knockout of Lennox Lewis on Sept. 25 at London. 
</P>
<P>
 Possible sites are Las Vegas or Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Holmes' third bid at regaining at least a piece of the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He failed to regain the IBF title from Michael Spinks when he lost a split 
decision in 1986, then retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes came back to challenge Mike Tyson in 1988, was stopped in the fourth 
round and retired again. 
</P>
<P>
 From the time Holmes became champion by outpointing Ken Norton in 1978 until 
he lost it on points to Spinks in 1985, Holmes made 17 defenses of the WBC 
title, which he relinquished, and two defenses of the IBF title.

BOOK REVIEW / FICTION; A ROUSING RETELLING OF A REAL-LIFE MARITIME ADVENTURE; 
THE GOLDEN OCEAN: A NOVEL BY PATRICK O'BRIAN ; W.W. NORTON $22.50, 285 PAGES

<P>
 The 18th- and early 19th-Century voyages of exploration provide the historical 
foundation of the marvelously civilized Aubrey/Maturin adventure novels of 
Patrick O'Brian, which have gained a devoted following. A kind of prelude or 
warm up to those novels, "The Golden Ocean" (first published in 1956) is 
O'Brian's rousing novelistic retelling of a particularly colorful chapter in 
the history of the imperialist wars of the mid-18th Century, British navy 
Commodore George Anson's semi-secret mission to harry Spanish colonial shipping 
and attack its New World stations in Peru and Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 Though one gold-laden, Manila-bound Spanish galleon was eventually taken, 
Anson's four-year expedition was a strategic washout; a single superficial raid 
on the Peruvian coast did England's enemy little damage. The trip's principal 
fruits, apart from the prize money earned by its long-suffering survivors, lay 
in its contribution to the full revelation of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravaged by storm, shipwreck, starvation and especially the dreaded sailor's 
disease scurvy, the squadron lost four of its five ships and two-thirds of its 
crewmen. Its hardships and casualties, quickly brought to light in published 
accounts, became a manual of perils for the prospective venturer around the 
Horn, a scary primer in all the worst that could befall him. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of those accounts, those of Anson's chaplain, Richard Walter, and 
of a young Irish midshipman, John Philips, appear to have supplied O'Brian much 
of what he needed to paint with charming pictorial realism the life both above 
and below decks on Anson's flagship Centurion. The principal historical 
outlines of the long cruise are retained, but evidently in keeping with an aim 
of appealing to a younger audience, the darker aspects of the crew's experience 
are played down in favor of a robust and exhilarating rendering of the great 
adventure of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if there's any character in "The Golden Ocean" with heavyweight 
potential, it's the sea itself, whose power as a kind of fate is rendered with 
the Conradian force that shows where O'Brian was headed as a narrative writer: 
</P>
<P>
 "The light was fading, and the wind, though still tremendous, was declining 
with it: yet still squalls hurled out of the darkening sky, from different 
directions now, and often the high scream reached its intolerable topmost pitch 
for minutes at a time -- blasts that would lift a crouching man into the air. 
And now the sea that the hurricane had raised caught up with the wind, an 
enormous hollow sea, racing, scooped into wild irregularities by the squalls, 
so that the laboring ships had no even motion but ran in mad, jarring lurches 
-- ran straight for the land, a race-horse speed under bare poles and a 
lee-shore white with five miles' breadth of murderous surf an unknown length of 
time away: half an hour, an hour perhaps; not more with this unrelenting wind." 
</P>
<P>
 In a useful autobiographical note prefacing the new "Patrick O'Brian: Critical 
Essays and a Bibliography," edited by Arthur Cunningham (from the same 
publisher), the novelist confides that his "cheerful little 'Golden Ocean' " 
(designated elsewhere in the critical volume as a "historical novel for 
children") was written "for fun . . . in little more than a month, laughing 
most of the time."  
</P>
<P>
 In "The Golden Ocean," O'Brian's protagonist is a young Irish midshipman 
through whose eyes the life of the ship is seen. Clearly a captain like the 
rather drab real-life Anson offered the novelist little in the way of 
inspiration -- his retiring manner prompted the saying that he "had been 'round 
the world but was never in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, O'Brian's Anson is a benign, distant authority figure, more "iron 
and oak" than flesh and blood, and, unlike O'Brian's later fictional captain 
Jack Aubrey, of only peripheral interest. But the rivalries and friendships, 
pranks and jokes of the midshipmen's berth convey a sense of good-humored 
humanity that engages our sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning from O'Brian's "cheerful" version of the Anson voyage to the macabre 
account of its depredations contained in midshipman Philips' journal, one can't 
help regretting that O'Brian didn't feel free here to deal more fully with the 
manifest cruelties of 18-Century maritime life right along with its perhaps 
largely invented glories -- as he would do in the Aubrey/Maturin novels to 
come.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; FORMER COUNCILMAN DROPS LIBEL LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending nearly $6,000 on legal fees, former City Councilman Warren 
Harwood has dropped his libel suit against the man who beat him in the June 
council election. Harwood filed the Superior Court lawsuit against current 9th 
District Councilman Jerry Shultz shortly after the June 7 election, claiming 
Shultz lied about him in campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit focused on Shultz mailers to the district's North Long Beach voters. 
One such mailer quoted Harwood's former neighbor -- an African American -- as 
saying that Harwood built a high wall between their homes after she moved in. 
Harwood said the statement was false and was Shultz's attempt to brand him a 
racist. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Harwood formally withdrew the suit, in which he had asked for $1 
million in damages. "I ran out of money," Harwood said. "The suit just wasn't 
going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Harwood, a projects coordinator for the Los Angeles County Department of 
Health Services, now lives in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz, who spent about $5,000 in legal fees, said the suit was frivolous. "I 
may contact (Harwood) and ask him to pay my legal costs, or I may just write it 
off as a bad experience," he said. "I haven't decided." EMILY ADAMS

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: RAISE A TOAST TO SOUTH BAY'S NEW WINE LABEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 POPPING THE CORK: Sure, the South Bay has its sunny beaches, its gently 
rolling waves and its salty sea breezes, but let's face it, something has been 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the delights of the South Bay can be savored with a glass of South 
Bay wine: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and, coming next week, white 
Zinfandel. 
</P>
<P>
 No, there are no vineyards tucked in remote portions of Hawthorne. But San 
Diego residents Tim and Nancy Moore are shipping cases of Sonoma County wine, 
complete with labels depicting the Manhattan Beach pier at sunset, to local 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very drinkable wine. It's not 'foo-foo' wine," says Tim Moore, 49, who 
owns Scenic Wine Co., which distributes wine with special labels to tourist 
areas, including Newport Beach and Del Mar.  
</P>
<P>
 Moore developed the idea four years ago while working in his tiny Colorado 
wine shop. First he marketed Telluride wine to Colorado skiers, then expanded 
the business to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Moore says he has sold several hundred cases of South Bay wine to 
grocery stores in Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach. The bottles 
retail for about $7 each. 
</P>
<P>
 He says sales have been boosted by the wine's attractive label.

 A PAINFUL OUTCOME: They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
But for Dr. Wayne McKinny of Palm Springs, the road of good intentions may lead 
to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 After being lauded as a humanitarian for arranging to bring a Russian girl to 
America for treatment of a life-threatening affliction, McKinny is now being 
sued for $205,483 by a debt collection agency for Harbor-UCLA Medical Center 
near Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Baranova, 4, was covered with a hairy nevus, a mole-like growth that 
threatened to turn cancerous. McKinny encountered her while visiting her 
hometown of Zelanadolsk, Tatarstan, 350 miles east of Moscow. After McKinny and 
others, including former international relief worker Ted Werner of Rancho Palos 
Verdes, arranged to bring Eleanor and her mother to Los Angeles in 1992, the 
girl underwent 10 operations at Harbor-UCLA and at a hospital in San Diego to 
remove the mole. Earlier this year, Eleanor went back to Russia until she can 
return for the final operations in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harbor-UCLA demanded payment for Eleanor's hospital stay. (A local 
plastic surgeon had performed the surgery for free.) McKinny didn't have the 
money and couldn't raise it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the hospital has assigned the debt to a collection agency that filed the 
suit in Torrance against McKinny and Werner for the $205,000. McKinny said that 
regardless of what happens with the lawsuit, he intends to bring Eleanor back 
for her final operations, which will be provided free by a San Diego group 
called Fresh Start.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will wipe me out," McKinny, a retired pediatrician, said. But he added, 
"If I had to do it over, I would do the same thing again." 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokeswoman was unavailable for comment.

 CATTLE RANCH IN THE SKY: For years, Lomita Councilman Dave Albert has raised 
steers on his half-acre farm. But just hours after Albert arrived home recently 
with Buford, a 500-pound steer from Riverside, the animal bolted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Buford died. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday afternoon, the black Angus, heading for the tasty green lawns nearby, 
crashed through a chain-link fence at Albert's farm on 240th Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Responding to reports of a loose cow, eight police officers joined several 
neighbors trying to corral the steer. But the animal would not allow anyone to 
come close.  
</P>
<P>
 Animal control couldn't control him. The Department of Fish and Game said 
Buford didn't qualify as game. So police called a vet. 
</P>
<P>
 An attempt to inject Buford with a tranquilizer sent the steer galloping into 
a market parking lot. Police cornered Buford once more, but he escaped by 
jumping on the hood of a squad car.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials and neighbors finally held Buford still enough for the vet to 
administer a sedative. It worked. Too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Buford died after being taken back to Albert's farm, apparently of an 
overdose, Albert said. QUOTE OF THE WEEK

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; LAW EASES SITE LIMITS ON ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new zoning ordinance that will allow topless clubs and other adult 
entertainment businesses to operate closer to schools, homes and churches has 
been given final approval by a reluctant City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, which council members ratified last week, will go into effect 
Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action came after judges, in two separate lawsuits against the 
city, said Long Beach's current law may be unconstitutional because it doesn't 
provide enough commercial areas for adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the new law will continue to enforce buffer zones between 
adult businesses and homes, but the buffers will be reduced from 500 feet to 
300 feet. Adult businesses can also set up 500 feet from churches and 600 feet 
from a park, closer than the previous 1,000-foot limit. EMILY ADAMS

MEMBERS OF 1955 COMPTON TEAM THAT BROKE COLOR BARRIER HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The occasion was to honor eight black players from the undefeated 1955 Compton 
College football team that broke racial barriers by playing Jones Junior 
College of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 The game, involving the nation's two top junior college teams, marked the 
first time a Mississippi college, junior college or high school had played an 
integrated opponent. Top-ranked Compton defeated Jones, 22-13, before a crowd 
of 58,132 at the Rose Bowl to claim the junior college championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the hoopla at a reception Tuesday night for the five surviving players 
at the Compton Community College Board of Trustees meeting, however, surrounded 
a demonstration by more than 100 students armed with signs in opposition of 
Proposition 187, the initiative that proposes to deny most public services to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is ironic that 40 years later, we find ourselves tonight dealing with 
another issue of racial overtones," board member Kent Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters had dispersed by the time the four players in attendance -- Lee 
Sampson, Billy Brown, Jimmy Waddell and Lee Mack -- were recognized. The other 
remaining player, Edis McNeil, was not present. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see a lot of gentlemen tonight who have gone through a lot of hardships 
and played under constraints," Sampson said. "So right now we are in an era in 
our lives that we must reach out to people of other races. And it's important 
to realize we have to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson, 57, a loan consultant who lives in Lynwood, is spearheading a 
campaign to find players -- black and white -- from the 1955 team for a reunion 
next year in Ellisville, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones College wants the black Compton players to ride in a homecoming parade 
and attend a football game for the 40th anniversary of their historic contest. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mack, 59, an airline baggage handler whose son, Shane, plays for the 
Minnesota Twins, it's a gesture that is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 40 years and a national championship, nobody talked about these guys 
until now," said Mack, an Inglewood resident. "They should have had their 
recognition in 1956, not 1996. We had eight blacks playing with white boys and 
that was unheard of. We went through hell sometimes. We've had bricks thrown at 
us and went through all kinds of segregated places." 
</P>
<P>
 Board vice president Emily Hart-Holifield, apparently moved by the players' 
testimonials, asked them to appear on a local cable television show to relive 
their experience and to give a talk to the Compton College athletic teams. 
</P>
<P>
 At the players' urging, a resolution was passed to rename the football field 
after Tay Brown, the coach of the 1955 team. Brown, who coached at Compton from 
1937 to the mid 1960s, died in July at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great man and affected my life," Brown said. "He was colorblind. He 
didn't care if you were white, black or green. If you believed in yourself, he 
believed in you." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 62, a retired carpenter, has lived in the Los Angeles area since his 
playing days but said he had seen Sampson only once before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A tailgate party for the players will be held before the Tartars' Nov. 12 
homecoming game against Los Angeles Valley and they will be recognized at the 
football awards banquet in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell, 62, though, can't wait to make the trip to Mississippi. The halfback 
suffered a fractured nose, a cut eye and a concussion when he was kicked in the 
eye by a Jones player and was forced to leave the game early in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Waddell wants to find the player who kicked him. He wants to buy him lunch.

CERRITOS COLLEGE OFFICIAL FACES CONFLICT PROBE; ETHICS: ADMINISTRATOR ALLEGEDLY 
STEERED FOREIGN STUDENTS TO TRANSCRIPT EVALUATION FIRM HE OWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN COX, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Cerritos College administrator has been placed on leave pending an 
investigation into conflict-of-interest allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Viet Be, vice president of student services, allegedly steered foreign 
students to a company he owns to evaluate their transcripts and complete their 
academic files, college President Fred Gaskin said. The company, International 
Service Center, charged students as much as $120 for its services, Gaskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students received letters warning that their transcripts from foreign high 
schools had to be evaluated by the company for them to remain at the college, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the district attorney's office and the Fair Political Practices 
Commission have been asked to investigate the allegations, college officials 
said. Be and his attorney, Glenn Rothner, did not return repeated phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's board of trustees, which placed Be on paid leave Oct. 19, plans 
to meet with him in closed session Nov. 10 to discuss the allegations, Gaskin 
said. The president said he also has ordered the college admissions staff to 
stop sending letters that tell foreign students to send transcripts to Be's 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Be, who was hired in January, 1992, as director of admissions and records, 
apparently began sending the letters to foreign students in January, 1993, 
Gaskin said. The letters told students that high school and college records 
"must be evaluated by the International Service Center." Be had added the 
requirement to a policy that previously required only proficiency in English 
for foreign students. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later, the admissions office, over which Be had authority, also 
amended the college's general catalogue, adding the requirement that 
international students have their foreign high school work evaluated, Gaskin 
said. The president said he rescinded the policy last week. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials have sent out letters to the 1,400 foreign students who have 
enrolled at Cerritos since 1993 to notify them that they are not required to 
have their transcripts evaluated. The letter also asked students whether the 
company had actually provided the evaluations. Officials said they do not know 
how many students paid for evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 Be founded the International Service Center in 1990, according to documents 
filed with the Los Angeles county clerk. The documents listed Be's Canoga Park 
residence at the time as the address of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said college counselors received complaints from students who said 
they never received transcript evaluations after paying for them. Officials 
said they were unable to contact the company because no phone number is given 
on its forms and the address provided on applications is a post office box in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicky Guiyab, whose son, Ericson, attends Cerritos College, said she paid the 
company $400 last year for evaluations of her son's college transcripts from 
the Philippines but never received evaluations. She said she initially paid $80 
for two evaluations, $120 for a special course summary and then $120 to rush 
the evaluations. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she complained to Be. "He told me he was going (to the company) 
personally to ask why there's no answer yet," Guiyab said. She said he never 
told her that he owned the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaskin said investigators may also probe allegations that Be authorized the 
purchase of two computers for the college from Be's company. The $6,500 
purchases apparently violated competitive-bidding requirements, Gaskin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Be was promoted last July to vice president of student services. His salary is 
$90,000 a year.

DESPITE OUTCRY, NATURE CENTER CONSTRUCTION WILL GO FORWARD; BUILDING: CRITICS 
SAY CATALINA ISLAND ALREADY HAS SUCH A CENTER. THE $1.3-MILLION FACILITY IS 
WASTEFUL, THEY SAY, IN LIGHT OF A RECENT BOOST IN COST OF PARAMEDIC SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Most times, county plans to build parks or other public facilities draw praise 
from local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Catalina Island, plans for a $1.3-million nature center have many 
residents and local officials fuming. They say they already have a nature 
center at the botanical gardens and another one is the last thing they need, 
especially after county officials recently increased the cost of paramedic 
services on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Many have written letters to the island's newspapers and called their county 
representative to complain. "It's a waste of money," said Avalon Mayor Ralph J. 
Morrow Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think it's needed," said Councilman Scott D. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether or not the 3,200-square-foot interpretive center is needed, it 
will be built: Construction began Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the project will come from Proposition A, a 1992 county bond measure 
that raised millions of dollars to restore parks, acquire wildlife habitat and 
improve public piers. It specifically called for the interpretive center on 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Voters approved the project before the county drastically increased rates for 
the county's paramedic and bay-watch services on the island. Avalon had been 
paying $46,000 annually for the county services, but last year the county 
boosted the cost to $300,000 a year, a fee island officials say the city of 
Avalon can barely afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedic services are critical on Catalina because the island community 
cannot turn to a private ambulance service or another city's service for help, 
island officials say. The county provides four paramedics in Avalon who respond 
to calls throughout the island. Many would rather see the money for the nature 
center help fund those services. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials say that can't happen: When voters approved the bond 
measure, they specifically signed off on construction of the island's 
interpretive center. 
</P>
<P>
 So residents' pleas that they already have a history museum and botanical 
gardens fall on deaf ears. As do their suggestions for other ways to spend the 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 "$1 million would go a long way on the repair of the road from Two Harbors to 
Avalon, which at this time is worse than I have ever seen it," Maureen Oudin of 
Two Harbors wrote to the local newspaper. "Doesn't the county library fall 
under the heading of 'recreation?' "  
</P>
<P>
 And nothing will come of Nelson's claims that the money could be better spent 
making City Hall more accessible to the handicapped or for a senior citizens 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand their point of view," said Rod Cooper, county Parks and 
Recreation Department director. "But the law has been set up so I have to 
administer the project. It was passed by the voters, so I have no options." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, scheduled to be completed next spring, is designed to educate 
visitors. It will feature displays on the island's history, geology, nature and 
artifacts, said county projects manager Sandra Fiorenza. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say they are doing their best to please the island's 3,300 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The county recently agreed to add a public meeting room to the center to 
accommodate the island's clubs and community groups. And officials say they met 
with island representatives to determine the best location for the center, 
which is being built in Avalon Canyon near the city of Avalon.

 People on quiet Santa Catalina Island putter around town in their golf carts, 
shake their heads at the silly tourists and thank God that 26 miles of deep 
water separate them from the rest of crime-infested, smog-shrouded Southern 
California, which they refer to as "over town." 
</P>
<P>
 But lately life on the island hasn't been so uniformly sedate: In a roundabout 
way, the Southland's gang problem has found its way across the water to 
Catalina. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, school officials have told the island's 641 public 
schoolchildren that they cannot wear the traditional surf T-shirts and faded 
jeans to class anymore. Instead, it's light-colored shirts and dark blue or 
black shorts, pants or skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-campus Long Beach Unified School District, which includes Catalina's 
two peaceful public schools, has mandated a dress code to curb gang violence 
and boost academic performance. The rule is being applied to the island's two 
schools, where the main turf war erupts when uppity sophomores dare to set foot 
on the seniors-only lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule went into effect last month. Catalina's elementary and high school 
principal, Mark V. Ur, cited a study that indicates dress codes improve 
students' behavior, boost self-esteem and attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like dressing up and going to work," he said. "Their job is learning." 
</P>
<P>
 But many who moved to Catalina for a laid-back life among the swaying palm 
trees and gently rolling hills disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no fights here," said senior Steven Gonzalez, 18, who, in his blue 
shirt and white shorts, didn't quite match the policy's color codes. "Who are 
they to tell me what to wear? Do they really think it will solve any problems?" 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has divided many in the resort town of Avalon, where nearly all of 
the island's 3,300 residents live among the colorful minibuses, T-shirt shops 
and ice cream stands. 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue arose earlier this year, opponents circulated petitions, school 
officials called a special meeting with parents, and the post office, where 
residents gather to collect their mail, buzzed with the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a school survey found that a majority of parents favored the rule, 
officials decided to broaden the policy to include the island's high school 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, only elementary and middle school students are required to 
follow the dress code. But more than half of the Catalina parents who were 
surveyed last year said all students should be included. Most of the island's 
students -- from kindergarten to high school seniors -- attend Avalon School. 
The tiny, one-room schoolhouse across the island in Two Harbors has only 13 
students enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the district do have a way out. But their parents must file for an 
exemption, meet with the principal and then talk to a district official. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday, parents of 242 students throughout the Long Beach district had 
asked that their children be excluded. More than half of those requests -- 143 
-- came from Catalina, including the parents of six children in Two Harbors.  
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the least sense here," said Anni Marshall, 42, who filed for 
exemptions for her two children in the Avalon school. "If I lived with gangs in 
Long Beach, I may look at it differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who don't comply could be disciplined, Ur said. They and their 
parents will be asked to meet with the principal. Eventually, students could be 
ordered to serve detention after school, and in extreme cases, could be 
suspended, he said. But Ur suspects that won't happen.

OFFICIALS TRADE BARBS OVER HARASSING PHONE CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he is the victim of "small-time political vandalism," Lawndale Mayor 
Pro Tem Norm Lagerquist has accused Councilman Larry Rudolph of making 
harassing phone calls to his home.  
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph denies making the calls and says that the accusations were made as 
political retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one from my house made those calls," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagerquist says telephone records prove his allegations, but that assertion 
has also caused controversy.  
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to the council Monday night, Lagerquist said he had received 
eight phone calls between 1 and 3 a.m. beginning Sept. 27. The most recent call 
was Sunday. Each time, the caller hung up when the phone was answered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like these calls to stop. My peace of mind is being harmed," 
Lagerquist said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fourth call, Lagerquist said, he asked Pacific Bell's "annoyance 
calls" bureau to trace his incoming calls. Lagerquist said a Pacific Bell 
customer service representative told him that three early-morning calls placed 
Oct. 3-6 were traced to Rudolph's residence. Lagerquist said that he did not 
get the operator's name. But sheriff's detectives confirmed the information, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell officials would not comment on Lagerquist's request for tracing, 
but they said his telephone records, including the incoming calls, have been 
turned over to the Lennox sheriff's station.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Lagerquist said he got his information from a Pacific Bell 
representative, company officials say it is against their policy to tell a 
customer any information about a company investigation, including the name, 
address or phone number of a caller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be surprised if a customer service representative volunteered the 
information. . . . We send that information directly to the (sheriff)," said 
Pacific Bell spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives say Lagerquist filed a complaint about the calls Oct. 11 
and that they are investigating the matter. Sgt. Jim LeBlanc said that no one 
in the Sheriff's Department released information about the caller to Lagerquist 
and did not confirm any information for him.  
</P>
<P>
 The allegations are the latest in a series of political barbs traded by 
Rudolph and Lagerquist, who have been political adversaries since Lagerquist 
joined the council in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Lagerquist said the harassing phone calls began the night that he supported 
ousting Rudolph's wife from the Parks and Recreation Commission. At the Sept. 
26 City Council meeting, Lagerquist, along with council members Nancy Marthens 
and Virginia M. Rhodes, voted against Shirley Rudolph and selected a new member 
to fill her commission seat. Mayor Harold E. Hofmann and Larry Rudolph 
supported Rudolph's wife.  
</P>
<P>
 Marthens and Rhodes say they also received annoying calls late in the night, 
but neither reported the incidents to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph said he was not upset by the council's decision to replace his wife. 
He also said that Lagerquist, in making the harassment charge, is trying to get 
even with him for a past dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph voted to censure him after Lagerquist wrote a letter on city 
stationery asking a judge for leniency for an associate who pleaded no contest 
in a lewd conduct case involving a 12-year-old girl. "I think he's still sore 
from when he got his hand caught in the cookie jar supporting a child molester, 
and he's been after me ever since," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lagerquist said he does not hold a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials say the investigation should be complete by Tuesday.

LAWNDALE GIVES ASTROTURF NO MIDDLE-OF-ROAD PRAISE: IT'S BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SWEET, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the entrance of his Lawndale furniture store, Bill Henderson can see what 
has been lampooned by some as a civic joke and derided by others as a civic 
tragedy -- a swatch of worn, weathered Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks crummy," Henderson said of the dreary artificial lawn that carpets 
the median of Hawthorne Boulevard in front of his store. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawndale -- called "Astrodale" by some -- is a city divided. 
</P>
<P>
 On the northern half of Hawthorne Boulevard, the median is landscaped with 
grass and boulders, Italian cypress and eucalyptus trees. But south of the San 
Diego Freeway, a different spectacle unfolds: balding, faded plastic grass, 
littered with cigarette butts, discarded gum, wrappers and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after the United States put a man on the moon, Lawndale carpeted the 
median of its entire strip of Hawthorne Boulevard -- also known as State 
Highway 107 -- with Astroturf. The idea was to save the city maintenance costs, 
the same reason a number of baseball and football stadiums installed the fake 
grass around the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 But once it became obvious the turf served as a magnet for litter, the city 
had to invest in vacuum cleaners. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, the City Council decided to landscape anew the medians at 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Marine Avenue. Now, with the remainder of the 
Astroturf nearly 25 years old, the council has asked the state to give up 
control of Lawndale's section of the highway -- a decision that may hasten 
removal of the remaining Astroturf. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans, which currently is responsible for the road, is agreeable. But 
before Caltrans can transfer authority over the roadway, state law requires 
that the agency restore it to a good state of repair.  
</P>
<P>
 Would this include removal of the Astroturf?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's negotiable," said Russ Snyder, a Caltrans spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lawndale covered the median -- which once served as a trolley route, 
bridle path and drainage ditch -- with Astroturf in 1970, the product's 
manufacturer, Monsanto Co., gave the city a plaque. Below a strip of Astroturf, 
the citation read: "World's First Astro Grass Traffic Median Installation." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1984, the color had faded, so the city tried to paint the Astroturf green 
in preparation for the carrying of the Olympic torch through the city. 
Aquamarine ground cover resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Harold Hofmann can't remember the last time the city -- which is paid by 
Caltrans to maintain the highway -- vacuumed the Astroturf. Five years ago, he 
recalled, workers used fire hoses to wash away the trash that had accumulated 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, much of the plastic grass has snapped off. All that's left are the 
circular nubs that once held it. In one spot, the turf has split and a strip of 
concrete shows. 
</P>
<P>
 A Monsanto official said the company stopped manufacturing polyethylene for 
landscaping 15 years ago and said he was startled that Lawndale's turf is still 
in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got 25 years out of it? That's fantastic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is removed, Hofmann has an idea of what the city's reaction will be.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll all say 'Glory, hallelujah!' " he said.

DECISION '94: SPOTLIGHT ON LOCAL ELECTIONS; DILLS RESPONDS TO COHEN'S SAX 
APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redondo Beach attorney David Barrett Cohen has hammered State Sen. Ralph C. 
Dills (D-El Segundo) on his long tenure, his pensions and his special interest 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican opponent's mailer is what really irritated the 84-year-old 
Dills. It featured Cohen borrowing a Dills trademark, holding a saxophone and 
the slogan "Time to Change the Tune." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has only one hand on the damn thing," said Dills, once a professional sax 
player, in his raspy, Southwestern drawl. "You can't play a sax with only one 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Their race in the 28th State Senate District is a classic matchup of a young 
upstart versus the long-entrenched, battle-tested incumbent. (Also running are 
Peace and Freedom candidate Cindy Henderson and Libertarian Neal Arvid Donner.) 
 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen has tried to define his opponent as out of touch and beholden to liquor, 
gambling and tobacco industry political action committees -- "sin PACs," as 
Dills calls them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, meanwhile, has seized on his opponent's fumbles. Most recently: Cohen's 
charge that Dills collected a legislative pension while in the Senate. It 
turned out to be false, and Cohen sent a letter of apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Making their battle more complex is the split personality of the 28th 
District, which was created when legislative lines were redrawn to include the 
beach cities Playa del Rey, Westchester, Marina del Rey and Venice. The 
district's eastern half -- considered a Dills stronghold -- includes 
blue-collar and ethnically diverse Compton, Carson and Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is: Will there be so many votes in the Republican coast areas to 
counteract (the) east side (of the district)?" said Republican consultant Allan 
Hoffenblum. "For Cohen to have any chance, he has to win big in the beach 
cities and hold his own in the eastern end." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of September, Dills had $77,833 in his campaign war chest, compared 
to Cohen's $53,085. State Republicans won't say whether they'll invest in the 
final weeks of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen takes pains to distance himself from conservative Republicans. He favors 
abortion rights and opposes Proposition 187, the initiative that would deny 
many public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up thinking that Republicans didn't care about the poor," said Cohen, 
who was raised in a working-class section of Washington. "I felt they were 
mean-spirited and greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 He credits Jack Kemp for changing his mind in the mid-1980s. The then-New York 
congressman, who ran for President in 1988, had a platform of "bleeding heart" 
conservatism that emphasized aid to urban areas. Cohen has adopted many parts 
of Kemp's platform of enterprise zones and tax incentives to stimulate poor 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the type of Republican people can respond to in this area," Cohen said. 
"It seemed pretty much tailor-made for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the same approach he took in his unsuccessful bid against Rep. Mel 
Levine (D-Santa Monica) in 1990. Cohen did well in the South Bay areas of El 
Segundo and Manhattan Beach, but was trounced by Levine in the Democratic 
strongholds of the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Cohen is trying to persuade longtime Democrats in Carson to cross 
party lines. In doing so, he's promoting his family's multiethnic history -- he 
is half Jewish, half-Samoan, prompting his slogan a "rainbow on the right" -- 
as well as his ties to Carson's Pacific Islander community. Among them are more 
than 200 relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our family has sort of a weird, tortured history, but it is sort of the wave 
of the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Dills is fighting hard to retain his foothold in Carson. At a 
recent Carson parade to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur's landing in the Philippines, Dills promoted his ties to Filipino 
Americans, including a scholarship that the United Filipino Service 
Organization gives in his wife's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I see those of you my age, we're not ready for the trash heap this soon," 
said Dills to the war veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, who taught in Compton schools in the 1930s and 1940s, traces his 
judicial and legislative career to 1938. Resplendent in wild and colorful ties 
(fuchsia and purple neon on a recent day), he recalls playing saxophone with 
Nat King Cole and his brother and that baseball great Duke Snyder was one of 
his students. 
</P>
<P>
 But far from reminiscing on the trail, Dills has set out to highlight his 
accomplishments in the state Senate, where he chairs the powerful Government 
Organization Committee and is the body's presiding officer. 
</P>
<P>
 And in appealing to the beach cities, he's trumpeting his ties to 
environmentalists, on the premise residents there are more eco-conscious. His 
endorsers include the California League of Conservation Voters, a group that 
had once chided him for pro-industry votes. He recently helped push through a 
bill banning offshore oil drilling in state tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the people's will," he says of his switch to "green" issues. "I'm in a 
new district. They're the boss. (The oil companies) didn't like it. But there 
was not a damn thing they could do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the age issue. Dills spent almost $500,000 during the primary 
on billboards showing him tooting a sax and the slogan "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to the funerals of those who exercise," he said. Senate District 28 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Along the coast from Venice to Redondo Beach, extending inland to 
include sections of Long Beach and Compton.

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE BLASTS BAR ASSN. RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two court commissioners competing for a judge's seat on Compton Municipal 
Court have received widely different ratings from the Los Angeles County Bar 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Court Commissioner Thomas Townsend was rated "not qualified" by the 
association's judicial evaluation committee. Townsend had appealed the 
committee's preliminary decision to label him not qualified, but the rating 
remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rated Townsend's opponent, Commissioner Kelvin D. Filer, "well 
qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from the committee said that Townsend's objectivity was in question 
and that the committee believed Townsend had preconceptions that could affect 
his judgment of the law. The letter did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, an angry Townsend attributed the unfavorable rating to the 
committee's dislike of his campaign tactics and to Filer's political 
connections. Filer, former president of the Compton Unified School District 
board, is the son of former City Councilman Maxcy D. Filer. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was particularly unhappy with Townsend's decision to publicize 
Filer's earnings as a court-appointed defense attorney, Townsend said. "They 
feel it's beneath the dignity of a judicial campaign," Townsend said. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend said he made an average of $39,000 a year as a court-appointed 
attorney, while Filer averaged about $150,000 while he was also president of 
the school board. In campaign literature, Townsend questioned whether Filer 
shortchanged Compton students by paying more attention to his law practice than 
his school board duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend said he believes the concern about his objectivity stems from two 
cases that he handled, without charge, as a defense attorney. Townsend said he 
believes he is being punished for being a zealous advocate in those cases. But 
Filer said the committee's decision more likely refers to Townsend's sample 
ballot statement, in which Townsend states that his tough courtroom policies 
include high bail in certain cases and maximum sentencing in others. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee discussed the ballot statements and the cases that Townsend 
handled, said attorney Rex Heinke, chairman of the 50-member group. "But since 
we don't poll members on specifics . . . I can't say why anyone voted the way 
they did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heinke denied that politics played a part in the committee's decision. He also 
said Townsend's campaign tactics were not "the major element" in the final 
rating. EMILY ADAMS

POLITICAL NOTES: LAWSUITS GAIN POPULARITY AS WAY FOR OFFICE-SEEKERS TO COMBAT 
MAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 COURTING CONTROVERSY: Candidates have several ways to respond to attack 
mailers: send out one in response, hold a news conference or file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to court seems to be a recent response of choice. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) sued opponent David Barrett Cohen 
Tuesday for $1 million over a mailer claiming that Dills collects a legislative 
pension at the same time he serves in Sacramento. That's prohibited by state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 "That implies that I am in collusion with the retirement system," Dills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills collects Social Security and pensions for his days as a schoolteacher 
and municipal judge. The suit also names Republican Julian Sirull, who is 
running against Assemblywoman Debra Bowen in the 53rd Assembly District, 
because he was included in the mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Cohen issued a statement of apology and took full responsibility 
for the statement. He said that it was placed in the mailer -- recently sent to 
absentee voters -- after a consultant mistook Dills' legislative salary for a 
pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, the error was a minor one," Cohen said. "It's important, 
however, to correct the record so voters can decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills is being represented in the lawsuit by Michael I. Sidley, the Venice 
attorney who lost to him in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance is suing Rancho 
Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks, who beat him in the June Republican 
primary in the 36th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance claims he was libeled in a mailer titled "60 Lawsuits and Counting." 
The ad called Florance "the Republican who can't win in or out of court." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names Ron Yates, the publisher of California's Republic 
Reporter, which published an article about his litigation; Republican John 
Duke, who appeared in the Reporter as part of his unsuccessful campaign against 
Rep. Steve Horn (R-Long Beach); Brooks' husband, Jim, and campaign worker Les 
Martin. Florance is seeking punitive damages of $250,000, general damages of $1 
and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign charged that the filing of the lawsuit is politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "His new lawsuit is just the latest example of Mr. Florance's inability to 
solve any problems outside of the courtroom," said Jim Brooks, an adviser to 
his wife's campaign. "I guess we'll have to change the title of the mailer from 
'60 Lawsuits and Counting' to '61 Lawsuits and Counting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MO' MONEY: Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) still has a hefty war chest with 
less than two weeks left in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has $365,234 in cash to Brooks' $68,065, according to the latest 
campaign statements, which cover Oct. 1 to Oct. 19. Harman spent $206,358 to 
Brooks' $54,943 in that period. A large portion of what Harman has left is 
expected to go to television advertisements. 
</P>
<P>
 Both campaigns have stepped up fund-raising efforts, with Harman raising 
$101,920 to Brooks' $52,835. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BABBITT AT BALLONA: Yet another Friend of Jane's came to stump for her on 
Friday: Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
 As skaters whizzed by the Fig Tree Cafe on the Venice boardwalk, Babbitt 
praised Harman's environmental record and her persistence in nagging him about 
the Ballona Wetlands, set to be restored as a developer embarks on the new 
Playa Vista project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a good congressman is advocating the interests of the district because 
they are on the phone and they've got specific proposals," he said after a 
speech at the cafe. "The Ballona Wetlands is something she's been after me 
about for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the morning, at the wetlands, Babbitt and Harman pledged that 
restoration of the wetlands will be sped up. More than two dozen agencies will 
restore more than 200 acres of wetlands, including a marsh and freshwater 
habitat west of Lincoln Boulevard. The work will be done as McGuire Thomas 
Partners constructs the Playa Vista project, a massive residential and 
commercial development on adjacent land. Babbitt said he would set up a system 
of "parallel processing" of government permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be slow getting here, but I'm here and I ain't leaving," Babbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt is the most senior of all Clinton Administration officials to campaign 
for Harman. He predicted that the anti-Clinton tide will recede come Election 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Saturday night tear-on-the-town against the political system is

saying, 'Wait a minute. It's the only system we have.' "

 SIGN TARGET: It seems to happen every campaign season these days: sign 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 But the damage to Brooks' signs has been an extreme case, her campaign manager 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Her "Susan Brooks for Congress" signs are being altered or destroyed en masse, 
according to campaign manager John Perkins. In some cases, the vandal paints 
over the "Susan" and stencils lettering over the B and s in "Brooks" so it 
reads "Crook! for Congress." Other signs are stolen, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put them up one night, and the next day they are gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates that of 2,700 signs, more than half have been altered or stolen. 
The campaign has reported the incidents to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department in Lomita and to the Torrance Police Department.

COMMUNITY NEWS: COMPTON; SCHOOLS ORDERED TO PAY FOOD SERVICES FIRM

<P>
 A federal judge has ruled that Compton Unified School District owes $2.2 
million to a food service management company that operated the district's 
school lunch programs for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 District Judge William Rea in Los Angeles ruled earlier this month that the 
district breached its contract with United School Food Services, a partnership 
of Marriott School Services Inc. and National Business Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard A. Allen, an attorney for the company, said the issue was simple: His 
client provided food and services, but did not get paid. The company filed the 
lawsuit in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The district refused to pay part of the company's management fee and other 
costs, attorney Melanie Lomax contended, because the company ran up millions of 
dollars of deficits over three years, rather than generating revenue for the 
district as promised.  
</P>
<P>
 "During their three-year tenure, the program was $4 million in the red," Lomax 
said. "Because of that non-performance, the district is not liable." The 
district has appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The district signed a contract with the company to manage and operate its 
lunch program from 1989 to 1991. The contract called for the district to pay 
the company a management fee and the costs of food purchases. The district 
failed to make these payments in the last months of the contract, the judge 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has hired a food services director and now manages its own school 
lunch program. EMELYN CRUZ LAT

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; LEAD BEING REMOVED FROM MODEL BOAT SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City parks officials are working to return a preschool to a city-owned 
recreation facility after tests on children and employees who used the site 
showed no dangerous levels of exposure to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials recently removed 12 inches of topsoil from the Long Beach Model Boat 
Shop after tests found lead contamination of soil and work surfaces at the 
facility in September, recreation Supt.Jana Ransom said. Tables and benches 
were also removed and will be replaced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The soil may be replaced by the end of the month, which would allow the 
Colorado Lagoon Preschool Co-Op to return to the boat shop, Ransom said. The 
school was moved temporarily in September to a recreation building at 5620 
Atherton St. in Whaley Park.  
</P>
<P>
 Tests were ordered for the site after a parent complained in August that 
children were filing lead moldings as part of a summer program in building 
model boats. The same boat-building process has been used for 60 years at the 
facility, which is near the Colorado Lagoon at 5119 Colorado St. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials found regular levels of lead exposure during tests on 26 
preschoolers, three employees who worked at the facility and 24 children who 
constructed model boats at the facility over the past two summers, city health 
officer Darryl Sexton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park and recreation officials will develop a new process for constructing the 
metal keels that keep the model boats upright. JOHN COX

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWTHORNE; COCKATOO INN TO CLOSE, RELUCTANTLY, DEC. 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The landmark Cockatoo Inn, which recently got a $1-million face lift, will 
close its doors in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the inn's management company, California Hotels Corp., said the 
213-room hotel, which resembles a half-timbered English house, was losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing to me," said John Mavros, the company's senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the hotel received a $500,000 contract with the military to 
temporarily house new recruits waiting to take examinations. But the contract 
was not enough to support the inn, which has slid to an average occupancy rate 
of 50%, Mavros said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharpest hit has been the loss of thousands of defense industry and 
aerospace jobs in the South Bay, Mavros said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 employees were notified that the hotel will be closing Dec. 22, 
Mavros said. The company, which owns other hotels in California, is trying to 
help employees relocate or find other work, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inn has been for sale for years, for up to $11 million. The most recent 
asking price was $3.5 million, Mavros said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, which was constructed in 1946 as a chicken-and-rib drive-in 
restaurant, catered to politicians and celebrities during the 1950s and '60s.

COVER STORY; SMALL WONDER; TINY FOUND THEATRE IN LONG BEACH HAS SURVIVED 20 
YEARS BY OFFERING IRREVERENT, TOPICAL ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan Malmstrom admits that she was nervous the first time she attended a play 
at the 40-seat storefront Found Theatre, which sits between a sandwich shop and 
a bridal store on a drab, busy street in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a tiny alternative theater and you don't know what you'll get 
into," she said. "If you leave, you almost have to cross the stage and everyone 
will notice you." 
</P>
<P>
 But her reticence quickly vanished. Malmstrom loved the production, "Bus Trip 
to Vegas," in which a group of bizarre characters journey to the gambling Mecca 
for a few hours to try to strike it rich. Among the passengers were a 
mother-daughter country duo dubbed The Juggs, a beauty queen and a Barbie doll 
clone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was absolutely hysterical," said Malmstrom, who reviews applications for 
arts grants for the Public Corp. for the Arts in Long Beach. "It made fun of 
our materialistic culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The production was typical of the wacky, off-the-wall plays that the theater 
has presented for 20 years. The plays, most of them original, satirize and 
provoke thought about political and social issues of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Found is unabashed about being a "message" house, touching on themes 
ranging from hucksterism and corporate greed to spousal abuse and AIDS. But 
it's hardly preaching. Instead, audiences laugh their way to enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Found has lampooned the shoe fetish of former Philippine First Lady Imelda 
Marcos, even covering the theater walls with shoes for the play. It has poked 
fun at coupon-clipping, coffee-drinking, soap-opera-watching housewives, and 
parodied telethons and America's obsession with fast food. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, fresh, low-cost experimental theater that's not excruciating to sit 
through," said Malmstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Found, performers rarely sit. They walk, march, roll, stand on chairs, 
do reverse somersaults and jump in and out of barrels as they mine a rich vein 
of vigorous, physical theater. The actors usually play multiple roles requiring 
quick costume changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience might see high drama one moment and something resembling an 
irreverent "Saturday Night Live" skit the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're either subtle or right out there, in your face," says Joyce Hackett, a 
Found actress who first came to the theater 18 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the competitive and fragile world of live theater, where even major 
companies can falter, the Found has endured on a shoestring budget and modest 
ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers attribute the theater's success to the tenacity of the two women who 
lead it: Cynthia Galles, 42, who started the Found in 1974, and literary 
director Virginia DeMoss, 46, who signed on a year later. Galles and DeMoss 
"keep it going," said Dorothea MacNeil, who has been attending Found plays 
almost since the theater opened. 
</P>
<P>
 But Galles insists that a core group of devoted "foundlings," as company 
members are called, deserve the credit. They perform without pay, rehearsing 
three hours a night, five nights a week for several weeks before a play opens. 
They paint walls, make costumes, and handle lighting and sound. When the 
theater was created they built the stage and even searched for used theater 
seats.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate to have wonderful, generous, talented people willing to do 
everything," Galles said. "People care about this theater."  
</P>
<P>
 The reliance on volunteers allows the Found to stage five plays a year on a 
$15,000 budget earmarked mostly for rent and utilities. The Found's choice of 
material also has permitted it to exist on a pittance. Original plays and 
public domain classics such as Shakespeare don't require royalties.  
</P>
<P>
 The box office, which charges a $10 admission for most plays, covers a large 
chunk of the costs. The theater also conducts fund-raisers and receives 
donations and grants. During the last two years, the Public Corp. for the Arts 
has given the Found a total of $6,875, according to Malmstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater has no advertising budget, relying on word of mouth and press 
releases of upcoming performances to draw audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles acknowledges that it has been a struggle to keep the Found afloat over 
the years. "We've never been off the edge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater closed for a few months at one point to search a new location 
after the rent was increased. And at some plays, the actors have outnumbered 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothea MacNeil recalls one night when she was the only one in the audience. 
"I said, 'Cynthia, you don't have to put the play on.' " MacNeil recalled. "And 
she said, 'We play even if we have only one person.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Marking its 20th anniversary, the theater is staging "Hot Flash Backs," a 
collection of scenes from more than 20 plays that have been performed at the 
Found since it opened its doors. In the show, which plays at 8:30 p.m. Fridays 
and Saturdays through Nov. 5, Galles, DeMoss and Hackett juggle 40 different 
roles with speedy costume changes and quick changes of character and mood. 
</P>
<P>
 The show features another Found trademark: a combination of live performances 
and video scenes projected on a wall behind the stage. In some instances, plays 
incorporate video and live action at the same time, with actors on the video 
exchanging lines with performers on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the Found's plays are original. Even when established works are 
produced, they're adapted to such an extent that even their authors might have 
trouble recognizing them. In "Cinderella," for example, the health-conscious 
heroine persuaded the prince to finance her health food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the entire theater becomes a part of the play. For the three-part 
"Beyond the Valley of the Flight Attendants," in which the high-altitude 
servers took revenge on surly passengers by murdering them, the theater was 
transformed into an airplane. Members of the audience became passengers, with 
the attendants serving them refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, audience participation has gotten out of hand. During one 
performance of the housewife epic "Broads," a man in the audience walked on the 
stage, took an ashtray from a table, walked back to his seat and lit a 
cigarette. One of the actors casually sauntered over and retrieved it as if 
that were part of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles launched the theater in 1974 at the suggestion of a college professor 
at UC Irvine. "Cynthia was a student of mine," said the professor, Ashley Carr, 
who now teaches theater arts at Cal State Long Beach. "We were doing 
experimental pieces. I told her to set up her own theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Galles and other UC Irvine theater arts graduates staged the first play in a 
church. They gave the theater its current name after they "found" their own 
space, a former Laundromat at 7th Street and Orange Avenue. After the rent was 
raised a few years later, they moved the theater to its current site, a former 
printing shop, at 251 E. 7th St., just west of Long Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 While many "foundlings" have been trained actors, others have gotten involved 
after seeing a few shows. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoss, herself, started out attending Found plays. Her knowledge of theater 
was limited to studying classic plays as an English major in college, but in a 
few months she found herself working backstage, then performing. She wrote her 
first Found play, a long monologue about a woman in a retirement home looking 
forward to a Liberace concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting to see what I'd written (being performed) on stage," DeMoss 
said. The Found quickly "became a large part of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoss and others are quick to point out, however, that the theater is not a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have your day job to do your acting," said actress Hackett, a 
hospital admissions officer who has acted at community colleges, sung with a 
jazz ensemble and is a member of Bard in the Yard, which performs summer 
Shakespeare on the Queen Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMoss is a free-lance editor and writer for trade publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Galles works as a graphic artist and has some financial independence through 
her family that allows her to focus on the Found.  
</P>
<P>
 She writes the bulk of the plays, although they are polished during rehearsal, 
with performers contributing dialogue and ideas for stage action. Galles also 
directs the productions and often performs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Galles would like the Found to play to full houses all the time and 
enjoy more financial security, she said moving to a larger facility would 
inhibit what the foundlings do best. "The kind of work we do is geared for a 
facility that's small," she said. "The intensity of the experience we give 
people would go down." 
</P>
<P>
 Other storefront theaters have operated in Long Beach, but the Found is the 
sole survivor, observers say. The Out Theatre, dedicated to plays with gay and 
lesbian themes, is gone. The Uprising, a coffeehouse theater, closed.  
</P>
<P>
 John Traub, the Out's founder, said he closed the theater in 1991 after five 
years because he "ran out of energy." The Uprising, which staged 13 original 
plays a year, operated from 1986-88 before closing because of financial 
difficulties, according to its co-director Carr, of Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carr and Traub praise the Found's productions.  
</P>
<P>
 Traub said the theater's work is "very intelligent, entertainment that is 
thought provoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said the plays are "fun and dynamic. . . There's an audience for them or 
they wouldn't have survived for 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 But observers say that without the perseverance and dedication of Galles and 
DeMoss, the Found would have met the same fate as the other storefront theaters 
that folded. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Found were to vanish, so would a key outlet for original plays, 
they add.  
</P>
<P>
 "Larger theaters are not able to do this kind of original work," says Nanci 
Andersen, who has been with the Found for nine years as an actress and lighting 
technician.  
</P>
<P>
 Adds Malmstrom: "They're the only smaller organization performing the kind of 
original material they come up with. There's no more theater like (the Found) 
in Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Hot Flash Backs" 
</P>
<P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: PALOS VERDES ESTATES; COUNCIL BACKS OFF PLAN TO CREATE SOCCER 
FIELDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to turn 10 acres into soccer fields, which sparked angry protest from 
residents, has died because the City Council declined to take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the Planning Commission unanimously rejected a proposal by the 
Palos Verdes Soccer Club to grade the land at the city-owned Zurita field, and 
Tuesday, the council declined to reconsider the proposal.All Planning 
Commission decisions come before the City Council for review, said City Manager 
James Hendrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 The council received about 35 letters regarding the proposal, and only two 
expressed support. Nearby residents said the soccer fields would bring noise, 
traffic, trash and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also said Mayor James Nyman had a conflict of interest because he was 
friends with the soccer club's treasurer and because his 12-year-old son plays 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday's meeting, however, Nyman said he was not close friends with 
Ronald L. Buss, the treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer club would have paid $52,000 to turn the 10 acres near Via Zurita, 
Via Lopez and Via Martinez into soccer fields, Nyman said. But Hendrickson said 
it was unclear who would pay for maintaining the fields. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; COUNCIL SETS LIMITS ON ELECTION DONATIONS

<P>
 Candidates for office here won't be able to accept contributions of more than 
$1,000 from a single source, under rules established by the City Council on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance also prohibits candidates for mayor, council, city treasurer 
and city clerk from accepting donations except during the election cycle -- 
which begins the day they file a statement of intent to run and ends June 30 
after the city election. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, no laws limited the donation period or amount that could be 
contributed. The council voted unanimously to approve the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance defines husbands and wives as separate contributors, but 
contributions by children under 18 count as part of their parents' limits. The 
contribution limits take effect March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty for violating the ordinance is a $1,000 fine or six months in 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Don Lee, chairman of the committee that researched 
contribution ordinances, said they wanted to create a simple ordinance that was 
easy to understand and enforce. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; PROGRAM AIMS TO TEACH UNDERSTANDING OF DISABLED

<P>
 Standing in front of a group of Torrance's North High School freshmen, Luis 
Alfaro strained to read his prepared speech. A gunshot injury a year ago 
prevents him from seeing the lower half of the visual field, so one of his 
instructors held the paper above shoulder level as he read. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the crowd he was shot in the head while working as a disc jockey at a 
friend's birthday party. The bullet went through his skull and damaged his 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was unlucky and I got in the way," Alfaro, 18, told the audience as they 
sat silently in the school library. "What happened to me could happen to 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, he was blind and used a wheelchair. But over time he 
learned to walk with a leg brace and regained a portion of his vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks by Alfaro and 10 other students with disabilities -- ranging from a 
speech impediment to cerebral palsy -- are part of a two-day program to teach 
North's 450 freshmen how their fellow students live with disabilities.  
</P>
<P>
 School staff created the event 11 years ago when North became a regional 
education center for students with mental and physical disabilities. Nearly 10% 
of the 2,000 students on campus have some sort of disability.  
</P>
<P>
 During the first day of the program, the freshmen rotated through five 
stations in the library, each designed to simulate a different type of disease 
or physical impairment. 
</P>
<P>
 At one table students tried to pick up pennies and tie bows while they wore 
gloves with cotton balls stuffed in the fingers. The wadded cotton mimics the 
lack of feeling and loss of motor control experienced by people with arthritis 
or cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kizanis, 14, craftily looped the thread around his ankle to provide some 
tension while he tried to tie a bow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do it," Kizanis said, and then looked up and asked with awe: "Can 
anyone ever learn to do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 At another spot in the library, the teen-agers tried to use their non-dominant 
hand to trace within the lines of a maze reflected in a mirror. The exercise 
simulates how people with dyslexia see and process information. The youngsters 
learned that Tom Cruise and Cher both have dyslexia, and need extra help to 
handle daily tasks and learn scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Ito, 14, did better than most on the wheelchair obstacle course, but he 
still ran over an orange safety cone and narrowly missed a head-on collision 
with another racer. And he has had some practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago he cut his leg so severely on a jungle gym he had to use a 
wheelchair for weeks. Getting around inside his house was so difficult, he 
said, he didn't venture outside until he got crutches. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second day, students heard comments from 11 disabled students. Some, 
like Courtney Weathers, cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Weathers has cerebral palsy. In a statement read by an instructor, Weathers 
told the students he needed help to eat and do schoolwork, but his words were 
proud when he discussed taking the bus alone and using a computer to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could be like everyone else and do what everyone else does," he 
said. "I hurt very much inside when I can't do the things other people do. I 
feel trapped inside my body."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Palos Verdes Peninsula School District are considering how to 
invest at least $4 million in surplus money from the sale of school property. 
</P>
<P>
 After a discussion Monday with county investment officer G. W. Jeffries, 
trustees asked for a staff report outlining ways to invest the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has $7 million since selling land that was designated for a high 
school, said Director of Fiscal Services Carleen Vose. In a memo to trustees, 
Vose recommended that $2 million be set aside to replace roofs and buy 
computers during the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 School district money in the county pool, a collection of funds from school 
and special districts throughout the county, now earns about 4.8% interest, 
Jeffries said. 
</P>
<P>
 By investing in one-year U.S. Treasury notes, the district could earn 6.2% 
interest, resulting in tens of thousands of extra dollars, Jeffries said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, however, could lose money if it invests in a one-year treasury 
bill and needs the cash before the year is up. Also, a fixed, one-year 
investment could cost the district if interest rates dramatically rise. JEFF

<P>
 Paul Mitchell, owner of the most popular home for filming in the city, has 
sparked a change in the city's film permit policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a request from Mitchell, the City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday to 
amend its film permit ordinance and allow filming at local homes for up to 
eight days a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, each home was allowed one film permit per year but the number of 
days allowed for filming was not specified. "It could be one day or 364 days," 
Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new ordinance results in more filming, it could boost city revenues; 
Palos Verdes Estates charges $1,700 a day to film at private homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said his French Chateau-style home on Paseo La Cresta has been filmed 
twice in the past two years, once for a MasterCard commercial and once for a 
Cartier jewelry commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, formerly an engineer who now sells real estate, declined to give 
exact figures, but he said that for each day it takes to set up the commercial 
he is paid $700 to $2,500. For each day of actual filming, he is paid $3,000 to 
$8,000. JEFF KASS

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials should require special permits for alcohol sales to cut down 
the number of convenience stores and liquor stores that attract loitering, 
littering and gang activity, the planning commission recommended.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed ordinance, businesses that sell beer, wine and liquor -- 
with the exception of restaurants and large grocery stores -- will be required 
to apply for a city permit.Current regulations only require businesses that 
sell hard liquor to have the permits, planning department manager Lori Parcells 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses that sell beer and wine are required to have a license from 
California's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control but not from the city, 
Parcells said.  
</P>
<P>
 "These stores are just another place for derelicts and gang members to hang 
around," Planning Commissioner S.L. Tyree said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the change is to give the city more control, Planning Commissioner 
Kevin S. Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to stamp out alcohol, but the city should be able to impose 
(guidelines)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would give city officials more latitude in revoking alcohol 
permits, and requires the businesses to keep their premises well-lit and free 
of litter. It would also hold the manager responsible for patrons' behavior, 
Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the City Council, the ordinance will not apply to the 182 
retail businesses that already have liquor licenses, Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to vote on the ordinance Tuesday.. JON GARCIA

 Public Works Manager Mehrdad (Mike) Kapanpour claims that Mayor Harold E. 
Hofmann harassed him and discriminated against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In a the two-page letter to City Manager Patrick P. Importuna dated Oct. 7, 
Kapanpour alleged Hofmann made harassing phone calls to his home and subjected 
Kapanpour to "repeated and ongoing . . . verbal abuse, intimidation (and) 
threats of discharge." 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann said that "there is nothing true in (the letter)," but declined to 
discuss the allegations in detail. He said he has not spoken directly with 
Kapanpour for at least eight weeks and that he usually channels communication 
with city employees through the city manager's office.  
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, Kapanpour also accused Hofmann and a former planning 
commissioner of trying to influence the awarding of city contracts in the 
Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they are investigating the allegations and have planned a 
meeting with Kapanpour this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Kapanpour declined to comment. JON GARCIA

 TALK OF THE TOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan football Coach Mike Ono didn't fret after the Panthers, who 
entered the season as the state's ninth-ranked team, dropped their second 
consecutive game to fall to 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he had a team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew our offense was capable of scoring points, but I knew it would take a 
while for our defense to come around because we had so many inexperienced 
players," Ono said. "The kids were pretty upset, but we sat down and made it 
our goal to be ready by the time we played Poly." 
</P>
<P>
 Call it mission accomplished. Jordan beat previously undefeated Poly, 28-0, 
Friday to win its third consecutive game and take a step toward its first 
outright Moore League title in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan (5-2), which shared the league title with Poly in 1988 and 1990, earned 
its first victory in four seasons against the Jackrabbits. The Panthers, who 
opened Moore League play with a 71-7 victory over Millikan, have shutouts in 
two of their last three games in which they have outscored their opponents, 
130-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan limited Poly to 61 yards on offense and intercepted three passes, 
including two by cornerback Kason Smith who had a 46-yard touchdown return. 
Lineman Howard Faagata also had four tackles for losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ono also credited the efforts of linebackers Ephraim Suluai and Chris Fields 
and free safety Raheem Elliott for helping shut down the Southern Section's 
fourth-ranked team in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we've always been outmanned by Poly, but the defense really rose 
to the occasion," Ono said. CHEAP THRILLS 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens quarterback Eddie Negrete smashed a school passing record, 
completing 17 of 31 passes for 340 yards and three touchdowns Friday night 
against Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
 But Negrete's performance and leadership during a furious second-half rally 
were not enough to offset a one-man show by Alhambra quarterback Aryn Hart in a 
45-38 defeat to the Moors in an Almont League game at Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams combined for 979 yards of offense, including 550 by Alhambra. Hart, 
a senior, completed 15 of 24 passes for 289 yards and three touchdowns. He also 
rushed for 107 yards in 15 carries, including a 61-yard run for Alhambra (7-0, 
2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a heck of a spectator game," Bell Gardens Coach Dave Newell said. "It 
was quite a night. We were in shock but that's what happens when you put your 
life in the hands of 16-year-olds. The people that paid $3 really got their 
money's worth." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 45-31, Negrete, a converted safety who surpassed the 1992 school 
record of 297 yards set by Robert Perez, combined with Ricardo Flores on a 
30-yard touchdown pass with 4 minutes, 41 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers had rallied from a 14-0 second-quarter deficit to tie the score, 
31-31, on David Villegas' fourth touchdown of the game, a two-yard run, to 
start of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty passes was what most guys at Bell Gardens throw in a season," said 
Newell, who suffered his first career loss in 18 seasons when the Lancers had 
scored more than 30 points. "Ball control and the run is our trademark, but 
Alhambra couldn't stop it so we kept throwing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Tadeo Gonzalez had six receptions for 103 yards. Flores caught five 
passes for 134 yards and Guillermo Alvarez had four receptions for 73 yards for 
Bell Gardens (4-3, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "(Bell Gardens) never passes in their life, they always run the ball," 
Alhambra Coach Gil Ruedaflores said. "We were expecting them to run. We just 
couldn't believe it." COACH SUSPENDED 
</P>
<P>
 Seven members of the Cal State Long Beach men's and women's cross-country 
teams and Coach Andy Sythe were suspended for one meet because of a preseason 
initiation ritual involving alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Sythe, six women and one man were not allowed to participate in Saturday's 
Bronco Invitational at Bonelli Park. First-year assistant Gwen Loud coached the 
team in Sythe's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 The August incident involved consumption of alcohol by current and former team 
members at the team's preseason training camp near Trinity Lake in Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Sythe did not participate in the incident and did not know about it when it 
occurred. But Athletic Director Dave O'Brien said Sythe was suspended for 
failing to report the matter in a timely manner. The athletic department became 
aware of the incident Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Bendzick and Dennis Sweningson were fifth and sixth, respectively, in 
25:32 and 25:41 in the 8,000 meters at the Bronco Invitational to lead the 49er 
men to a fourth-place finish. Long Beach failed to score in the women's race, 
fielding an incomplete team of three runners. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation from student affairs is pending, but the 49ers will be at 
full strength for Saturday's Big West Conference meet at Utah State.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; ISLANDS UNTO THEMSELVES; SOME RESIDENTS OF 
UNINCORPORATED AREAS ENJOY THE INDEPENDENCE, BUT OTHERS SEEK ANNEXATION OVER 
NEGLECTED STEPCHILD STATUS.

<P>
 Some people call it El Camino Village, or western Gardena, or Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Some label it No Man's Land. 
</P>
<P>
 They are describing a neighborhood deep in the heart of the South Bay, an area 
of one-story tan stucco homes much like those lining the streets of any 
middle-class suburban city in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no city. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Village is an unincorporated area, lacking a city hall, a city 
council, a mayor or even a police department to call its own. In city-rich Los 
Angeles County, that makes it a rarity, an island of innocuous pale yellow in a 
Thomas Guide awash with cities highlighted in bright pinks, purples and 
oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, a dozen such islands dot the South Bay map like scattered puzzle 
pieces, stretching from the gritty streets of Lennox near Los Angeles 
International Airport southward to the upper-crust homes of Academy Hill on the 
Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 These islands are sometimes rich, more often poor. Some are seen as the 
neglected stepchildren of mammoth Los Angeles County, which oversees 
unincorporated areas. In others, residents seem to enjoy life removed from 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, life on one of these unincorporated islands offers a litmus test of 
attitudes toward government -- some people want more societal structure around 
them, and some want less. 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere is this split more apparent than in the eastern flank of El Camino 
Village, where a civil war of sorts is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents, weary of the anonymity of non-city living, have risen up and 
lobbied to latch onto neighboring Gardena. After years of struggling to procure 
services from Los Angeles County -- whether more sheriff's patrols or better 
tree trimming -- they long for a smaller-scale city such as Gardena to call 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is so difficult to try to get through the maze of (county) offices," says 
annexation supporter Paul Stone, "while with a smaller place that is so much 
closer -- you can go there in person." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, are fighting to retain their unincorporated status, fearful 
that their freedom could be encroached upon.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel comfortable with having a whole other layer of bureaucracy," 
explains Ursula White, an annexation opponent and a leader of Neighbors 
Concerned About Annexation. Now, with an annexation election tentatively set 
for April in the 861-home neighborhood, residents are being showered with 
sometimes vitriolic flyers extolling the dangers -- or glories -- of joining 
Gardena.  
</P>
<P>
 But others say it hardly matters whether they live inside or outside a city -- 
just as long as the garbage gets picked up on schedule and police arrive 
promptly when summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Most South Bay residents are oblivious to these islands wedged among cities, 
and are unaware that some well-known facilities lie within them -- San Pedro 
Peninsula Hospital perched amid a tiny unincorporated area called La Rambla; El 
Camino College sitting not in Torrance but on unincorporated turf; bucolic 
South Coast Botanic Garden topping a former county landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 But many who live on such islands are all too conscious that they are not part 
of any city. 
</P>
<P>
 And for some, that has become a source of deep distress.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pat O'Hara remembers as clearly as if it were yesterday that evening three 
years ago that she took her teen-age daughter and a friend to a dance concert 
at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
 When they returned afterward to O'Hara's home in El Camino Village, the two 
girls began practicing jazz steps in the family room, where a large 
sliding-glass door leads to the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the girls burst into the kitchen, exclaiming they felt they were 
being watched. Discovering that her back gate was open, an alarmed O'Hara 
called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which patrols her 
unincorporated neighborhood. She was on the line when she saw a stranger stride 
up to the glass and peer inside. Startled, the girls hid under the kitchen 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her report of an intruder, O'Hara says, a squad car never arrived at 
her door -- at least, not until the next week, after she complained to the 
watch commander at the Sheriff's Department's Lennox station. Luckily, the man 
had left, but her peace of mind was shattered.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were no police, and that's a very scary thing if you're a woman with a 
young daughter, living alone," O'Hara says. That experience spurred O'Hara to 
join the annexation drive in her neighborhood, lodged between Crenshaw 
Boulevard, Marine Avenue, Van Ness Avenue and Manhattan Beach Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 Concern about law enforcement is a key issue in the annexation debate. Some 
residents claim that the Lennox sheriff's station can take one to three hours 
to respond to a call in little El Camino Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good bunch of guys and they try very hard. They're just spread too 
thin," said Peggy Halberg, recording secretary for the El Camino Village Assn., 
which is remaining neutral on the annexation question. 
</P>
<P>
 But others defend the sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the sheriffs are just much more professional and much more respectful 
than the (Gardena) police," said Nellie Plake, who carried petitions door to 
door opposing annexation. "I would rather deal with them than with some little 
law enforcement (agency)." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Lennox Station, Lt. Bob Hudson said that records no longer are 
available to explain why sheriff's deputies did not respond to O'Hara's call 
three years ago. The department aims to respond to a report of a back-yard 
prowler within 20 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he refuted reports that the neighborhood regularly lacks late-night 
patrols. Two sheriff's deputies in "Car 34" are assigned to El Camino Village 
and Alondra Park around the clock, Hudson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Day in and day out. Seven days a week," he said. And although the Lennox 
Station staff is currently stretched because of budget constraints, he said, 
hiring should swell staffing numbers within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of El Camino Village are split over other issues as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would welcome city-coordinated garbage pickup, while others like the 
freedom to contract with the garbage company of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unincorporated areas are frequently confused with the cities around them. Some 
unincorporated land around Harbor-UCLA Medical Center is often called Torrance 
because it has a Torrance mailing address. And a large sign in the median of 
Manhattan Beach Boulevard announces "Welcome to City of Gardena," even though 
the north side of the street is really unincorporated turf.  
</P>
<P>
 Other snafus arise, such as the time a few years ago when residents of the 
unincorporated area east of Harbor Gateway accidentally received flyers 
announcing a special Los Angeles city pickup of items too big to be picked up 
by the trash truck. Residents carted their throwaways to the curb, but no city 
crews arrived to pick them up -- since their block of West Fiat Street is not 
part of the city. Finally, after days of phone calls, the city agreed to haul 
the trash away. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an unincorporated area near Carson known as Rancho Dominguez, Vaughn 
Holiday and other residents insist they're not getting services they deserve. 
"The trash people do not make the pickups they're supposed to," he said.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Over the past 20 years, the number of residents living in unincorporated areas 
has declined. In 1974, the number was 1,046,500, or nearly 15% of the county's 
population of 7.1 million. Today, while the county population has swollen an 
additional 2 million, the number of residents in unincorporated areas has 
declined to 962,000 -- just over 10% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop might not be so significant except the remaining unincorporated areas 
-- left behind by happenstance or their own choosing -- are often low- to 
moderate-income neighborhoods. That can mean some of the neediest areas receive 
the least attention, officials admit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All areas of the county can have a lack of social services because of the 
economy and needs of a changing population. But the unincorporated areas 
usually have the greatest need," said Lorraine Barber, executive director of 
the Federation of Community Coordinating Councils of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the areas that have not been absorbed by cities already are older 
pockets of residential neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 For the foreseeable future, a lot of unincorporated areas may have no choice 
but to stay unattached, according to city and county officials. That's because 
in Southern California's battered economy, interest in annexation appears to be 
waning. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-strapped cities may not want to go to the trouble of annexing areas that 
could require costly services, such as police patrols or environmental cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued by environmental problems, some residents of West 204th Street east of 
Torrance might understand why a city may not be eager to annex their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Their homes sit directly east of a federal Superfund hazardous waste site and 
just south of a Superfund nominee near Harbor Gateway. Federal officials 
discovered this spring that the pesticide DDT was buried in the unincorporated 
neighborhood, prompting temporary evacuation of 33 families. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leader Cynthia Babich believes the absence of a city has hampered 
residents' efforts to get government attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even have a city council where we can go and complain," Babich says. 
"It just becomes apparent that the reason we're unincorporated is that there's 
a lot of pollution there. No one wants to take the responsibility to clean it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, officials say, unincorporated areas have been largely 
working-class communities that did not have the tax base necessary to support 
their own cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unincorporated areas tend to be older, and if they haven't been annexed 
by now, there is usually . . . some compelling reason," said Jim Colangelo, 
executive officer of Los Angeles County's Local Agency Formation Commission, 
which oversees annexations and incorporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet just a few miles southwest of Babich's polluted neighborhood are two 
unincorporated areas that might easily be featured in Better Homes and Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy Hill and Westfield are surrounded by some of the South Bay's 
wealthiest suburbs. Streets in Academy Hill are named after great thinkers 
(Rousseau Lane, Pascal Place, Montaigne Lane). And in neighboring Westfield, 
where the lack of sidewalks and the occasional peacock evoke a pastoral air, 
Pam Gault serves as the official "greeter" to welcome newcomers to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the kind of community where you could expect to be greeted," said James 
Vandever, president of the local parks board. 
</P>
<P>
 Westfield seems to do fine without a City Hall. Amid recent concern that local 
horse trails were turning into lovers' lanes, about two dozen residents met at 
Vandever's home to discuss solutions. Later, the parks board decided to install 
posts to prevent cars from driving onto the trails. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in an age when many city halls use computer-generated agendas, the parks 
board gets the word out by posting notices on a simple wooden sign at the 
Westfield entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking city halls, some unincorporated areas cope by concocting 
quasi-governments. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lennox, a port of entry to many Spanish-speaking immigrants, residents have 
learned to turn to school officials in lieu of a city hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Lennox Elementary School District has a long tradition of offering non-school 
services to the community, providing health fairs, clothing drives and 
translation help. In the broadest sense, anything that's bad for Lennox can be 
seen as bad for the children, which is bad for the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, residents complained about a freeway tunnel at Ocean Gate and 104th 
Street, which had become a home to prostitutes and homeless people. Parents 
walking their children to a nearby school complained to Supt. Kenneth Moffett, 
who wrote letters to Caltrans and County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
The tunnel was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the unofficial mayor of Lennox I'm busier here than I normally would be," 
said Moffett, who lives in Manhattan Beach, "but that's OK."  
</P>
<P>
 Residents of tiny Del Aire near Hawthorne rely on an informal network of 
"block captains."  
</P>
<P>
 That network mobilized this fall with news that the state Employment 
Development Department was opening a temporary office on Aviation Boulevard. 
Bristling because they were not told early on about the plan, residents met 
with county and state officials early this month in hopes of negotiating some 
concessions, such as better parking plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were a city, they wouldn't have snuck in the back door," complained Del 
Aire resident Janice Rotella. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the El Camino area, exasperated with weed-infested medians and 
unrepaired streets, banded together in the late 1980s to create a community 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the group pressuring the county, she reports, the weeds are getting 
cut and the streets repaired. County officials even agreed to install signs 
reading "El Camino Village" on roads leading into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the case of the squeaky wheel gets the oil," El Camino Village 
Assn.'s Halberg concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some in the neighborhood, that isn't enough.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you are part of some of the other cities around here, you have a certain 
loyalty and camaraderie with that city and the people in it," said Stone, who 
continues to push for annexation to Gardena.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just swallowed up by a big monstrous whatever." 
</P>

Garcia and Jeff Kass contributed to this report. Patches of County Land

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: AMPLE SERVINGS OF FOND '50S MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Manny Chavez will never forget the day his father drove home in a shiny new 
red-and-white 1956 Ford Crown Victoria. The 8-year-old was blown away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something about that car did it for me then, and it still makes me think fond 
memories of that era," Chavez says. Today, three '56 Fords of his own later, he 
is the owner of Margo and Manny's, a Fifties-style diner that is something of a 
neighborhood landmark in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant opened way back in 1939, when it was known as Parson's. In the 
Fifties, as Norm and Irene's, it was a hangout for students at Banning High 
School, then located across the street. Manny and his wife -- she's the Margo, 
of course -- took it over in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a cute little place with a 16-seat horseshoe counter. Fifties 
memorabilia, such as a rare restored model 1015 Wurlitzer jukebox and an old 
Coke machine dispensing 6 1/2-ouncers, are scattered about. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's regulars, which Manny estimates are 97% of his business, 
usually bypass the menu in favor of the chalkboard specials. One of the biggest 
sellers is Thursday's meat loaf ($5.40), with brown gravy, mashed potatoes and 
green beans. Monday is the day for roasted turkey with corn- and wheat-bread 
dressing ($5.80). Braised short ribs hit the board on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 The regular menu is full of diner classics, such as chicken-fried steak 
($5.70): sirloin dipped in milk, coated with flour and seasoned salt, then 
fried. It comes drenched in a white gravy that also covers the mashed potatoes. 
The roast top round of beef ($6) and liver with onions and bacon ($5.20) are 
other popular choices. All selections come with soup, salad or coleslaw, 
potatoes and vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 A case behind the counter holds meringue pies -- lemon, chocolate, 
coconut-custard and banana ($1.60 a tall slice).  
</P>
<P>
 Margo and Manny's is at 126 E. Pacific Coast Highway, Wilmington. (310) 
830-4224. Open for breakfast and lunch only, daily 5:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.

 MISSING IN ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 The troubles of the Harbor College football team apparently have gotten to 
Coach Don Weems. 
</P>
<P>
 With Harbor (0-7) off to its worst start since 1960, Weems has taken a 
stress-related leave of absence and will probably sit out the rest of the 
season, Athletic Director Jim O'Brien said. The Seahawks have three games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be out at least the next two games," O'Brien said. "That's all I know. 
I would say it's doubtful that he'll be back (this season)." 
</P>
<P>
 Weems, who teaches health and physical education, has not been at school since 
Oct. 19, when he complained of feeling poorly and went home, O'Brien said. 
Assistant Eugene Miranda served as interim coach Saturday in Harbor's 45-17 
Western State Conference loss to Los Angeles Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don wanted to come to the game, but we didn't feel it was appropriate," 
O'Brien said. "He didn't feel well and he was advised by our administration to 
take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't been himself for some time. It's typical of stress-related 
problems. He's just been down. I would say it's some type of depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor has won only four of its last 17 games. The Seahawks were 4-6 in 1993, 
a season marred by a postgame brawl with Pierce College that resulted in 
penalties, legal repercussions and adverse publicity for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Weems, who could not be reached for comment, has a six-year record of 23-35 at 
Harbor. He guided the Seahawks to an 8-3 mark in 1992, including a victory in 
the Western State K-Swiss Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tough competitor," O'Brien said of Weems. "He never experienced that 
much losing until the last couple of years. He had a tremendous record, but now 
he's going through tough times." UNPLEASANT VISIT 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw High didn't exactly roll out the red carpet Friday for the visiting 
San Pedro football team. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, San Pedro Coach Mike Walsh can't remember when his team was treated 
more inhospitably. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the most incredible incident I've ever run across in my life," Walsh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh first became angry when no dressing facilities were provided for the 
Pirates, who were forced to stay on the field for more than an hour before the 
game and during halftime. But that was nothing compared to a pregame incident 
that resulted in Walsh and two of his assistants being removed from the field 
by campus police. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh and the assistants, Joe Aguilar and Grant Beachley, were ordered off the 
field by Crenshaw Principal Yvonne Noble after they refused to cut short 
pregame warm-ups in order to accommodate Crenshaw's homecoming festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble said San Pedro was asked to move to the far end of the field, but Walsh 
contends the Pirates were told to leave the field even though they were barely 
into their warm-ups. Noble said she called for campus police after San Pedro 
coaches directed "inappropriate statements" at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said Noble was the one out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 "She demanded that I listen to her," Walsh said. "I didn't know who she was. 
She grabbed me with both hands and pulled me back. I don't have the right to do 
that and neither does she." 
</P>
<P>
 After being removed from the field, Walsh said he stood near the stands for 
about 30 minutes before Noble and San Pedro Principal Rey Mayoral reached a 
compromise. Walsh and Aguilar were allowed to return to the field and coach, 
but Beachley was not. He spent the game in his car, parked on a street next to 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said the distractions hurt San Pedro in a 22-14 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it had a definite impact on the game," he said. "Our players had to 
be thinking, 'Is this a safe place for us to be?' They certainly weren't 
thinking about who they were playing that day or what impact the game had." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayoral said the school plans to send a letter to the City Section's 
Interscholastic Athletics Committee to complain about Crenshaw's failure to 
provide a dressing facility. Noble said the facility formerly used by visiting 
teams now houses a student business, Food From The Hood, and a new facility has 
not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've never thought about," Noble said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Crenshaw has use of its locker room while the visiting team 
sits outside and uses the same restroom as the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would never treat anybody like that," Mayoral said. ELECTRIC GLIDE 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, you never know. After a week of uneven practices, Peninsula High 
football Coach Gary Kimbrell wondered if his team was ready for Friday's Bay 
League showdown against Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real concerned last week," Kimbrell said. "It didn't seem like we were 
mentally prepared. But we were." 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula proved it was ready on the first play from scrimmage when running 
back Petros Papadakis broke up the left sideline for a 70-yard touchdown run. 
The Panthers had a 24-0 lead by the end of the first quarter, on their way to a 
convincing 44-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbrell said any jitters Peninsula may have experienced during practice 
disappeared the night of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the game, I didn't know we were going to win, but I knew we were ready to 
play," Kimbrell said. "It seemed like our kids were walking on air. Our band 
was playing the Michigan fight song and their fans were booing us. There was a 
lot of electricity in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Peninsula's first victory in four tries against Hawthorne and moved the 
Panthers into sole possession of first place at 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbrell said a key to Peninsula's steady improvement has been the dominant 
play of the offensive line, consisting of center Jeremy Sparling, guards Alan 
Warmbier and Ryan Lindley, and tackles Jeff Erxleben, Hamilton Allman and Scott 
Jackson, and tight ends Dan Secrist and Clark Haggans. The Panthers rushed for 
326 yards and six touchdowns, three by quarterback Peter Krogh, against 
Hawthorne. AERIAL ASSAULT 
</P>
<P>
 It took a record-breaking performance by quarterback Steve Sarkisian for El 
Camino College to avoid an upset Saturday as the Warriors turned back winless 
Saddleback, 31-28, at Murdock Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian, a sophomore from West Torrance High, set a school single-game 
passing record with 481 yards, eclipsing the previous mark of 467 yards set by 
Ronnie Barber in 1985. He completed 24 of 45 attempts for four touchdowns and 
had two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarkisian leads the Mission Conference in passing and total offense with 
averages of 363.5 and 353.7 yards a game, respectively. His total offense 
figure is lower because of negative rushing yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (6-0), ranked third in the nation behind Garden City, Kan., and 
Ricks, Idaho, will play host to Mt. San Antonio (2-3-1) at 7 p.m. Saturday. 
SITTING PRETTY 
</P>
<P>
 The second half of the West Coast Conference women's volleyball season begins 
this week with Loyola Marymount firmly in control. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-place Lions opened a two-match lead over their nearest competitor 
Saturday by defeating San Diego, three games to one, at Gersten Pavilion. It 
was Loyola's 11th consecutive conference victory dating to last season, a 
school record. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore middle blocker Tate Medley, a former Mira Costa High standout, had a 
career-high 17 kills and seven blocks against San Diego and contributed 16 
kills in Friday's victory over San Francisco to earn the WCC player of the week 
award. Medley was the fourth Loyola player to win the award this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (14-6, 8-0 in the WCC) can put more distance between itself and San 
Diego (15-6, 6-2) when it visits the Toreros at 7 tonight. The Lions play at 
fourth-place Pepperdine (6-12, 5-4) on Saturday night. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * Ryan Price continued his outstanding season for the El Camino College water 
polo team by scoring six goals in an 8-6 victory over Saddleback in the 
championship game of the Saddleback tournament on Saturday. Earlier Saturday, 
Price scored the winning goal with eight seconds left in an 11-10 semifinal 
victory over Ventura. Price leads El Camino (12-12) with 11 goals and ranks 
second on the team with 24 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circe Thompson, a freshman from Torrance High, helped the University of 
Maryland Baltimore County women's volleyball team improve to 14-3 and 4-0 in 
the Big South Conference last weekend with her play in victories over 
Charleston Southern and Coastal Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stephanie Fleischaker, an assistant at Nevada Las Vegas last season, has 
been named softball coach at Cal State Dominguez Hills. Fleischaker helped UNLV 
reach the NCAA Southwest Regional final in 1993-94. Before that, she was the 
coach at Whittier College for one season. 
</P>
<P>
 * A women's tennis team from Torrance has qualified to compete in the United 
States Tennis Assn. 4.5 Senior National Championship Nov. 3-6 in Phoenix. The 
team, which recently won the Southern California title, plays out of the West 
End Tennis and Racquet Club and consists of Maggie Adams, Carolyn Biedler, 
Maxine Brown, Dolly Bloomstedt, Loretta Delgado, Ginny King, Sandra Williams 
and captain Judy Estes. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Verhoeven, pitching coach for the Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball 
team, has accepted a similar position with the Palm Springs team of the new

PEOPLE: SUNSET WHIPS UP 3-DAY FESTIVAL IN LONG BEACH OF FOOD, DRINK, CHEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Steve Seabolt of Rancho Palos Verdes knows the recipe for success in 
advertising. "Get a clear understanding of what the customer wants," he said. 
"Match the product to their needs. Then measure the results in dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 As publisher of Sunset magazine, Seabolt follows the recipe with the aplomb of 
a French chef whipping up a creme brulee . He knows his customers. And he plans 
to get to know them even better this weekend when he and the rest of the 
magazine staff hold a three-day festival of food, drink, celebrity chefs and 
the magazine's advertisers called "The Tastes of Sunset" at the Long Beach 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Seabolt, a veteran ad executive who previously has managed such clients as 
Honda, Time, People and Sports Illustrated, took over the publisher's desk at 
Sunset in January. He has presided over a magazine on the rise. Recent 
circulation has grown to 1.5 million, the best showing in years, said Brianne 
Murphy Miller, the magazine's public relations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Seabolt's stewardship, the magazine continues its mission to bring 
travel, food, gardening and remodeling tips into the homes of the West's 
affluent consumers.  
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, that means Pavilions shoppers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our circulation is strongest in areas where Pavilions chooses to put stores," 
he said. "Quite frankly, that means (the) upper middle class. We deliver huge 
numbers to Palos Verdes, Pasadena, San Marino, certain areas of Long Beach, the 
South Bay's beach cities."  
</P>
<P>
 Seabolt, 42, traces his love of advertising to his father, who owned a public 
relations firm in Chicago. In his 20s, Seabolt moved to Arizona to attend 
business school, fell in love with the West and has been in Los Angeles -- and 
in the advertising business -- most of his life since. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week, Seabolt commutes from the Palos Verdes Peninsula, where he has 
lived for 13 years, to Sunset's main office in Menlo Park in Northern 
California. He usually spends two nights a week away from his three children 
and wife, Elizabeth, an optometrist who practices in Redondo Beach. The family 
lives in Southern California, he said, because they like the lifestyle.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot about the West that's appealing," he said, "the lifestyle, the 
climate, the attitude of the people. Westerners embrace change, they're not 
bounded by tradition. The farther west you move, the greater the level of 
openness to new ideas."  
</P>
<P>
 He said many advertisers launch new products in the West first before the rest 
of the country. "In the case of Sunset, we can deliver (millions) of readers to 
advertisers who embrace change and are open to new things."  
</P>
<P>
 Seabolt plans a few changes at the magazine in the coming years, but none will 
be jarring. "We have a formula that works very well," he said. "People know and 
trust the magazine the way it is." He does, however, hope to make "The Tastes 
of Sunset" an annual festival in Western cities after this weekend's debut in 
Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 In his spare time, Seabolt plans to continue cultivating his passion for 
gardening, though he says he'll leave the cooking to somebody else. "I can stir 
up a mean tuna sandwich," he said. "But that's about the extent of my ability 
in the kitchen."  
</P>
<P>
 "The Tastes of Sunset" opens Friday at noon and continues Saturday and Sunday 
at the Long Beach Convention and Entertainment Center. Admission is $10 for 
adults, $8 for seniors. Children under 12 are free. Discount coupons are 
available at Pavilions supermarkets. For information, call 1 (800) 321-1213.

VETERANS: A PLEA FOR KEEPING MEMORIAL AS IS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the granddaughter of the oldest Gold Star mother in America until her 
death, the niece of an uncle who lies among the poppies of Flanders Field, the 
niece of an uncle who lost his life in the Boxer Rebellion, the daughter of a 
World War I veteran and wife of a past national commander of the American 
Legion, I must decry once more the incredible determination to change and 
destroy our Palos Verdes Estates Veterans Memorial Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Veterans Memorial Park, another sparsely landscaped memorial 
park already exists immediately adjacent to the City Hall. There is a 
landscaped buffer between the sidewalk in front of City Hall and the building 
itself. Either of these areas would be suitable for a dignified memorial for 
slain policemen Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool and Capt. Michael Tracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, while on a bicycle trip through Austria, lunchtime found a small group 
of us in a village without a restaurant. We shopped in the village market and 
then sat silently on the steps of a tall obelisk and read the names of village 
men who had died during World War I and II. Within moments a woman rushed out 
of the market and motioned vigorously that we should not be sitting and eating 
at the foot of the village memorial. She then sternly led us to her home, where 
she pointed out a picnic table in her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 War memorials and cemeteries in Europe and throughout America are hallowed 
places where tradition and often literature still proclaim that "here one does 
not picnic or play." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Edward Carson Beall, "roll up your plans!" And, dear members of the City 
Council and Memorial Committee, take a walk around our City Hall and the 400 
empty city parkland acres, and think it out again.

DWP: BATTLE FOR LOWER ELECTRIC RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to what was presented in your coverage (Oct. 20) of the seven 
municipalities fighting for lower electric rates from Southern California 
Edison Co., the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power does pay property 
taxes in the counties of Los Angeles, Inyo, Mono, Riverside and San Bernardino, 
as well as in Nevada and Arizona. It does not pay taxes for properties owned 
within the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the DWP does support municipal services through a traditional 5% 
transfer of its gross revenues to the city's general fund. Over the past 15 
years, the DWP has contributed more than $1 billion to the city. This year, a 
record $197 million is slated to be transferred to support critical city 
operations such as police and fire. This amount is far greater than what would 
have been paid in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the record straight is important. Despite its contributions to the 
city, the DWP has managed to keep its residential rates lower than those of 
SCE. We will continue to implement cost-cutting measures to keep rates low.

NO-CONTEST PLEA BY TRAVEL AGENT TO GRAND THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travel agent Susan Reindl, who pleaded no contest to 13 charges of grand theft 
for bilking South Bay residents of more than $450,000, should have to pay back 
all the money, some angry victims say.  
</P>
<P>
 Reindl agreed Monday to pay $150,904 to about 400 clients who lost trip 
deposits. But Harbor City resident Teresa Buckley, who said 14 of her relatives 
lost money to the travel agent, called $150,000 a drop in the bucket compared 
to the amount taken by Reindl. 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl suddenly closed the doors of her Apollo travel agency on Western Avenue 
in Rancho Palos Verdes in 1991 and kept more than $450,000 in trip deposits. 
She left one newly married couple without tickets to their honeymoon and 
stranded a family that had planned a cruise to Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year investigation, deputies arrested Reindl in June at a Harbor 
City travel agency where she was working. The arrest warrant listed 74 felonies 
and she faced 10 years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea bargain reached Monday, Reindl will be sentenced Nov. 21 and 
could receive up to 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Deputy Public Defender John M. Powers, said Reindl's former 
clients should each receive about a third of the money they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, she has at least, in some ways, acknowledged her guilt rather than 
try to blame it on someone else," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl, who has filed for personal and corporate bankruptcy, claimed earlier 
that her business folded because an employee embezzled close to $100,000 and 
because travel business plummeted during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers reiterated those claims this week but added that "she should have 
declared bankruptcy a year earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Reindl has continued to live and work as a travel agent in the South Bay, but 
Powers said she did not line her pockets with the money from Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, she is totally indigent," he said. "(She) has nothing."

VALLEY NEWSWATCH

<P>
 BACK IN COURT: Sure, they've been overshadowed by O. J. But Lyle and Erik 
Menendez -- remember them? -- will be back in the spotlight today. Superior 
Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg will hold a hearing to decide how many juries 
will hear the second trial, when it will start and where it will be -- Van Nuys 
or downtown. . . . The brothers, charged with murder in the 1989 shotgun 
slayings of their parents, remain in County Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 TO DIE IN RESEDA? Tom Petty put Reseda on the map five years ago with "Free 
Fallin." Now the town is back on the airwaves in Soul Coughing's 
"Screenwriter's Blues." . . . The song, getting play on KROQ-FM, includes the 
lyrics: "We are all in some way or another going to Reseda someday to die." But 
band member M. Doughty, who wrote the song, says he had never visited Reseda 
until recently: "It just had a certain musical ding to it." 
</P>
<P>
 PRO PROSPECT: One dunk shot made him a legend, but it's his play on the 
defensive line that might make him a fortune. CSUN's Oscar Wilson, above, has 
attracted attention from NFL scouts (C8). . . . Wilson became a hero in Santa 
Ana in 1988 with a spectacular last-second dunk against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFER SEX: Teen-agers are finally getting the message about practicing safe 
sex, says the Valley Community Clinic's Connie Kruzan. She was responding to a 
report this week by the National Center for Health Statistics that shows the 
birthrate among 15- to 17-year-old girls fell by 2% in 1992 after a 27% 
increase between 1986 and 1991. . . . "I'm not surprised," Kruzan said. "We see 
more and more kids saying they've been using condoms." 
</P>
<P>
 FRANKENSTEIN: Frankenstein is alive and well, and works in the Valley. But 
don't panic. This Frankenstein is no freak. He's a financial planner for a 
local insurance company, and his first name is Bill (E1). . . . The Times 
tracked Frankenstein down and found that he's used to the attention: "Oh, I 
used to get in a lot of fights when I was a kid. You know, they'd yell, 
'Frankenstein monster!' " 
</P>
<P>
 TONIGHT: "It's Magic!," a revue featuring top magicians, opens at 8 at the 
Alex Theatre, 216 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Tickets are $15.50 to $18.50. 
Information: (800) 233-3123. 
</P>
<P>
 WEATHER: Mostly sunny skies with some patchy fog at night. High temperatures 
in the mid-70s to low 80s; lows around 50. B12

Q & A WITH JONI MITCHELL; 'YOUR LIFE SHOULD AFFECT YOUR DIRECTION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to be careful when congratulating Joni Mitchell on her latest album. 
If she thinks your enthusiasm is based in part on the belief that she has 
finally "returned to form," sparks are likely to fly.  
</P>
<P>
 Words such as jackasses and idiots can surface when she talks about critics 
who largely wrote off her late - '70s and '80s albums as lacking the insight 
and warmth of her early-'70s collections -- works that established her as one 
of the most gifted songwriters of the modern pop era.  
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's outbursts are likely to be followed by disarming giggles -- as if 
she's surprised and amused at her own bratty language.  
</P>
<P>
 The critical complaints began when Mitchell moved from the folk-tinged 
chronicles of relationships in albums such as "Blue" and "Court and Spark" to 
explore other themes and textures.  
</P>
<P>
 But like fellow Canadian-born musician Neil Young, who is also back in 
critical favor after having been attacked in the '80s for experimenting with 
various musical styles, Mitchell is enjoying the last laugh. Both are currently 
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees.  
</P>
<P>
 The praise returned four years ago when her "Night Ride Home" album was widely 
cheered, and the new "Turbulent Indigo" -- which speaks about betrayal and 
compromise on various levels -- is winning even more acclaim.  
</P>
<P>
 With the album just in the stores, Mitchell, 50, spoke about the new songs, 
changes in her life (including the separation from her husband, musician Larry 
Klein, who co-produced the new album) and the impact of the renewed critical 
acceptance.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You have gone through a lot of changes since the last album, 
including the separation from your husband. How close was that to starting the 
new album? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We separated the day before we started. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Didn't that make things difficult in the studio? 
</P>
<P>
 A: People don't even like to work with a married couple, let alone a 
separating couple, so it was a little difficult. When you are separating like 
that . . . it is the opposite of the beginning when everything is synchronistic 
and you are thinking identically. There is an emotional withholding as you are 
pulling apart or changing your relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Klein and I had a good friendship to begin with and a good musical 
relationship. For mutual personal growth, I just think that the separation was 
a good idea. We are working together on two more projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Another change was your return to Warner Bros. Records after 20 years. Was 
it your decision to leave David Geffen's labels after all this time? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I asked David to let me go, please , because I felt I was just on the shelf 
over there and had been for many years. It was time for a change. David offered 
me a new contract, but it was not attractive to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Justice, or the lack of it, seems to be a major theme of the album -- from 
the subject of wife-beating in "Not to Blame" to the social divisions outlined 
in "Borderline." How did that theme emerge? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The album isn't about justice. It's about a quest for justice . . . 
understanding what justice is. I pulled up behind a Cadillac while I was 
waiting for the traffic light and the license plate said, "Just Ice," and I 
started thinking about that: 
</P>
<P>
 Is justice . . . just ice? Governed by greed and lust ? 
</P>
<P>
 Just the strong doing what they can  
</P>
<P>
 And the weak suffering what they must?  
</P>
<P>
 Q: There has been speculation that "Not to Blame" was inspired by specific 
incidents, possibly the O.J. Simpson case or the allegations about Jackson 
Browne and Daryl Hannah. Any comment? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Let's not go gossipy on any of these songs. . . . I should have put a 
disclaimer. . . "Any resemblance to any people living or dead is merely 
coincidental." This is a song about batterers of women. It's dumb to reduce the 
song to a portrait of an individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As someone who experienced enormous success at a young age, can you 
identify with the pressures on someone like the late Kurt Cobain? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Are you kidding? Listen to (her 1972 song) "For the Roses": 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the days when you used to sit  
</P>
<P>
 And make up your tunes for love  
</P>
<P>
 And pour your simple sorrow  
</P>
<P>
 To the sound hole and your knee  
</P>
<P>
 And now you're seen  
</P>
<P>
 On giant screens  
</P>
<P>
 And at parties for the press  
</P>
<P>
 And for people who have slices of you  
</P>
<P>
 From the company . .  
</P>
<P>
 People don't understand how distasteful it is to the artistic temperament to 
be pulled through the business like we are forced to. . . . It threatens the 
creativity. It cheapens. It slanders. It assumes. . . . You are subject to the 
printed opinions of jackasses. You put your work up and some idiot comes up, 
like some guy wrote after (1976's) "Hejira" how I completely lost perspective 
on my music and didn't know who I was anymore. . . . It is a heartbreaking 
gantlet young artists have to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does it feel to have so many people calling the last two albums your 
best in years? Is there part of you that resents it when critics say this is 
your best since the "Court and Spark" days? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It just shows me the person who is writing that has a very limited 
perception of my work. I think I have done some of my best work out of favor, 
between "Night Ride Home" and "Court and Spark." It's not the most commercial, 
but it is the most emotionally adventuresome. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the impact of critical reaction on your direction as an artist? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's nice when a project is well received, but it shouldn't affect your 
direction at all if you are a genuine artist. Your life should affect your 
direction. I've got two songs now that I need to get in and start recording, 
and they are different from the songs in this album. One's titled "Happiness Is 
the Best Face Lift." 
</P>
<P>
 * 'TURBULENT INDIGO' 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's latest is her best in years, reviewer Chris Willman says. F11

O.C. POP BEAT; BARRELHOUSE'S SOUL MEN PAY RESPECTS TO REDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seated at the dining table in his apartment, a pouch of roll-your-own tobacco 
beside him and a quart of Jim Beam at the ready, Steave Ascasio had girded and 
provisioned himself for some serious yarn-weaving on the theme of how he came 
to be the singer in a suburbanite band that plays authentic-sounding Southern 
soul music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd call it fate on my part," Ascasio said expansively, leaning back and 
starting at the beginning. "For some strange reason, when I was about 7 or 9. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing a myth in the making, Ascasio's mild-mannered band mate, Mark Cerneka, 
decided to puncture it with a quip before it ballooned out of hand: "When you 
were working in the cotton fields?" the clean-cut guitarist asked wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascasio smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "No cotton fields involved. I don't think anybody would believe me if I said 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The impressive thing about Ascasio and his band, Barrelhouse, is their knack 
for making music that sounds as if its creators might have firsthand knowledge 
of cotton fields, or at least of the ghetto barrooms and Chitlin' Circuit 
theaters where the grittier forms of soul music took root more than 30 years 
ago. Instead, Barrelhouse's roots are in the subdivisions of Laguna Niguel and 
Huntington Beach, where Ascasio grew up.  
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, this band of white guys in their 20s has come up with a close 
approximation of the sweaty, tightly played, freely wailing mid-'60s Memphis 
soul sound made famous by Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. Rather than cover 
the standard repertoire of soul, a la the Commitments, Barrelhouse (which plays 
Friday at Roxbury South) plays Ascasio-penned originals that sound like lost 
tracks from the Stax Records vault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can train to be a soul singer," said Ascasio, a 
husky-voiced, huskily built 25-year-old with long sideburns and wavy, unkempt 
dark brown hair. "I don't want to project myself as egotistical or conceited 
and say I'm a natural, but some people say either you have it or you don't, and 
I guess I just have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ascasio said the first sign that he had "it" came when he was in the fourth 
grade and his class sang a version of the Beatles' "Hey Jude" for parents' 
visitation day. While everybody else swayed to the song's 
"nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah-nah" campfire sing-along, Ascasio free-lanced his own 
part in mimicry of Paul McCartney's frenzied soul screams: "I was the only kid 
going, ' Jude -ay , Jude-ay, Jude-ay, ow!! ," Ascasio recalled, complete with 
sung illustration. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days however, soul music was still in his future. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Kiss, man. Kiss was the hot stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Ascasio and his best buddy, Guy Laurin, would ham it up by staging Kiss 
concerts in their garage, complete with painted faces, homemade uniforms, as 
much of a light show as Christmas bulbs would allow, and lip-synced, air-guitar 
performances set to their heroes' records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ascasio credits his mother with putting him in touch with rootsier forms of 
rock. Before that facetious interruption about his days in the cotton fields, 
the singer was painting a picture of the time his mother sat him down with a 
double album of Chuck Berry hits and told him, "It's something you need to 
hear."  
</P>
<P>
 Ascasio said Berry, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones were the most important 
inspirations as he and Laurin graduated from air guitars to real guitars and 
began to write their own songs. Ascasio was 11, Laurin 13. It wasn't until 
Ascasio was in his mid-teens that he discovered Otis Redding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody turned me on to it. I don't know who, but I'm grateful for it. 
Everything that I write is a direct dedication to Otis Redding. He is the man. 
He is it. He is soul." 
</P>
<P>
 However, when Ascasio and Laurin formed Crawdaddy, their first serious band, 
the sound had more to do with redneck rockers like Lynyrd Skynyrd than with 
soul men like Redding and Pickett. Crawdaddy became Barrelhouse in 1991, the 
band name nicked from a blues song by Robert Johnson.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, Ascasio said, "we were playing Stonesy-Black Crowes kind of stuff. 
It was bull. It didn't feel right."  
</P>
<P>
 He points to Cerneka's arrival in mid-1993 as a turning point that led away 
from rock sources and toward the definitive soul sound (mixed with a smattering 
of blues) that has become the band's hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Calhoun (Cerneka's performing nickname) came in, I felt I had an ally," 
Ascasio said. "I can get back to my original roots because he has the same 
roots, and he can back me up" in keeping other, more rock-oriented members 
close to the traditional soul and blues line the band has adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Cerneka, 26, joined after answering a musician-wanted ad that read, "Bluesy 
rock band looking for a guitar player." He had grown up in a house full of 
roots music, courtesy of a mother who was an Elvis fan and a father who loved 
Ray Charles. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing soul music, Cerneka said, is "a natural progression" from his origins. 
But before getting back to his first love, he took an unexpected detour through 
punk.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1986-87, Cerneka, dubbed "The Kid," played a hitch in the Orange County 
hard core punk band D.I., appearing on its album "What Good Is Grief to a God?" 
Cerneka, a Fullerton College music major at the time, said he was intent on 
playing the blues, but auditioned for D.I. when a mutual acquaintance told him 
the band needed a guitar player. Cerneka said he played punk rock for the money 
and the fun of it but always felt his true calling was in blues and R & B. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrelhouse surfaced early this year with a self-produced cassette, "Blues on 
10th 'n' Central." Though the seven-song release lacked the horns and keyboards 
that are a vital part of the Memphis/Redding soul sound, Ascasio's impassioned 
singing made it obvious where the band's inspiration lay.  
</P>
<P>
 Before recording the just-released follow-up CD, "Soul Pimps 'N' Blues 
Pushers," the five core members of Barrelhouse recruited those missing pieces. 
In concert, the band is now a nine-piece outfit, with sax, trumpet, trombone 
and piano filling out the sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Before putting out "Blues on 10th 'n' Central," Barrelhouse's members adopted 
stage names meant to draw a fondly humorous connection to a rural South of juke 
joints and cotton fields. Ascasio became Harlis Sweetwater. Cerneka is Calhoun 
B. Tibbs. Drummer Michael Keen dubbed himself Cleotis Jackson, guitarist Dave 
Metzger is Mobley Stonefield, and bassist Laurin, showing a tad less 
imagination than his cohorts, became Leonard Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leonard and Cleotis and I were sitting around drinking," recalled Ascasio, 
who always refers to his band mates by their nicknames. "I said: 'Look at all 
our heroes: Otis, Marvin Gaye, Wilson Pickett. And who are we? Mike, Steave, 
Dave, Mark. Let's have some fun." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mockery or satire intended in the adoption of names with a black, 
Southern ring to them, Cerneka said. If anything, he said, it's a homage to 
Barrelhouse's sources.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we're angry at somebody in the band, we call them their real name. All 
the people I play the recordings for can't believe we're a bunch of white guys; 
even the black people I've played it for. It's a compliment to me. It tells me 
we're doing something right." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Barrelhouse has begun to emerge as a solid attraction in local clubs. 
Its biggest moment so far was a performance at the recent Orange County Blues 
Festival in Dana Point, where it won an encore. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the blues festival, they were received very well. I had a lot of good 
comments coming back from people who hadn't seen them before," said Mark 
Liddell, booker for the blues festival and the Heritage Brewing Co. nightclub 
in Dana Point. "At the Heritage they've packed it both times they've played." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the band, which has neither a manager nor a record deal, is trying to 
solidify its first tour, which it hopes will take it to Texas and Louisiana 
early next year. Ascasio, a tumbler of bourbon and Coke in hand, spoke 
zealously of carrying the soul torch to a new generation. He emphasized that 
Barrelhouse is neither a cover band, like the movie-spawned Irish soul group 
the Commitments, nor a musical tourist such as Michael Bolton, who scored big 
hits with heavy-handed versions of Redding's "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" 
and Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to face it: Soul is not that big right now," Ascasio said. "We're 
not waiting for a record company to pick us up -- they don't want to hear a 
soul band. They want to hear what's hot -- a punk band, a grunge band. When 
blues and soul (becomes) hot, they'll call us. We're saying: 'This is it, this 
is how we feel. You're going to relate to it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Barrelhouse plays at 9:30 p.m. Friday at Roxbury South, 2 Hutton Centre 
Drive, Santa Ana. $10. (714) 662-0880.

NEW CHAPTER FOR 'THE SCARLET LETTER' -- AS OPERA; MUSIC: PREMIERE OF 
HAWTHORNE'S 'HEART SONG' AT CSULB WILL USE A BLEND OF PROFESSIONAL AND STUDENT 
SINGERS AND CREW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "The Scarlet Letter" as opera? 
</P>
<P>
 To composer Martin Herman, Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 novel is a natural. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hawthorne's language is strong," he said. "It has meter and sings in a way 
that suggests that it should be set to music. Hawthorne said himself in the 
opening passages of the book that this was his 'heart song' to his wife. The 
nice thing about opera is that it makes passions really big." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, in terms of the issues it addresses, "The book is every bit as 
contemporary now as it was then," Herman said last week during a rehearsal 
break at Cal State Long Beach, where his operatic version of "The Scarlet 
Letter" gets its world premiere tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing parallels in Hawthorne's novel to contemporary American issues, Herman 
said he has long believed that the 1850 novel would translate well into a great 
American opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are issues in the novel that we face every day -- issues of single 
parenthood, civil rights, feminism, and what constitutes a family," said 
Herman, 37, an associate professor of music since 1989 at Cal State Long Beach, 
where he teaches music composition and theory. 
</P>
<P>
 He's not the first to think the story could have a life outside of a library. 
In 1896, composer Walter Damrosch wrote a little-known opera based on the book. 
In New York, the Classic Stage Company is presenting its theatrical treatment. 
A movie version starring Demi Moore also is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until a dinner conversation in 1982 with a colleague from Hamilton 
College in New York, where Herman was teaching music theory at the time, that 
the idea of composing his own opera took hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The colleague mentioned that his father, novelist Tom Curley, always wanted to 
write a libretto for "The Scarlet Letter." That led to a meeting between Herman 
and Curley. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 12 years, one workshop and 20 versions of the libretto later (many 
versions were hammered out via fax across two continents while Curley, author 
of "Past Eve and Adam's" and "Knowwhere Man," was in Italy), Herman's "The 
Scarlet Letter" will at last be born. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A joint production of CSULB music and theater departments and the campus's new 
Carpenter Performing Arts Center, the opera will use a blend of professional 
and student singers and crew.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the professionals in central roles is tenor Greg Fedderly -- he'll be 
the Rev. Dimmesdale -- who sang the title role in Britten's "Albert Herring" 
for Los Angeles Music Center Opera as well as others for that company. Brent 
McMunn, Music Center Opera's principal pianist, will conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The university's theater department did the staging, scenery and costumes, 
while students from the music department are singing in the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 The opera, set in 17th-Century Puritan Boston, examines the roles of love, 
shame and independence as it tells the story of Hester Prynne, a married woman 
convicted of adultery who is forced to wear a scarlet "A" after refusing to 
identify the father of her child. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman realizes that the production is a gamble. He had never composed an 
opera, Curley had never written a libretto and the director, Philip Littell, 
had never directed an opera. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riskiness is part of the attraction," said Herman, who nevertheless has a 
wide range of experience to draw upon. 
</P>
<P>
 He has written numerous chamber and symphonic pieces for the Cabrillo Festival 
Orchestra in Santa Cruz, N.M., and the National Orchestra Assn. in New York 
City. He has been guest conductor at the "Music Now -- Prague" festival in the 
Czech Republic. His "The Fractal Bow," a symphonic work based on mathematical 
algorithms and the chaos theory in physics, premiered at the Long Beach 
Symphony in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think a guy who wrote a symphony inspired by chaos theory wouldn't have 
much trouble with a novel that's nearly 150 years old. But Herman said it 
presented a significant challenge because of its lack of action. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the drama is internal, so it is up to the music to get that across 
on stage. . . . It is like Wagner in my mind because a lot of Wagner is simply 
sung. This opera is like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Littell: "It moves forward in waves like Wagner, but it has the lyric 
qualities of a Verdi opera. . . . It is a very emotional, dramatic score." 
</P>
<P>
 Littell, 44, who lives in Hollywood and who has acted, directed and written 
for theater, hopes the work will enter the standard repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since it is a self-generated project, it does have further to leap," he said. 
"But that's my job -- to help it leap, and I think it has the qualities to do 
that, emotionally, intellectually and artistically . . . and I'm a snob about 
these things. I don't get associated with mediocre projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Littell's main experience with opera has been as the author of the librettos 
for two works composed by Conrad Susa: "Dangerous Liaisons," which opened in 
September in a San Francisco Opera production that later was broadcast over 
public television, and a Christmas opera, "The Wise Woman," which premiered in 
Dallas at the American Guild of Organists Convention earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had two incredible opportunities (with Susa) to write and now get the 
opportunity to participate," Littell said. "So if nothing else, I am getting a 
hell of an education: learning to develop a technique for working with opera 
singers on the spot, trying to make a class 'A' production with almost no 
budget and no resources. . . . I don't know the exact figure of the budget, but 
it's low. Real low. And really I don't want to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Curley, 69, also is getting an education, he said in a phone interview from 
his home in Manhattan, where he teaches English at St. Xavier High School. What 
he especially enjoys about adapting the work of another writer is that "being a 
novelist, it's great not having to invent everything yourself for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he tried to follow the structure of the book while preserving the 
integrity of the prose -- but without the trappings of Hawthorne's language. "I 
cut down on the floweriness of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he came up with an innovation. "We start the opera after the book ends," 
he said, when Hester comes back to visit after her daughter is grown and in 
Europe. "It makes a unity. It is not quite a flashback, but the whole thing 
looks back on the action, and that emphasizes Hester's strength." 
</P>
<P>
 All that aside, Curley said he'll be looking for one thing when he flies in to 
attend Saturday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never understand the words to opera," he said. "I am hoping that I 
will be able to understand my own." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Scarlet Letter," produced by the CSULB music and theater departments 
and the Carpenter Performing Arts Center, premieres tonight at the Carpenter 
center, Cal State Long Beach, 6200 Atherton St., Long Beach. 8 p.m. Continues 
with performances Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. $18 to $25. Lectures 
by composer Martin Herman and director Philip Littell will be given an hour 
before each performance in the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall adjacent to the 
center. (310) 985-7000.

OPERA PACIFIC ENDS SEASON IN RED FOR FIRST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One truism in opera is that box office tends to suffer whenever the repertory 
ventures off the beaten track.  
</P>
<P>
 At the 7-year-old Opera Pacific, productions of Gounod's "Faust" and Wagner's 
"Die Walkure" during the recently concluded season resulted in the company's 
first-ever deficit -- $679,000 for the fiscal year ending Aug. 31. A surplus of 
$295,000 carried over from the previous year, however, effectively leaves the 
company $384,000 in the red. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is not planning any layoffs or ticket price increases, according 
to Lori Burrill, Opera Pacific's co-managing director, who added that the staff 
feels "pretty confident" the remaining deficit will be halved this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Paid attendance, which has been as high as 95% or more for popular operas such 
as Verdi's "Aida" or Puccini's "Madama Butterfly," plummeted to an average of 
70% for the four operas presented by the company last year. (The other two were 
Lehar's "The Merry Widow" and Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Audiences are always (leery) because Wagner has a reputation of being very 
long and very difficult to understand," said Timothy B. Dunn, director of 
public relations for the company. "He's never the big seller in most companies 
that Puccini and Verdi are. . . . 'Faust' was a very controversial production. 
. . . People with traditional tastes (apparently) decided, 'I don't want my 
"Faust" so controversial.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Those low turnouts, Dunn said, led to a current season stocked with 
"bread-and-butter" operas: "Aida," "Madama Butterfly," Verdi's "La Traviata" 
and Mozart's "Die Zauberflote." Season subscriptions total 9,304 for the 
current season, an increase of 1,500 over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At $932,801, "Die Walkure" was an unusually expensive undertaking for Opera 
Pacific, which also lost about $50,000 on a benefit performance by Placido 
Domingo in January. ("Faust" was a co-production with Opera Pacific general 
director David DiChiera's other company, Michigan Opera Theater, which split 
the $740,000 cost with the Costa Mesa troupe.) Fund raising, however, remained 
stable: During fiscal 1994, the company raised about $1.8 million of its 
$5.6-million budget. The remainder comes from ticket sales ($2.7 million), 
interest income and set rentals.

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: BY DESIGN; FEATHERS, BUGLE BEADS AND . . . TWEED?

 The Movie: "Bullets Over Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Woody Allen's comic tale of a struggling playwright, David Shayne 
(John Cusack), and his attempt to get his work produced with funny money in 
late '20s New York. Olive Neal (Jennifer Tilly), a gangster's girl, and fading 
star Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) have the top roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Jeffrey Kurland, doing his 13th Woody Allen feature. 
Others include "Manhattan Murder Mystery," "Husbands and Wives," "Broadway 
Danny Rose," "Radio Days" and "Alice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Exuberant and luxurious, featuring the endangered species of the 
dress-up world: ostrich feathers and bugle beads. Such costumes enliven 
fashionable Helen Sinclair, who boasts a dreamy wardrobe of drop-waist dresses, 
feather-trimmed cloches, embroidered China silk lounging pajamas plus two 
silver fox stoles (worn simultaneously), fur-collar coats and a monkey-fur 
muff. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive Neal, who proves that money can't buy good taste, is blessedly garish in 
outfits of flaming red, pink and orange. Her ostrich-feather-trimmed robes are 
absolute scene-stealers. 
</P>
<P>
 David Shayne, in his relentless diet of tweed Norfolk jackets and spectacles, 
amazingly looks like a prewar version of the filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Triumph: Keep an eye out for the chorus girls in Chinese costumes with pagoda 
hats and short, pagoda-shaped skirts with sequined balls. Their ode to New York 
City features short dresses with the skyline of Manhattan rendered in bugle 
beads. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia: Warner Purcell (Jim Broadbent), who expands by about 100 pounds during 
play rehearsals, was enlarged in three stages. The first involved belting a pad 
around his waist. The second added a padded T-shirt-style garment made of 
cotton batting and grain (so the rolls sag properly) that zips up the back. The 
third required a complete "fat suit," featuring padded torso plus limbs, also 
made of batting and grain. Finally, eight suits were made to fit the various 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: Although it's never visible, the actresses wear period 
underwear -- bandeau bras, garters, stockings, teddies and camisoles. "I think 
the actresses like it very much," Kurland says. "It helps them get into 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 Research: The photograph collection at the Lincoln Center branch of the New 
York City Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Principals' clothes were either vintage or custom-made at Barbara 
Matera Limited, Miracle Studio, Pierre of Paris and Woody Shelp (for hats) in 
New York. Glasses are from Robert Marc Optician in New York. Helen Sinclair's 
furs were both vintage (including the muff) and new, custom-made at Ben Kahn.

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: CINDY CRAWFORD: 'GIRL' OF STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Give Cindy my number," hollered our cute, smudged plumber as he ducked into 
the basement and we headed for a date with model/goddess Cindy Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford -- in Los Angeles for pre-production work on her first film, an 
action-adventure co-starring Billy Baldwin -- inspires romantic impulses and 
curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women need to know: Is she as smart, beautiful and tall as she seems? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, and even somewhat self-deprecating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody asked me what I thought of the attorneys in the O.J. Simpson trial," 
she said, after a round of early-morning television appearances. "Who cares 
what a model thinks?" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, her job this day was to tout Revlon's new men's and women's 
fragrance, Fire & Ice. Crawford's contract with the cosmetics company expires 
on her 30th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't intentional or anything," she says with a laugh. "But still, it 
makes you think." Like about why models are always called "girls." 
</P>
<P>
 "I even do it myself. My husband asked me why I would fall into that . . . but 
everyone calls them girls." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to think of Crawford -- who's masterminded a spectacularly 
successful career for herself that includes hosting MTV's "House of Style" -- 
as a girl. But sidelined at the fall collections as a fashion reporter, she 
pined for the catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at those 16-year-olds and I thought, 'I can still do that. I still 
look pretty good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she knows firsthand the rigid standards that rule the fashion world. 
Crawford consoled model Christy Turlington, who was savaged last season for 
gaining a bit of weight, by telling her, " 'They leave me alone because I'm 
always fat.' Christy had just gotten so thin, she looked heavy by comparison." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, of course, is similarly obsessed with youth and beauty. Actress 
Ellen Barkin, who works out at the same gym as Crawford, told her that 
actresses' ages are frozen at 33. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said that in Hollywood, the golden age for a woman is 33 -- that's when 
you should have your big hit," Crawford says. "In the modeling business, it's 
about 10 years younger. When you turn 25, your agency tells you to never give 
your age." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Sighing Game: Jaye Davidson, the actor who starred in "The Crying Game," 
is just 27, but has the world-weary sensibility of someone many decades older. 
"I will only wear the best," he said during a two-day visit to Los Angeles. 
"Savile Row suits, custom-made shirts, vintage Levi's. . . ." Isn't that a bit 
paralyzing, we wondered? "Excruciatingly," he answered in a soft, deadpan 
voice. Which sort of sums up his feelings about being a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about spring fashion shows in Paris, several of which he attended, 
Davidson asked: "Did you see what happened at the Vivienne Westwood show when 
Lenny Kravitz and (French pop star) Vanessa Paradis walked in?" (We did -- the 
paparazzi went berserk.) "I never want to be that famous." 
</P>
<P>
 Too late. Davidson was recently stalked by a loony fan who waited for weeks at 
a subway stop near the actor's home to meet her idol. And Friday, his second 
film, "Stargate," opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've actually had people in a bar tell me that ("The Crying Game") had 
changed their life. Can you imagine that? All I can say is, it must not have 
been much of a life to start with." 
</P>
<P>

 Those Wacky Hollywood Gals: Remember Angelyne? The billboard bombshell has had 
a face lift and that may not be all. Her latest incarnation can be viewed on 
billboards all over town. She's still pushing her signature color -- hot pink 
-- and her extraordinarily ample bust in a tiny, diamond-studded bikini, long 
black gloves and diamond cuffs. Angelyne looks younger, a lot younger -- 
courtesy, we suspect, of computer retouch. "What does she do anyway? Who is 
she?" asked an elderly woman waiting for a bus near the La Brea and Sunset 
billboard. "Those Hollywood women! Always showing off their breasts. It's 
disgusting." Her friend, recently arrived from Russia, agreed: "There's too 
much freedom here. . . . I'll never get used to it." 
</P>

 Lounge Wear: While busily preparing for the spring '95 shows in New York, 
designer Richard Tyler was called upon by Mick Jagger's stylist to whip up some 
duds for the rocker's L.A. and Miami appearances. After chatting with the 
singer via phone about the look Jagger was after, Tyler turned out a purple and 
chartreuse striped jacket, a burgundy jacket with bronze trim, a silver stretch 
T-shirt, white silk crepe de chine shirt, black stretch pants and burgundy 
striped brocade vest. There had to be some sweet nostalgia there -- early in 
his career, Tyler specialized in dressing rock stars.

 Divine Inspiration: Need some early tips on what to buy for the person who has

 The Scene: Monday's premiere of MGM's "Stargate" at Mann's Chinese with a 
party at the Palace. The film is a special-effects-filled science-fiction 
thriller with an ancient Egyptian theme. One writer, well-versed in the 
reigning buzzwords used to sell scripts, dubbed it " 'Die Hard' in a pyramid." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, James Spader and Jaye Davidson, who's 
best-known for "The Crying Game" (co-star Kurt Russell was in New York for the 
Letterman show); also on hand were director-writer Roland Emmerich, 
writer-producer Dean Devlin, executive producer Mario Kassar and 1,200 guests, 
including James Coburn, Adam Baldwin, Gary Busey, Kim Cattrall, Ed Begley Jr., 
Lesley Ann Warren, Rick Nicita, Jim Sheridan, and MGM's Frank Mancuso, Gerry 
Rich and Larry Gleason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Film Distilled: Jennifer Tilly said, "James Spader is a kind of a yuppie 
heartthrob, Kurt Russell is a kind of cowboy heartthrob, and then you have Jaye 
Davidson, who plays a hermaphrodite, which in itself is a really interesting 
special effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Davidson, who said doing "Stargate" was "a lucky break," added, "Why 
didn't I work for two years after 'The Crying Game'? It's because Hollywood 
doesn't know what to do with me. I don't look normal. I look like a bit of a 
freak. It's not as though I'm going to get the roles Keanu Reeves turns down." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: It was a truly lively party with a large segment of the crowd 
dancinguntil 1 a.m. Part of the ambience came from muscular extras in ancient 
Egyptian costume who looked like bodybuilders from the King Tut gym. They wore 
loincloths that were a strong breeze away from being X-rated. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Ambrosia's Middle Eastern menu of stuffed grape leaves, hummus and fish 
skewers was served by staffers wearing turbans and robes a la John the Baptist. 
One guest called the style "early Tunisian drip-dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Standout: Davidson arrived at the screening in a shimmering, antique 
Indian sari woven from gold thread. He changed into jeans and T-shirt 
immediately afterward. "No way was I going to wear it to the party, bump into 
drunks and get cigarette burns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Wisdom: A film star's ex-wife said, "Being a celebrity is like having an 
all-access, backstage pass to life in Hollywood."

NBA MAKES ITS MOVE TO AVERT A STOPPAGE; PRO BASKETBALL: LEAGUE AND PLAYERS' 
ASSOCIATION AGREE ON NO-STRIKE/NO-LOCKOUT PLEDGE, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NBA and the players' association, days away from an unannounced 
league-ordered work stoppage, reached an agreement in principle late Wednesday 
night on a no-strike/no-lockout pledge that will allow the season to start on 
time Nov. 4 and continue without interruption, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times learned that league officials notified the National Basketball 
Players Assn. about a week ago that a lockout would have begun Monday had they 
not come to this understanding. That will become a moot point today, however, 
when the pact is completed and announced at a joint news conference in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, executive director of the NBPA, declined comment. Deputy 
Commissioner Russ Granik said he was hopeful for a peace treaty before the 
season begins, but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Buck Williams of the Portland Trail Blazers, president of the players' 
association, told the Associated Press, "I like the concept" of the 
no-strike/no-lockout proposal, adding: "I'm sure there are some discussions 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the union will continue to press forward with two lawsuits, 
contrary to reports that those would have to be dropped before the league would 
accept the no-strike/no-lockout agreement. Sources said the sides have had 
about six unofficial meetings in an attempt to reach a settlement on the 
antitrust suit in the court of appeals that challenges the salary cap, the 
college draft and the rights of free agency, but that no progress has been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 The second legal action was filed this week when David Wood of the Golden 
State Warriors and Howard Eisley of the Minnesota Timberwolves sued the league, 
alleging it artificially reduced the salary cap for 1994-95 by about $74 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement have been at a 
standstill and no meetings are scheduled. Earlier this month, the union and the 
league said they would be willing to open the season without a new deal, as 
they have in the past, and as recently as three weeks ago Commissioner David 
Stern dismissed any lockout talk while boasting of the league's labor harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had a strike and never had a lockout," Stern said after an Oct. 
5 owners' meeting. "We know what a strike is. We know what a lockout is. But 
those particular weapons have never been called into action. We haven't and we 
don't plan to." 
</P>
<P>
 Those plans apparently changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, before the agreement neared completion, Grantham faxed a memo to 11 
player agents that, among other things, warned of the impending Monday lockout.

CLIPPERS' ROBERTS SIDELINED FOR SEASON; PRO BASKETBALL: CENTER RUPTURES LEFT 
ACHILLES' TENDON. HE RUPTURED THE RIGHT ACHILLES' LAST SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper center Stanley Roberts, who played only 14 games last season before 
rupturing his right Achilles' tendon on Dec. 4, will sit out the upcoming NBA 
season after rupturing his left Achilles' tendon in the fourth quarter of a 
101-98 exhibition victory over the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday night before an 
announced crowd of 5,211 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts will undergo surgery Friday at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital and is 
expected to be sidelined nine to 12 months, said Gene Osher, who will perform 
the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual (to have ruptured both Achilles' tendons in such a short span of 
time), but this was the type of circumstance where it would be less unusual -- 
big man, small tendon, working hard," Osher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts ballooned to more than 345 pounds last summer while recuperating from 
surgery last December and reported to camp overweight and out of shape. After 
working out three times a day with a personal trainer, he practiced with the 
team only three times before leaving for a traffic-court appearance in Raleigh, 
N.C., on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Roberts' weight contribute to the injury? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of the problem," Osher said. "He had a built-up shoe (for his 
right foot) and he was progressing very nicely. The shoe was designed to take 
some of the pressure off the Achilles' on both sides. He has a relatively small 
tendon for a man his size. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a season injury. By the time he recovers from this and gets back in 
shape, I really strongly doubt whether he'll play this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts was chasing his own missed free throw when his left leg buckled 
underneath him. He collapsed to the court, rolling in agony. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Keith Jones and Osher rushed out to examine him. He was wheeled off 
the court on a stretcher by Clipper centers Elmore Spencer and Bob Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in his first game since last season's injury, Roberts had 13 points 
and two rebounds in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest problem we had with him the last week was keeping him from 
killing me because he wanted to play," Coach Bill Fitch said. "He was doing all 
the right things; he just got a bad break." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Eric Piatkowski: "Everybody is down and out about Stanley's 
injury. "Stanley shot the free throw so quickly and when he pushed off, his 
foot gave out and you could tell he was in pain."

IN A RUSH TO THE TOP; WITH QUARTERBACKS HURTING, NEBRASKA GIVES THE BALL TO 
PHILLIPS . . . AND GIVES IT TO HIM . . . AND GIVES IT TO HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The amazing thing isn't that Colorado defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz and 
his staff are spending two solid days watching videotape of Nebraska's offense, 
better known as I-back Lawrence Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 What is amazing is that after viewing the nation's third-leading rusher, they 
still have an appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a cramped meeting room, the conference table covered with open 
videocassette boxes, notes and diagrams from the morning session, Hankwitz 
picks at his plate of lukewarm stir-fry chicken. In between bites he explains 
how Phillips, the sophomore from Baldwin Park High, has kept the 
quarterback-impaired Cornhusker offense from collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the premier running backs in the country," Hankwitz said with a sigh. 
"He's a typical Nebraska I-back. He's an aggressive runner, but they've always 
had tough running backs. They have the ability to make you miss, but they're 
not going to put five moves on you. They're going to give you a move and then 
go north-south." 
</P>
<P>
 Few runners have a better sense of direction that Phillips, who doesn't need a 
compass to know that 'north-south' in coach-talk means end zones. In only eight 
games, Phillips has rushed for 12 touchdowns. He has gained 1,242 yards, 
averaged 6.8 yards per carry, and his eight consecutive games of 100 yards or 
more tie a Nebraska record set in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 If Phillips keeps this pace, he could finish with about 1,800 yards, which 
would give him the second-best season in Nebraska history, no small feat 
considering the list includes Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier, Derek Brown, 
Jeff Kinney, I.M. Hipp, Keith Jones, Calvin Jones, Bob Reynolds and Ken Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Average player," said Bob Simmons, Colorado's assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons smiles when he says it. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the morning, when Simmons and Hankwitz were clicking the VCR 
control button back and forth, watching Nebraska's signature dive plays, 
counter traps and fabled "43 toss," they saw the ghost of Cornhusker I-backs 
past. They saw a little of Rozier in Phillips' running style. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what we said," Simmons said. "It don't look like he's running, 
but you don't catch him. He's smooth. He's got that long gait." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he's the difference," Hankwitz said. "He may not look like a fast guy, 
but you know he's running." 
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia knows. Phillips gained 126 yards against the Mountaineers in the 
Kickoff Classic. He got 175 against Texas Tech, 178 against UCLA, 138 against 
Pacific in only nine tries, 168 against Wyoming, 221 against Oklahoma State, 
126 against Kansas State's eight-man front and 110 against Missouri in only two 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 You yawn -- typical Nebraska stuff. After all, isn't this the state with three 
seasons: planting season, harvest season and 1,000-yard seasons? 
</P>
<P>
 But this is different, mainly because the Cornhuskers are down to their last 
experienced scholarship quarterback. Preseason Heisman candidate Tommie Frazier 
is out for the season after doctors discovered a blood clot behind his right 
knee Sept. 25. Frazier's replacement, Brook Berringer, the only remaining 
scholarship quarterback with any appreciable playing time, suffered a partially 
collapsed lung against Wyoming Oct. 1 and now wears enough body armor "that I 
look like Robo-Cop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Berringer's backup, walk-on Matt Turman, injured his shoulder last 
week and is out. True freshman Monte Christo is back after sitting out six 
weeks because of torn ligaments in his throwing hand, but an appearance against 
No. 2-ranked Colorado isn't exactly what the Cornhuskers are hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
 After Christo, Coach Tom Osborne can choose from wingback Clester Johnson, 
wide receiver Ryan Held, former student manager Andy Kucera and walk-on Trent 
Schlaka. If that doesn't work, there's always Our Lady of Lourdes . . . or 
Phillips, who seems heaven-sent for third-ranked Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I think God is sitting up there saying, 'I'm gonna zap the 
quarterback,' " left tackle Rob Zatechka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but with Berringer's status in question and the rest of the 
quarterbacking depth chart in disarray, Phillips has become the logical 
centerpiece of the Cornhusker offense. He has help. Nebraska's offensive line, 
the best at Lincoln in the last five years, is bigger than some farm machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all its people-moving skills, Zatechka and Co. can do only so much. 
The rest is up to Phillips, who has quietly moved himself into Heisman 
contention, though you wouldn't know it by talking to him. Ask him about his 
national profile and you get polite indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess," Phillips said with a shrug. "I've seen me on TV a couple of times." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly he sees Colorado's Rashaan Salaam, or Alcorn State's Steve McNair, or 
Washington's Napoleon Kaufman on the weekly updates. Phillips is the Heisman 
afterthought. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine," Phillips said. "I don't really get upset because I don't get 
mentioned. I'm proud of what I've done at Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
 He ought to be. Against Kansas State, Phillips not only faced an eight-man 
defensive line, but found himself the center of attention on every option play. 
The Wildcats didn't even bother assigning a defender to the quarterback, which 
is unheard of. Instead, they followed Phillips' every move. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd put both guys on the pitch man," Zatechka said, "and he'd still gets 
100 yards a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado runs the only true 3-4 defense in the Big Eight Conference, so a 
repeat of Kansas State's scheme isn't likely. But Phillips has the Buffaloes' 
attention and Colorado has his. 
</P>
<P>
 When Phillips arrived for the weekly Nebraska news conference earlier in the 
week, he wore a black and gold Colorado baseball cap. So did his buddy, 
all-American linebacker Ed Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to think about them a lot," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody on campus seems to mind the fashion statement. In fact, hardly anybody 
has noticed Phillips or his hat. It seems to be a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think people know I'm on the football team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They will if he somehow leads undefeated Nebraska past unbeaten Colorado in 
Lincoln on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll be surprised if they think all we can do is run," Phillips 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, Lawrence, at the moment that's all Nebraska can do. The Cornhuskers are 
No. 1 nationally in rushing offense (390 yards per game) and No. 101 in passing 
(110.8 average). And if Berringer, one of the few Cornhuskers somewhat familiar 
with the concept of the forward pass, gets hurt, then look for Phillips to run 
until he or Colorado drops. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't new to Phillips. Earlier in the season, when Frazier's blood clot 
was diagnosed, the senior quarterback cornered Phillips and told him to expect 
more carries. He wasn't kidding. With Frazier in the lineup, Phillips never 
rushed more than 24 times in a game. Without Frazier, Phillips hasn't carried 
the ball fewer than 27 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the funny thing is, I haven't been as sore as I think I should have 
been," said Phillips, who has dipped only his sprained left thumb into the 
whirlpool after recent games. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips' performances haven't gone unnoticed by his teammates. They see his 
left thumb, which is swollen twice the size of his right. They heard Osborne 
call him, "the one-armed man," which was the coach's way of complimenting him 
for playing hurt. They heard the hits on each of his 33 carries against 
Oklahoma State and 31 against Kansas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who says he knew Phillips could play the very first time he saw him 
in practice, gives him the edge over Calvin Jones and Derek Brown, who both 
collect NFL paychecks. Phillips, six feet and 200 pounds, has the power of 
Jones and the speed of Brown. "And he will run over you if he catches you 
slipping," Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 No need to tell that to Hankwitz and Simmons. They've got calluses on their 
fingers from pressing the reverse button on that VCR. Each time they see the 
same thing: "They're going to let their best player make plays," Hankwitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska's best player is Phillips, the semi-reluctant star. And so what if 
Phillips didn't ruin Hankwitz's lunch? He can do worse. He can ruin his 
Saturday. LAWRENCE PHILLIPS

IN A RUSH TO THE TOP; COLORADO'S SALAAM WENT FROM SMALL EIGHT AT LA JOLLA 
COUNTRY DAY TO BIG EIGHT'S BIG GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rashaan Salaam, the front-runner of the moment for the Heisman Trophy, is an 
unlikely candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager he sometimes spent two hours on a bus to get to a high school 
that was so small its football team competed in an eight-man division. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a college scholarship, he and his coach went on a publicity campaign 
with recruiters and the local press. 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman at Colorado, Salaam was so insulted when coaches suggested he 
redshirt that he openly talked about transferring. 
</P>
<P>
 He sat out the opener against Texas his sophomore season for disciplinary 
reasons and later bad-mouthed a teammate with whom he shared backfield duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salaam, a junior who recently turned 20, has persevered. He has gone from 
relative obscurity to a running back with such impressive numbers that he is 
being urged to make himself available for the NFL draft a year early. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention has become so overwhelming in recent weeks that Salaam is afraid 
to answer his telephone and often disguises his voice with callers he does not 
recognize. School officials have also stepped in, limiting interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rashaan does not revolve his schedule around the media," school spokesman 
Dave Plati said last week. "He has his own life and that's the way we're going 
to keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 It might be difficult for Salaam to maintain much of a private life if he has 
a productive outing Saturday when No. 2 Colorado (7-0) plays No. 3 Nebraska 
(8-0) at Lincoln, Neb., in a Big Eight Conference battle with national title 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, 6 feet 1 and 210 pounds, already leads the nation in rushing with 
1,256 yards, and an impressive performance against the Cornhuskers on national 
television should all but lock up the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm overwhelmed that I'm even considered the favorite," Salaam said this 
week. "I'm surprised my name is coming up because I don't see myself as a 
Heisman Trophy winner, I just see myself as a hard worker on a team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam grew up in San Diego. His father, Sultan Abdus-Salaam, formerly known 
as Teddy Washington, played running back at Colorado in 1963 before 
transferring to San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashaan played Pop Warner football as a youngster and hoped to make a name for 
himself at San Diego Lincoln High, a local power. But Khalada Salaam, Rashaan's 
mother who operates a private preparatory elementary school, wanted her son to 
get an education away from city life. 
</P>
<P>
 When he turned 13, Rashaan enrolled at La Jolla Country Day, a private school 
30 minutes from downtown San Diego with annual tuition of $8,500. He was so 
miserable there in the beginning that he often came home crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from being away from his childhood friends, Salaam, a black Muslim, felt 
out of place at a school with a student body of predominantly wealthy whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never forgot where I was from," he said. "I never considered myself from La 
Jolla." 
</P>
<P>
 With only 250 students, La Jolla Country Day competed in a football division 
with other small schools. Instead of 11 players on a team, the league played 
eight-man football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Eight-man football. What is this?' " Salaam said. "I was just so 
sad. I mean, I'm like a football-aholic." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Woods, La Jolla's coach and a former Big Ten quarterback at Minnesota, 
knew he had something special in Salaam and was not about to let him get away. 
Woods took a personal interest in his star player, often giving him rides to 
and from school and offering advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Because La Jolla Country Day was not a regular stop for local sportswriters or 
recruiters, Woods sent videotapes of Salaam to major colleges and begged 
reporters to take a look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a college athlete myself, so when I started promoting Rashaan I knew I 
was doing the right thing," Woods said. "This kid was big-time, and I wanted 
everyone else to know it. Eventually, people came around." 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam's numbers helped his cause. Despite sitting out the first half of his 
sophomore season because he was not old enough to compete on the varsity, 
Salaam rushed for 1,207 yards and 24 touchdowns in six games. La Jolla went 
undefeated his junior season as Salaam finished with 2,164 yards and 50 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he graduated, Salaam had gained 4,965 yards and scored 112 
touchdowns, setting numerous school and San Diego Section records. His 
statistics are even more impressive considering he sat out the second half of 
most games because of lopsided scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters took notice too. Many came calling, and Salaam initially selected 
California but changed his mind when Coach Bruce Snyder left for Arizona State. 
He eventually settled on Colorado after a visit over the holidays left him 
impressed with the wintry setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill McCartney, Colorado's coach, did not consider Salaam a risk despite the 
low level of high school competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't like we found a diamond in the rough," McCartney said. "Everyone 
knew who Rashaan was, so we were thrilled to get him. I never considered him a 
risk. I expected the things he's accomplished." 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado's offense was geared toward the pass when Salaam arrived in 1992, and 
McCartney already had a couple of veteran running backs. A nagging ankle injury 
also slowed Salaam, who was never higher than third on the depth chart. He 
finished the season with 158 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many freshmen, he was homesick and disappointed at his playing time. He 
was also impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't be moaning and groaning," Salaam said that fall. "Everything is 
going well. But I should have looked at (the college decision) more. My heart 
is with Cal." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of staying in Boulder and working out the summer after his freshman 
year, Salaam went home to San Diego to sort out his options. His mother 
persuaded him to stay at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about his following through on his commitment," she said. "He was 
going through normal things for his age, but I told him not to run away from 
his problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam returned and increased his playing time. He shared backfield duties 
with junior Lamont Warren and gained 844 yards in nine games. Despite sitting 
out the opener for giving police a false name after a liquor store incident, 
Salaam established himself as the main back by the end of the season, gaining 
135 yards in a victory over Fresno State in the Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting time with Warren was not easy for Salaam, who wanted to get the ball 
every down. Salaam said some unkind words about Warren to teammates and the 
gossip spread. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warren made himself available for the NFL draft a year early, the players 
parted on bad terms. "Some things did get back to me that really hurt my 
feelings," said Warren, who was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts. "I had tried 
to be a friend to Rashaan, offering a shoulder to lean on when needed. We 
haven't spoken since I left." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren's departure certainly helped Salaam, who has racked up impressive 
numbers against quality competition. His average of 179 yards per game is 21 
yards better than the nation's No. 2 rusher, Washington's Napoleon Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the first Colorado back to rush for more than 200 yards twice in the 
same season. His top performance was 317 yards in a 34-31 victory over Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this has been accomplished on a team that has another Heisman Trophy 
candidate. Quarterback Kordell Stewart, a senior, would probably be a 
front-runner if not for Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics, undefeated record and Heisman hype have led to a circus 
atmosphere for Salaam, who is trying to maintain some semblance of privacy. 
Friends have been calling to offer advice, and agents have been hounding him 
and his mother with promises of lucrative contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam has maintained all season that he will return to Colorado for his 
senior year, but he has begun to waver the last couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk about the draft at all," his mother said. "I think my son just 
wants to concentrate on the next four games and try to be as normal as 
possible. He has a good head on his shoulders and that is going to have to be 
enough. Some things are out of my control." RASHAAN SALAAM

JIM MURRAY: LEGALIZED MAYHEM ON FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since time immemorial, sports fans and entrepreneurs have been a bloodthirsty 
lot. Witness the Christians and the lions. Nero was the promoter of that Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know that the earliest boxing matches were to the death? Even as late 
as the turn of the century, they fought till one man was knocked out. No 
la-dee-dah split decisions for those fisticuff sporting types. A round ended 
only when one guy was knocked down. You never stopped a fight for something as 
wimpy as a cut eye or a three-knockdown rule. No doctor at ringside, just the 
coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the sport of choice is pro football. Lots of blood and guts. Stretchers 
and ambulances on the ready. Only auto racing and ice hockey approach it in 
mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball is getting rougher and rougher. Baseball is losing favor because 
nobody is losing consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Sam Goldwyn used to say, "Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist needs to 
have his head examined." Well, anybody who plays quarterback in the NFL today 
does too. Sam might say, "Anybody who plays quarterback has a hole in his 
head." Or soon will. 
</P>
<P>
 Take last Sunday: Reports show that Troy Aikman, Vinny Testaverde and Chris 
Miller all had to leave their games because of concussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "concussion" has a nice, euphemistic ring to it. "Getting your bell 
rung," is a nice alternate description for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts of the matter are, any damage to the brain is no laughing matter. 
Brain cells are irreplaceable. You can't put a splint on the brain. A nosebleed 
might not be serious. A brain bleed is. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you will recall Roger Staubach's retirement was hastened by repeated 
concussive blows to the head. And that Chicago Bear running back Merrill Hoge 
took early retirement last week after his doctor told him one more blow to the 
head could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 A concussion is serious enough that the victim temporarily (or hopefully 
temporarily) has no clear idea who he is or where he's at. That's not a very 
encouraging indication. You will remember in the film, "Requiem for a 
Heavyweight," the manager (Jackie Gleason) asks his fighter, Mountain Rivera, 
where he thinks he is and the fighter answers "I'm in Pittsburgh and it's 
raining." 
</P>
<P>
 Fresco Thompson used to ask prospects, torn between a career in football or 
baseball, "What do you want, kid? A career -- or a limp?" Well, even a limp 
might be preferable to a permanent ringing in the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, football is a game of intimidation. And has to be taught as 
such. You may remember, many years ago, the league found one team had kind of 
an office pool where the money collected went to the player who "got" the 
quarterback, i.e., made him limp off or ride off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting that Aikman left the field Sunday probably thinking he was in 
Pittsburgh and it was raining after a linebacker, Wilber Marshall, slammed him 
in the face and mouth with his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmets today are plastic head coverings that, like the iron hats of medieval 
knights, are designed to spare the brain. But they are also weapons. They were 
used for a tactic known as "spearing" in which the defensive player would 
launch his helmet, which was about the tensile strength of a cannonball, into 
any vulnerable position of the guy with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching staffs didn't exactly teach it. Neither did they discourage it. But 
the league made it illegal. They didn't want to bring body bags into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has always defended itself from charges it was sponsoring legalized 
mayhem by pointing out that the object in football was not to hurt but to 
score. In boxing the object is to hurt, maybe, unfortunately, to kill. In 
football, the idea was to score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, on the way to a touchdown, you had to destroy someone in your 
path. And to get a touchdown, first you had to get the ball. You did this by 
hitting the quarterback so hard you made him too fearful to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting that the coach of the team that made Aikman, so to speak, 
forget himself is Buddy Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Ryan is probably the game's most enthusiastic advocate of what has come 
to be known as "smash-mouth football." I mean, Nero would have loved him. Ryan 
doesn't want you to die for dear old Siwash, he wants you to kill for dear old 
Siwash. Like General Patton, he believes in letting the other poor slob die for 
his side. "Motivation" can sometimes be confused with what they call in boxing, 
"the killer instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 The helmet is so lethal it should probably have a spike on top of it like the 
Kaiser's. What's to be done about it? No one seems to know. They beefed up 
scoring by shortening kickoffs and penalizing field goals, but their real 
problem may be not to get more touchdowns but to get fewer concussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks may be as defenseless as the Christians. Football players, like 
dinosaurs and finned Cadillacs, may be getting too big for the environment. 
Getting smashed into by 300-pound, 6-foot-7 linemen is something less than 
humane, but the official party line was voiced by linebacker Jack Lambert some 
years ago when protection for quarterbacks was first broached. "Let 'em wear 
skirts," sneered Lambert. As if protecting the body's computer, the brain, was 
somehow unmanly. 
</P>
<P>
 How many concussions is a Super Bowl worth? Aikman has had three concussions 
and two Super Bowls. The price is not right. Sam Goldwyn was right. He needs to 
have his head examined.

FRANK THOMAS PERFORMS AN ENCORE AS AL MVP; BASEBALL: WHITE SOX SLUGGER WHO 
CHASED TRIPLE CROWN IS THE FIRST REPEAT WINNER SINCE MARIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The players' strike might have deprived Frank Thomas of the opportunity to 
become the first winner of the Triple Crown since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967, but 
it did not prevent the Chicago White Sox first baseman from obtaining a 
milestone of comparable significance. 
</P>
<P>
 In results announced Wednesday, Thomas was voted the American League's most 
valuable player by a committee of the Baseball Writers Assn. of America, 
becoming the 11th player to win the award in consecutive years and the first in 
the American League since Roger Maris in 1960 and '61. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the shorter season diminished the accomplishment, Thomas said it was 
even sweeter the second time, although he "hated to see the season end like it 
did because I was having a career year. I felt like I was in a groove all year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, I got a full season award last year," he said. "If this was my 
first, maybe I couldn't have lived it down, but I thought my stats were 
deserving. I thought they were reflective of a full season." 
</P>
<P>
 A unanimous winner last year, Thomas received 24 of 28 first-place votes and 
372 points. Ken Griffey Jr., the Seattle Mariner center fielder who led the 
league with 40 home runs and hit .323, got three first-place votes and 233 
points to finish second. Albert Belle of the Cleveland Indians was third, and 
teammate Kenny Lofton, who received the other first-place vote, was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, known as the Big Hurt, dominated the league's offensive statistics. He 
was third in batting at .353, second in home runs with 38 and tied for third in 
runs batted in with 101. He led the majors with a .487 on-base percentage and 
led the league with a .729 slugging average. He also led the league in runs and 
walks while striking out only 61 times in 399 at bats. He is the only player in 
major league history to hit .300 or more with 100 RBIs, 20 homers, 100 walks 
and 100 runs in each of his first four full seasons, reaching those levels in 
1994 despite appearing in only 113 games because of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he was not too upset over missing out on the Triple Crown but that 
it remains a goal he is confident he can obtain. His MVP carried a contract 
bonus of $100,000, and Thomas said, "I'll take whatever comes. The strike is 
tough on everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 His 1994 salary was $2.5 million. It jumps to $7.15 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (owner) Jerry Reinsdorf he wouldn't be overpaying me," Thomas said. "A 
two-time MVP deserves to be paid more than everybody else." A COMPARISON WITH 
OTHER BASEBALL GREATS

 All that remains of Forbes Field in Pittsburgh is the outfield wall, and it's 
a gathering place for baseball zealots who make a pilgrimage to the site each

to beat the New York Yankees in the World Series.

 "Fans took peanuts and popcorn, tapes of the game, original programs and other 
memorabilia to the anniversary celebration," writes Beth E. Trapani of the

PGA'S TOP EARNERS GET CHANCE TO STRIKE IT RICHER; GOLF: PRICE, NORMAN HEAD 
FIELD OF 30 LEADING MONEY-WINNERS IN $3-MILLION TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP AT OLYMPIC 
CLUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's late October and that means the thoughts of the professional golfers 
gathered here under the stately Cypress trees at the venerable Olympic Club are 
turning to . . . well, what? 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween? Four-foot par putts? Vacation?  
</P>
<P>
 Nope, they're here for the money, and lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some $3 million at stake in the PGA Tour Championship. You don't even 
have to know how to spell PGA to know that's a lot. A mere $540,000 goes to the 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 So here is the format. Beginning today, the top 30 players on this year's PGA 
Tour money list tee it up for money and the glory of a tournament title. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's top two millionaires, Nick Price ($1.4 million) and Greg Norman 
($1.2 million) head a field that includes 12 who have won more than $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of an embarrassment of riches, even for this elite group. All 30 of 
the players entered have won more than $1 million in their careers, led by Tom 
Kite's $9.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's only official PGA Tour earnings, not including money from 
endorsements, special events or any earned on any other tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe these players weren't born with silver spoons in their mouths, but it 
looks as if they've got an entire place setting in there right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Gallagher Jr. won the 1993 tournament after shooting 277 at the Olympic 
Club. But he didn't come back this time, mainly because winning once doesn't 
earn you an invitation to the next one. 
</P>
<P>
 In this tournament, you're only as good as your bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 46 official PGA Tour events, but none of them are richer than this 
one. At least there is a good chance that these guys are going to have to earn 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic's Lake Course is 6,800 yards of straightforward golf. Designed by 
Sam Whiting and Wilfrid Reid in 1924, there is no water, no out of bounds and 
no fairway bunkers except for one on the sixth hole. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also no way anybody is going to kill it if the wind blows off the 
ocean, which it tends to do because the course is only about a good five-iron 
from the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of my favorite courses," said Fred Couples, who earned $577,354 
even though he played only 13 events. "Accuracy is very important here, length 
isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Price and Norman, who seem to be tournament favorites wherever they play, 
might have scooped some of the tournament publicity when Norman announced that 
he and Price are going to team up. For money, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said he and Price are going to challenge two-man teams from the rest of 
the world in a series of televised $1-million, winner-take-all tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman said the first event will be played in February in the Bahamas, which 
would conflict with regularly scheduled PGA Tour events, including such West 
Coast tournaments as the Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem, who said the tour intends to protect its 
tournaments from competing special events, vowed to try to work out any 
potential scheduling conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, any new conflicts ought to involve players vs. golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Els, the U.S. Open champion, won $624,440 in 10 tournaments and is 
getting his first look at the Lake Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Els was back home in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week and arrived here 
Monday night. He played practice rounds Tuesday and Wednesday at the Lake 
Course, which will be the site of the 1998 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I'll have a warm-up here this week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like everybody else, it'll be worth his while. Last place gets $48,000.

sport? 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the 31 entries for this week's Winston Select Finals at Pomona Fairplex 
in top fuel dragster, the sport's premier class, are 50 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 The list includes five of the favorites -- Don Prudhomme, Kenny Bernstein, Joe 
Amato, Connie Kalitta and Eddie Hill, last year's National Hot Rod Assn. 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 58, is the oldest. He is winless this season but was the No. 1 qualifier 
at Indianapolis with a 4.762-second elapsed time before losing in the finals to 
Kalitta. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta, 56, is the father of 1994 champion Scott Kalitta and is himself a 
three-time winner this season at Gainesville, Fla., Atlanta and Indianapolis, 
where he won the U.S. Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudhomme, 53, won last Sunday's NHRA meet at Dallas for a record 49th victory 
in nitromethene-powered dragsters. It was the fourth victory this season for 
the Snake, who won his first Winston Final (then the World Finals) in 1975 at 
Ontario Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, 50, has bettered 300 m.p.h. in his last six national events, with a 
top speed of 307.80 m.p.h. Sept. 18 at Reading, Pa., and has been No. 1 
qualifier at four events, but has yet to win a final round this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Amato, 50, has won a record five top fuel championships and was a winner last 
August in Seattle. He holds the Winston Finals record of 302.21 m.p.h. set last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 All five also will be in the Budweiser Top Fuel Classic, an eight-driver 
shootout scheduled Saturday for a $50,000 first prize. The other entries -- 
based on qualifying points earned in the previous 17 events -- are Shelly 
Anderson, 28; Cory McClenathan, 31, and Scott Kalitta, 32. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kalittas ran the quickest side-by-side top fuel race in NHRA history at 
Houston, with Scott edging his father, 4.748 to 4.788 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the over-50 set include Gary Beck, 53, 1983 world champion 
and two-time Winston Final winner; Clayton Harris, 55; Bruce Larson, 56; Jim 
Murphy, 52, and Jack Ostrander, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualifying for the 30th Winston Finals in professional categories will start 
at 1:30 today. Another session Friday and two more Saturday, at 10:30 a.m. and 
2:30 p.m., will set the 16-car fields for Sunday's eliminations. The event is 
the 18th and last of a $16-million championship series that began at Pomona 
last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kalitta, in top fuel, and John Force, in funny car, have already 
clinched the $150,000 championship bonus in their classes, but the $100,000 pro 
stock title will be decided at Pomona between Darrell Alderman and Scott 
Geoffrion, teammates in Wayne County Mopar Dodges. 
</P>
<P>
 Alderman, the 1990-91 champion who was suspended for two years for using 
drugs, has a 578-point lead over Geoffrion with 1,200 points at stake Sunday. 
Geoffrion defeated Alderman in last Sunday's final round at Dallas for his 
sixth victory. Alderman has four. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the man to beat in the pro stock final round may be Oldsmobile driver 
Warren Johnson, who has won the last four Pomona events. That's 16 consecutive 
eliminations. He has not lost there since the 1992 Winternationals. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the three major championships, Winston series champions will be 
determined for pro stock motorcycle and seven sportsman categories. 
</P>
<P>

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 Bob Miller cleaned his swimming pool cover, washed and waxed his car and took 
a two-mile walk in Woodland Hills on Wednesday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 He would much rather have been in Tampa preparing for the scheduled Prime 
Ticket telecast of the King-Lightning game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What really bothers me about the lockout is that both sides aren't in a room 
every day for 10 or 12 hours trying to hammer this thing out," said Miller, the 
voice of the Kings for the last 21 years. "I don't care about posturing or 
negotiating protocol. I just say get in a room and settle it. Nobody is making 
a move and it's utterly ridiculous." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was eager to return to work about mid-August. The Kings didn't make the 
Stanley Cup playoffs last season and his postseason assignments were limited to 
three games for ESPN2. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what I saw of the Kings in the exhibition games," he said. "This is a 
bigger, stronger team. Matt Johnson was becoming a huge fan favorite at the 
Forum. He's only 18 years old, but he's not afraid to stand up and hit people." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick Tocchet is going to be popular too. He's a tough winger who can score. 
He's an outstanding team player. I compare him, personality-wise, to Terry 
Ruskowski. 'What do you want me to do? I'll do anything,' he says." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The question remains when Tocchet, who came to the Kings from Pittsburgh in 
the Luc Robitaille deal, will be able to play his first regular-season game at 
the Forum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep reading about players who want to play in the International League or 
in Europe and say that it's not the money, it's just that they want to play," 
Miller said. "Well, if that's the case, they should call Bob Goodenow and say 
sign an agreement and let's play. Why would you want to play in the IHL for 
$2,000 a game instead of in the NHL for $1 million a year?" . . .

 Hundred-Yard Harvey Williams figures to stay busy Sunday at the Coliseum when 
the Raiders play the Houston Oilers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among AFC teams, only the Indianapolis Colts have given up more yards rushing 
than the Oilers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, only the Pittsburgh Steelers have given up fewer yards passing 
than the Oilers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no justice if Lynn Swann, who was a finalist last year, isn't 
voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 June Jones, the former quarterback who coaches the Atlanta Falcons, says 
playing center is the toughest job in football. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten Colorado vs. unbeaten Nebraska on Saturday at Lincoln is billed as a 
battle of running backs, Rashaan Salaam of the Buffaloes and Lawrence Phillips 
of the Cornhuskers, but the difference might be at quarterback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado has Kordell Stewart, who ranks fifth in the nation in pass 
efficiency. Nebraska has Brook Berringer, who would be stuck on the bench if 
Tommie Frazier hadn't been injured. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was wrong about Bobby Bowden leaving Florida State for the NFL years ago but 
am convinced that Terry Bowden won't stay at Auburn much longer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It will be UCLA vs. Stanford in three sports Saturday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The women's soccer teams play at 10 a.m. at the North Soccer Field on the 
Bruin campus, the water polo teams at noon at the Rose Bowl aquatic center, and 
the football teams at 3:30 at the Rose Bowl. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 California Cup officials should think about moving their $1-million series of 
nine races to an earlier date when it doesn't conflict with the Breeders' Cup. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Cup V at Santa Anita this Saturday lost much of its marquee value when the 
owners of Best Pal and Bertrando opted to run them, instead, in Breeders' Cup 
XI at Churchill Downs on Nov. 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford Whaler General Manager Jim Rutherford claims his franchise will lose 
between $8 million and $10 million if there is an NHL season -- and $6 million 
if there isn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former San Francisco Giant scout George Genovese will manage one of the teams 
in the benefit exhibition games between professional and collegiate players 
Saturday and Sunday at 1:15 p.m. at Blair Field in Long Beach. Few people have 
a better eye for talent than Genovese, who would be a great hire. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan's No. 23 will be retired by the Chicago Bulls their new home 
arena, the United Center, in ceremonies next week. But that doesn't mean they 
can't bring it down from the rafters if he decides to play again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about the ultimate home-field advantage -- the Miami Dolphins could 
become the first team to play a Super Bowl game at their home field Jan. 29, 
1995, at Joe Robbie Stadium.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; THEY WON'T GIVE MCNAIR LIBERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alcorn State and the Liberty Bowl can say, "Pretty please," all they want, but 
the NCAA is not going to allow the Division I-AA team and its Heisman Trophy 
candidate, quarterback Steve McNair, to play in the Dec. 31 game. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were up to Liberty Bowl officials, Alcorn would receive an invitation to 
face either East Carolina or hometown Memphis. It makes sense: McNair's 
presence would sell lots of tickets; it would give television viewers an actual 
reason to watch the game and it could provide the struggling bowl a unique 
regional matchup, what with Alcorn in neighboring Mississippi and the 
possibility of Memphis as the other team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love to have him," Liberty Bowl spokesman Chris Bork said. "He's a great 
player. But it's not going to happen. The NCAA won't allow it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the NCAA requires bowl teams to have at least six victories 
against Division I-A teams. Alcorn plays exclusively in Division I-AA. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's dead," Alcorn Coach Cardell Jones said. "We're just 
hoping and praying the NCAA will sanction it and let us go." 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Bowl representatives contacted the NCAA about an exception to the rule 
but didn't receive much encouragement. Jones said Alcorn might make a similar 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 If the NCAA doesn't change its mind--and it won't--Alcorn and McNair will have 
to hope for an at-large bid to the Division I-AA playoffs or an invitation to 
the Division I-AA Heritage Bowl in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather play in the Liberty Bowl," Jones said, "because of the exposure 
and because this is something that hasn't been done in the history of college 
football. I think it would be great for Steve to play against a Division I-A 
ballclub before he graduates." 
</P>
<P>
 We'd love to see McNair get his moment, too, but for the NCAA to change the 
rule for Alcorn would be unfair to every Division I-A program that wins those 
six required games. HELPFUL GRAPHICS 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case any of the Associated Press voters covering last Saturday night's 
Kansas State-Colorado game needed a reminder, the Folsom Field scoreboard 
operator offered a not-so-subtle ballot hint. Read the huge screen at the 
conclusion of Colorado's 35-21 victory: 
</P>
<P>
 1 Penn State Is Idle  
</P>
<P>
 In other words: We played. We won. We deserve No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 The voters weren't swayed, but Kansas State might have been. The Wildcats have 
played Nebraska, the former No. 1, and Colorado in successive weeks and limped 
away from each defeat thinking they could have won each game. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they lost to the Cornhuskers by 11 and the Buffaloes by 14. So who 
wins when No. 2-ranked Colorado travels to No. 3 Nebraska on Saturday? 
</P>
<P>
 The vote is nearly unanimous: the Buffaloes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have so many weapons and with (Cornhusker quarterback) Tommie Frazier 
out, that negates Nebraska's whole plan," Kansas State strong safety Chuck 
Marlowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Colorado will win," wide receiver Tyson Schwieger said. "It will be a 
great game. I think offensively, they are a lot better than Nebraska was." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder: "If Nebraska has some balance in their 
offense, they have a chance. I don't know who is the better team. A week ago I 
would have said Colorado. Right now, I think Colorado has great balance and 
they can be as good as any team in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 We have mixed feelings about picking Colorado. You would too if you heard 
Buffalo quarterback Kordell Stewart make the following offer: "If we come out 
with a big win, I'll kiss all of you (reporters)." THE ANSWER MAN 
</P>
<P>
 College football's three most-asked questions: 
</P>
<P>
 --When will UCLA drop to Division I-AA? 
</P>
<P>
 --Who's No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
 --When will there be a national playoff? 
</P>
<P>
 For now, we'll concentrate on the playoff issue, mostly because UCLA is beyond 
help and Penn State is No. 1 . . . this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by ABC's John Saunders if they supported a playoff, Colorado Coach Bill 
McCartney and Auburn Coach Terry Bowden offered some fresh views on the 
subject. Misguided, but fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden, who coached on the Division I-AA level before arriving at Auburn two 
seasons ago, has seen how a 16-team national playoff tournament works and he 
didn't like it. True, one champion is decided on the field, but Bowden said 
there always were questions and complaints about the selection and seeding 
process. In other words, a controversial title--even with the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney, whose team split a national championship in 1990 with Georgia Tech, 
favors a 16-team playoff, but with a selection twist. He wants a media panel to 
choose four teams from each of the four major regions of the country and then 
let the playoff begin, like the NCAA basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a nice thought, except for one teensy-weensy problem: What happens if 
there aren't four teams in a region worthy of selection? Take this season as an 
example: 
</P>
<P>
 East--Penn State, Syracuse, Virginia Tech, Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 South--Duke, Florida, Alabama, Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Midwest--Colorado, Nebraska, Texas, Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 West--Arizona, Utah, Brigham Young and, uh, the San Diego Chargers? 
</P>
<P>
 If McCartney wants it like the Final Four, then Auburn, Washington and Texas 
A&M--all on NCAA probation--wouldn't be eligible. And if McCartney really wants 
a playoff, then he first has to persuade the folks on the NCAA's powerful 
Presidents Commission that the tournament would be worth the trouble. Fat 
chance. This past summer the Commission disbanded the NCAA special committee 
formed to study such a playoff. THE CHECK'S IN THE MAIL 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's nothing . . . but nearly two months after their appearance in the 
Pigskin Classic, Fresno State and Ohio State have yet to receive full payment 
for playing in the Aug. 29 game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Don Andersen, whose Orange County Sports Assn. cuts the checks, 
the OCSA has up to 90 days to pay participating teams. In this case, Fresno 
State and Ohio State are due a minimum of $500,000 each, more if ticket sales 
exceeded a certain level (which they didn't). The two schools then keep a 
percentage of the payout and share the rest with their respective leagues, the 
Western Athletic Conference and the Big Ten Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 No dummies, the Buckeyes insisted on and received an up-front payment of 
$250,000 in August. Doug Clay, Ohio State's business manager, said he is 
awaiting the rest of the payout but added that he won't officially get nervous 
until Feb. 15, the school's deadline for accounts to be settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fresno State hasn't seen a penny, said Les Snyder, the Bulldogs' 
assistant athletic director in charge of business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we played in the (1992) Freedom Bowl (also operated by the OCSA), we 
didn't have any problem at all," Snyder said. "We were taken care of very 
quickly. But in the Pigskin, we haven't had that same (cooperation). We just 
weren't taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 A possible sticking point: Fresno, which brought about 15,000 fans to the 
Freedom Bowl, pledged to do the same for the Pigskin. Instead, only 7,000 
Bulldog supporters bought tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said Fresno is willing to wait for its money. Actually, he doesn't have 
much choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a problem--right now," he said. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Selection Day for the bowl coalition is Dec. 4. The most likely matchups: (our 
picks in boldface) Rose--Penn State vs. Arizona; Orange--Colorado or Nebraska 
vs. Miami or Florida State; Fiesta--Notre Dame vs. Nebraska or Colorado; 
Freedom--Brigham Young vs. Washington State or Oregon, if the Ducks can win two 
of their final four games; Citrus--Michigan vs. Alabama; Holiday--Utah vs. 
Illinois or Ohio State. . . . In what must be a Heisman candidate first, 
Colorado junior running back Rashaan Salaam, who leads the NCAA in rushing 
(1,256 yards), says he wants no part of the famed trophy. "I'm scared, man," 
said Salaam, who is wavering about returning to Boulder for his senior season. 
"I really don't want to win it because I know how much pressure is going to be 
put on me." If he had a Heisman vote, Salaam said he would cast it for his 
buddy Napoleon Kaufman of Washington or Alcorn State's McNair. Colorado wide 
receiver Michael Westbrook wasn't buying it. "He wants to win it, but he has to 
tell himself that he has higher goals," he said. . . . Let's say only three 
Pacific 10 Conference teams--Arizona, Washington State and USC--get the 
required six Division I-A victories for a bowl appearance. If Arizona goes to 
the Rose and the bowl coalition somehow chooses Washington State, then the 
Freedom Bowl gets the Pac-10's No. 3 team, the Trojans, right? Uh, no. Because 
USC wanted a no-repeat rule, the Freedom would have to go outside the Pac-10 
for both of its teams. . . . Take it for the rumor it is, but former Auburn 
coach Pat Dye might be considering a return to the sidelines. With Georgia's 
Ray Goff struggling, Dye's name continues to surface. Dye played at Georgia, is 
close friends with Athletic Director Vince Dooley and his wife Barbara and 
recently retired his position at Auburn as special assistant to the president. 
So he's available, but don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Who says UCLA isn't competitive? If the Bruins remain in the Pac-10 cellar, 
they will become only the fourth team since World War II to go from first to 
last in their league. The three others: Arizona in 1965, Kansas in 1969 and 
Stanford in 1993. . . . Breakfast at Lincoln? Because ABC waved money and 
because Nebraska--or so says Colorado Athletic Director Bill Marolt--had the 
final say and agreed to the change, kickoff for Saturday's game at Lincoln 
begins at 11 a.m., which is earlier than some cartoon shows. Said McCartney: 
"I'm not excited about playing morning football, but they do it at Wimbledon, 
why shouldn't we? I don't like morning football. I'd rather play at midnight." 
Memo to Bill: Matches at Wimbledon don't begin until early afternoon. Also, 
don't say that midnight stuff too loud. The networks are listening. . . . If 
Michigan State President M. Peter McPherson was serious about Coach George 
Perles having to have "an outstanding season"--or else--then Perles is 
officially cooked after last Saturday's loss to a dreadful Iowa team. Michigan 
State is 2-5 overall and 1-3 in the Big Ten. Top 10

FORD'S KICKING HAS IMPACT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: MORE OFTEN THAN NOT, SENIOR'S

 Nine times, right on the sweet spot.  
</P>
<P>
 That's where Cole Ford kept putting his right foot Saturday in USC's 61-0 
victory over California.  
</P>
<P>
 All his kickoffs went into the middle or rear of the end zone, or beyond it. 
Not one was returned by Cal's Tyrone Edwards, the Pacific 10 Conference's 
leading kickoff returner. 
</P>
<P>
 And where is the sweet spot on a regulation NCAA football?  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just about two inches below the center line," said Ford, a senior who 
hopes to continue his career in the NFL. "A football has a sweet spot, just 
like a baseball bat, or a golf club. When I get my foot on it, I know it right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 During his USC career, exactly half of Ford's 160 kickoffs have been returned. 
This season, only 16 of 38 have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's phenomenal," Coach John Robinson said. "Usually when we kick off, I look 
first to see if we're offside, then I watch the wedge the opponent is forming. 
But lately I find myself watching Cole's ball going through the air and saying: 
'Wow!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking coach Jeff Kearin puts a stopwatch on each of Ford's kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "His hang time is consistently between 4.0 and 4.2 seconds," he said. "Average 
for a kickoff would be about 3.8. He really gets height on his ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Can a kicker find work in the NFL solely as a kickoff man?  
</P>
<P>
 Brad Daluiso, the former UCLA kicker, has with the New York Giants. Although 
he is also used as a long field-goal kicker, he's the only kicker, according to 
the NFL, used primarily on kickoffs. Only 15 of his 28 kickoffs this season 
have been returned.  
</P>
<P>
 Pro clubs are taking longer looks at college kickoff specialists this year, 
because the league is kicking off from the 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teams will consider carrying a kickoff specialist, if they can get a 
real good one," said Bob Ackles, assistant general manager of the Arizona 
Cardinals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Moving the kickoff back five yards, that's changed a lot of thinking. 
Ideally, though, you'd still like a kickoff guy who can put it in the end zone 
to also kick field goals for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kearin: "A couple of NFL scouts have told me their clubs would carry a 
kickoff specialist if he could put it in the end zone every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, 6 feet 2 and 195 pounds, has made seven of 10 field-goal attempts this 
season and ranks fifth among Pac-10 kickers. But among the top 10 conference 
kickers, all but one have more attempts than Ford.  
</P>
<P>
 USC's offense has played so efficiently lately that Ford hasn't been asked to 
kick many. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cole has established himself as a great kickoff kicker, but he hasn't yet 
established himself as a great field-goal kicker," Kearin said. "I think he is 
a great field-goal kicker, and I think he'll prove that in a situation where he 
has to kick a lot of field goals. He just hasn't had to here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has made 27 of 48 field-goal attempts at USC, his longest a 41-yard kick 
at Stanford in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Most disappointing miss? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a freshman, we were down three to Stanford on the last play and I 
missed a 45-yarder, wide right by a foot," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Both his USC coaches, first Larry Smith and now Robinson, have encouraged him, 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I missed that field goal against Stanford, Smith came up to me right 
away and told me it was a great try, that it shouldn't have been up to me 
anyway.  
</P>
<P>
 "And the first time I met Robinson, we talked in his office about mental 
preparation. He told me to understand that I would miss some field goals, but 
that the important thing would be to forget it, to get my mind together, and 
prepare to make the next one." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford sat out seven games last season because of a stress fracture in his back 
and made only two of six field-goal attempts. He had 20 attempts in his 
sophomore season, his busiest at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is a graduate of kicking specialist Ray Pelfry's summer camps. A former 
Green Bay Packer and New York Giant punter, Pelfry has taught thousands of 
kickers at camps in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cole has a big-time pro leg," Pelfry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a college kicking specialist required a psychological adjustment for 
Ford, who played wide receiver and defensive back at Sabino High in Tucson.  
</P>
<P>
 At a college football practice, kickers appear to be only part-time members of 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, their practice time occurs before and after the rest of the team is 
on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "A kicker can get lonely out there, especially if you missed a couple of field 
goals in the last game," Ford said. "You're more sensitive to what people 
think. You have a feeling that you let your teammates down, even though no one 
says anything. In high school, I could contribute in other ways if I missed, 
because I played offense and defense."

<P>
 The theme of USC's 1995 preseason training camp has been set: 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Present backup Brad Otton and Kyle Wachholtz will work to become Rob Johnson's 
successor.Johnson, a three-season starter, will graduate in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton is a 6-foot-6 sophomore who has filled in impressively while Johnson 
recovered from a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachholtz, a 6-5 junior, was expected to be Johnson's backup this season. But 
Otton transferred from Weber State last spring and Wachholtz was declared 
academically ineligible for this season.

 Tony Boselli, a senior offensive tackle who received an $18,000 postgraduate 
fellowship this week by the National Football Foundation and College Hall of 
Fame, said he would use the grant for graduate school after a pro career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get an MBA, something like that," he said. "It's a great honor and I'm 
really thrilled about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Boselli, one of nine recipients announced Monday, is the ninth USC player to 
be so honored. The last was John Jackson in 1989. EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; CAN STANFORD GET JUMP ON LAWRENCE?

<P>
 Only a week after having to deal with Arizona receiver Richard Dice, who is 6 
feet 2, UCLA's Teddy Lawrence will be looking up again on Saturday. Make that 
farther up, at 6-6 Justin Armour, Stanford's leading receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, a 5-9 cornerback, struggled with Dice, particularly on an eight-yard 
touchdown pass in the second quarter. Lawrence never had a chance on a 
perfectly thrown ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really the only place where the receiver has an advantage on me: at 
the goal line," he said. "Any other place, I'm all right because I'm faster. If 
he gets a good jump and I get a good jump, he's going to get the ball because 
he's taller. But if his jump is just OK, I can deal with it."

 Wes Bender always wanted to be a fullback. Wanted it so bad, in fact, that he 
transferred from Burbank High to Burroughs rather than switch from fullback to 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender, 24, is still a fullback. And Wednesday, after subsequent stops at 
Glendale College, USC and the Kansas City Chiefs, Bender officially joined his 
hometown team, the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys native was promoted from the practice squad after fullback Jarrod 
Bunch was waived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are expected to sign the 5-foot-10, 235-pound Bender, a blocking 
specialist, to a two-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hard work finally paid off," said Bender, who started 10 games for the 
Trojans in his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender joined the Raiders as a free agent last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tremendous blocker," Coach Art Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bender will back up fullback Tom Rathman and also play on special teams.

FIFA PLAN COULD HELP U.S. IN CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The presidents of the six continental confederations of FIFA, soccer's 
international governing body, agreed Wednesday to a division of expanded World 
Cup berths that seemed to satisfy almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Their plan, which will be voted upon today by FIFA's Executive Committee, 
allocates the extra eight places for France '98 as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Europe: two extra places for a total of 15, including host France, which 
automatically qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- South America: one extra place for a total of five, including defending 
champion Brazil, which automatically qualifies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Africa: two extra places for a total of five. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Asia: one extra place for a total of three. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CONCACAF: one extra place for a total of three. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth place will go to the winner of a home-and-home playoff between Asia 
and Oceania. 
</P>
<P>
 As a possible alternative, the confederation presidents suggested that Africa 
be awarded one extra place, with the other going to the winner of a playoff 
between Africa and CONCACAF, the North and Central American and Caribbean 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, what will emerge is that when the first 32-team World Cup is held 
there are sure to be some countries that have never before qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the United States' chances of qualifying will be greatly enhanced 
if CONCACAF gets three places. 
</P>
<P>
 The Executive Committee could reject both plans today and come up with one of 
its own, but that is considered unlikely.

BREEDERS' CUP; 124 PRE-ENTRIES BREAK RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There may be a horse shortage, but the 11th Breeders' Cup will not reflect it. 
When pre-entries were announced Wednesday, a record 124 horses were made 
eligible for the seven races at Churchill Downs a week from Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout broke the Breeders' Cup record of 116 set in 1991, when the races 
were last run at Churchill Downs. There was such a stampede to compete this 
year that six of the races were oversubscribed, which has resulted in 
also-eligible lists of horses that can run only if there are defections from 
the 14-horse fields. 
</P>
<P>
 With 14 horses likely to run in six races and 11 fillies and mares pre-entered 
in the Distaff, the record will probably be broken for number of starters. The 
most horses that ran in a Breeders' Cup has been 92 -- six short of capacity -- 
at Gulfstream Park in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping break the pre-entry record were the European horse owners, who paid 
preliminary fees ranging from $10,000 to $30,000 to make 31 horses eligible. 
Five of those horses, despite limited or no experience running on dirt, will be 
in the richest race of the $10-million day, the $3-million Classic. Pre-entry 
and entry fees cost 2% of each race's total purse, and the second payment is 
due when entries are drawn Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost considerably more for six others to run, as their owners supplemented 
horses not nominated. That was the most since there were eight supplementaries 
in 1985. It's costing Bertrando and Best Pal $360,000 apiece to run in the 
Classic, and $120,000 is being paid per horse for Cherokee Run, Exclusive 
Praline and Soviet Problem in the Sprint and for Post It in the Juvenile 
Fillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, the horse Breeders' Cup officials would have most liked to see 
supplemented, will spend the day in his barn at Gulfstream Park. Holy Bull, who 
could become the first horse-of-the-year champion not to run in the Breeders' 
Cup since Criminal Type in 1990, wasn't made eligible via a $500 payment the 
year he was foaled, and his owner-trainer, Jimmy Croll, declined to pay the 
$360,000 supplement for the Classic. Holy Bull's victory in the Woodward at 
Belmont Park last month was his eighth in 10 starts this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that we'll miss Holy Bull," said D.G. Van Clief Jr., 
executive director of the Breeders' Cup. "But there's hardly been a year where 
we haven't missed some important horse. We've lost a star, but the Breeders' 
Cup is not a one-race event, and we're fortunate that we have star quality 
across the board in all the races to make up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 European horses have been beating one another all year, and Tony Morris, the 
British journalist, has not been enthralled by what he has seen of the English 
group. "I would not wager as much as a $2 bill on any of the mooted contenders 
from Britain," Morris wrote last week, "because the likelihood is that none of 
them is going to be good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcangues Factor, cited by Van Clief, is probably the biggest reason for 
the sizable European pre-entry. A year ago, the 5-year-old French-raced horse 
with a chronic back problem entered the Classic with two victories in two 
years. Arcangues overhauled Bertrando in the stretch, won by two lengths and 
paid $269.20 for $2, a Breeders' Cup record. After Arcangues, the Europeans are 
saying, anything is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Fabre, who trained Arcangues, is back with another Classic contender in 
Dernier Empereur, who ran last at Santa Anita last year in the Breeders' Cup 
Turf. The 1 1/4-mile Classic is more suited than the 1 1/2-mile Turf for a 
horse with Dernier Empereur's staying power, and the 4-year-old son of Arc de 
Triomphe winner Trempolino will make his dirt debut at Churchill Downs after 
wearing down Grand Lodge by a nose in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket, 
England, on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Lodge is also expected to run in the Classic, along with Europeans 
Ezzoud, Flag Down and Millkom. Ezzoud, who has earned $1.1 million, was seventh 
at Santa Anita a year ago in his only start on dirt, and Flag Down tried the 
main track for the first time this month when he was third, behind Colonial 
Affair and Devil His Due, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway will miss the Distaff because of a lung infection. . . . 
Birdonthewire, winless in six starts this year, still got into the Sprint while 
four California horses -- Saratoga Gambler, Concept Win, D'Hallevant and 
Uncaged Fury -- won't run unless there are defections among the 14 who 
qualified. . . . Joe Burnham, 73, an Eclipse Award-winning cinematographer and 
film historian, died Monday at Arcadia Methodist Hospital. Burnham suffered a 
stroke on Oct. 16. Burnham, who lived in Sierra Madre, requested that there be 
no services.

JUSTICE FOR A FRIEND 5 OF DEMOCRACY; THREE S. AFRICANS ARE CONVICTED IN KILLING 
OF VOLUNTEER WORKER AMY BIEHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The victim was a bright young woman whose life was taken by killers she did 
not know. Later, in their trial, the accused were portrayed by the defense as 
victims themselves. It was another round in history's seemingly unending cycle 
of violence, and its circumstances were of a sort that seemed all too familiar 
to families across the world. What was dramatically different in this case was 
that the story unfolded on the international stage of the birth of South 
African democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday three South African men were found guilty in the killing of Amy 
Biehl, a Newport Beach woman who had been working on voter registration when 
she was slain by a mob in 1993. They were sentenced to 18 years in prison on 
Wednesday in what amounted to a test for the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
 In life, Biehl was committed to democracy. In death, she became a symbol for 
the price that many have paid to bring it into being. Afterward, her story 
continued to lend meaning to democratic aspirations and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was a reminder that democracy cannot take root and grow amid 
political violence. Nor can the experiment be continued without assurance that 
those who seek to undermine it with violence will be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution nearly lost very early on when two key witnesses said they 
were too afraid to testify, and the prosecutor was forced to drop charges 
against three defendants. The case against the remaining defendants also was 
put to the test. Eventually, one suspect was convicted on the basis of a 
confession, but to convict two others required the courageous testimony of 
three surprise eyewitnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth defendant, a juvenile, still awaits trial. 
</P>
<P>
 If Amy Biehl was a planter of democracy, her family has been picking up where 
she left off. They have established the Amy Biehl Fund to help finance the kind 
of grass-roots projects that their relative was involved in. And rather than 
clamoring for the death penalty, they have sought more positive outcomes. In 
doing so, they have taught us, too, something about resolution and justice.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: PICO RIVERA; COUNCIL WEIGHS FEWER MEETINGS TO SAVE MONEY

<P>
 The City Council is considering whether to cut back on regular meetings to 
save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meets on the first and third Monday of each month, but Vice Mayor 
Garth G. Gardner has proposed that the council meet every three weeks or once a 
month during a six-month trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has suggested that the Redevelopment Agency reduce its meetings from 
twice a month to once a month, and that the Housing Assistance Agency meet once 
every three months instead of once a month.  
</P>
<P>
 Gardner and Councilman Gil De La Rosa will study how much the financially 
strapped city could save by holding fewer meetings and will also solicit 
residents' opinions. The study was approved last week by Gardner, De La Rosa 
and Mayor Beatrice Proo. Council members John G. Chavez and Helen O'Hara were 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner and De La Rosa are scheduled to present their findings at the 
council's Nov. 14 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen city staff members attend the council meetings. Some are paid 
overtime to attend and others are given time off afterward. Gardner said he 
thinks the city could save $500 to $1,000 a month in staff expenses and 
printing costs by holding fewer meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Activist William Pinkerton, who attends council meetings regularly, condemned 
the proposal. "They have their minds made up and they don't want to hear from 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the city's $22.7-million budget has no funding for residential 
street repairs. Funding for park and recreation services was cut by $150,000.

 AT PEACE ON SHORE: It cost her about 35 jellyfish stings, but Los Alamitos 
endurance swimmer Lynne Cox completed her two-day "peace swim" across the Gulf 
of Aqaba symbolically linking Israel, Egypt and Jordan. For an encore, she was 
present at ceremonies in Jordan on Wednesday when President Clinton signed a 
peace treaty between Israel and Jordan."I started crying," said Cox, 37. "It

 NO LOVE AFFAIR: Warren Beatty give a speech in Orange County? Did you really 
think he'd show? They did at the American Magazine Conference at the 
Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point. That is, until his agent called late Saturday 
night saying: Sorry. . . . Beatty, lately out touting his new movie, "Love 
Affair," sent his regrets. Conference officials groaned hard, but came up with 
a speaker they liked for their Wednesday grand finale: Oliver Stone.

 NEW CAUSE: Louise C. Cummings, former fund-raiser for the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum and South Coast Repertory, has taken on a new cause: AIDS. She's the new 
fund-raiser for the AIDS Services Foundation of Orange County. . . . Says 
Cummings, whose title is director of development: "I took a pay cut to come 
here. At age 50 I wanted to do something that really makes a difference. This 
is the most important health issue of our time."

 HEALTHY ART: The arts world in Orange County is financially healthy, and even 
holding down prices for consumers, says a new report from the Business 
Committee for the Arts. A few facts from a 1991-93 survey released Wednesday: 
The economic impact of nonprofit arts groups hit a new two-year high of $348.5 
million; average ticket prices remained stable, and paid admissions rose by 
18%.

 A man who shot a doctor to death at a crowded Tokyo railway station was a 
patient dissatisfied with a hernia operation, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old man fired a Russian Tokarev pistol into Dr. Takejiro Okazaki's 
back in front of hundreds of morning rush-hour commuters Tuesday in a crime 
that shocked the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who had also been treated for mental illness, was still at large, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities here are worried by a recent influx of smuggled guns, including 
American Colts and Smith & Wessons, Chinese-made Russian Tokarevs and 
handcrafted replicas of U.S. models made in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Handguns are banned for civilians in Japan.

A. SHELEPIN; LED KGB FOR KHRUSHCHEV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Shelepin, the head of the KGB during the era of Nikita S. Khrushchev 
who once was considered a contender for Khrushchev's job, died Monday at the 
age of 76. 
</P>
<P>
 The ITAR-Tass news agency reported his death but did not give the cause or say 
where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelepin -- who owed his career to Khrushchev -- in the 1950s headed the 
Komsomol, the party's youth wing. In 1958, he became chairman of the KGB, the 
Soviet Union's state security committee. That job lasted until 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 After having helped oust Khrushchev in 1964, his career peaked as a member of 
the Politburo and a secretary of the party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But he lost the secretary's job in 1966 and was demoted to head of the 
official trade unions, probably because he was seen as a rival to party leader 
Leonid I. Brezhnev. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost the trade union job in 1975 after a controversial visit to Britain 
which sparked protest demonstrations, and eventually was removed from the 
Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelepin was KGB chief in 1959 when the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leader 
Stepan Bandera was ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelepin followed a classic career path for Soviet leaders, joining the 
Communist Party in 1940 after graduating from the Moscow Institute of History, 
Philosophy and Literature. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Komsomol, he directed hundreds of thousands of young people in building 
cities in the Siberian wilderness and cultivating the so-called virgin lands of 
Kazakhstan. He became a member of the Communist Party Central Committee in 
1957.

R. CHAMBERS; FEDERAL JUDGE, PRESERVATIONIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard H. Chambers, the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge who fought 
to preserve historic buildings and was instrumental in moving the court's Los 
Angeles offices to a renovated Spanish colonial hotel building in Pasadena, has 
died. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers, who had continued hearing cases as a senior judge until he was 
disabled by a stroke three years ago, died Friday in Tucson, where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
 He was appointed to the appellate court by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 
1954, and from 1959 until 1976 served as the court's chief judge. The 9th 
Circuit encompasses the eight Western states and all U.S. territories in the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is based in San Francisco, the court also maintains offices and 
occasionally meets in Seattle, Portland and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When the appellate body felt squeezed by the local U.S. District Court in the 
Downtown federal courthouse, Chambers became the driving force behind a plan to 
move to Pasadena. At his urging, the court took over the Hotel Vista del Arroyo 
and spent $10 million to rehabilitate it. The hotel, built in 1881, had served 
as an Army hospital and was declared surplus property in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Services Administration planned to sell the old hotel and 
initially greeted Chambers' idea as a "boondoggle." The move remained 
controversial among his colleagues, with many considering the building too 
ornate and costly. When the court moved in 1985, four judges lagged behind in 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the building was named the Richard H. Chambers U.S. Court of Appeals 
in honor of Chambers' conversion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 He also led campaigns to preserve or restore nearly two dozen other historic 
buildings, mostly courthouses, in San Francisco, San Diego, Portland and 
elsewhere in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers' lobbying included unusual means such as sending memos to fellow 
judges signed by his horse, Tom Chambers. When he wanted some of the Pasadena 
hotel-cum-courthouse bungalows torn down to build a parking lot, he launched a 
letter-writing campaign by taking out a classified advertisement in the 
Pasadena newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paid advertisement," he said, "enabled me to put my message in the paper 
without being edited." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Illinois, Chambers moved to Arizona with his family when he was 1 year 
old. He earned his law degree from Stanford University and went into practice 
with his father in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers served as president of the Pima County Bar Assn. in 1950 and 1951 and 
as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1959 to 1976.

JOHN LAUTNER; INNOVATIVE L.A. ARCHITECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Lautner, an innovative Los Angeles architect whose modernistic houses 
include Chemosphere House above Studio City, which has been likened to a UFO 
hedgehopping the Santa Monica Mountains, has died. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Lautner, who studied as an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright, died Monday of 
heart failure at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lautner set up his practice shortly after moving to Los Angeles in 1937 to 
supervise Wright projects. 
</P>
<P>
 He later recalled his first impression of the city: "It was so ugly, it made 
me physically sick." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Lautner's best-known works is the striking Bob Hope home, which 
dominates a mountainside in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, the Encyclopaedia Britannica rated Lautner's Chemosphere the "most 
modern home built in the world." The two-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot house, 
mounted on a single concrete column near Mulholland Drive, has become an 
often-photographed architectural treasure and one of Lautner's most famous 
creations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of his landmark homes, Silvertop, features an arching concrete ceiling 
above a 3,000-square-foot living room, which makes the room appear to open like 
a clamshell. A majestic concrete fireplace in the 7,500-square-foot house 
includes a glass wall providing a spectacular view of Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lautner's designs sought to relate humans to their living space and the 
residences to surrounding nature. He disparaged simplistic, box-style 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a box is for jails and dogs," the outspoken architect told The Times 
in 1983. "The environment for people is always better in some other space than 
a box." 
</P>
<P>
 Lautner prided himself on caring more for good design than for profit, once 
noting, "I just kept a week ahead of the rent for 35 years." 
</P>
<P>
 His houses have been the sets for several movies, including "Diamonds are 
Forever" and "Body Double." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he specialized in single-family residences, Lautner also notably lent 
his hand to such multiple-family developments as the Sheets Apartments in 
Westwood in 1949, and commercial designs such as the radio astronomy laboratory 
at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 He designed hundreds of schools and commercial and residential buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 His work has been the subject of many exhibitions in the United States and 
elsewhere, including a current one at Columbia University in New York. His 
designs have often been discussed in architectural publications, with Arts & 
Architecture magazine rating him a "lyrical technologist." Artemis of London 
recently published a comprehensive monograph on Lautner's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lautner was named a fellow of the American Institute of Architects in 1970. 
Last year, he received the gold medal of the institute's Los Angeles chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Francesca; four children, Karol, Michael, Mary and 
Judith; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing is scheduled for 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. today at Pierce Brothers Mortuary, 
5959 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. Services will be at 7:30 tonight in the 
Church of the Blessed Sacrament, 6657 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood.

MILDRED NATWICK; STAGE, FILM, TV ACTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mildred Natwick, a renowned character actress who built her career around some 
40 Broadway plays and who also performed on television and in film, has died. 
She was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Natwick, who excelled in comedic as well as dramatic roles, died Tuesday 
at her home in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 When she appeared in Neil Simon's Broadway comedy, "Barefoot in the Park," in 
1963, New York Times critic Walter Kerr called her "the most hilarious woman in 
the Western Hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 She earned an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work 
in the film version in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, she paired with veteran actress Helen Hayes in a motion picture and 
four-part television miniseries titled "The Snoop Sisters," about two aging 
amateur sleuths. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times critic Mary Murphy said Miss Natwick "shines above her 
material," but added: "It is a waste of talent to let Helen Hayes and Mildred 
Natwick play sweet, slightly doddering, clever old ladies instead of wise old 
women with real humanity and depth of emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Natwick won an Emmy for the 1973 television show. Despite her versatility 
in all media, the stage remained her first love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss what you have in the theater," she told The Times when she was doing 
the "The Snoop Sisters" on television. "You try things (there) until you get 
them right. I miss the four weeks' rehearsal, five weeks out of town. I don't 
really like this instant acting." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Miss Natwick's outstanding Broadway roles were as a secretary in George 
Bernard Shaw's "Candida," a medium in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit," and a 
shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Baltimore, she graduated from Bryn Mawr School and Bennett Junior 
College in New York. She studied drama with the University Players on Cape Cod, 
along with Henry Fonda, James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Natwick made her Broadway debut in "Carrie Nation" in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 On film, she appeared in "The Enchanted Cottage" in 1945, "Cheaper by the 
Dozen" in 1950, "If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Belgium" in 1967, "Daisy Miller" 
in 1974 and as the aunt in "Dangerous Liaisons" in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Her television roles included "Blithe Spirit," for which she received an Emmy 
nomination, and guest roles on "McMillan and Wife," "Hawaii Five-O" and "Love 
Boat."

LAPD COST FOR DIVISION: $35 MILLION; POLICE: STATION WOULD SERVE THE NORTHEAST 
VALLEY. COUNCILMAN ALARCON WANTS TO USE FEDERAL CRIME BILL MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed new police division in the San Fernando Valley would cost $35 
million to build and $10 million annually to operate, police officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 No source of funding has been identified for the project, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon introduced a motion Wednesday to 
instruct the Police Department to consider adding a sixth Valley division as a 
way to focus more police attention on high-crime neighborhoods in the northeast 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Alarcon's proposal does not say how the city would pay for the new 
division, he asked the Police Department to consider tapping funds provided by 
President Clinton's 1994 crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said they will study the bill as a funding source but only if 
the department and city officials determine that a new division is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Without funding from the bill, police are skeptical that the city can afford a 
new police division. "The city doesn't have anything," said Steve Hatfield, 
assistance commander of the department's police facilities construction group. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 18 divisions in the Los Angeles Police Department, including 
five in the Valley. Alarcon proposes a division that would cover the 
communities of Panorama City and North Hills east of the San Diego Freeway, and 
Mission Hills and Arleta west of the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hopes a new division could concentrate on such high-crime areas as 
Orion Street in North Hills and Blythe Street in Panorama City, areas now 
situated on the borders of other Valley divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are areas of concentrated crime," Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hatfield, the cost of buying land, designing a new station and 
building the facility would range from $25 million to $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officers reassigned from adjacent divisions would make up the bulk of 
a new division's staff, the department would have to hire 40 to 50 new clerks, 
watch commanders and other support personnel, city officials said. Hatfield 
said police have estimated the cost of the additional staffing and facility 
maintenance at about $10 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon's proposal is not the first time city and police officials have 
considered adding a new Valley division. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, city officials put a $176-million bond measure before voters, 
promising it would help pay for new police facilities, including a new Valley 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hatfield said all of the bond money has either been spent or is set aside 
for other projects, such as the construction of a new driver-training center, 
new parking lots and repairs at three existing stations. 
</P>
<P>
 In June of 1992, Chief Willie Williams instructed department officials to 
study the idea of adding two divisions, one in the northeast Valley and one 
near downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the police study concluded there was sufficient need for the new 
divisions, the proposal died for lack of funding, said Capt. David R. Doan, 
commander of the department's planning and research division. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams rekindled the idea of adding new divisions in September as part of a 
plan to realign existing police divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan said his department is expected to complete the latest study on adding 
new divisions by next week. If the study concludes that two new stations are 
warranted and the idea is backed by Williams, the Police Commission and the 
City Council, he said the department would then study ways of funding the new 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is still unclear whether the city can rely on Clinton's crime bill. The 
anti-crime package signed into law last month sets aside $8.8 billion for 
hiring police -- as many as 100,000 new officers during the next six years, 
according to supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter DiCarlo, a city administrative analyst, said the city is waiting for the 
Department of Justice to draft regulations on how the money can be spent. That 
report is expected by early December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But DiCarlo said if the city decides to fund the new divisions with crime bill 
money, the city may end up scrambling for additional funds once the bill's 
six-year funding period expires.

 In a city that flaunts its ties to the entertainment industry, police clerk 
Norma Brolsma didn't think twice about granting a permit to yet another 
filmmaker wanting to shoot in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 What Brolsma said she did not know was that the scenes were for an X-rated 
movie involving oral copulation and intercourse at the city's water and power 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoot for "Fantasy Chamber" by Ultimate Video production company last 
weekend alarmed some plant employees who said they arrived at the plant Sunday 
morning to see sexual gymnastics involving groups of two and three actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the type of image we want for the city," said Ron Stassi, general 
manager of the city's Public Services Department, who fielded several 
complaints from his employees. "The risk is (that) it will reflect unfavorably 
on our department or city." 
</P>
<P>
 Stassi's concern was shared by City Manager Bud Ovrom, but not by Police Chief 
Dave Newsham, who said he saw nothing wrong with his department's handling of 
the application. Brolsma said she was aware nudity would be involved in the 
filming. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovrom said the permit "slipped through the cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's something that should have happened," Ovrom said. "But 
it's not a major crisis. We'll find a procedure to correct it in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank's policy for granting film permits -- now limited to determining how 
many people are in the cast and crew, whether special effects or stunts will be 
done and if interior or exterior shots are needed -- will be reviewed, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city, as an entity, has no policy regarding what kind of filming goes on. 
It may even be censorship," Newsham said. "The Police Department, in issuing a 
permit, is ensuring safety considerations are being met." 
</P>
<P>
 The power plant has been used for filming episodes from the movie "Thelma and 
Louise" and another motion picture starring Hulk Hogan. Burbank issues permits 
for filming 175 to 200 productions each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Nick and Anthony Pinkowski, who operate Ultimate Video in Chatsworth, 
said they made it clear to the Burbank Police Department they were in the 
adult-entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fantasy Chamber" refers to a sensory-deprivation tank in the movie that 
enables anyone who steps inside it to visualize sexual fantasies. Burbank's 
water and power plant on North Lake Street seemed to be the perfect spot to 
film, the brothers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never, ever, ever, ever, ever -- and I will say that double emphatically 
-- shoot (X-rated movies) without having permission, without being up front 
about it," said Nick Pinkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is one of a number of X-rated filmmakers in the San Fernando Valley, 
a center of the national pornographic film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you don't feel you have to take a shower after seeing one of our 
movies," said Pinkowski. "It's geared for females and couples." 
</P>
<P>
 Two workers who asked not to be identified said they saw an actress leaning 
against a motorcycle having sex with two men at once when the employees 
reported to work Sunday morning. Several other actors looked on and 
masturbated, the employees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they got to film it somewhere," said one employee. "But it's 
different than if you spend $20 on a nudie bar and are pretty well liquored up 
and don't care what's going to happen. It's different than coming stone sober 
to work. It shouldn't occur in the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The permit obtained by Ultimate Video enabled the company to use the plant 
grounds from 5 p.m. Saturday to 6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Burbank has tried to give filmmakers as little trouble as 
possible in issuing film permits, Brolsma said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been friendly. We make it easy for them," she said. "If they 
want it in a day, we try to get it for them."

<P>
 Hoping to increase religious tolerance, a group of local clergy has planned 
the first-ever Orange County Religious Diversity Fair to be held at Mission San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-hour conference, scheduled for Nov. 5, will offer informational 
sessions on eight faiths: Judaism, Islam, Catholicism, several mainline 
Protestant faiths, Buddhism, Bahaism, Christian Science and Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (participants) become more knowledgeable of religions other than their 
own," said Rabbi Allen Krause of Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo, the 
conference's primary organizer. "When we know more about each other we have a 
better chance of being more understanding and less judgmental." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants can choose among discussion groups ranging from encouraging youth 
involvement in religious activities, discounting myths about evangelical 
Christians, exploring theology and discovering the roles music and ritual play 
in religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer services in the different faiths also will be offered, with an 
ecumenical closing celebration planned for 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference also will include tours of the mission, 31550 Camino 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 To register, call Temple Beth El at (714) 362-3999. Registration before 
Thursday is $10, while the cost at the door will be $15. LYNN FRANEY

</P>
<P>
 Contribution: Donated a 1990 Chevrolet Caprice police car to the Fullerton 
College Police Academy. The college, which regularly supplies new recruits to 
the department, needed five patrol cars for its training program. Police 
officials said the car had served the city but was no longer needed by the 
department. The car's light bar is now considered out of date, they said. The 
cruiser would have fetched about $3,000 at an auction, they added. Academy 
students plan fund-raisers to help pay for new tires and upholstery.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; SCHOOL FOCUSES ASSEMBLIES ON AIDS DANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In bygone years a high school homecoming dance was viewed as a fairly innocent 
rite of passage for students. But in the 1990s, it's an occasion that brings up 
a life and death issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parents, Teachers and Students Assn. at El Camino Real High School 
sponsored assemblies Tuesday and Wednesday to educate students about the 
dangers of HIV infection and AIDS. Each program included presentations by the 
Valley Teen Clinic, a talk by an HIV-positive man and a display of eight panels 
from the AIDS quilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Using street language in a series of skits, representatives from the youth 
clinic portrayed the virus as a member of the "Homies In Venice" gang being 
interviewed on the show "A Current Bodily Affair." 
</P>
<P>
 "To relate to a juvenile, you must be one," said Demetrius Navarro, one of the 
performers. "You just can't speak at them, you have to speak to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation included a discussion on how to use condoms, but stressed 
abstinence from sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them it's OK to be abstinent, that it's not a bad thing. And 
abstinence does not mean being a virgin," said Theresa Covello, also a 
performer. "You can say no whenever you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Also emphasizing safe sex practices was Bob Ames, who has been HIV-positive 
for 13 years. "I'm sick and tired of burying young people," said Ames at one of 
the assemblies, explaining that he has a 14-year old friend who had sex only 
once and is now dying from AIDS-related illnesses. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; CITY GIVES COMPUTERS TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city of Westlake Village has donated five computers and two printers to 
White Oak Elementary School to help enhance the school's computer education 
program, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers and printers, which until recently were used at City Hall, are 
incompatible with the city's new computer system, said Mike Mathews, assistant 
to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to take equipment that we weren't using and be able to give it to 
the students," Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the computers and printers, he said, the city will be allowed 
to use the school's auditorium for city functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Zimring, assistant superintendent for the Las Virgenes Unified School 
District, said the computers will be a welcome addition to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The district, he said, recently launched a campaign to upgrade the district's 
high-tech education programs. But the fiscally strapped district can't afford 
the cost of keeping up with the rapid changes in technology. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district -- which has been forced to cut about $4 million from its 
budget over the past five years -- can't afford items like CD-ROMs, on-line 
learning such as the Internet, or interactive CDs. The district cannot afford 
satellite learning and the use of cable in the classroom as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Technology Foundation, a parents booster organization, 
recently held a $50-a-plate dinner to raise money to purchase some of the 
needed items. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, according to Mayor Doug Yarrow, upgraded its computers to speed up 
the system and provide a network operating system for the city's seven 
full-time employees. He said the new computers, which have color monitors, 
contain software for word processing, spreadsheet and database management.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; GROUP TO WARN GIRLS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A local organization dedicated to preventing family violence is planning to 
introduce a program in area high schools to educate students about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot program, created by the nonprofit group Haven Hills, will be 
launched at several San Fernando Valley high schools early next year, said 
Betty Fisher, the group's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the organization has learned from doing classroom presentations 
that many girls who are being beaten by their boyfriends don't realize they are 
victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence in dating relationships is often interpreted (by the victim) as a 
sign (the abuser) really cares about her, or he wouldn't become that 
emotional," said Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, designed to help victims overcome denial and get help, is being 
funded by a $25,000 grant from Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased to be able to lend a helping hand and applaud the 
direction that Haven Hills is taking in creating an extremely important 
program," said Otis L. Spencer, medical group administrator at the medical 
center, in a written statement issued by the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will train peer counselors how to spot victims of domestic 
violence, said Fisher. The counselors will also learn how to assist victims in 
getting help. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer counselors are preferred over adult counselors, Fisher said, because 
young people tend to confide more in people their own age. 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills, established in 1977, operates a shelter for battered women in the 
San Fernando Valley. It also has a 24-hour crisis telephone hot line and offers 
free counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said studies indicate that in the United States a woman is beaten every 
12 seconds, and that one of every two women will at some point in her life 
experience domestic abuse. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE NAMES NEW DEAN OF RESOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy Rupert, formerly assistant dean at West Los Angeles College, has been 
appointed dean of resources and community relations at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert, a resident of West Los Angeles, will be in charge of obtaining grants 
for the school, said Pierce College President Mary Lee.She also will serve as a 
liaison between the school and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are delighted that Dorothy is joining us at Pierce College," Lee said. 
"Her expertise and experience will help further the Pierce College master plan 
for fund-raising and new facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert said Wednesday that her role will probably evolve because the position 
is new. She will be in charge of finding and writing applications for public 
and private grants. Rupert also may solicit donations from corporations and 
other entities. 
</P>
<P>
 Her appointment comes at a time when the college is confronted with declining 
enrollment and a $2-million budget deficit. Lee says the school needs to raise 
money to get through the funding crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether she feels a sense of urgency to raise money, Rupert answered, 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert said fund-raising is a long-term process and her goals will be "making 
friends for the college, establishing credibility, establishing trust . . . I'm 
skeptical about flash-in-the-pan approaches." 
</P>
<P>
 At West Los Angeles College, where she had worked since 1983, Rupert was 
executive director of the College Foundation and assistant dean of 
institutional advancement. 
</P>
<P>
 She lists as her major accomplishment as helping to obtain a $2.5-million 
federal grant to enhance educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rupert has a master's degree in business administration from Pepperdine 
University. She is treasurer of the Network of California Community College 
Foundations, and of the National Council of Resource Developers. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY TO RAZE OLIVE MEMORIAL STADIUM 
</P>

 The City Council has voted to tear down Olive Memorial Stadium, where the 
former St. Louis Browns baseball team once held spring-training camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a need to replace the aging bleachers, dugout and locker rooms for 
safety reasons, Burbank officials Tuesday agreed unanimously to demolish the 
stadium soon but did not specify when. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems to me there's no reason to tolerate that attractive nuisance there," 
said City Manager Bud Ovrom. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old stadium has been closed to the public since 1989, but portions 
of its playing field have been used by recreational softball players. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive Memorial's claim to fame came in the years between 1949 and 1952, when 
it was used as the spring training site for perhaps the worst baseball team in 
history -- the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns accumulated a record of 3,414 wins and 4,465 losses in 52 years, 
but won the hearts of Burbank residents who came to see them play. 
</P>
<P>
 Among others who called the stadium home were high school baseball teams, 
Burbank on Parade and the Los Angeles Rams football team, which sometimes 
practiced there. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of whether to tear down the stadium or preserve it had been an 
emotional one for the Parks and Recreation Board and the committee of citizens 
charged with making a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to raze the stadium for about $80,000 and eventually build a 
new one for $500,000 more. A sculpted concrete column and a set of plaques 
honoring World War II veterans will be preserved and relocated. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ARMENIAN CENTER TO CELEBRATE OPENING

<P>
 A long list of local, state and federal dignitaries is expected to attend a 
banquet and celebration Friday night to mark the recent opening of a central 
headquarters for several major Armenian American organizations in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armenian National Committee/Western Region has long called Glendale its 
home, but recently the organization and several affiliated organizations moved 
into new quarters at 104 N. Belmont St. to offer a variety of services from a 
central location, said Raffi Hamparian, ANC chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamparian said attendees at the banquet, scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Universal 
City Hilton, will include U. S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, gubernatorial candidate 
Kathleen Brown and seven members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could look at it cynically and say they're coming because this is an 
election year, but on the other hand the Armenian community has a lot of 
friends, because we're active in the public life of many cities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being the headquarters for the ANC Western Region, which has 16 
chapters from Texas to California, the new building houses the local offices of 
the Armenian Youth Federation, the Armenian Relief Society, a student 
association and a fund for the war-torn Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 Also located in the building are local offices of the ANC's parent 
organization, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, a political party founded 
in 1890. 
</P>
<P>

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; MICROBREWERY WINS SPRING OPENING OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley, long the home of an Anheuser-Busch brewery, is about 
to be home to another commercial brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's doubtful anyone at the huge Anheuser-Busch facility is getting 
nervous. The Burbank Brew Pub, set to open next spring, will be a microbrewery, 
the first of its kind in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a trend that began in the Pacific Northwest, the microbrewery will 
offer a variety of beers and ales brewed on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 The pub, to be located in the city's downtown redevelopment area in a 
now-vacant building at 159 E. Angeleno Ave., easily won approval to open from 
Burbank's planning board. Unlike the Australian Beach Club -- a bar that opened 
near that site earlier this year after much debate -- no objections were raised 
to the pub, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a family restaurant, it's not a bar, and it's quite on the upscale 
order," said Gary Yamada, the city's zoning administrator. "It just so happens 
that they brew beer on the premises." 
</P>
<P>
 The microbrewery will be owned and operated by California Fast Foods, a 
Glendale company that owns seven restaurants, including five in Glendale. The 
company plans to spend $750,000 on the project, with $250,000 budgeted for the 
brewing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The workings of the brewery will be visible from the street through the 
restaurant's front windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bagheri, marketing director for the restaurant firm, said the company 
believes microbreweries may catch on in California, much the way gourmet coffee 
outlets have in recent years. There are already two successful microbreweries 
in nearby Pasadena, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new venture for us, and like any new business there is a risk, but we 
feel we can do a pretty good job at it and be successful," Bagheri said. The 
company is now searching for a brew master who will supervise the beer-making 
process. Bagheri said the brew pub will typically offer about four different 
beers at any given time. The brews will change periodically, with stouter, 
richer varieties offered during the winter and lighter beers during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot like cooking or baking, where you rely on the creativity of your 
chef. The brew master will have different recipes for different beers that are 
his or her specialty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The microbrewery has applied to the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board for 
a small brewer's license, which allows for the production of up to 15,000 
31-gallon barrels of beer per year. But the restaurant's owners anticipate 
making about 1,200-1,500 barrels per year, said Anita Williams, a private 
planning consultant who worked on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant will also be allowed to sell its beer in containers ranging 
from a half-gallon to 15 gallons for parties and other functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the restaurant expects to have 40 employees, and to ring up 
sales of beer, food and merchandise of $1.75 million in its first year, 
climbing to $2.4 million within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 If those figures prove to be accurate, the city would earn about $144,000 in 
sales tax revenue from the pub the first year. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; MAN DIES, 2 INJURED IN HEAD-ON CRASH

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was killed and two other people were injured when a car traveling the 
wrong way on the Hollywood Freeway collided head-on with another vehicle, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 8 p.m. Tuesday on the northbound side of the 
freeway after Shawna Leavell, 29, of Encino, entered the freeway via an 
off-ramp, said CHP Officer Tito Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say they do not know how long she was driving the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Universal City, Leavell's car struck a car traveling northbound, driven 
by Yuri Avetisyan, 46, of North Hollywood, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Avetisyan was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Leavell and a passenger in Avetisyan's car were in serious 
condition at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavell has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, Gomez 
said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; $25,000 REWARD OFFERED IN KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to offer a $25,000 reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer of a 77-year-old 
woman stabbed to death during an apparent robbery in her Van Nuys home. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude proposed the reward to help police solve the Oct. 9 
murder of Berneda McMackin who apparently was killed for the money she saved by 
recycling glass bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the killer then set her house on fire to cover the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This especially brutal crime against a peace-loving senior citizen, beloved 
in her neighborhood, is shocking and troubling, all the more so for its 
senselessness," Braude said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two days after her slaying, another elderly woman was killed in Van Nuys, 
sending shock waves through the San Fernando Valley's senior citizen community 
and prompting Councilman Joel Wachs last week to call for increased police 
patrols of neighborhoods populated by seniors. HUGO MARTIN

ELECTION '94; 40TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-Van Nuys), 45, was first elected to this 
seat in 1991. A former aide to Los Angeles City Controller Rick Tuttle, 
Friedman is single and has one child. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican challenger Noel DeGaetano, 51, of Van Nuys, owns moving company 
franchises in Van Nuys and Santa Clarita. He is married and has six children. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman has established herself in Sacramento as one of the capitol's most 
aggressive champions of women's causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Her biggest victories were a measure inspired by the O.J. Simpson case to 
earmark $30 million for various services to battered women and children; a 
proposal for a 2 cent-per-pack cigarette tax to raise an estimated $38 
million-a-year for an ambitious breast cancer program; and a law that permits 
the governor to consider granting clemency to women prisoners who are 
themselves the victims of battered women's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed all three measures but passage of the cigarette tax - 
hotly opposed by Sacramento's tobacco lobby - was seen most as a feather in 
Friedman's bonnet. 
</P>
<P>
 Aligned with the powerful political machine of U.S. Reps. Howard Berman 
(D-Mission Hills) and Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles), Friedman reportedly is 
being prepped to run eventually for the 20th Senate District seat. That seat 
encompasses her Assembly district and that of Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman got her start in Sacramento in 1990 when she was won a special 
election to fill Mike Roos' Hollywood-based seat. By 1992, reapportionment had 
collapsed that seat and forced Friedman to search about for another place to 
call home. It wasn't long before the San Fernando Valley - where Friedman had 
attended school - beckoned as Democratic Assemblyman Tom Bane decided not to 
seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running because I believe in less government and lower taxes," said 
DeGaetano, a member of the fundamentalist Church on the Way and a former 
supporter of Pat Robertson's 1988 presidential bid. He said he does not expect 
to spend more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40th District ranges from Studio City and Van Nuys to Sherman Oaks and 
Canoga Park. Voter registration is 56% Democratic and 30% Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running is Libertarian Kelley L. Ross, a college philosophy instructor 
from Van Nuys. JOHN SCHWADA

3 VALLEY MEN HELD IN SANTA MONICA SLAYING

 Three Panorama City men were arrested in connection with the fatal beating of 
a 38-year-old Santa Monica hospital executive Monday after a call made on the 
victim's cellular phone led officers to the suspects, Santa Monica police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests came four days after Edward Patrick Broderick was found bound, 
robbed and beaten to death in the kitchen of his Santa Monica apartment, Police 
Sgt. Gary Gallinot said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a call allegedly made by one of the men on Broderick's cellular 
phone after the slaying led police to an apartment in the 14000 block of 
Nordhoff Street in Panorama City. They arrested Lloyd Fred Smith, 24, and 
Norman Tooks Jr., 28, on suspicion of murder after they found numerous personal 
belongings of Broderick's in the apartment, Gallinot said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the two men left fingerprints and "other evidence" at Broderick's 
apartment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third man, Mark Anthony Henderson, 30, was arrested on suspicion of 
conspiracy to commit murder, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallinot said police surrounded the apartment about noon and used a hostage 
negotiating team to talk the men into surrendering about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the men apparently selected Broderick's home at random and 
ransacked the house, taking cash, a cellular phone and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallinot said they bound Broderick and beat him, possibly in an attempt to 
find other property. 
</P>
<P>
 The men will be arraigned Nov. 9 in Santa Monica Superior Court. No bail was 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three men have extensive criminal records," Gallinot said, with Smith on 
parole for a weapons violation and Tooks on parole for burglary.

CITY, ARMY CORPS TO FUND IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AT 2 PARKS; RECREATION: THE 
AGREEMENTS CALL FOR MAJOR ADDITIONS AT BOTH HANSEN DAM IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE AND 
THE SEPULVEDA BASIN.

<P>
 The city of Los Angeles and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have signed two 
multimillion-dollar cooperative agreements launching major park improvements at 
Hansen Dam and the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 At a groundbreaking ceremony Wednesday, officials with the Army Corps and city 
Department of Recreation and Parks signed an agreement to share the cost of a 
long-awaited $10-million revitalization project at Hansen Dam Recreation Center 
in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Army Corps and the city signed another agreement splitting the 
cost of a $10-million expansion of athletic fields and nature preserves in the 
Sepulveda Basin, the Valley's largest recreational area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hansen Dam project, which will take two years to complete, includes 
construction of a 1 1/2-acre swimming lake and nine-acre boating and fishing 
lake in the northwestern section of the park, expanded equestrian trails and 
new picnic and parking areas. Concessions, such as snack bars and a batting 
cage, may also be brought in to raise money to pay for increased expanded Park 
Ranger service and security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 A local homeowners' group and city park officials are also discussing whether 
to levy a $5 admission fee for adults to pay for park maintenance and security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hansen project returns a major recreation facility to east San Fernando 
Valley residents who recall fishing, canoeing and picnicking at the former 
120-acre Holiday Lake, which gave Lake View Terrace its name. 
</P>
<P>
 The former lake was a major recreational attraction that not only served the 
community, but attracted visitors from throughout the region for about 25 
years. But severe rains and floods in the late '70s and early '80s choked 
Holiday Lake to death with silt and sand from the Tujunga washes and forced 
residents to pull their boats out and shelve their tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the vibrant lake attraction, the park fell into disrepair and became a 
haven for gangs and the homeless. More recently, a gravel dirt patch near the 
park's main entrance became painfully wedged in the consciousness of Angelenos 
as the site of Rodney G. King's beating and was dubbed "King's Corner" by 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's ceremony was imbued with a particular poignancy for many members 
of the predominantly black and Latino surrounding communities, whose residents 
have waited for the project for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in my day, we used Hansen Dam as a family place. Pacoima was a family 
neighborhood," said Tom Montgomery, a 73-year-old Pacoima resident who attended 
the ceremony. "We've been long-neglected. Look at the dollars they pour into 
the Sepulveda Basin. They've got lakes, and those people can afford swimming 
pools in their own back yards! This will help our community." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the Army Corps, which owns the land because it is a 
federally protected flood plain, will put up $5 million, funds authorized by 
Congress after years of prodding by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
Berman made restoration of the lake a campaign promise when he was elected to 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berman authored federal legislation in 1986 that expanded the role of the Army 
Corps from flood control to include recreation projects, and raised about $1.5 
million through sales of silt and other materials dredged from the dam's basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will match the federal funds with $5 million in Proposition A funds 
used for parks development. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first two children know about Hansen Dam the way it used to be," said 
Valerie Moody, a Pacoima resident who lives within walking distance of the dam. 
"But my youngest doesn't. The other two remember their grandma going fishing 
here. . . . This was a real neighborhood back then," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be starting a whole new generation on fishing and hiking and swimming, 
it looks like," Moody said. "It's been a long time coming. It was something 
here that was beautiful and they let it die out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Villalobos, chief of the Army Corps' district environmental resources 
branch, said the two lakes will be next to each other, separated by an 
embankment designed to maintain high-quality filtered and chlorinated water in 
the swimming lake. The lakes will be built on a bluff in the park, directly 
south of Foothill Boulevard. The higher ground was chosen to protect it from 
flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalobos said original plans calling for a much larger lake have not been 
dropped. The Army Corps is studying the possibility of building a 70-acre lake 
below the two new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the funding yet," Villalobos said. "We're estimating the 
70-acre lake would cost somewhere between $30 (million) and $40 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said no funding source of that magnitude has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not likely to see two $10-million agreements between the Corps and the 
city of Los Angeles -- signed in the same two weeks -- in a lifetime," said 
Fred-Otto Egeler, a spokesman for the Army Corps. "It was purely coincidence. 
But it's a great coincidence for the city of Los Angeles."

2ND MISTRIAL IS DECLARED IN CITY COUNCIL FINANCIAL LIABILITY CASE; COURT: TRIAL 
IS DELAYED IN SUIT THAT ALLEGES THE MEMBERS SHOULD PERSONALLY PAY DAMAGES FOR 
ACTIONS OF POLICE WHO SHOT FOUR ROBBERS AFTER A HOLDUP IN SUNLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise development, a Los Angeles federal judge Wednesday declared a 
second mistrial in a case that could lead to a ruling holding Los Angeles City 
Council members financially liable, as individuals, for police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge J. Spencer Letts does not end the 
case, but in effect delays the trial until Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 A mistrial had previously been declared in the case last December because 
Stephen Yagman, an attorney for the plaintiff, described the killing of a 
robber by officers from the LAPD's Special Investigations Section as "murder" 
during his closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit brought by Yagman alleges, among other things, that council members 
should be forced to pay damages out of their own pockets for the actions of 
special investigations officers who shot four robbers after a holdup at a 
McDonald's restaurant in Sunland on Feb. 12, 1990. Three were killed and one 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which was to be split into two phases, began Tuesday in U.S. 
District Court. In the first phase, a jury was to determine whether to award 
compensatory damages to 4-year-old Johanna Trevino, whose father was one of the 
slain robbers. Johanna was born seven days after her father, Javier Trevino, 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the same jury was to hear a second phase of the trial, roughly a 
month later, to determine whether council members can be held personally liable 
for damages. Yagman has argued that when the council members voted to have the 
city pay punitive damages assessed against the police officers in a previous 
trial, they condoned the officers' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury was also supposed to decide whether LAPD officers habitually use 
excessive force and whether the city and council members should share the 
blame, on the grounds that the council has routinely voted to pay damages 
assessed against police officers by juries in brutality trials. Yagman said 
city records show that council members voted to pay the damages in 37 of 39 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's proceedings headed toward a mistrial after Letts ruled that 
Yagman could not present testimony from several witnesses about the economic 
loss the girl may have suffered as a result of her father's death. The judge 
ruled that Yagman lacked concrete proof of how much the girl's father would 
have made if he had lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman said the psychiatrist he wanted to call to testify on the emotional 
distress the child has suffered as the result of her father's death was out of 
town until Monday, which would not have meshed with the jury's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Letts subsequently declared a mistrial because of Yagman's 
inability to proceed with his case, despite protests by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office, which is defending the city. Don Vincent, supervising deputy 
city attorney, asked Letts to decide the case himself, but the judge declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you come out of a case without a loss it has to be a good day," 
Vincent said in an interview. "But in this case it's not a particularly warm 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman described the decision as fair and said the only effect it will have is 
that a new jury will be selected to hear the entire case at once, dealing with 
the issues in what had been phase one and phase two, unless a settlement is 
reached in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, "nothing happened here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman has offered to drop the suit if the city agrees to set up an annuity 
for the child, an offer which city officials say would cost $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Atty. James Hahn told reporters at City Hall Wednesday that 
although he believes the case should have been dismissed, "we will never close 
the door on settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office has tried to get the suit dismissed, 
citing the common legal doctrine that lawmakers cannot be sued personally for 
votes they cast as part of their official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Letts rejected the city's position, a decision that was upheld by the U.S. 9th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled unanimously that the decision to pay the 
damages assessed against the police officers was an administrative, not a 
legislative, act. 
</P>
<P>
 The city appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused this month to hear 
the case, setting the stage for this week's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the incident that resulted in the lawsuits, 19 special investigations 
members followed the four men suspected in a string of restaurant robberies 
from Venice to Sunland and watched as they broke into the closed McDonald's 
about 1 a.m., and robbed a lone employee inside. 
</P>
<P>
 After the robbers got into their car, the officers moved in and later 
testified they fired 35 rounds from shotguns and handguns when the robbers 
pointed weapons at them, which were later determined to be unloaded pellet 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the robbers sued former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates and 
nine officers shortly after the shooting, contending that the police shot the 
men without provocation and that Gates was responsible for the way the 
department was run. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury found in favor of the families in March, 1992, and assessed more than 
$44,000 in punitive damages against Gates and the officers. Yagman, who had 
represented the families, subsequently filed an identical lawsuit on behalf of 
Trevino asking for unspecified damages against the city, the council members 
and police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who Yagman said had traveled from Vera Cruz, Mexico, for the trial, 
was not present in court Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney said he believes it is in the public's best interest that the 
case go to trial and he hopes it will make council members think twice before 
they vote to pay punitive damages for police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a bunch of politicians," Yagman said. "No one has ever gotten 
close to them and all of a sudden the madman from Venice -- that's me -- shows 
up at the door."

CITY IMPOSES TOUGH RULES ON 3 VAN NUYS MOTELS; CRIME: SECURITY MEASURES ARE 
DESIGNED TO CONTROL PROSTITUTION AND OTHER VIOLATIONS ALONG SEPULVEDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to impose tough 
security measures on three Sepulveda Boulevard motels in Van Nuys that police 
say are havens for prostitution and other crimes, despite appeals from owners 
who say they are also victims of crime in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision represented the last step in the city's appeal process 
under which motel owners could have overturned the restrictions proposed by 
city zoning officials and backed by crime-weary neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But an attorney for at least one motel owner suggested that the owners would 
continue the fight in court. The owner even hired a court reporter to attend 
the council meeting to make a full record of what was said during the 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions are the city's latest effort in an 11-month battle to crack 
down on crime at motels and hotels along Sepulveda Boulevard. A city study of 
the problem in December originally identified five of 11 motels along the 
boulevard as magnets for crime. But since then, one has been sold and another 
has closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the council's decision, the three remaining motels -- the El Cortez, the 
Cinema and the Town House -- must each abide by nearly 30 conditions imposed by 
zoning officials to control prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions include requirements that motel managers check the driver's 
licenses of tenants, refuse to rent rooms on an hourly basis, improve lighting 
around the motels and discourage loitering, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 But the condition most vehemently opposed by motel owners is the requirement 
that they hire private guards to patrol the motels for at least 13 hours a day, 
and longer on Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners said they have already agreed to abide by some of the conditions, 
but they argued that the city is unfairly forcing them to take the blame for 
all the crime problems on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners and their representatives said the crime on the boulevard is not 
their responsibility but they are forced to suffer the consequences of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation is a no-win situation for the motels," said Angela Oh, a 
spokeswoman for the El Cortez Motel, who complained that the city may force 
motel owners to keep the guards indefinitely as long as the prostitution 
problem is kept in check. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Marvin Braude, who represents the stretch of Sepulveda 
Boulevard where the motels are located, puts part of the blame on the owners 
and said he believes the restrictions will have a beneficial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is, does a property owner have a right to operate a property so 
that it becomes a nuisance?" he said.

ELECTIONS / 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; BEILENSON, SYBERT SPAR OVER 
PROPOSITION 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D -- Woodland Hills) and his Republican 
challenger, Richard Sybert, jumped into the Proposition 187 fray Wednesday, 
agreeing that illegal immigration needs to be controlled but parting ways on 
the controversial ballot proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson condemned the initiative as ineffective, costly and unconstitutional 
during a debate sponsored by the Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce, while 
Sybert said it is an important first step in easing the state's immigration 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with health care and the federal budget deficit, immigration is the 
issue that is surfacing repeatedly in the 24th District race, as it is in 
election contests across the state. At the center of the debate is the 
initiative on next month's ballot that would deny government assistance to 
illegal immigrants and their children and call on authorities to report those 
who have entered the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson, who is seeking his 10th term in a district that represents Studio 
City, Sherman Oaks, Malibu and the Conejo Valley, said he has fought for years 
for more Border Patrol agents and a better system for verifying the legal 
status of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would accomplish neither, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sybert, a former official in Gov. Pete Wilson's Administration who is 
making his first bid for elected office, argued that Proposition 187 has 
already succeeded by focusing the nation's attention on the issue and prompting 
the federal government to beef up border patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert -- whose father is an immigrant from Holland and whose wife emigrated 
from Brazil -- said his family followed the rules when they arrived. Those who 
slip across the border illegally are draining significant resources from the 
state, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not without flaws," Sybert said of Proposition 187, "but I haven't seen 
an initiative that's not." 
</P>
<P>
 While Sybert said the measure will send a signal to Washington about 
Californians' frustrations, Beilenson said the message has already arrived. The 
crime bill approved earlier this year, for instance, included money to beef up 
patrols at the U.S.-Mexico border, Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates meet for two final debates today. They will meet at a 
luncheon debate sponsored by the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce at 11:30 a.m. at 
the Calabasas Inn, 23500 Park Sorrento. Lunch is $20. Then they will debate at 
7:30 p.m. at Kaiser Permanente, 5601 De Soto Ave., Entrance 5.

MAHONY WAS AMONG 1ST GRADUATES IN '54 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an entry typical of high school yearbooks, the meaning of inside jokes 
lost over time but the youthful humor in evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger Mahony, local salesman for Mother Fletcher's Nose Slings, recently 
purchased twin barracudas from Charlie's Fish Hatchery. He plans to raise them 
in the swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony is now a cardinal in the Catholic Church, but in the spring of 1954 he 
was 18 and graduating from the newly built Our Lady Queen of Angels High School 
Seminary next to the San Fernando Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building, with a Spanish mission-style tower, even had a swimming 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony had moved during the Easter holiday with classmates from the Los 
Angeles archdiocese's junior seminary on Detroit Street, then known as Los 
Angeles College. The school, founded in 1926, is now the site of Daniel Murphy 
Catholic High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Mission Hills campus included junior college-level studies in its 
early years, Mahony spent two more years there before continuing seminary 
training at St. John's College in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-editor in 1955 of a yearbook produced by the college-level students, Mahony 
is seen posing for a photograph with another puzzled seminarian, studying first 
aid handbooks in the school's infirmary. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahony wasn't the only seminarian there destined for bigger things. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cassock-wearing seminarians in the same yearbook include William Levada, 
now the archbishop of Portland, Ore., and Justin Rigali, now archbishop of St. 
Louis. JOHN DART

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN INJURED IN COLLISION DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newhall woman, who was injured late Sunday when the motorcycle on which she 
was a passenger slammed into a truck at a Lancaster intersection, has died, 
sheriff's deputies said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Janes, 29, died Tuesday at Lancaster Community Hospital, where she was 
being treated for injuries received in the collision at 50th Street East and 
Avenue K. In an earlier report, deputies incorrectly identified Janes as a 
Tujunga resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's traffic investigators said motorcyclist James Marsh, 32, of Sunland 
failed to halt at a stop sign and collided with a semi-trailer truck driven by 
Mark Smith, 36, of Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh was pronounced dead at the scene, deputies said. Smith was not injured.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEGOTIATIONS STALL BETWEEN CITY, WATER AGENCY; 
SANTA CLARITA: IMPASSE OVER LAWSUIT BLOCKING PROPOSED REDEVELOPMENT PLAN MAY 
DELAY 30-YEAR QUAKE RECOVERY PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations to settle a lawsuit blocking Santa Clarita's proposed 
$1.1-billion redevelopment plan have broken off between city officials and the 
wholesale water agency that filed the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden impasse may reignite the acrimonious court battle between the two 
agencies and further delay the start of the 30-year plan that the City Council 
approved eight months ago to aid the recovery of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are hundreds of millions of dollars in future tax increases that will 
occur here during the next 30 years as property values rise. The city wants the 
money to fund redevelopment, but the Castaic Lake Water Agency wants the funds 
to pay off bond debts the agency incurred for various construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement was initialed by Castaic Lake Water Agency Board 
President Mary Spring and Mayor George Pederson last week. Under the agreement, 
the CLWA would have dropped its suit and the city would have scaled back its 
spending plans from $1.1 billion to $854 million. The city also would have 
agreed to reimburse the water agency for half of the tax income it would lose 
once the redevelopment plan is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The water board balked at the agreement Tuesday, saying the plan would divert 
more property tax revenue from the CLWA than first thought and could trigger 
tax hikes for certain Santa Clarita Valley residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're trying to do is understand it completely. We discovered it late in 
the process because we're not redevelopment people," said Robert Sagehorn, CLWA 
general manager. "What we'd really like to do is spend some time with some math 
models. It's information the city should have provided a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members reacted angrily Tuesday night, threatening to proceed with 
Santa Clarita's full-sized redevelopment plan and to fight the water agency in 
court unless the CLWA backs the proposed agreement within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned that this (water) board is stalling," City Councilman Carl 
Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people who need help," Councilman H. Clyde Smyth said. "We need to 
get moving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It had appeared that Santa Clarita and the water agency had resolved their 
fight last week. Water board members now say they have since learned that the 
redevelopment agency would siphon away not only portions of general property 
taxes, but parts of special taxes established to pay for schools and water 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The water agency would have to raise assessment fees to make up for money 
diverted to the Redevelopment Agency, Sagehorn said. Residents living under the 
Redevelopment Agency and assessment fee area could find themselves paying many 
times what other residents do. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to warn the city is that we think this might be a tax 
increase," Sagehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagehorn, who described the city's seven-day deadline as unrealistic, said the 
water board would like to prevent any of its future tax revenue from being 
diverted to redevelopment. Perhaps state legislation could be introduced to 
protect the agency's tax funds, Sagehorn said, but the agency has yet to 
approach a lawmaker about proposing such legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials insist the water agency must adhere to the proposed settlement 
or continue with its lawsuit, which alleges the redevelopment plan goes beyond 
fixing earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pederson calls the CLWA's argument irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed settlement between the city and water agency states the 
redevelopment plan will be implemented according to "any method authorized by 
current or future state law," a condition that everyone agreed to no matter 
where the plan draws its funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to ignore the agreement we have signed and to attempt to use this in 
the eleventh hour to torpedo it -- this is the wrong," Pederson said.

DISPUTE FLARES OVER PLANNED RADIO SPOTS FOR PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With less than two weeks remaining before Election Day, the battle over 
Proposition 187 continued to heat up Wednesday with controversy erupting over a 
planned last-minute pro-187 radio ad campaign by a national immigration reform 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, LAPD Chief Willie L. Williams and a wide range of Southern 
California religious leaders issued statements opposing the sweeping ballot 
measure, which seeks to eliminate most government services for illegal 
immigrants and require educational, health and law enforcement officials to 
report suspects to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio flap concerns purchase of ad time by the Washington-based Federation 
for American Immigration Reform, a group known as FAIR that previously had 
indicated it was making no financial contributions in support of Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 FAIR Executive Director Daniel A. Stein, acknowledging that the organization 
has reserved radio time for the last week of the campaign, said it is doing so 
only to be able to respond to recent ads aired by Taxpayers Against 187, a 
coalition of organizations opposed to the ballot measure.  
</P>
<P>
 But spokesman Joel Maliniak of Taxpayers Against 187, which made public the 
pending FAIR radio campaign Tuesday, said that FAIR officials have "been caught 
lying with their pants down." 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, FAIR, whose former Sacramento lobbyist, Alan Nelson, 
co-wrote Proposition 187, has come under repeated attack from the taxpayers 
group for receiving a portion of its annual funding from the New York-based 
Pioneer Fund. The latter is a group that has also sponsored research by various 
scientists, including the late William B. Shockley, who contended that African 
Americans are inherently intellectually inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the indirect link between Nelson and the Pioneer Fund, Taxpayers 
Against 187 have charged in their radio ads that the ballot measure is backed 
by white supremacists. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said any ads that FAIR now runs would be "to defend ourselves." Stein, 
who has previously taken pains to point out that his organization had nothing 
to do with the drafting of Proposition 187, added that his group's ad "may 
(also) say vote for 187 -- it won't say vote against it." 
</P>
<P>
 "FAIR has attempted to distance itself from Proposition 187," responded 
Maliniak. "This latest development completely contradicts FAIR's denials and 
leaves absolutely no doubt about its involvement behind the scenes at the Yes 
on 187 campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and other top religious leaders gathered Wednesday in 
Los Angeles for a news conference reaffirming their opposition to the measure.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMAN PASSENGER, 75, DIES IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 75-year-old woman died Wednesday morning after the car she was riding in was 
struck by a second vehicle that ran a stop sign, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Temple of Santa Clarita was in the front passenger's seat of a Ford 
Escort making a left turn from Decoro Drive onto McBean Parkway about 11 a.m., 
said Officer Wendy Moore of the California Highway Patrol.The car was struck by 
a Mercury Marquis traveling northbound on McBean Parkway at 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right front of the Mercury struck the front center of the Escort," she 
said. "It was almost like a head-on collision because of the angle." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple, who was wearing her seat belt, suffered no visible external injuries, 
said Los Angeles County Fire Department Capt. Harry Thy. However, CHP officers 
said she went into cardiac arrest at the scene, was revived briefly by 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation and pronounced dead at 11:37 a.m. at Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Parent, 72, a Santa Clarita resident driving the Ford Escort, and James 
Kraft, 71, a Playa del Rey resident driving the Mercury Marquis, were taken to 
Newhall Memorial with minor injuries, CHP Officer Michele Esposito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft told officials he thought he was passing through an intersection without 
a stop sign and that a stop sign was a block or two up ahead. Kraft was not 
cited at the scene for running the stop sign, but an investigation is pending, 
Esposito said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SECOND TRUANCY SWEEP NETS 71 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley's second truancy sweep in less than a month rounded up 71 
students on Wednesday, primarily teen-agers who skipped classes at two local 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 6, sheriff's deputies and probation officers conducted a similar 
sweep, rounding up 87 truants. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Pricer, president of the Antelope Valley Union High School District, 
said he was disappointed that so many truants were picked up again on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is telling me that more of these (sweeps) are going to be necessary if 
the word is going to get out that we're quite serious about this truancy 
problem," Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer, a retired sheriff's deputy, runs the nonprofit United Community Action 
Network (UCAN), which provides counseling to troubled teen-agers. During both 
sweeps, the truants were taken to the UCAN offices in Palmdale, where they 
listened to motivational lectures while waiting for their parents or guardians 
to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, only two or three truancy sweeps are conducted during a school year. 
School officials suspect that some teen-agers believed they were safe to skip 
school this soon after the Oct. 9 sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's sweep, most of the truants were found loitering near school 
campuses or outside convenience markets, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 One was a junior high school student from Lancaster, while another was a 
13-year-old boy who did not seem to be registered in any school, Pricer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the remaining youngsters were from Antelope Valley High School in 
Lancaster or Palmdale High School. One youngster had a drug pipe, a small 
quantity of marijuana and a pocket knife that cannot be carried during school 
hours, Pricer said. That youth faces an expulsion hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say they are trying to curtail truancy because it contributes 
to crime problems and reduces the state funding each school receives. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Havens, principal at Palmdale High School, said truancy sweeps are an 
effective deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that the kids who are picked up spread the word to the kids they 
associate with," he said. "I'm sure the parents are getting the word out to 
their students that they belong in school -- and not out roaming in the 
community."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; EX-CON HELD IN SLAYING OF WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Paula man released from prison a month ago was arrested on suspicion 
of murdering a construction worker who was talking to the man's girlfriend, 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Cmdr.Bob Gonzales said David C. Lopez, 39, is accused of 
firing four to six bullets from a small-caliber, semiautomatic handgun Tuesday 
night into a van parked outside the Mountain View Motel on East Harvard 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Three construction workers who had traveled from Palmdale to work on a sewer 
project were shot. Pedro Severa, 28, was dead on arrival at Santa Paula 
Memorial Hospital. Raul Gaxiola, 38, was treated and released, and Miguel 
Gaxiola, 36, was in stable condition at the hospital, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's girlfriend told police that Lopez was upset with the construction 
workers because they were talking to her, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Shy of the state parole unit said Lopez had been released from the 
California Rehabilitation Center in Norco on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 He was imprisoned on drug charges and for receiving stolen property, Shy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was arrested at the Santa Paula Motel after fleeing on foot from the 
crime scene, police said.

NEIGHBORS RESCUE MAN TRAPPED IN LAGUNA NIGUEL FIRE; 59-YEAR-OLD WITH 
HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE LOST HOME BUT NOT LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When residents heard the crackling sounds of fire Tuesday night, they feared 
trouble. When they saw it was Phillip Buttle's house ablaze, they feared big 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttle, 59, has a neural disorder that neighbors said often forced him to 
catch his balance during strolls with his two dogs along La Hermosa Avenue. 
Neighbors watched 35-foot flames leap from the house and worried he'd never get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole garage was one big ball of fire. I realized it was Phil and he has 
Huntington's disease and couldn't get out by himself," said Wy Bauman, whose 
family lives just up the hill. "A healthy person would have trouble getting out 
with that amount of smoke and fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Barclay Bauman, jumped a fence and raced to the burning house, joined 
by next-door neighbor Steve Moseman. Moseman crawled through a smoke-filled 
bedroom toward the sound of coughing, locating Buttle curled on the floor with 
his two cocker spaniels, then dragged him to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttle suffered smoke inhalation and was in fair condition Wednesday at 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the neighbors' quick work probably saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deserve credit for what they did," said Emmy Day, spokeswoman for the 
Orange County Fire Department. "I'm not sure the average person would do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bauman, a 19-year-old student at Saddleback College, was asleep when his 
father heard the crackling noises and then a series of small explosions just 
before midnight. John Bauman said he looked out to see flames leaping from the 
Buttle house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost like somebody dropped a bomb on the house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barclay Bauman awakened to his mother's shouts and ran down the hill to 
Buttle's house in the 24000 block of La Hermosa Avenue as his father called 
911. Moseman, who had been watching television next door, also raced to the 
house, the front part of which was already enveloped by flames and billowing 
smoke, he said. The two ran to the side of the house and Moseman broke a 
bathroom window, calling to see if anyone was inside. No one answered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair went to the rear and Bauman slid open a glass door, unleashing a 
blast of acrid smoke. As he went to open a second sliding door, Moseman heard 
someone coughing inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I heard was a hacking sound, like a guy was coughing up a lung," said 
Moseman, a 24-year-old restaurant worker. "The smoke was incredible. You 
couldn't breathe the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 On his hands and knees, Moseman groped his way toward the noise. Five feet 
inside, he found Buttle, conscious but disoriented, and managed to pull him 
outside to safety before firefighters arrived. The dogs followed them out and 
were unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze destroyed the single-story house, causing a total of more than 
$300,000 in damages, Day said. She said the fire appeared to start in the 
kitchen and may have been sparked by a "careless" action, such as an appliance 
left on. She said neighbors did not hear a smoke alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either there is no smoke detector there or it wasn't working," she said, 
noting the damage to the house was too severe to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Moseman recalled Wednesday that a year ago he was living in Laguna Beach when 
the wildfire swept through and he and neighbors fought to save their homes with 
garden hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird," Moseman said. "I smelled exactly the same a year ago as I did 
last night."

NEW ALLEGATION MADE AGAINST MSGR. HARRIS; DECLARATION: EX-MATER DEI STUDENT 
SAYS THE PRIEST TOUCHED HIM SEXUALLY IN 1979. HE AGREES TO BE A WITNESS FOR 
ANOTHER ALUMNUS WHO HAS MADE A SIMILAR CLAIM AND FILED SUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 For 16 years, it was a secret known only to Mark Curran, a few of his 
relatives and the closest of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week, the Santa Ana tile setter read news reports that Msgr. Michael 
Harris, the popular founding principal of Santa Margarita High School, had been 
accused of molesting two boys when he was principal at Mater Dei High School in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he saw John Barnett, Harris' attorney, blast the priest's accusers on 
television as two sick individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Barnett guy came on and basically made mincemeat out of those two guys," 
Curran, 30, said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Curran, married with a 3-year-old daughter and a baby on the way, decided 
to come forward with his own allegation about Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really want to get involved in this," said Curran, who still lives 
just a few blocks from Mater Dei. "I work 60 hours a week. I have a new baby 
coming. But my brother, my friends, my wife's mother, they said, ' You got to 
do it, Mark.' They told me, ' We can't do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Curran, who says he has no interest in suing Harris, has signed a declaration 
detailing his allegation against the priest and has agreed to serve as a 
witness for David Price, 29, the Mater Dei alumnus whose civil suit alleging 
that Harris had molested him led to the public disclosure that another former 
Mater Dei student had made similar allegations before his death of AIDS last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He heard all these people bashing these two guys that had been harmed," said 
William Paoli, one of Price's attorneys at the Irvine office of attorney 
Theodore Wentworth. "He decided to come forward despite any personal 
embarrassment it might cause him." 
</P>
<P>
 Paoli and Wentworth said they will call Curran as a witness, and on Wednesday 
filed his declaration with the court having jurisdiction over Price's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, Harris' attorney, said he was not aware of Curran's allegations. "I 
don't know who Mr. Curran is, or who he told. But we will certainly investigate 
his allegations," he said, adding, "allegations like these do not come without 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 For Curran, the recent allegations about Harris are at once vindication and a 
painful unearthing of something that he alleges occurred when he was a scrawny, 
5-foot-2 freshman who believed Harris was "what Jesus Christ would be like if 
he was here on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Curran said, he has viewed his alleged betrayal by Harris as the 
moment when he was yanked into the adult world and as a secret he could not 
tell church authorities or his devout mother -- "a Catholic's Catholic." 
Besides, Curran asks, who do you turn to when the man you viewed as the 
ultimate authority wrongs you? 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew no one would believe me," Curran said. "I was a 14-year-old kid. I 
didn't want that tag hanging over me." 
</P>
<P>
 But from his declaration written last Thursday, this is what Curran alleges 
happened: 
</P>
<P>
 Curran was a freshman at Mater Dei, the third of four brothers to attend the 
school. At his eldest brother's urging, Harris had helped Curran, not the best 
of students, get into the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in," Curran alleged in the declaration, he and Harris "spent five days a 
week together, maybe three to 10 hours a day. Lots of times we went to the 
beach or dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris took Curran to a convention of priests at the Anaheim Convention 
Center, where Harris spoke, Curran recalled. "I saw a huge change in my life 
for the better, and formed a desire to become a priest someday," Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one night in 1979, as the pair were sitting on the couch watching a Gene 
Kelly movie at Harris' church-owned home on Batavia Street in Orange, Curran 
contends, Harris "suddenly . . . leaned over, his face right beside mine, less 
than six inches away and he placed his hand on my penis. He didn't just lay it 
there, he grabbed it to manipulate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Curran alleges that he jumped up and asked Harris, " 'What the heck is going 
on here?' I wanted to run and he said, 'Did that bother you?' I said, 'Yes, you 
better believe it bothered me, and I want to get out of here. I want to go 
home.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Curran contends that Harris offered to drive him home, but he ran out and 
walked to a nearby hospital where he called friends to come and take him home. 
</P>
<P>
 In his declaration, Curran said his "admiration for Father Harris had been so 
great" that he told no one except his best friend, Mike McChesney. "I couldn't 
tell anyone else because I didn't want to burst their bubble, and I was 
embarrassed and I didn't understand," Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
 McChesney, who urged Curran to come forward, remembers Curran telling him 
about the alleged incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were tears in his eyes," McChesney recalled. "At first, my reaction was 
disbelief. Father Harris was an idol to Mark. Mark wanted to be a priest 
because of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, his family and friends remember, Curran began to lash out. Curran 
said he begged his mother to take him out of Mater Dei. When she wouldn't, he 
and a couple of friends vandalized the school with brown paint, even painting 
"Mark was here" on Curran's locker. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my conduct, Father Harris knew I wanted to get out of the school," 
Curran said in his declaration. Six weeks later, after Curran refused to do 
homework and insulted all of his teachers, he was expelled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be a priest anymore. I didn't want to go to the school 
anymore. I just wanted out of there," Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran said he didn't tell anyone else until he started dating his wife, 
Wilhelmine, when he was 17. Then he told his brother, Mike, when he was 20. In 
the mid-1980s, he told a few friends he worked with. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Werdel, 37, said Curran first told him his allegations about Harris when 
the pair were tiling homes together in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just came out and told me," remembered Werdel, also a Mater Dei graduate. 
"I think it has personally troubled him a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Werdel, a longtime Curran family friend, said Curran could never have told his 
devout Catholic parents, who still live just down the street from him. "There's 
certain things you don't discuss in that family. That's uncharted territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Curran said his brother Mark told him his allegations shortly after Mark 
got out of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want to tell my mom because it would break her heart," Mike Curran, 
36, remembered. Harris had lived with the family's cousins in Orange for a 
short time when he was still a seminary student, Mike Curran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1987, Mark Curran said in his declaration, he angrily blurted out his 
allegations to his staunchly Catholic in-laws one day as they gushed over 
Harris' fund-raising efforts for Santa Margarita High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scorned. (His mother-in-law) came unglued," Curran remembered. "They 
said, 'No way. You're making that up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nellie Schuurmans, Curran's mother-in-law, admits she didn't believe her 
son-in-law when he made his allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubted it," remembered Schuurmans, a Catholic for 66 years until she 
recently began attending Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa. "But he had no need to 
lie. Who would say something like that about a priest?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the new allegations became public last week, Schuurmans said, she 
finally believed her son-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, after so many years, now that I'm older, I believe it," Schuurmans said. 
"At the time he told me, there was not such a thing as coming forward. When I 
heard (the new allegations), I said to Mark, 'You have to report it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Curran said he didn't tell his mother until she sent him articles in March 
when the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange announced that allegations of sexual 
improprieties had been made against Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 "She made a comment about how Father Harris is being so mistreated in the 
newspaper," Curran said. "I said, 'Mom, Father Harris did some things that were 
not right to your own son.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Curran said he has long since come to terms with what happened to him: "I'm 
not a wounded soldier." But coming forward has been painful. "I basically 
buried it all. Now, it's bringing it all back to the surface."

A SOBERING RECORD; ANAHEIM POLICE OFFICER HAS MADE 422 DRUNK-DRIVING ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Usually, when Police Officer Allen W. Eichorn pulls over a suspected drunk 
driver, the first thing he hears is an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone tells me they've had exactly two beers," Eichorn said while on 
patrol one day last week. "Two beers, every time. No more, no less. Or they 
tell me that they're just tired and have had a long day." 
</P>
<P>
 But Eichorn is nobody's fool. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the Anaheim Police Department's driving-under-the-influence 
(DUI) enforcement team 20 months ago, he has arrested 422 suspected drunk 
drivers -- a stupendous record that continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, he will be honored by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) for 
having made more DUI arrests than any other police officer in Orange County 
during fiscal 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm impressed," said Sgt. Ed Dougherty, Eichorn's supervisor. "He takes his 
job very seriously and is one of the most aggressive officers I've ever seen in 
that position. He's a hustler." 
</P>
<P>
 Eichorn, who has been a police officer for 15 years, said he found his niche 
when he was assigned to the special enforcement team last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go out and arrest someone, once I put them in jail, I get instant 
gratification," he said. "Even if the court dismisses the charge, between now 
and then they are sober and aren't on the streets killing someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, none of Eichorn's DUI arrests have been dismissed in court, police 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty said he thinks Eichorn is successful because he is committed to 
getting drunk drivers off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has real strong feelings about it," Dougherty said. "I think your interest 
really has to be there to do the kind of job he has." 
</P>
<P>
 His achievements bear that out. Eichorn's single-day record is arresting five 
drivers in one night. Once, he even arrested two men in the same car for drunk 
driving. The unique double-arrest occurred shortly after Eichorn spotted a car 
being driven erratically. 
</P>
<P>
 He watched as the driver pulled into a gas station to pick up his 
brother-in-law. At this point, the brother-in-law, who was also intoxicated, 
took over behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped them and ended up taking them both in for DUI," Eichorn recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eichorn said that while a majority of the drivers he arrests are men, there 
really isn't a common profile of the drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all different types of income brackets, race, color and creed," he 
said. "I've pulled over lawyers, businessmen. I once pulled over a nurse who 
had been drinking. She was completely humiliated and wanted to get it all over 
with as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Eichorn begins his shift in the evening and works into the middle of the 
night. The veteran officer demonstrated his technique during an evening last 
week. He had been on duty less than an hour when he spotted a possible drunk 
driver -- the first of three he would arrest that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's driving with his lights off," Eichorn said. He flashed his lights and 
pulled the car over on Katella Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer radioed for backup, then calmly asked the disheveled driver to 
perform a variety of sobriety tests, all of which he appeared to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a classic example of what we are working to get off of the road," 
Eichorn said later. "He might have driven all the way home with his headlights 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving at night without headlights is just one indicator of an impaired 
driver. Other clues are unusually wide turns, straddling the center lane or 
lane marker, weaving or swerving, sudden stops, turning abruptly or illegally, 
driving with a window down in cold weather, responding slowly to traffic 
signals, and driving in the wrong direction, according to MADD. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't realize the consequences," Eichorn said. "And I'm not 
talking about financial cost. If they make the wrong turn, someone gets 
killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Eichorn said that a drunk-driving conviction stays on a driver's record for 
seven years, causes insurance rates to go up and can draw up to $1,200 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County chapter of MADD will induct Eichorn and 12 other local 
officers into the "Century Club" at a dinner on Nov. 11. To qualify for this 
elite group, officers must have made at least 100 DUI arrests from July, 1993, 
through June, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is Eichorn's second year in the Century Club. Last year, he qualified in 
just five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to recognize the best of the best," said Reidel Post, director of 
MADD's Orange County chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, 18 people were killed and 282 people were injured in Anaheim in 
alcohol-related accidents, according to statistics provided by MADD, which 
praised the city for its attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anaheim is a huge city, and there is a need for officers to be on DUI 
enforcement," Post said. "It's obvious that the Anaheim Police Department is 
taking a proactive stance in getting drunk drivers off the road."

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SANTA ANA CITY COUNCIL; RECORD NUMBER OF CANDIDATES TARGET 
CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime, overcrowding and the pinch of steep business-license fees and taxation 
are the battle cries of the coming election here, which includes the largest 
field of candidates in city history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime. Crime. Crime. Mostly crime," Reuben Martinez, a downtown 
small-business owner, said of residents' concerns and the content of much of 
this year's campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
 With longtime Mayor Daniel H. Young stepping out of Santa Ana politics, eight 
candidates -- including Mayor Pro Tem Miguel Pulido Jr. -- are vying for his 
job. Nine more candidates are running for three open council seats, bringing 
the total to 17 and edging the previous record of 16 candidates in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's race also includes the greatest number of young newcomers to 
politics, including a 24-year-old former professional snowboarder who is 
running for mayor and two women running a joint campaign for council seats who 
are so sensitive about their youth that they've listed their ages only as 
"18+." Despite the ample pool of candidates, the Santa Ana Firemen's Benevolent 
Assn., the Police Officers Assn., the Santa Ana City Employees Assn. and the 
Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce are all backing known commodities. All of the 
organizations are supporting Pulido for mayor and council members Robert L. 
Richardson and Patricia A. McGuigan, who are trying to keep their seats. Don 
Blankenship, president of the Police Officers Assn., said he interviewed all 
but three of the candidates.  
</P>
<P>
 "They all talked about crime issues, even the people that I say were totally 
unqualified. I think that they're totally fed up with hearing gunshots at 
night," he said. "It's just what's on everyone's mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The association endorsed the three current council members in part because of 
the City Council's approved a $107-million city jail and police administration 
building earlier this year, Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one race does not include a current council member as a candidate. That 
seat -- being vacated by Pulido in his bid for mayor -- is being sought by Tony 
Espinoza, a 26-year-old deputy probation counselor and planning commissioner 
with a degree in business administration; and banker and neighborhood 
association leader Alberta Christy, 49, who has fought to rid the city of 
nude-dancing establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The city employees union has endorsed Espinoza in that race. The police and 
fire associations and the chamber of commerce have endorsed Christy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido has been in office since 1986, and has worked with Richardson to push 
for new statewide standards that would ease overcrowding by restricting the 
number of people who can live in residences.  
</P>
<P>
 He has plenty of competition. Seven others say they also deserve to be mayor: 
* Ann Avery Andres, 53, is a Santa Ana attorney who says she has drafted a 
three-pronged anti-crime plan and encourages residents to take landlords of 
overcrowded dwellings to small-claims court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arthur A. Castro, 24, is a ski company sales representative and former 
professional snowboarder who said he believes the current leadership often 
overlooks youth and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sal Mendoza, 48, is a businessman and president of the Santa Ana Unified 
School District board who assails the current council for raising the utility 
tax, and water and trash rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * John M. Raya, 41, is a community activist and plumbing contractor who is an 
opponent of recent tax hikes and this year opened an after-school boxing club 
to help keep Santa Ana youth off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * James A. Richards, 54, is an engineer and former school board member who 
identifies Santa Ana's primary problem as overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 * Joseph L. Wagstaff, 32, is a teacher and businessman who has run on a 
campaign of ridding the city of lawbreakers and people who don't care about 
their community. 
</P>
<P>
 * Randell Young, 39, is a musician and businessman who says he believes Santa 
Ana's problems with poverty and crime would diminish if government eased 
restrictions on business and became "market-liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richardson, who won a seat in 1990, is facing off with Ana Y. 
Vasquez, a 26-year-old businesswoman who says the community has been abandoned 
to "gangs, drugs and career criminals" by the current council.  
</P>
<P>
 Richardson has led a city effort to change state law to regulate overcrowding 
in Santa Ana. Vasquez says her primary goal is also to "stop overcrowding." 
Vasquez declined to give her age to the city clerk and was listed simply as 
"18+" because she said she thought voters might be age-biased.  
</P>
<P>
 McGuigan, a 60-year-old homemaker, has served on the council since 1981, with 
a hiatus from 1992 to November, 1993. She is promoting an "open door" policy to 
citizen participation.  
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates are running against McGuigan. They are Sean H. Mill, 28, a 
former recreation and parks commissioner and currently on the Uniform Code 
Appeals board who opposes tax hikes and stresses youth activities; George F. da 
Corte, 57, a postal worker who says he wants to reduce the utility tax and 
educate parents so youth stay out of gangs; Henry Drew, 36, a senior planner at 
McDonnell Douglas who cited his experience in the military as a qualification 
for the job; and Noemi C. Romero, who was appointed in July to the human 
relations commission and said she keep taxes down and create programs for 
youth. Romero declined to give her age, but according to voter registration 
records she is 25. 
</P>
<P>
 In campaign statements covering the period from July 1 to Sept. 30, Pulido, 
Andres and Richardson reported the most contributions. Pulido -- who started 
with a cash balance of $10,000 -- reported raising more than $27,000. Andres 
reported raising more than $35,000, and Richardson -- who started with a 
balance of $33,700 -- reported raising $11,990. So far, only one formal 
complaint has been lodged by a candidate. Mayoral candidate Randell Young said 
he filed a complaint with the Fair Political Practices Commission, alleging 
that a candidates forum held in council chambers on Oct. 12 was "intentionally 
and significantly biased" in favor of Pulido. Pulido and forum organizers deny 
the charge, and an FPPC spokeswoman said the complaint does not appear to come 
under the commission's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of council candidate Tony Espinoza contend that a mailer sent out 
this week by the Police Officers Assn. misleadingly states Espinoza has lived 
in the ward for only a few months. He says he grew up there. 
</P>
<P>
 Election watchers say the tiffs are mild so far compared to years past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to this point I'm kind of surprised there hasn't been as much 
mudslinging," said Guy Ball, who has edited a community newsletter about Santa 
Ana for the past five years. "There's not the real pointed, hard-edge 
competition that there has been in previous years.

TAX APPEAL POLICY MAY BE AGAINST STATE LAW; ASSESSMENTS: OFFICIALS QUESTION 
COUNTY REQUIREMENT THAT CHALLENGES BE FILED WITH THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE RATHER 
THAN THE CLERK OF AN INDEPENDENT BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Orange County's practice of having homeowners and businesses appeal their 
property tax bills to the same agency that assessed their properties may be a 
violation of state law, state officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The county -- which recently bungled at least 170 appeals -- appears to be the 
only county in California that requires property owners to lodge complaints 
about their assessments with the county assessor instead of the clerk of an 
independent appeals board, according to state tax officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is similar to suing a doctor and filing the lawsuit with the 
doctor instead of a court, said Charles Knudsen, the principle appraiser in the 
assessment standards division of the State Board of Equalization. "It just 
seems as a matter of common sense that if you're going to appeal something, you 
would appeal it to the neutral party and not the assessor," Knudsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 County Counsel Terry C. Andrus said Wednesday that the county attempts to 
avoid any legal problem by having employees in the assessor's office deputized 
as appeals board clerks. Nonetheless, he said, the initial handling and 
processing of the appeals is done by the assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure has come under scrutiny recently because the county mishandled 
more than 170 assessment appeals by allowing a statutory two-year review period 
to expire. The bureaucratic snafu means that the county must accept the 
assessments offered by residents or business owners and could cost the county 
millions of dollars in lost tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 James Williams, an attorney for the State Board of Equalization, said Orange 
County officials are skirting the intent of the law with their unusual filing 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no basis in law for filing with the assessor. The filing has to be 
with the county board," said Williams, who also provides legal advice to 
assessment appeal boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the assessor and the taxpayer are opponents in the appeal 
process. Having assessor employees, who are deputized clerks, receive the 
appeal files "gives the impression that (the clerk of board) is not 
independent. It gives the taxpayers a bad taste in their mouths. We would take 
the opposite point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis A. Henderson, the county's assessment appeals board clerk, said the 
arrangement has created some tracking problems in her department because she 
has to rely on the assessor to transfer original files to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would obviously be better if we received them immediately," Henderson 
said. "It would be better for us. We would know the number of appeals and we 
would have control and responsibility for the files." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs has been unavailable for comment this 
week and has directed his staff not to discuss the appeal mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake has outraged members of the Board of Supervisors and spurred an 
internal investigation of the entire process. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fallout from the appeal blunder continued to spread Wednesday. 
County sources said some supervisors are investigating whether they can revoke 
a recently approved raise for Jacobs, who is an elected official and does not 
report to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal problem came to light when county officials realized that they had 
lost an appeal by the Bank of America because the two-year deadline had expired 
before a hearing was held. As a result, the county was forced to accept Bank of 
America's estimate of the value of its property -- a figure that was more than 
$100 million below the assessor's value. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the difference in that case could cost the county as 
much as $3 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Following that incident, county officials conducted a review of hundreds of 
other cases and discovered that the county bungled 178 property assessment 
appeal cases by allowing deadlines to lapse. Additional millions of dollars in 
tax revenue could be lost as a result of those cases, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Schneider, the county administrative officer, said he is still trying to 
determine the magnitude of the problem, including the exact dollar amount and 
number of cases, and find out who is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in process of examining the entire procedure," he said. "There needs 
to be one, centralized focal point for this entire process. We'll be examining 
what other counties are doing and taking a look at the state statutes." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have leveled blame at Henderson and Jacobs. But neither has 
accepted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said Wednesday that her office cannot find the original files for 
the 178 cases that have passed the deadline. She said she does not know whether 
the tax assessor ever transferred the cases to her office, or whether her 
office lost them. There is no process for tracking those files from office to 
office, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said the problem might not have occurred had the county followed the 
procedure of most, if not all, other counties in the state. That procedure 
requires that property owners file their appeals with the appeals board clerk, 
not the assessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Aileen Matheis, a Newport Beach attorney who serves on one of the appeals 
boards, estimated that her panel reduced assessments on about 60% of all 
commercial parcels that were reviewed during hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other parcels were reduced in value when the assessor's office reached 
agreements with property owners, eliminating the need for appeals hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheis said the boards had granted many assessment adjustments because of the 
faltering real estate market, which caused reductions in property values 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials calculate property assessment based on the "historic" value 
of each parcel, Matheis said. In most cases, the county increases the assessed 
value of parcels by 2% annually.

<P>
 Authorities are investigating a possible gay-bashing attack Sunday on two men 
near a Buena Park bar that has a gay clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a group of three to five men shouted anti-gay epithets in Spanish, 
slashed the victims with broken bottles and beat them before stealing the car 
in which the two were talking while parked near Ozz, a bar and restaurant on 
Manchester Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were seeking the attackers Wednesday. The victims' car -- stripped and 
badly damaged -- was found several blocks away on Monday, said Sgt. Robert F. 
Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomas Canas, 32, of Fullerton suffered a fractured skull in the attack and was 
released Wednesday night from St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton. Alex 
Saucedo, 26, of Long Beach was treated at the same hospital for severe cuts and 
bruises to the face and head. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were sitting in Canas' car in a parking lot across the street from the 
bar when the men approached and pulled them from the car, Chaney said. Canas 
said in a brief interview from his hospital room that attackers yelled epithets 
and cursed as they beat him and Saucedo. KEN ELLINGWOOD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; STUDY SOUGHT ON PLAN TO RELEASE WASTE 
WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has requested an environmental study on possible effects of a 
plan by the Irvine Ranch Water District to release partially treated waste 
water from duck ponds near the Irvine-Newport Beach boundary into San Diego 
Creek, from where it would ultimately flow into Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved by the California Regional Water Quality Control 
Board, water draining into the bay could increase nitrates there by 1,000 
pounds a day -- an estimated 27% rise, according to water district consultants 
working on the proposed Wetlands Demonstration Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The water district wants to run a projected 15 million gallons of water a day 
through three duck ponds to filter out some of the nitrates, then pump the 
water into the creek. The duck ponds were abandoned by two shooting clubs in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 While the plan would pose no threat to people, Newport Beach environmentalists 
fear the increased nitrates would increase the Back Bay algae blooms they have 
worked to reduce over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to drive out there today, it looks like a golf course," 
environmentalist Jack Skinner told the council, referring to the algae blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "One cannot argue that it's a health hazard like human waste (would be)," he 
said. "It can interfere with the enjoyment of the bay, such as kayaking, 
swimming and fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Schneider, environmental program manager for the state water quality 
board, said the agency is unlikely to approve the Irvine plan without a focused 
environmental impact report on the project's effects on the bay. HOLLY J.

 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District board and its new financing agency 
have authorized the sale of $5.3 million in bonds to fund a new district 
headquarters and school improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The certificates of participation offered by the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District Public Financing Authority will pay for a $1.26-million heating, 
ventilation and air-conditioning system at Corona del Mar High School, an 
expense that will be reimbursed by developer fees.Another $3.2 million of the 
money will be used for construction of the planned Education Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards authorized the sale of the certificates between now and 
Thanksgiving. Investors will buy the certificates in $5,000 increments, Finance 
Director Michael Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certificate holders will be paid back over 10 to 15 years, depending on the 
deal the district is able to get. The revenue will come from leasing district 
properties.  
</P>
<P>
 When it is completed in 1995, the Education Center at Baker and Bear streets 
in Costa Mesa will be the new headquarters for district administrators now 
based in aging temporary bungalows at a corner of Newport Harbor High 
School.HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH/COSTA MESA; SCHOOL DRUG SEARCHES GET 
INITIAL APPROVAL

<P>
 A policy to use drug-sniffing dogs at Newport Beach and Costa Mesa high school 
and middle school campuses won preliminary approval Tuesday on a 5-2 vote of 
the Newport-Mesa Unified School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members Sherry Loofbourrow and Martha Fluor voted against the plan.They 
said the plan has the potential of creating a climate of suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not see any positive benefit that even remotely comes close to 
outweighing the negative effects," Loofbourrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor agreed but also protested the policy's failure to address the substances 
teen-agers most commonly abuse: alcohol and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still not convinced that this is the next step that we as a district need 
to take to discourage the use of drugs on campus," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Roderick H. MacMillian supported the policy despite an amendment 
requiring four searches a year at the schools. He said he opposed having a set 
number of searches. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward H. Decker acknowledged that the plan seems drastic. But 
he said the school community would become accustomed to it as a necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy includes provisions to post notices at campus entrances of possible 
locker and car searches.  
</P>
<P>
 Students need not be present for locker searches, but school officials will 
try to contact the drivers for car searches if a dog indicates the likelihood 
that drugs are inside. Otherwise, police would handle a search when a car 
leaves the campus. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS PROP. 187 WILL 
COST IT MILLIONS 
</P>

<P>
 Proposition 187 would cost the Capistrano Unified School District as much as 
$12.5 million in new expenses and lost revenue if approved, according to a 
report prepared by the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Monday asked Supt.James A. Fleming to publicize the predicted 
impact that the controversial state ballot initiative would have on the school 
district of 33,000 students. The $12.5 million figure takes into consideration 
any savings the initiative would have on the district, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board did not take an official position on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But Trustee Peter J. Espinosa said that the more he studied the initiative, 
the "more poisonous I find it." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative proposes to deny most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district said the cost would include an estimated $15 to $20 per 
pupil to verify legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
 If the initiative were found to violate federal law, the district could lose 
about $3.5 million in federal funding for several programs, according to the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming told trustees that the report represented the district's "best guess," 
based on available information. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL APPROVES HOUSING FOR DISABLED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have given developers approval to build an 
affordable-housing complex for people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Rehabilitation Institute of Southern California, will offer the 
25 apartment units at monthly rents ranging from $379 to $618, including 
utility costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a condition of approval, the rents must remain at comparable levels for 99 
years. Also, the city Redevelopment Agency will spend about $39,000 upgrading a 
water main at the 2.12-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment complex will share its address, 2200 E. Chapman Ave., with 
another soon-to-be constructed project -- a 27-unit apartment complex for 
lower-income people that drew complaints from dozens of residents who said it 
would create traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments for the disabled, however, prompted no such opposition and 
received unanimous approval from the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a worthwhile project," Councilman Chris Norby said. "It addresses a 
specific need group." 
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the project is expected by the end of 1996, officials said.MIMI

</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has a new law outlining how all public trees are to be planted, 
maintained, removed or otherwise managed. 
</P>
<P>
 Approved by the City Council last week, it holds property owners responsible 
for watering trees abutting their property in the public right of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, owners of trees on private property that cause damage to public property 
such as sidewalks will be responsible for rectifying the damage. It could 
include replacing a tree or paying for damages. The city will take corrective 
measures as well if a public tree damages private property. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also prohibits people from "disfiguring" trees on public 
property by severely cutting the top. However, such a cut may be allowed if the 
tree is under utility wires. 
</P>
<P>
 Violators could be cited and fined, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, historically or culturally significant trees will be 
designated "landmark" trees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the law shifts responsibility for planting, removing and caring 
for city trees from the public works director to the director of maintenance 
services. That director will be in charge of designing "community forestry 
themes" involving the use of trees for major traffic routes and districts.MIMI

<TEXT>
<P>
 A combative Curtis Stricker, who is challenging incumbent Tom Daly for the 
mayor's seat, called his opponent "a flop as mayor" during a lively televised 
debate this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stricker charged that Daly has aligned himself too closely with Disney while 
ignoring problems such as crime and deteriorating neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly calmly defended his record and accused his opponent of making "empty 
charges." He stated that Disney and surrounding hotels and motels bring major 
tax dollars to city coffers and said the city has hired 22 new police officers 
in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates squared off Tuesday in the studios of MultiVision Cable TV 
during a one-hour debate, which was preceded by a forum with 13 of the 16 City 
Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, posed a series of 
questions to the mayoral and City Council candidates on city issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Topics included: the proposed expansion of Disneyland, plans to revitalize the 
area surrounding the theme park and the Rams' future in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the candidates said crime is the biggest issue facing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, taped by Multi-Vision Cable TV, will air repeatedly until the Nov. 
8 election. Airings are scheduled from 7 to 10 p.m. on Oct. 27 and 28, and on 
Nov. 1 and 3 on Channel 45. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the City Council candidates' debate will air on Channel 3 from 7:30 
to 9:30 p.m. followed by the mayoral debate from 10:30 to 11:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents who want to see the candidates debate live, a forum sponsored by 
the Orange County Congregation Community Organization will take place at 7 p.m. 
Sunday. The event will be at the St. Justin Martyr Hall, 2050 W. Ball Road.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; FOREIGN AID PART OF LESSON IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Ari Guiragos Minassian Armenian School are studying computers, 
fine arts, biology and all the other usual subjects. But they're also learning 
about the importance of charity -- and the harsh realities of life in the 
former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago the school "adopted" what was originally called School No. 58 
in the Armenian capital of Yerevan, and is now named for writer/poet Mousegh 
Ishkhan, who was persona non grata during the Communist era. 
</P>
<P>
 Facilitating relief efforts for the children in Yerevan and the cultural 
exchanges is Tustin resident Sylvie Tertzakian. She said that as a result of 
the interaction, students in Santa Ana have learned that items they take for 
granted, such as toothbrushes and electricity, are considered luxuries in 
Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 The impoverished country is suffering under a trade blockade organized by 
Azerbaijan and its allies as part of the Nagorno-Karabakh war. The United 
States has been sending emergency humanitarian assistance such as food, 
clothing and medical supplies to Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Tertzakian has collected $17,000 in cash donations and supplies for 
the dilapidated school in Armenia. That's a substantial sum, she said, 
considering that teachers there get paid the equivalent of $1 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're living at a survival level," said Tertzakian, who describes the 
relief effort as a small and manageable program "that doesn't get lost in 
bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Vahram Shemmassian, principal of the Santa Ana school, said his students have 
had fund-raisers for their Armenian counterparts and have been corresponding by 
mail on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon they will be communicating on-line via the Internet. Computers have been 
donated to both schools by several groups in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to impact positively on Armenia," Shemmassian said, by sharing 
"what is worthwhile and applicable from the West." At the same time, students 
of Armenian heritage in the United States can learn about the culture of their 
ancestors, and perhaps offer some solace as fuel-starved Armenia braces for a 
harsh winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hopeful time," Shemmassian said, "and a fearful time." ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; NUDE CLUB'S REQUEST TO STOP RAIDS DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Santa Ana won a court victory Wednesday against Paddy Murphy's, a 
nude dancing establishment that sought a preliminary injunction to stop police 
from raiding the club and arresting its dancers on charges of lewd conduct.  
</P>
<P>
 Paddy Murphy's filed a lawsuit earlier this month, alleging that the arrests 
of the dancers infringed on their First Amendment protections and created a 
chilling effect at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Many dancers have quit and others refuse to dance on Friday nights, when the 
police raids have occurred, the lawsuit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our argument is that anything you do on that stage cannot be lewd conduct, 
because it's entertainment," said Marc Lebovitz, the attorney for Paddy 
Murphy's. "Lewd conduct is the guy in a park who exposes himself to a Girl 
Scout. Entertainers, performing on a stage, dancing, can never be lewd 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge David H. Brickner, however, disagreed that the arrests 
violated the women's First Amendment rights and denied the request for an 
injunction. A trial date is set for Dec. 12, Lebovitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has argued that the nude dancing establishment should not be 
considered a "theater," where nudity would be protected as free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Bob Wheeler commended the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very important victory for the city. We are very gratified by the 
judge's decision," Wheeler said. LEE ROMNEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; TRUSTEE SETS UP PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustee Max Reissmueller, who has advocated privatizing schools in the Orange 
Unified School District, has made the issue a family affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller and his wife, Angela, filed an affidavit with the county 
Department of Education Oct. 10 stating that they have established a school 
called Orange Christian Academy.The form lists Reissmueller as principal, his 
wife as teacher, and one first-grader as the student body. The address of the 
school is the same as that given for the Reissmuellers' home. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple described the academy as a coeducational day school that is 
religion-based but not affiliated with a church. The school offers a high 
school diploma program and does not claim tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller refused to comment, stating only that "my children are not a 
public issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The trustee, a 26-year-old electronics manager, won his seat on the school 
board last November after running on an "anti-tax" platform that earned him 
endorsements from Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Assemblyman Mickey 
Conroy (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 District officials would not confirm or deny that the Reissmuellers took their 
child out of public school. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oct. 13 school board meeting, Reissmueller indicated that he would 
support privatizing some district services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to my experience with public and private firms, I would take private any 
day," Reissmueller said at the meeting. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT SETTLES SUIT BY EX-CHANCELLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former North Orange County Community College District Chancellor James 
Kellerman has accepted a $385,000 settlement in his wrongful termination 
lawsuit against the district. District spokeswoman Donna Hatchett said the 
district did not admit any liability or wrongdoing in settling the case on the 
eve of a scheduled civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kellerman nor his lawyer, Ronald G. Parker, could be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellerman joined the district as vice chancellor in 1985 and was appointed 
chancellor in February, 1986. He was placed on administrative leave April 12, 
1989, after two trustees accused him of misusing his expense account. The board 
voted to terminate his contract May 23, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He sued the district the following October, alleging that the firing cost him 
his $97,000-a-year job and the status that went with it. He was subsequently 
hired by an association of community colleges in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 Kellerman's suit also contended that two trustees defamed him with their 
allegations and that the board denied him an opportunity to respond. He also 
claimed that trustees trumped up unfavorable performance evaluations to justify 
firing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County district attorney's investigators declined to file charges 
against Kellerman after checking out allegations that he accepted paid 
vacations and other gifts from a firm that later won a $1.5-million district 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The district earlier paid a $125,000 settlement to its previous chancellor, 
Leadie Clark, who was fired after several trustees objected to her leadership 
style. HOLLY J. WAGNER

MAN IN FATAL CRASH CONVICTED OF SECOND-DEGREE MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Orange man involved in a fatal crash while trying to escape 
police was convicted Wednesday of two counts of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Alden Whitson faces 15 years to life in prison on each murder count when 
he is sentenced in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash killed a passenger in his car, Derick Romo, 26, of Moreno Valley, 
and the driver of another, Janice Diehm, 46, of Fountain Valley. Whitson and 
two others were injured, including a passenger in Diehm's car who nearly died. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Kirkwood contended during the trial that Whitson 
was "stone-cold sober" and knew what he was doing on the night of the June 11, 
1993, crash, making the case one of murder rather than manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Whitson had run at least two red lights and reached speeds of about 
80 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had engaged in very, very dangerous driving for a distance of almost two 
miles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Gary Pohlson told the jury in his opening trial statements 
that Whitson "made a huge error that he will suffer for the rest of his life," 
but that he should be found guilty of the lesser charge of manslaughter. He 
said Whitson is "functionally retarded" and had been urged by his passengers to 
keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't thinking," the lawyer said. "He was just panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes before the crash, a Costa Mesa motorcycle officer spotted a man 
running in a dark parking lot. The man, who got in Whitson's car, had been 
trying to steal a stereo, Kirkwood said in her opening statements to the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle officer then saw Whitson's car speed through a red light with 
its lights out. He followed the car but did not chase it because of the 
dangerous speeds, she said. Whitson had run a red light at Ward Street and 
Slater Avenue in Fountain Valley when he plowed into Diehm's car, Kirkwood 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason the defendant survived is because he had an air bag," 
Kirkwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diehm, a marriage and family counselor, had been out to dinner with her 
husband that night, and was driving home a baby-sitter when the crash occurred. 
Diehm's husband, worried when she didn't return from what should have been a 
short trip, went out looking for her and came upon the crash scene, Kirkwood 
said.

FAIRVIEW PARK TO GET NATIVE SHRUBS, GRASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A portion of Fairview Park will soon be blooming with native California plants 
-- all at a cost of $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council allocated the money to the Fairview Park Committee at a 
recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee requested the money after Robb Hamilton, chairman of the Orange 
County chapter of the California Native Plant Society, showed the committee a 
plan last month for rejuvenating the park on Placentia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The native plantings include California sagebrush, Brewer's salt brush, 
California sunflower, buckwheat and giant wild rye. 
</P>
<P>
 The plants, which will be set out in November, will not require irrigation.

CURBS ON FISHING OFF NEW ENGLAND COAST ARE BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators, hoping to stem the collapse of fish stocks, approved a 
measure Wednesday to impose harsh new restrictions on fishing off the New 
England coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, endorsed by the New England Fishery Management Council, which 
regulates commercial fishing, could lead to a complete prohibition of fishing 
on the Georges Bank, once one of the world's richest fishing grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry fishermen charged that the restrictions will ruin their already troubled 
industry, and accused scientists and environmentalists of overstating the 
problem. 
</P>

VOTERS SHOULD DEMAND CHANGE IN SENATE FILIBUSTER RULES, GROUP SAYS 
</P>

<P>
 Voters should demand that Senate candidates vow to end government gridlock by 
changing the filibuster rules that cause it, a bipartisan group of retired 
senators and senior politicians said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that when they see gridlock in Washington, it's because 
our leaders can't get a majority in Congress to agree," said former Atty. Gen. 
Elliot L. Richardson, a Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last session of Congress, majorities favored reforming 
campaign-finance laws, requiring lobbyists to disclose who pays for their 
services, updating laws related to toxic-waste cleanup and protecting drinking 
water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of these bills died, not because they lacked majority support, but 
because a minority of senators filibustered -- simply refusing to let the 
Senate vote," Richardson said at a news conference called by Action, Not 
Gridlock, a privately funded group dedicated to changing the Senate's way of 
doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, departing Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said in an 
interview that he agreed the rules should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last week before adjournment, "we had five separate filibusters going 
at the same time," he said. As recently as the 1960s, the Senate averaged only 
two filibusters a year.

17TH-CENTURY CEILING TO GRACE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17th-Century carved ceiling that once sheltered Spanish monks and then 
languished for years in William Randolph Hearst's estate has found a new home 
in Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Workers this week began installing massive beams, each weighing half a ton, to 
support the 370-year-old ornate ceiling in an expansive new central library 
being built at Thomas Aquinas College. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernardine Library will house 20,000 books, mainly Western 
civilization's greatest and most influential works that make up the school's 
"Great Books" curriculum, said Thomas Aquinas President Thomas Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceiling will be the centerpiece of the 18,550-square-foot library, set to 
open next spring, Dillon said. It was donated to the college last year by 
William P. Clark of Paso Robles, who served as national security adviser and 
Interior Department secretary during the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon predicted that the 220 students will be drawn to the new $2.2-million 
library as a tranquil place to read and reflect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very much concerned with the good, the truth and the beautiful," 
Dillon said. "And the ceiling certainly is beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark bought the Renaissance-style ceiling from the estate of William Randolph 
Hearst several years ago, said John Holecek, Thomas Aquinas' director of public 
information. The 1,200-square-foot ceiling is carved in a recessed-checkerboard 
pattern and features square panels painted in a stylized floral design overlaid 
in gilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark intended to install the ceiling in a community chapel near his ranch 
outside Paso Robles but ended up using another, more ornate ceiling, Holecek 
said. Clark decided last year to give the ceiling to the Santa Paula college, 
partly because his ancestors are Ventura County pioneers, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also was attracted by the school's method of teaching the liberal arts 
through classic texts discussed in small seminars and tutorials, Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisers have placed the ceiling's worth at nearly $300,000, Holecek said. 
But some, including Holecek, believe it is priceless because countries 
increasingly do not allow such treasures to leave their borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The college retained Norman Neuerburg, an expert in ancient architecture, to 
supervise the restoration and installation of the ceiling. Neuerburg discovered 
through research that the ceiling was carved for a monastery built in the 1620s 
in Grenada, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The monastery's inhabitants belonged to an order called Discazed Mercedarian, 
which, loosely translated, means Order of the Barefoot Monks of Mercy, 
Neuerburg said. These monks were charged with rescuing Christians who had been 
enslaved by pirates roaming the Mediterranean Sea, Neuerburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Hearst bought the ceiling in the 1920s, it remained in a leaky warehouse 
near Hearst Castle, still packed in its original Spanish shipping crates, until 
this spring, Holecek said. That is when it was hauled to the Thomas Aquinas 
campus on three 18-wheel flatbed trucks, Holecek said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Neuerburg and others unpacked the crates, they discovered two Stars of 
David carved into the back side of one beam. The stars were probably put there 
370 years ago by a Jewish carpenter intent on leaving his mark where it 
couldn't be seen, Neuerburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, this was during the height of the Spanish Inquisition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Paula, Neuerburg worked with Mel Knowles, a wood restoration expert 
based in Santa Barbara, to restore sections damaged by water, termites and 
other infestations.  
</P>
<P>
 Knowles and some students spent the summer restaining wood and repainting 
sections where the original paint had faded. Only a few pieces of the ceiling 
were so damaged they could not be used, Neuerburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Installation of the entire ceiling is expected to take several weeks, Holecek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a small band of construction workers watched as the first of the 
14 giant beams was successfully fitted. Alan von Doeren was one of several 
carpenters who seemed awed by the prospect of installing a ceiling built during 
the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing," von Doeren said. "All of the carving and craftsmanship was 
done by hand back then, and they made it all work. Today, we have power drills, 
electric saws and hydraulic machines to do all the hard work, and we still 
don't get it right sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 And then von Doeren revealed something that closed a 370-year gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "See that beam," he said, pointing to the newly installed column of ancient 
wood. "I signed my name on it."

REHIRING OF FIRED COLLEGE OFFICIAL BACKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard College bookstore manager, fired in June for shoddy record-keeping, 
could win back her $60,000-a-year job under a ruling proposed by the district's 
personnel commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said Ventura County Community College District trustees acted 
too harshly in firing Sharon Davies, a 22-year employee dismissed after an 
independent audit uncovered numerous accounting errors and losses of $40,000 or 
more in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is expected to be approved tonight at a meeting of the 
three-member commission, which is appointed by the governing board. Trustees 
could then accept the ruling or fight it in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission recommends that Davies, 52, return to work Tuesday, four months 
after she was informed by letter that she had been fired. It also suggests that 
she be placed on six months probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The punishment was too severe for the negligence," said Commissioner James G. 
McDonald, who signed the ruling released by the district Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was quite delinquent in handling the bookkeeping, but very good at 
everything else," he said. "It just seemed to us that terminating her was a 
little more than what should have been done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner James D. Faulconer agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly Ms. Davies had some shortcomings that need to be corrected," 
Faulconer said. "But it seemed like the action taken was a little too severe 
given the information presented." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees and district officials contacted Wednesday declined to comment on the 
ruling. But David C. Bernstein, who represented Davies at the administrative 
hearing, praised commission members for their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased the system worked the way it's supposed to," he said. 
"The commission did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Stuart W. Rudnick, who represented the three-campus district in the 
hearings, also declined to discuss the ruling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But he argued last week that Davies' accounting practices were "filled with 
errors and inaccuracies." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no alternative but to terminate the employee relationship," Rudnick 
told commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein argued at the two-day hearing that his client was never warned that 
she may be fired, and was promoted and told that she was doing good work as 
recently as last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees voted in private in June to fire Davies after an April audit turned 
up serious flaws in the record-keeping system at the Oxnard College bookstore, 
which sells nearly $1 million in books and goods each year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the personnel commission ruled that although Davies failed to maintain 
adequate financial records, the district acted unfairly in firing her without 
providing further training in accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the district's often-stated grave concern for the financial controls 
needed in the bookstore, the commission finds it surprising that this subject 
apparently was never specifically addressed during any of Ms. Davies' 
performance reviews," the ruling states. 
</P>
<P>
 The order also stipulates that both Davies and the district take 
responsibility for their own attorney fees, and that Davies not be compensated 
for lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cost her quite a bit of money," McDonald said. "She was in effect 
suspended without pay until Nov. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit was ordered in April after district accountants working to 
centralize bookkeeping were unable to make sense of the records that Davies 
submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 It concluded that cash registers were not closed out each day, records were 
not properly maintained and internal controls over cash receipts were 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sharp criticism of Davies' record-keeping abilities, auditors and 
commission members said there was no evidence that Davies was responsible for 
bookstore losses of $40,000 or more over the last six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees will meet Tuesday and are expected to discuss the matter in 
closed session.

ELECTIONS CAMARILLO COUNCIL; CANDIDATES FIRED UP OVER AIRFIELD USE, CREEK 
COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two most fiery issues to emerge in this year's Camarillo City Council race 
are proposals whose ultimate fate may be out of the council's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 A $10-million plan by a local developer to alter the course of Calleguas Creek 
and build an estimated 1,000 single- and multi-family houses, and a proposal to 
develop joint civilian and military use of the airfield at the Point Mugu Navy 
base have sparked the most interest among the six candidates seeking three 
seats in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Because both projects involve county, state and federal approval, incumbent 
candidates Charlotte Craven, Stanley J. Daily and Charles K. (Ken) Gose have 
warned that the City Council may have little say in deciding their outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Calleguas Creek proposal, a one-mile stretch of the creek would be 
moved and made deeper by developer Pardee Construction Co. The company wants to 
build about 100 of the 1,000 houses on the former creek bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the complicated project can go forward, however, Pardee must gain 
approval from the county Board of Supervisors and state and federal 
environmental agencies. The city has jurisdiction over only zoning, layout and 
architectural aesthetics of the subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 The Point Mugu proposal, which recently was declared technically feasible by a 
citizen investigative committee, must be approved by the county Board of 
Supervisors before being formally presented to the U.S. Navy and the Department 
of Defense for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three City Council challengers, Richard L. Lundberg, Jackie W. Mathis 
and Robert P. Radnoti, have argued that the City Council needs to be more 
assertive in representing the views of its constituents, many of whom oppose 
both projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dodging the issue is easy to do," said Mathis, a 42-year-old business 
executive and Air National Guard pilot who wants to bring a more businesslike 
approach to the city's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to do is to express the city's opposition to this directly to 
the Board of Supervisors," Mathis said. "We need to enlist the help of other 
cities to do this. Collectively, we could bring a change in their plans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Lundberg, 65, said that despite the position of the incumbents, the 
public can impact matters directly out of the control of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very supportive of the idea of having strong neighborhood associations," 
Lundberg said. "And if the public really cares (about Calleguas Creek) they'd 
better make some noise and let their views be known." 
</P>
<P>
 But although the candidates differed on how much influence the council may 
have over the Calleguas Creek project, all six were united in their opposition 
to the proposed joint military and commercial use of the Point Mugu Naval Air 
Weapons Station. They say the plan will lead to increased noise, air pollution 
and safety problems for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Mathis said he would consider the merits of the airport plan if flights 
over Camarillo could be prevented. If they cannot be avoided, he said, he will 
oppose the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also agreed that the city should fight to maintain the 
greenbelts and prime agricultural land that surround the city. And incumbents 
and challengers alike said the city should involve itself more in helping to 
provide better recreation for young residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, Craven, 50, said it is easy to fight against something if taking such a 
position is politically popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until you get on the council and you find out how things work and you start 
spending the kind of time necessary to study the issues, you don't really 
know," said Craven, a two-term council veteran. "Sometimes you are most 
effective when you know when to pull your punches." 
</P>
<P>
 Radnoti, a 36-year-old quality control specialist, has been seen campaigning 
door-to-door in a pair of in-line skates. He says the council needs a member 
with expertise in technological fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like our council. I think they are fine, honorable people," Radnoti said. 
"My candidacy, however, is about bringing some technical expertise to the dais. 
I know a lot of the stuff that the current council has to rely on staff or 
consultants to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Lundberg, a semi-retired missile systems engineer, last year joined in a 
successful lawsuit with an Oxnard businessman to block the city from providing 
tax rebates to the developers of a factory outlet mall. As a council member, he 
said, one of his major issues would be to decrease crime in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a recent rash of violent crimes in the city, Lundberg said out-of-town 
criminals are finding easy prey in Camarillo because of its accessibility from 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to prevent these people from flying off the freeway and assaulting 
our citizens," Lundberg said. "We need to increase patrols near the freeway on- 
and off-ramps." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lundberg said Camarillo would be better served by its own police force than by 
the Ventura County Sheriff's Department because officers would have less area 
to patrol and response times could be decreased. 
</P>
<P>
 The incumbents, all of whom have campaigned on their records, said they are 
asking voters to examine their service to the city and then vote their minds 
accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven has been the city's leading opponent of the proposed joint use of the 
Point Mugu Navy base airfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have something here to worry about," Craven said. "They are 
projecting this facility to serve as many as 2.5 million people a year. I don't 
want to see our town turn into another South Gate or Compton. We have to try 
and stop this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Craven also pointed to her role in helping to establish the city's first 
anti-graffiti, skateboarding and smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily, 59, who was mayor for five years and is seeking his fifth council term, 
said one of his primary concerns will be preservation of the greenbelt and 
prime agricultural land around the city of 56,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try to preserve that greenbelt until my last dying breath," Daily said. 
"I think it's an important part of our history and it's an important symbol of 
our city's agricultural heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also high on his agenda, Daily said, is finding stable sources of commercial 
tax revenue for the city -- sources such as the $500,000 anticipated revenue 
from the factory outlet mall now under construction on Ventura Boulevard. And 
he said he supports the city's recent efforts to lure businesses to Camarillo 
from elsewhere in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Gose, who is completing his first term on the council and currently serves as 
the city's mayor, is attempting to walk the city in a door-to-door campaign as 
he did when he was elected four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A 73-year-old former Navy intelligence officer and high school civics teacher, 
Gose often lectures his council colleagues using colorful and passionate 
speeches in support of constitutional and individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has often cast the lone opposing vote on issues such as increases in 
employee salaries, which he says should be in line with salaries for similar 
jobs in neighboring cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid to vote alone and I've demonstrated that quite a few times," 
Gose said. "It's not that I like voting against the majority, it's just that I 
feel you have to stand up for what you believe in."

2ND MEDFLY SPRAYING DRAWS LITTLE PROTEST; MALATHION: AS LATEST AERIAL ASSAULT 
TAKES PLACE, MANY RESIDENTS SAY THEY ARE LESS ANXIOUS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO. BUT 
SOME STILL FEAR HEALTH RISKS. 
</P>

<P>
 Three helicopters laden with tanks of bug-killing malathion lifted off from 
the Camarillo Airport on schedule Wednesday night, beginning the second aerial 
spraying over Ventura County's 16-square-mile Medfly eradication zone. 
</P>
<P>
 With a thunderous beating of blades, the helicopters circled above 10 
sign-toting protesters who congregated at the airport to demonstrate against 
spraying insecticide over the homes of 32,000 people in Camarillo and Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There they go, sweet dreams Camarillo," said protester Anne Engelstad, 38, of 
Thousand Oaks. As she watched the helicopters fly in formation toward 
Camarillo, she turned to her 8-year-old son. "It's just spooky," she said. 
"I've never seen anything like this in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 During the four-hour incursion, the helicopters executed the second in a 
series of twice-a-month aerial assaults scheduled through April to knock out 
any future generations of the crop-destroying pest. 
</P>
<P>
 After experiencing a similar spraying two weeks ago, some Camarillo residents 
said they felt more comfortable knowing what to expect. Two weeks ago they 
thought they would awaken to a sticky film on every surface, but found it 
difficult to see the pesticide residue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem like such a hardship," said Kathy Cardenas of Camarillo, 
picking up her two children from elementary school Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But other residents, particularly the parents of young children, voiced 
greater concern about the long-term health effects of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Jacobs of Camarillo took her 6-year-old son to a girlfriend's house in 
Ventura to spend the night, as she did two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has asthma," she explained. "I'm extremely concerned about the possible 
health effects. It scares me. There are no studies that show this is safe for 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents complained they are already tired of draping their cars with 
plastic to protect paint jobs, pulling patio furniture into garages and hosing 
down their back yards to protect pets from the sticky sweet mixture of corn 
syrup and insecticide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a headache," said Harry Becker, 80, a Leisure Village resident 
frustrated that a 9-by-12-foot tarp wasn't big enough to cover his 1987 
Cadillac. He improvised with plastic bags. "Our freedom is being invaded in 
order to protect the profits of the grower." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said he has heard very little outcry from his constituents 
since the first aerial spraying on Oct. 12. "The first time there were quite a 
few people who were upset," Gose said. "They've calmed down considerably." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the first aerial spraying, the pesticide-laden helicopters on Wednesday 
were not chased by a thick flock of copters from TV news stations. That came as 
a relief to some agriculture officials who were alarmed at the crowded skies 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It scared a lot of residents," said Carla Agar, spokeswoman of the California 
Department of Food and Agriculture. "We were telling them it was only going to 
be three helicopters, and instead it looked like Armageddon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the three helicopters loaded with 120-gallon tanks and joined by an 
observation helicopter set off on their expedition into skies clear of clouds 
and air traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Light winds did not affect the mission, although ground crews placed white 
cards strategically around the perimeter of the spray zone to detect if the 
orange-brown mixture drifts out of the set boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Oct. 12 spraying, none of the cards picked up wayward drops of 
malathion and corn syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 But an internal flight recorder on one of the three Bell helicopters showed 
that a spray nozzle was not turned off until the helicopter was 50 to 60 feet 
outside of the northeast corner of the spray zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Hendrix, a spokesman for the Cooperative Medfly Project, said the 
over-spray occurred over an orange orchard, and not over a residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying Wednesday was the second of as many as a dozen such aerial 
attacks scheduled over the next 5 1/2 months to combat the infestation and 
preserve the county's lucrative citrus sales to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The agricultural crisis began on Sept. 29 when authorities discovered two 
fertile female Medflies in a fig tree at St. John's Seminary. Over the next 
week, traps caught a total of 63 Medflies, all but one on seminary grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Medfly larvae not only destroy oranges and avocados and other fruit, but the 
presence of the pest can scare off foreign countries that pay top dollar for 
the choicest fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan was considering banning fruit from California because of the 
infestation, said county Agriculture Commissioner Earl McPhail. But he said a 
visiting Japanese delegation, impressed with initial eradication efforts, 
agreed to limit the country's ban to fruit grown in an 86-square-mile 
quarantine zone that covers most of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparation for Wednesday night's spraying, hundreds of Camarillo residents 
picked up plastic tarps from a local agriculture group to protect their cars 
and outdoor furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clint McCaslin and other custodians covered a large sandbox at Las 
Colinas Elementary School, anchoring the plastic with sandbags. Half a dozen 
volunteers promised to help scrub the pesticide from tables and jungle gyms 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several Ventura hotels offered a special, one-night Medfly rate, and each 
received up to half a dozen reservations from Camarillo residents. The 
Doubletree Hotelreported reservations from Camarillo were slightly higher two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport Wednesday night, 10 residents staged a low-key protest behind a 
fence that protected the helicopters' staging area. The demonstrators set up a 
card table and handed out flyers titled "Malathion Spells Murder." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation included members of the Group Against Spraying People. Some 
carried signs, saying "Don't Spray People," "Spray your property, not mine," 
and "Wilson's emergency is now our emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've blinded Camarillans for too long," said Beth Fraley, 32, who 
moved from a rented house in Camarillo with her two children to a house in 
Oxnard. She said she needed to escape the spraying after experiencing health 
problems two weeks ago. "They don't want the truth to be out because it will 
scare everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a handful of news reporters, the protest attracted one Green 
Party congressional candidate and a counterdemonstrator who is running for the 
Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture officials said they had anticipated some residents would protest 
aerial spraying of malathion, as has been done in other communities. But they 
expected it would be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over a period of time, the protests decrease," said Agar, who has helped 
coordinate aerial sprayings in other communities. "After people see that it is 
nothing more than a minimal inconvenience, they go on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss is a Times staff writer and Fields is a correspondent. What to Do State 
and federal agencies report that malathion has been studied extensively, and 
there is no evidence that it causes cancer, birth defects, nerve damage, eye 
damage or cumulative injury. But residents are cautioned to avoid exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also recommend that the following precautions be taken after 
spraying: 
</P>
<P>
 * If in contact with spray, wash residues from skin and clothing with soap and 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave laundry outdoors when spraying is scheduled. If laundry is 
soiled, rewash before wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your car is outside during spraying, wash it the next day to prevent 
paint damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse plastic skylights and awnings the day after spraying to prevent 
permanent stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover fish ponds before spraying and uncover shortly after to minimize water 
contamination while avoiding oxygen depletion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid harvesting home-grown fruits and vegetables for three days after 
spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse all fresh fruits and vegetables with water before cooking or eating 
them, just as you should with store-bought items. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information about malathion is available by calling (800) 491-1899.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; LETTER CARRIERS TO AID IN WAR ON 
GRAFFITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking allies for their war on graffiti, Simi Valley police announced 
Wednesday that they have drafted a new set of public servants who know the 
battleground intimately -- U. S. Postal Service letter carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's 107 letter carriers will be specially trained in police 
graffiti-identification procedures, armed with index cards and dispatched on 
their rounds with an additional mission -- to report wall-scrawlings to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will then forward the cards to the city's Public Works Department, 
which tries to paint over the offending vandalism within 24 hours, Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be the eyes and ears of the city and, in a rapid manner, they'll be 
getting these (graffiti incidents) identified and reported," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police modeled the alliance on a similar plan in use in Lakewood, Colo., Lt. 
Tony Harper said. "We have a real effective reporting system right now . . . 
but we have the opportunity to stay on top of it and not let it get out of 
control in this city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While graffiti incidents have declined this year after a sharp increase last 
year, they remain a persistent problem in Simi Valley, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 436 incidents of gang graffiti and 2,852 incidents of tagger 
graffiti reported in the first nine months of 1993, records show. The number 
dropped slightly in the same period this year, with 277 gang graffiti incidents 
and 2,790 tagger incidents reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither rain, nor snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays these couriers from 
the swift completion of their appointed rounds, as the post office creed goes. 
</P>
<P>
 And filling out the cards should delay letter carriers only a few minutes per 
day, Simi Valley Postmaster Russ Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carriers will report graffiti "strictly on a voluntary basis, but the response 
has been very positive," he said. "They work in a very clean, safe city right 
now and they want it to continue that way." MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; RETIREE WRITES HISTORY BOOK ON THE 
CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years ago, Powell Greenland thought life was a bit boring. So the Port 
Hueneme retiree embarked on a journey to discover what events helped to shape 
the tiny city of Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent hours running from library to library. He read hundreds of newspapers 
clips and interviewed scores of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, four years later, the 74-year-old Greenland has published the first 
in-depth book on the history of Port Hueneme, according to Charles Johnson, a 
librarian for the Ventura County Museum of History and Art.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is superior to anything that has been published before on the history of 
Port Hueneme," Johnson said. "Powell Greenland was extremely thorough and 
even-handed with his research and analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenland, who has a bachelor's degree in history but who spent 35 years 
working as a businessman, said history has been a passion and that writing the 
book fulfilled one of his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a labor of love," Greenland said of the 174-page book. "I have always 
been fascinated with history and I like writing. So this was a fun project." 
</P>
<P>
 One passage in the hard-cover book, which includes 180 illustrations and 
several maps and drawings, concerns the migration of Port Hueneme residents to 
a bustling young Oxnard in the late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting a newspaper article, the book states: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. D.W. Dilworth has concluded to remove to Oxnard. . . . If our sister town 
doesn't quit influencing our good citizens to move there, we'll go to work and 
build a lot of elegant cottages on the beach and coax Oxnarders to reside here 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a job lot of us left here yet, and we'll stay with old Hueneme till 
the crack of doom. If Oxnard wants the rest of us, she'll have to club us 
insensible and drag us out." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the history of Port Hueneme and the local port, the book has 
information on Oxnard, Ormond Beach and some nearby areas, Greenland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenland, a Port Hueneme resident since 1987, said he was inspired to write 
the book three years after he had moved from Los Angeles to Port Hueneme.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I came here, I read a biography of Thomas Bard (Port Hueneme's founder) 
and I started looking around for something about the city itself, but I did not 
find much," Greenland said. "So I figured a book like this one needed to be 
written." 
</P>
<P>
 The book -- titled "Port Hueneme: A History" -- will be available within four 
weeks at the Ventura County Maritime Museum, Ventura County Museum of History & 
Art, Port Hueneme Historical Museum and at local bookstores, Greenland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Publication of the book was funded by donations. All profits of the $25 book 
will go to the Ventura County Maritime Museum, Greenland said. CHRISTINA LIMA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SCHOOL BOARD VOTES AGAINST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying Proposition 187 could kick 360 local students out of school, the 
Moorpark school board has unanimously opposed the "Save Our State" ballot 
initiative that would deny educational services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the board failed to support a "conscientious objector" clause 
suggested by member Tom Baldwin. Baldwin said that the board should not 
discipline teachers who refuse to follow Proposition 187's requirement that 
they report students who are illegal immigrants to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should a person have to risk their job to follow a law that is immoral?" 
Baldwin said in an interview. "I don't think we should be putting our employees 
in that position where they have to make a choice between their job and doing 
something they consider wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal died for lack of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously there was no support on the board to allow civil disobedience," 
trustee Pam Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that Proposition 187 could cost the Moorpark district 
$644,000 in state funds and $500,000 in federal funds each year. It also could 
force the district to spend about $60,000 to verify immigration status of 
students, about 28% of whom are Latino and 6% of whom may be illegal 
immigrants, Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board resolution also contends that Proposition 187 is illegal because the 
U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that undocumented immigrants cannot be denied a 
public education. However, the Yes on 187 coordinator for Ventura County 
scoffed at the resolution, saying it will have little effect on popular support 
for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every city and school district opposed Proposition 13. (But) the people 
didn't care, they wanted to save their homes," said political consultant Steve 
Frank. "In this case, Proposition l87, the people don't care what the 
bureaucrats and elected politicians say, they want to save their tax dollars."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MAN HELD IN DEATH OF CONSTRUCTION 
WORKER

<P>
 A Santa Paula man released from prison a month ago was arrested on suspicion 
of murdering a construction worker who was talking to the man's girlfriend, 
police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Police Cmdr.Bob Gonzales said David C. Lopez, 39, is accused of 
firing four to six bullets from a small-caliber, semiautomatic handgun Tuesday 
night into a van parked outside the Mountain View Motel on East Harvard 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Three construction workers who had traveled from Palmdale to work on a sewer 
project were shot. Pedro Severa, 28, was dead on arrival at Santa Paula 
Memorial Hospital. Raul Gaxiola, 38, was treated and released, and Miguel 
Gaxiola, 36, was in stable condition at the hospital, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez's girlfriend told police that Lopez was upset with the construction 
workers because they were talking to her, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Shy of the state parole unit said Lopez had been released from the 
California Rehabilitation Center in Norco on Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 He was imprisoned on drug charges and for receiving stolen property, Shy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was arrested at the Santa Paula Motel after fleeing on foot from the 
crime scene, police said. IRA E. STOLL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura should consider annexing Weldon Canyon to block any further attempts 
to turn the site into a landfill, the council's environment committee said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee members asked the city's staff to begin preliminary research on 
the issue and report the results at their December meeting.They requested the 
staff look into annexing an unspecified, contiguous strip of land up to and 
including Weldon Canyon, which lies about three miles outside the city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee made the request after a consultant, Bob Braitman, suggested the 
idea. Braitman is the former head of the Local Agency Formation Commission, a 
state agency that deals with annexation and border issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of a landfill at Weldon Canyon has loomed for the past decade but 
appeared to die in 1993 when Waste Management Inc. withdrew its plan in the 
face of probable defeat before the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego partnership, Taconic Resources, revived the idea with a spring 
petition drive. Enough signatures were collected to qualify the initiative for 
the November ballot, but the measure was removed in August after a judge 
declared it illegal. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Ventura's trash hauler may not charge other customers more because it 
underbilled Councilman Jim Monahan's business for more than a year, a council 
committee said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hauler, E. J. Harrison, discovered the discrepancy in Monahan's bill when 
it conducted an internal audit in June.The council's environment committee 
asked to review the issue because Harrison has an exclusive franchise agreement 
with Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan and Harrison officials have agreed that Monahan should pay part of the 
balance owed the hauler. From February, 1993, to June, 1994, a business that 
rents space from Monahan's company used a 600-gallon trash bin. But Monahan 
received a bill for two 64-gallon trash barrels from Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 He maintains, however, that his tenant only needed a 300-gallon bin. Monahan 
and Harrison officials have agreed that he should only have to pay the 
difference between the rate for a 300-gallon bin and the two barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, in effect, that Monahan would save about $400 because the bill for 
the 600-gallon bin would have been $1,250. The bill for the 300-gallon bin is 
about $860. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already paid Harrison about $460 for the two-barrel service. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the council committee decided that whoever pays the remaining 
$400 that Harrison did not receive, it should not be other customers. Council 
members gave Harrison officials the option of sending a bill for the balance to 
Monahan or taking the money out of their profits. CONSTANCE SOMMER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: D.A. MANAGEMENT PLAN OKD BY COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to trim government costs, county supervisors have unanimously approved 
a plan to streamline the management of the district attorney's office but give 
several of its top officials hefty pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 As approved Tuesday, the consolidation plan trims $330,000 from the district 
attorney's budget by eliminating five positions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also reorganizes the top echelon. Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury will be 
assisted by a single top aide, instead of two that he has now, and by five 
other senior-level executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these officials will get salary increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the supervisors approved the management plan, several of them urged 
the district attorney's office to help toughen enforcement of health and safety 
code violations, particularly in outlying areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White, who presented the plan to the Board 
of Supervisors, promised to take the matter to Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 From the urgings of supervisors, she said the district attorney may want to 
replace one of the eliminated positions with an attorney who focuses on 
enforcing health and safety code violations. KENNETH R. WEISS

<P>
 Organizers of a cultural exchange program are looking for families willing to 
share their Thanksgiving holiday with a high school student from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight students from Nishitan High School in Fukuoka, Japan, will arrive 
in Ventura County on Nov. 19, said Roxanne Kelley, a coordinator for Cultural 
Homestay International. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students have already been matched with families, but four boys 
and two girls still need to be placed, Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will stay with the host family through the Thanksgiving holiday, 
departing for Japan on Nov. 28, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the students are 16 or 17 years old, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanksgiving is a uniquely American holiday," Kelley said. "The purpose of 
the trip is for them to learn about Thanksgiving and its place in American 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides sharing Thanksgiving with families, the students will visit Ventura 
County high schools, Kelley said. All the Japanese students are fully insured 
and bring their own spending money, she said. KAY SAILLANT

CABLEVISION PLANS TO TEST 'INTERACTIVE' SERVICE IN '95 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The basketball goes up, teeters tantalizingly on the rim of the hoop, then 
slips through the net. There you sit, dying to see a replay. Instead, the 
network broadcasting the Lakers game cuts to a shot of Jack Nicholson 
applauding in the audience. Drat. 
</P>
<P>
 For all those armchair directors who want to pick their replays, for those who 
would prefer a close-up of the player with the ball to a long shot of the 
action, Ventura County Cablevision believes it has the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials announced Wednesday it plans to launch a limited test run in 
early 1995 of a new service that allows viewers to interact with their 
televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive programming, called the L.A. Project, is a joint venture among 
ACTV Inc., Prime Ticket Network and the Westlake-based cable company, a 
subsidiary of the San Francisco media company Western Communications.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Cablevision has 90,000 subscribers in Thousand Oaks, Camarillo, 
Santa Paula, Ojai, Fillmore, Westlake, Agoura and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said up to 1,000 households in eastern Ventura County and 
western Los Angeles County will be used for a six-month test run of the 
service. How the test households will be selected has not been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive television programming is being tested by several other companies 
in markets throughout the United States, including Castro Valley and Cerritos 
in California. But Western Communications Director of Marketing Richard Yelen 
said the company's new service is the most advanced example of the new 
technology being offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different from a lot of those pie-in-the-sky ideas," Yelen said. "It is 
actually operational." 
</P>
<P>
 Yelen said ACTV Inc. has successfully tested the services in Montreal and 
London. In Canada, the service has been available for nearly five years and is 
used in about 200,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides allowing viewers to select from four camera angles during Lakers and 
Kings games, the service would also let them call up statistics on individual 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be able to play the director at home," Yelen said. "This is no longer 
the Jetsons, this is today." 
</P>
<P>
 The service will air educational programming as well, he said, and viewers 
will be able to take pop quizzes on what they have learned. After they plug in 
answers with a specialized remote-control unit, the television screen will 
respond, telling them whether they are right or wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive games will also be available through the service, Yelen said, 
including card games such as poker. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if there were a real dealer on the other end, in the television?" he 
said. "Well, now you can do this at home, you can play alone at home. Although, 
of course, you won't win any money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some choices will also be available during the commercials, he said. For 
instance, as the commercial break approaches, the television will announce an 
upcoming car advertisement from a major manufacturer. The viewer gets to pick 
from a selection of four versions of the ad. Don't feel like seeing a minivan 
pitch? Opt for the sports model version instead. 
</P>
<P>
 But viewers who prefer to have their television running the show will not be 
jolted from their couches, Yelen said. All the interactive services are 
optional. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be totally passive," he said. "Many customers don't want to interact 
with their television. They just want to sit back and do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Installing the system will be simple, Yelen said, requiring changing control 
boxes and remote-control devices in the test households. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies have not yet established what the increase in cost to the 
consumer will be.

ELECTIONS / COUNTY SUPERVISORS; MONTGOMERY'S CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS OVER LIMIT, 
SAYS D.A.'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney has found that supervisorial candidate 
Scott Montgomery received $8,350 in illegal campaign contributions, and the 
agency plans to refer the case to the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, a prosecutor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery received 11 contributions that exceed the county's allowable limit 
on political donations, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Don Coleman, who handled the 
preliminary inquiry. The contributions were received between July 1 and Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery, a Moorpark councilman, also apparently failed to notify state 
elections officials of his intent to form a new campaign committee or to 
register a new committee identification number, Coleman said. Candidates are 
required to form such committees in order to establish a bank account to accept 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he believes he has complied with the law in each instance. He 
is running for an open seat in the 4th Supervisorial District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see that we did anything wrong," Montgomery said. "We just did what 
we were told we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he had contacted the secretary of state's office about using 
his council campaign committee and registration number in the supervisor's race 
and was told it would not be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't any money in the account, so they said it would be OK," 
Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the campaign contributions, Montgomery said his political consultant 
had checked with county election officials about the law regarding donations 
and was under the impression that he was in full compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is determined that we need to return money, then we will," Montgomery 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under county law, candidates can receive up to $750 from individuals and 
businesses in the June primary, and no more than $250 in the general election. 
Candidates can accept $1,800 from political action committees in the primary, 
and $600 in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the contributions Montgomery received in excess of the county's 
allowable limit are: $1,800 from the county firefighters union; $1,000 from 
Santa Barbara Restaurants; $1,000 from investor Jerry Sims; $750 from Cal Mat 
Co.; $700 from C. A. Rasmussen Co.; $600 from the county employees union; and 
$500 from Jim Dantona, an aide to state Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Montgomery's contributions were listed in his last campaign-finance 
report filed on Sept. 30, so there is no evidence that he knowingly committed 
the violations, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no apparent criminal violation, Coleman said Montgomery 
could face civil penalties from the Fair Political Practices Commission that 
could include a fine or repayment of the contributions or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Susan K. Lacey agreed to forfeit 
$1,600 in illegal campaign contributions and pay $400 in civil penalties for 
similar violations. That was the first time the county's ordinance limiting 
campaign contributions was enforced since it was passed in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said the district attorney's office has decided to refer the 
Montgomery case to the political practices commission because it wants to avoid 
any possible conflict of interest. Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury has endorsed 
Montgomery's opponent, Judy Mikels.

MANY CITRUS FIRMS STILL SHUT OUT BY JAPANESE; PRODUCE: MOST RESUME BUSINESS AS 
USUAL. BUT THOSE IN QUARANTINE ZONE REMAIN BLOCKED FROM KEY MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the threat of a Japanese boycott of Ventura County citrus products all 
but past, most growers and packinghouses outside the county's Medfly quarantine 
zone returned to business as usual this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one-third of the county's citrus grown within the 86-square-mile 
quarantine zone, a substantial amount of produce is still shut out of the 
lucrative Japanese and Pacific Rim market. 
</P>
<P>
 And some packers, including Paramount Citrus in Oxnard and three others that 
are now handling exclusively quarantined fruit, will not return to normal 
operations until the quarantine is lifted, probably sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now a quarantine house and will handle only fruit destined for the 
domestic market," said Jim Finch, director of lemon operations for Paramount 
Citrus. That alone will cause some loss in income because the foreign markets 
pay a higher price than domestic buyers do. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, growers from the San Joaquin and Coachella valleys that sent 
their fruit to the Paramount house for packing and shipping are now using other 
packinghouses for the fruit they send overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Those growers no longer want to send their fruit here since we can't pack it 
to send it to Japan," Finch said. "It's lost opportunity, lost volume." 
</P>
<P>
 With the designation of 86 square miles from Camarillo to Thousand Oaks as a 
Medfly quarantine area, Sunkist Growers Inc., which represents almost 900 
growers in Ventura County, designated four of the county's 15 packinghouses as 
handlers of exclusively quarantine fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 That assures Japan, as well as other export and domestic markets, that there 
is no possibility that an infestation could be transported to their regions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means that some growers and packinghouses will lose from the 
quarantine, while others will gain, said Ventura County Agricultural 
Commissioner Earl McPhail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet they are willing to cooperate for the good of the industry," McPhail 
said. "It's a major milestone, and that's what it takes to get through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and other Asian markets, which typically buy the highest quality fruit 
for about 10% more than the domestic market pays, will not accept any fruit 
from the quarantine zone. But other states across the country and Canada will 
take quarantine citrus because they do not consider lemons a host to the 
Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, growers and packers have tried to create new markets outside the 
Pacific Rim and inspire new uses for lemons at home. But they have found the 
lemon market a tough one to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer is only going to use a quarter of a lemon in iced tea or a 
squeeze over fish," Finch said. "Mothers don't put them in their kids' lunches 
for school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is one of the few places in the world that doesn't grow its own fruit 
that we still have access to." 
</P>
<P>
 Growers and agriculture officials were worried that Japan and other export 
markets would close off the entire county for fear of infesting their own 
citrus industries. But as long as no new Medflies are found outside the 
quarantine zone, Japan will accept fruit from the rest of the county, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign markets, with Japan leading the way, last year imported about 
one-third of the $260-million lemon crop grown in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other countries are highly influenced by what Japan does," said William 
Quarles, vice president of corporate relations for Sunkist. "Japan is Sunkist's 
most important export market, accounting for 40% of the exports." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Japan, the other three top export markets are, in order of 
volume, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore. Other importers are South Korea, 
Australia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The overseas markets are important in part because Japan and the other 
importers pay more for their fruit from Ventura County's packinghouses than the 
domestic markets do. After trans-oceanic transportation costs are added, the 
Japanese consumer pays about 50% more in the supermarket for a lemon than a U. 
S. customer pays. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are also important because the amount of trees planted and grown is 
based on the number of lemons that can be sold in the United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of lemons are planted with Japan in mind," Quarles said. "So the 
plantings were made in light of a demand that greatly exceeded the domestic 
market demand." 
</P>
<P>
 Although citrus planting in Ventura County dates to the missionaries of the 
1800s, the Japanese market did not open until the early 1960s when the country 
first liberalized its imports, Quarles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Japan was still operating under protectionist policies of the 
post-World War II era in an attempt to rebuild the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan did not produce lemons, and they went very well with that country's 
cuisine," Quarles said. "They tried to grow lemons for a while, but they didn't 
do well there because of the climate. They just couldn't grow a good lemon." 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time that the Japanese market and other Asian markets opened 
up, the European market began to shut down. Until then, the European Community 
had taken about one-third of the county's citrus exports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "But then the EC put on a discriminatory tariff," Quarles said. "They were 
charging us 20% tariff on oranges that went into Europe and at the same time 
they were charging other countries far less." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarles said that tariff, combined with the escalating cost of transportation, 
pushed Sunkist and other U. S. packers out of that market. 
</P>
<P>
 "So we were very fortunate that Japan and the Orient were opening up for us," 
Quarles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus, he said, was one of the few commodity groups that had alternative 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a horrible recession in agriculture during the mid-1980s," he said. 
"Farmers were shooting themselves. But the California-Arizona citrus industry 
was one of the few that maintained a stable economic base during that period." 
</P>
<P>
 While the export markets do create a dependence on foreign countries for 
economic well-being, the agriculture industry has no choice if it is to 
continue to thrive, Agricultural Commissioner McPhail said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dependent on all our markets, domestic and foreign," he said. "We can't 
limit our markets by cutting out whole sections of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Sunkist and other cooperatives are constantly trying to reopen the 
European market. But the European Community requires member countries to buy 
from each other before they look to outside markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just economics and productions," McPhail said. "It's a matter of 
politics as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Growers and shippers are now working with the European Community, Russia, 
Eastern European countries, Mexico and Central and South America in attempts to 
open up trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agriculture industry is always looking to expand our markets," McPhail 
said.

BIEHL'S KILLERS SPARED DEATH, GIVEN 18 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Wednesday gave the three killers of American student Amy Biehl 18 
years in prison instead of the death penalty, saying they have a chance to 
become useful citizens despite showing no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongezi Manqina, Mzikhona Nofemela and Vusumzi Ntamo, all members of the black 
militant Pan Africanist Student Organization, might appeal their convictions in 
Biehl's Aug. 25, 1993, slaying, defense lawyer Justice Poswa said. 
</P>
<P>
 High Court Judge Gerald Friedman said Biehl "was killed for one reason only, 
namely because she had white skin." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he rejected the death penalty because there is a chance that 
Biehl's killers can become useful citizens "despite the fact that they have 
shown no remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman noted that Biehl had come to South Africa to support the cause of the 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fulbright scholar from Newport Beach, Biehl was in South Africa helping to 
educate voters. She was set upon by a mob chanting anti-white slogans when she 
drove black friends home to the impoverished Guguletu township outside Cape 
Town. She was bludgeoned and stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a coldblooded and brutal murder carried out by a mob on a 
defenseless young girl of 26 who had already sustained a serious injury to her 
head from which she was bleeding profusely," the judge said in a solemn voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Poswa said he will explore an amnesty for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus said he would oppose any such move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they must serve 18 years, full stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the three men can demonstrate to a proposed commission that their crime was 
politically motivated, admit their guilt and give a full account of their 
actions, they could qualify for amnesty under a bill now before Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is designed to help heal the wounds of the country's apartheid past 
as South Africa begins a new democratic era. Poswa said that he would discuss 
the amnesty program with his clients, who have not admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, Biehl's parents heard of the sentences through a 7:15 a.m. 
phone call from South Africa and received many supportive faxes from friends 
and acquaintances. Biehl's father said the family is at peace with the 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any sentence cannot bring Amy back," Peter Biehl said in Newport Beach. But 
he said he hoped the killers can be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they survive the 18-year term, they'll be 40 or so when they get out," he 
said. "I hope they make more productive use of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's mother, Linda, said she is satisfied with the sentence because the 
deaths of her daughter's killers would not "be helpful in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 The African National Congress is "on record as being opponents of the death 
penalty," Linda Biehl said. "The fact the prosecutor had asked for it was 
almost a token thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Biehls said they expect lawyers to appeal the sentences given to the 
youths and were not surprised when Poswa said the young men will apply for 
amnesty under a program granting protection to people who committed political 
crimes before Dec. 6 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Biehl said she hoped that the young men would reform and that the 
sentences would allow residents in South African townships to believe in their 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, two dozen young blacks chanted "Settler! Settler! 
Bullet! Bullet!" and ran through the streets after learning of the sentence. 
"Settler" is a term used for whites by black militants in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 They also shouted "One settler, one bullet," the same chant that witnesses 
said they heard just before Biehl was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntamo's mother, Nomhle, said she felt more sorry for the victim's parents than 
for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's gone, and they won't see her anymore. Our sons are coming back," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pan Africanist Congress official, Yasien Mohamed, said it was apartheid, not 
the three youths, that caused Biehl's death and that the sentence was "too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Biehl said she intends to request transcripts of the court testimony to 
know more details about the trial. "I don't know that we want 3,000 pages, but 
I think we'll request some of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to know the story and all its chapters," she said.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WORKED 5 YEARS AT HUFFINGTON HOME; POLITICS: CANDIDATE SAYS 
HIS WIFE HIRED THE WOMAN. HE SAYS PROPER TAXES WERE PAID AND A GREEN CARD 
APPLIED FOR.

<P>
 Republican candidate Mike Huffington, whose tough stand against illegal 
immigration is a cornerstone of his Senate campaign, employed a woman at his 
Santa Barbara home for about five years who was in the country illegally, his 
campaign acknowledged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's job ended last year, shortly after Huffington was sworn into 
office as a freshman congressman and several months before he announced his bid 
to challenge Sen. Dianne Feinstein, sources told The Times. The woman had cared 
for the Huffingtons' two daughters -- now ages 3 and 5 -- since they were born. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington declined to talk with The Times on Wednesday. But in a live 
television interview Wednesday night, the candidate said his wife was 
responsible for hiring the illegal worker, which is a violation of federal law. 
He then accused Feinstein of hiring illegal immigrants at her home, but offered 
no evidence of the allegation.

 "My wife did hire someone, found out that she was illegal, applied for a green 
card and filled out all of the paperwork and paid the taxes," he said on 
KCAL-TV in response to a question about The Times' story. "But what is ironic 
is . . . we've been told by people who know a lot about (Feinstein's) staff, 
she too had hired two people who were illegal. The question I would ask Mrs. 
Feinstein is, did she pay the taxes as my wife did?" 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata hotly rejected the allegation. "That 
charge is an outright lie. It's just typical when he is caught breaking the 
law, his first response is to lie. Now his campaign is in great jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, after a campaign event in San Diego where Huffington spoke 
about his support for Proposition 187 -- the anti-illegal immigration measure 
on the November ballot -- the candidate was asked if he had ever employed an 
illegal immigrant at his home. He told the San Diego newspaper reporter he did 
not know of any problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign released five pages of federal documents Wednesday 
evening, after being questioned about the issue by The Times, to demonstrate 
that the candidate's wife had tried unsuccessfully to obtain papers that would 
allow the worker to be in the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the documents, the application was made to the U.S. Labor 
Department on Nov. 13, 1990. The process requires that the employer interview a 
number of U.S. citizens for the job to demonstrate that the foreign national is 
the only candidate qualified for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the documents released by the campaign was a sworn affidavit from 
Arianna Huffington saying that she had advertised the position in the Santa 
Barbara News Press and interviewed at least four applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington said Wednesday evening that she conducted the interviews 
and the woman who had already been on their staff for more than a year was the 
most qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nobody like her," she said. "She is a wonderful human being. My 
children adore her." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the couple paid all of the necessary taxes for the woman. She 
said the woman left the Huffingtons' employment shortly after Mike Huffington 
was sworn into office in January last year. Arianna Huffington said the woman 
did not want to make the move to Washington with the Huffingtons because she 
was married. 
</P>
<P>
 The document issued by the campaign indicates that the approval for a work 
certificate was given by the Labor Department on June 5, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The work certificate, which does not allow the immigrant to remain in the 
country legally, permits the employer to seek INS approval for immigration. The 
next step is a years-long process of waiting for a "green card" from the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The employee is not allowed to work in 
the country legally until the green card is issued by the INS. The woman never 
obtained a green card while working for the Huffingtons. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, federal law has made it a crime for employers to hire illegal 
immigrants. President Ronald Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control 
Act on Nov. 6, 1986, requiring that employers verify workers' citizenship 
status when they are hired by requesting personal documents such as a U.S. 
passport, Social Security card or driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 The act requires employers to prove the credentials were checked by filling 
out an immigration document -- known as Form I9 -- that is to be completed by 
employers within three days of hiring a worker. The document is also to be 
maintained on file for inspection by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service. Failure to complete the forms or maintain the records is itself a 
violation of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The act provides civil penalties of up to $10,000 for each illegal immigrant 
hired. Repeat violators may also be prosecuted criminally and face jail terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times talked to four sources who once worked inside the Huffingtons' 
$4-million home in Santa Barbara who confirmed the employment of the illegal 
worker. They agreed to talk on condition that their names not be used. 
Huffington's household staff had more than a dozen employees, including 
butlers, gardeners, security people, clerical help, drivers, maintenance 
workers and child care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign confirmed the story only after a Times reporter offered 
specific details of the illegal immigrant's employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman began working for the Huffingtons in 1989, the year their first 
daughter was born. At the time, Mike Huffington claimed separate residences, 
with the GOP candidate living in Texas where he was an executive of his 
family's oil and gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Huffington said he moved to the Santa Barbara home in 1991, after the 
family company was sold. The candidate was involved in some of the hiring 
decisions on the staff at the Santa Barbara home, sources told The Times. One 
source said he was interviewed by both Huffington and his wife for a job in 
December, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 One source said the illegal worker had also traveled to Washington with the 
Huffingtons, where they own another home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, immigration has already been a major issue between the 
candidates, with both Huffington and Feinstein disputing who would be tougher 
at enforcing immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington staked out the conservative side of the issue last week when he 
endorsed Proposition 187, the ballot measure that seeks to cut off health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants. Feinstein opposes Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Feinstein, Huffington also supports a constitutional amendment to 
prevent babies born to illegal immigrants in the United States from 
automatically becoming U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hostility of this state toward illegal immigration has risen in direct 
proportion to the weakness of our political leaders to enforce the immigration 
laws already on the books," Huffington said last week in announcing his 
position on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have allowed kids to cross the border, board our buses, use our schools, 
then return to their country while no one bats an eye," he said. "We have 
allowed illegal aliens to stand in line to receive post-earthquake housing aid, 
reassured that the Immigration and Naturalization Service won't ask any 
questions for fear of appearing 'discriminatory.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cut corners, looked the other way and sent the wrong message -- that 
breaking the law pays, that only fools go through the proper immigration 
channels. Well, no more. I believe Proposition 187 will finally draw a line 
between illegal immigration -- which is harmful and divisive -- and legal 
immigration -- which is beneficial to the nation and to California." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego on Wednesday, Huffington repeated that theme in a discussion 
about border issues with a campaign crowd of about a dozen people. He also said 
he does not believe cracking down on those who employ illegal immigrants is a 
good solution. He said in an interview that he does not support that approach, 
although it is the current law, unless a tamper-proof identification card is 
created. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the employer sanctions, I think it's important that we have . . . a 
tamper-proof identification card, preferably a Social Security card, that says 
you are a citizen. So if you go to an employer, that employer knows it's 
tamper-proof. So if you don't have it, you're not a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 "The employer sanctions to me make a lot of sense," he added. "My concern is 
if we don't have a tamper-proof card, there are forgeries out there and we 
can't hold an employer responsible if he has what he thinks is a citizenship 
paper." Another speaker at the meeting said, however, that employer sanctions 
were an important tool in the fight against illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the real answer lies in enforcing the employer sanctions," said T. J. 
Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol Council, a group that 
represents 4,500 federal employees. "If we cut out the magnet which is 
attracting people to this country, we won't have to concentrate so much at the 
borders." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington served in Congress when the so-called "nannygate" scandal erupted 
in Washington over two women considered by President Clinton for the job of 
attorney general. Last January, Zoe Baird, Clinton's nominee, withdrew her name 
from consideration when it was disclosed that she had hired an illegal Peruvian 
couple for domestic help and she had failed to pay their Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Federal Judge Kimba M. Wood withdrew her name after 
disclosing that she also had hired an illegal immigrant to work in her home as 
a nanny. Unlike Baird, however, Wood paid taxes and had hired her nanny before 
federal law made such hiring illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's office said Wednesday that it researched past and present 
employees at the senator's home after the Baird and Wood incidents. A spokesman 
for the senator said there were no illegal immigrants on the staff. 
</P>

Sacramento, Patrick J. McDonnell in Los Angeles and Greg Krikorian in San Diego

ISRAEL AND JORDAN SIGN PEACE PACT, ENTER NEW ERA; MIDEAST: IN DESERT CEREMONY, 
RABIN AND KING HUSSEIN END GENERATIONS OF HOSTILITY. TREATY ADDS MOMENTUM TO 
PROCESS OF SETTLING ARAB-ISRAELI CONFLICT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and Jordan on Wednesday signed a peace treaty that will launch their 
countries into an era of cooperation after two generations of hostility, and 
thus add momentum to the search for an overall settlement of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 With soaring hopes, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein of 
Jordan declared their countries not only at peace but also good neighbors 
interested in the warmest of relations and partners in rebuilding the Middle 
East as a region of prosperity rather than turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaming at one another like old friends, Rabin and Hussein spoke as men 
achieving goals of a lifetime -- for Rabin, the acceptance of the Jewish state 
by another of its neighbors, and for Hussein, political, military and economic 
security for his sometimes wobbly kingdom from a new and strong ally. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the thousands of Jordanians and Israelis killed in the wars they had 
waged against each other, Hussein said: "I believe (the dead) are with us as we 
come together to ensure, God willing, that there will be no more death, no more 
misery, no more suspicion, no more fear, no more uncertainty of what each day 
might bring." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin too noted the historic nature of the treaty and its impact on daily life 
in his own war-weary nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not only our states that are making peace with each other today, not 
only our nations that are shaking hands in peace here in the Arava," the 
general-turned-statesman said, addressing Hussein. "You and I, Your Majesty, 
are making peace here, our own peace, the peace of soldiers and the peace of 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 In the treaty, Israel and Jordan acknowledged each other's sovereignty, thus 
removing the core issue in the 46 years of hostility between them. They also 
pledged not to use force or to threaten to do so in resolving future disputes, 
and Jordan said that it will not join any future Arab alliance against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the accord dealt primarily with bilateral relations, it effectively 
shifted the balance of power across the Middle East, making it easier for other 
Arab states to reach the peace with Israel that many desire, making it harder 
for Syria to exercise a veto over such agreements and making it tougher for the 
Palestine Liberation Organization to maintain its position as Israel's 
principal Arab partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is peace with dignity," Hussein said, defying those at home and 
elsewhere in the Arab world who criticize him for signing a separate peace with 
Israel. "This is peace with commitment. This is our gift to our peoples and the 
generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath a hot desert sun with a wind whipping pages of the treaty and its many 
accompanying maps, Rabin signed the accord with Prime Minister Abdul Salam 
Majali of Jordan to the applause of 5,000 guests from their two nations and 20 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who had played an important role over the last six months 
in assuring Jordan of U.S. support if it made peace with Israel, witnessed the 
signing and praised Hussein and Rabin as "great leaders who saw the bright 
horizon of this dawn even while the darkness lingered." 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace between Jordan and Israel is no longer a mirage -- it is real," Clinton 
said after Hussein and Rabin had spoken. "I say to the people of Israel and 
Jordan: Now you must make this peace real, to turn no man's land into every 
man's home, to take down the barbed wire, to remove the deadly mines, to help 
the wounds of war to heal. Open your borders, open your hearts. Peace is more 
than an agreement on paper." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony itself was a first joint enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The arena had been set up by the Israeli and Jordanian armies in what had 
formerly been a deadly border minefield. Two howitzer batteries, one Israeli 
and the other Jordanian, fired a 21-gun salute in unison to celebrate the 
treaty. Thousands of Jordanian and Israeli troops surrounded the Arava Crossing 
in a coordinated operation. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it all very clear, top military commanders from both sides shook hands 
and exchanged gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This great valley in which we stand will become the valley of peace," Hussein 
said. "When we come together to build it and to make it bloom as never before, 
when we come to live together as never before, we will be doing so, Israelis 
and Jordanians together." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel signed its first treaty with an Arab state, Egypt, in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, it signed an interim peace deal with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization on Palestinian self-government and is now negotiating expansion of 
that autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with Jordan was probably the easiest for Israel to conclude with 
its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The disputes were few -- over a small area of the borders and water resources 
-- and the two countries have had secret contacts for years. 
</P>
<P>
 To resolve the disputes along their border, Israel and Jordan exchanged 
territory in several areas and made the frontier conform to geographical 
landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharing of water resources was more difficult, but Israel agreed to allow 
Jordan to take more water from the Yarmuk River and promised to increase the 
flow of water into the Jordan River from the Sea of Galilee to benefit 
Jordanian farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by all Israelis except the extreme right wing, the treaty has been 
condemned by the PLO, which objects to the role it accords Jordan in protecting 
Islamic shrines in East Jerusalem, and by Muslim militants who remain adamant 
in their opposition to the Jewish state's existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the signing ceremony, radical, pro-Iranian guerrillas in Lebanon 
fired rockets and mortars into northern Israel, according to Israeli military 
sources. There were no injuries, and little damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip and on the West Bank, Palestinians took part in a general 
strike ordered by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who met with Clinton in Cairo on 
Wednesday morning but did not receive an invitation to witness the treaty 
signing because of his criticism of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, expressing the increased U.S. concern about the growth of militant 
political Islam, warned Israel and Jordan of an upsurge in terrorism intended 
to thwart peacemaking in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 "The forces of terror will try to hold you back," Clinton said. "Already they 
take deadly aim at the future of peace, and in their zeal to kill hope and keep 
hatred alive they would deny all that peace can bring to your children. We 
cannot, we must not, we will not let them succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 He had pressed that point during the meeting that he and Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak held with Arafat in Cairo, urging him to crack down on the 
radical Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we got a very firm and unambiguous response," Clinton told a Cairo 
news conference. "I am satisfied with the response (Arafat) gave. He 
understands clearly now that Hamas is the enemy now." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, he said, had "started the discussions himself with his desire to 
combat the terrorist groups, with his willingness to do all that he could." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will all admit that it is impossible to guarantee a 100% success in any 
effort," Clinton said. "Even in the U.S. we are not 100% successful in 
combatting organized crime. What we want is a 100% effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an increasing effort in the last several weeks on the part of 
Chairman Arafat and the authorities in the territories to do what they can on 
this problem, and I think it will continue to increase. . . . Terrorists must 
not be allowed to intimidate the people of the region into abandoning the peace 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting with Clinton, Arafat told reporters that "my choice is the 
peace of the brave," even if it means cracking down on Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Syrian capital of Damascus, however, Hamas vowed to broaden its fight 
against Israel. "Rabin will be responsible for expanding the arena of battle," 
Hamas said, "and there are numbers of Hamas supporters who could reply harshly 
in any part of the world to which Rabin starts transferring the war."

MTA PLANS REORGANIZATION TO WIN BACK FEDERAL FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and DAVID WILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to resume subway tunneling in Hollywood in early December, transit 
officials on Wednesday approved a plan designed to strengthen management of the 
troubled project and win back federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board also voted to abolish the Rail 
Construction Corp., a subsidiary of the MTA that has overseen subway 
construction. The MTA board deferred action on a last-minute proposal by Mayor 
Richard Riordan to hire a consulting firm that he wants to shape the 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit authority Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White expressed 
confidence that the reorganization plan will receive federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But several board members, saying they were stunned by a Times report that 
engineers working on the project were not licensed in California, questioned 
whether the plan would prevent a repeat of the problems that have plagued the 
most expensive subway construction, per mile, in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am troubled that the biggest issue before this board is which way the San 
Fernando Valley line is going instead of how to be fixing a tunnel that is 
falling apart every single day," said county Supervisor Gloria Molina, an MTA 
board member. 
</P>
<P>
 In only the second such action, the Federal Transit Administration announced 
Oct. 5 that it would not provide $1.6 billion to extend the subway to East Los 
Angeles and the San Fernando Valley until the MTA shows it can competently 
manage the project. Tunneling in Hollywood has been shut down since Aug. 18 
after ground sinkages of up to nine inches were detected. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who met with Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton earlier 
this week, told board members: "We believe that the final plans which we 
submitted to the FTA earlier today will enable the lifting of the funding 
prohibition and allow the MTA to continue the tunneling in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Linton, White said, "We expect to complete the remediation of 
the existing tunnels and be prepared to resume tunneling in early December." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, an MTA board member, complained that the plan "does not go 
far enough" and called the proposed changes "cosmetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan proposed to hire the Big 6 accounting firm of Arthur Andersen to 
advise the MTA on the subway project, citing the firm's "pivotal role in 
getting the Eurotunnel back on track." But the board decided to let other 
companies compete for the work and leave the selection of a consultant to a 
committee of the transit authority board. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's proposal was his first public comment on the subway project since 
federal funds were cut off. The mayor said in an interview that he does not 
want to "micromanage" MTA operations and has not tried to influence the 
agency's posture toward the contractors involved in the disputed subway 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he also has avoided involvement because of his friendship with 
the family of John F. Shea, the top executive of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the tunnel 
contractor at work along Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose in the back of my mind, that's had a slight effect," said Riordan, 
who with Shea has raised money and made contributions to Catholic and public 
schools in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said the reorganization plan approved Wednesday sends a "powerful and 
determined message that the MTA is ready to take the necessary actions to 
ensure that the Metro Rail Red Line continues to move forward in a safe and 
efficient manner." 
</P>
<P>
 But Molina said, "I am distressed . . . about engineers not appropriately 
licensed in this state." 
</P>
<P>
 The approval by two transit engineering officials to substitute wooden wedges, 
instead of steel struts, for bracing in 12 miles of tunnels under construction 
drew wide criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The licensing status of those engineering officials -- and the fact that eight 
out of 10 "resident engineers" on the subway also do not hold California 
licenses, was reported Wednesday by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 One MTA official, Patsaouras, said that the prominence of unlicensed engineers 
on the subway project is an example of a "major flaw" not addressed by White's 
management reorganization proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) also was 
critical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is any excuse or reason or rationale for using unlicensed 
personnel," said Katz, who attended Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 White said in an interview that he has asked MTA lawyers to review the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously a matter that we'll be dealing with," he said, adding that the 
substitution was one of "a whole series of legal issues" related to the ground 
sinkage in Hollywood and the failure there of the wood wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 White's reorganization plan -- which, as amended Wednesday, will dissolve the 
Rail Construction Corp. as of Nov. 1 -- won passage by a unanimous vote., The 
RCC's oversight of construction will be assumed by a committee of five MTA 
board members who will be advised by three non-voting people with expertise in 
construction. White ousted the RCC president earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote did not come without heated debate. Molina criticized a 
vote by the RCC board on Monday that ran counter to White's recommendation to 
reject bids received recently for a station construction contract at Hollywood 
Boulevard and Highland Avenue. The joint venture of Tutor-Saliba-Perini 
submitted the lowest bid, $70 million, but White has concluded that the bid was 
"nonresponsive" because one of the minority subcontractors listed is not 
properly certified. Over the objection of the venture's managing partner, 
Ronald N. Tutor, the MTA board backed White on Wednesday and rejected all of 
the bids. 
</P>
<P>
 White had first sought last May to dissolve the RCC, but had been stymied by 
board members. He tried again this fall but was blocked by Riordan and by City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre, who won delays. Riordan put forth the amendment on 
Wednesday that will dissolve the RCC; Alatorre did not attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaining that she received the reorganization plan only 10 minutes before 
the session, Molina said, "I am not prepared to read this report right now and 
rubber-stamp it. The problem . . . is that we have been rubber-stamping 
everything staff tells us to do." 
</P>
<P>
 John Fasana, a Duarte councilman who is an MTA board member, said he does not 
believe all the difficulties with tunneling in Hollywood have been fully 
explained. Fasana said he felt "accountable" for construction practices he did 
not understand, such as grouting procedures and the substitution of the wooden 
wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't know why we have the current problems," Fasana said, "how do we 
know we're not going to have problems in the future?" 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the RCC, including Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, have 
accused the subsidiary's board and staff of being too cozy with contractors, 
obscuring accountability and diluting the power of elected officials who serve 
on the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Kruse, RCC chairman, said Wednesday that the subsidiary is being 
"scapegoated." 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan drafted by White and approved Wednesday also calls for 
the MTA to assume greater direct responsibility for quality control and safety 
inspection. It proposes new construction procedures for the resumption of 
tunneling in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the plan calls for metal struts -- not wooden wedges -- to be 
used for tunnel bracing. Substitution of the wedges was approved in 1992 by two 
engineers employed by Parsons-Dillingham, the MTA's construction-management 
firm, and by the project's chief design engineer, employed by the firm of 
Parsons Brinckerhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Parsons-Dillingham said that the firm's employee who was 
involved with the approval of the substitution, Stephen J. Navin, acted 
properly and his role was such that he did not require state licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy P. Smirnoff of Parsons Brinckerhoff previously has declined to comment 
and did not return calls this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the California Board of Registration for Professional Engineers 
and Land Surveyors said that a review of all circumstances would be needed to 
determine whether someone practiced civil engineering as defined by law and 
would thus require a state license. 
</P>
<P>
 The wedges crushed under Hollywood Boulevard, and engineers have concluded 
that the failure contributed to the surface sinkage. The substitution of the 
wood wedges for the steel struts was "inappropriate," according to an 
independent engineering firm's report earlier this month. The firm was retained 
by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Three types of soil-stabilizing grouting procedures also were recommended for 
the resumption of tunneling in Hollywood. The grouting procedures were not 
performed in the most severely affected area of sinkage.

<P>
 With two weeks left before voters declare their choice for governor, Democrat 
Kathleen Brown has gained ground on her Republican opponent, Gov. Pete Wilson, 
but still trails him significantly among those likely to cast ballots, the Los 
Angeles Times Poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 The state treasurer lags behind Wilson among registered voters by a spare 48% 
to 45%, better than the 8-point margin of 50% to 42% found in the last Times 
poll, published Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Among likely voters, Wilson holds a 52%-43% lead, slightly smaller than the 
54%-41% advantage he held earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the findings come as good news for Brown, the poll underscores broad 
difficulties facing her campaign. Wilson remains the choice of voters when they 
are asked which candidate is best able to handle the important issues of crime, 
immigration and the economy. While Brown is popular among younger voters 
traditionally less likely to vote, Wilson has a strong hold on the more 
dependable older voters. And Brown continues to have problems holding on to her 
Democratic base, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, said Poll Director John Brennan, "the window of opportunity for Brown 
is still open. . . . This race is still very unstable." 
</P>
<P>
 That is because of Wilson's own frail position. The governor's job rating 
remains negative, with 51% of the voters disapproving of the way he has handled 
his job and 43% approving. His favorability rating improved slightly from 
earlier in October, with 49% saying they liked him, compared to 47% earlier. 
Forty-five percent disliked him, slightly less than the 49% who did so earlier. 
It was the first time his favorability rating edged onto positive ground since 
May, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that slight movement, negative feelings about the state and its 
economy persist, the Times poll found. Fully 84% of registered voters believe 
the state remains in a recession -- 33% characterize it as a "serious" economic 
downturn. Almost two-thirds said the state is on the wrong track, with only 27% 
saying things are moving in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those numbers would traditionally indicate trouble for an incumbent, 
in this case they emphasize the contradictory nature of the campaign for 
governor: Wilson is almost matching Brown even among those who have grave 
concerns over the state he has headed for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who believe the state is headed in the wrong direction, Brown 
holds a slim 48%-45% margin. Those who think the state is in a serious 
recession favor her only by 47%-45%, a statistically insignificant margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people should be voting for her," Brennan said. "People are saying the 
state is going in the wrong direction, that the state is in a serious recession 
-- but they're voting for the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 In another finding, the poll set President Clinton's job approval rating among 
Californians at a stable 49% positive and 45% negative, virtually the same as 
it was two weeks ago despite positive foreign news in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll questioned 1,235 registered voters, of whom 762 are considered 
likely to vote Nov. 8. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is 
three percentage points in either direction; for likely voters it is four 
points in either direction. Margins of error for smaller subgroups may be 
larger. Participants were questioned Saturday through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll results essentially put Brown back where she was in early September, 
before a hard-hitting barrage of negative advertising by Wilson caused her 
standing to plummet. Then, Wilson led by two points among registered voters and 
nine points among likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the poll found that Brown's favorability rating has rebounded 
somewhat from early October. In the earlier poll, Brown recorded her first-ever 
negative favorability ratings, as her numbers dropped to 39% positive and 42% 
negative. In the past two weeks, however, she regained her positive rating and 
she now stands at 47% favorable and 40% unfavorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Brown, the latest poll also demonstrates that her loudly 
touted economic plan, on which she has hinged the rest of her campaign, has 
failed to boost her substantially among voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 41% of voters said they had not heard of the plan, which Brown has been 
hawking in campaign events and television advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 57% of voters who had heard of her plan, it was nearly a wash. Nineteen 
percent said it made them more likely to vote for her and 14% said it made them 
less likely to side with Brown, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 But the existence of the plan could account for a marginally better score for 
Brown among voters who were asked which candidate was best equipped to handle 
the economy. In early October, Wilson led Brown on that score by a 12-point 
margin, 46% to 34%. In the most recent poll, the gap closed to 42% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brown has not managed to overcome Wilson's lead on that issue and 
others judged important to California voters this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked which candidate can best handle immigration, Wilson beats Brown 50% 
to 27%, a margin slightly smaller than the 53%-27% margin seen in early 
October. On crime, Wilson wins 55% to 24%, again a substantial margin, if 
somewhat smaller than the 58%-22% gap seen earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 On the gut-level issue of leadership, Wilson is considered better by 53% of 
voters to Brown's 28% -- a broader success than the earlier 49%-28% finding. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown continues to do better on the issue of education, where she holds a 
44%-25% advantage, and empathy, where she is favored 42%-28%. Both findings are 
nearly identical to those in the earlier poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that voters continue to have varied reasons for supporting each 
candidate. In Brown's case, 16% of those who liked her said they "just like 
her" and another 10% said they felt good about her because of her father, 
former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown Sr., or her brother, Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr. Nine percent said they agreed with her views and the same percentage said 
they liked her because she was not Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's family ties were her greatest liability as well. Fully 24% of those 
who dislike her said it was because of her family; another 12% said she was too 
liberal and 11% characterized her as "wishy-washy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson supporters were more likely to cite issues as their reason for liking 
the governor. Seventeen percent specified his views on crime and 16% his 
immigration policies. Twelve percent said "he's trying" and another 12% listed 
his overall record as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who disliked Wilson, 10% said he was ineffective, 10% said he had 
hurt education, 10% cited his views on immigration and 10% disliked his record 
as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll made it clear that voters are drawing their own distinctions between 
the candidates' positions on immigration and their views about Proposition 187, 
the initiative that would restrict education and non-emergency health services 
to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked hypothetically in early October how they felt about the candidates' 
positions on the proposition, voters clearly indicated that Wilson's support of 
Proposition 187 helped him and Brown's opposition hurt her. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, according to Brennan, "the results are more equivocal." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 30% said Wilson's support would make them more likely to vote for him and 
24% said they were less likely to throw support his way. That 6-point gain 
replaces a 13-point margin in the earlier poll. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Brown, 23% said they would be more likely to side with her because of 
her opposition and 27% said they were less likely to vote for her. That 4-point 
loss replaces a 15-point loss in the earlier poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson was clearly seen as the best candidate to handle the immigration 
problem overall, suggesting that Brown will have to make a far stronger attack 
against Wilson's immigration policies if she is to connect with voters who 
believe the subject is important. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographically, Brown remains in trouble even within her own party. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson holds the allegiance of 80% of Republicans, Brown is supported by 
only two-thirds of her party. Strikingly, more than a quarter of Democratic 
women -- 26% of Brown's purportedly strongest base -- said they planned to vote 
for Wilson. Twenty-eight percent of Democratic men put themselves in Wilson's 
column. In contrast, only 16% each of GOP men and women said they plan to vote 
for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two weeks, Brown did gain among lower-income voters and 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's strongest supporters are Latinos (65% support her), liberals (76%), 
college graduates (51%) and those under age 30 (50%). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's strongest partisans are whites (53% support him), conservatives 
(77%), those making more than $40,000 (52%), those with a high school education 
or less (53%) and those ages 65 and older (55%). 
</P>
<P>
 The poll illustrated one potential opening for the candidates in the final two 
weeks before Election Day: While most voters say they will stick with the 
choices they have made, about one in five were open to changing their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four percent of Brown's partisans said they would consider another 
choice, and 19% of Wilson supporters said they could change their minds. How 
the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,659 adults statewide, by telephone, Saturday 
through Tuesday. Included in the sample are 1,235 registered voters and 762 
likely voters. Interviewing was conducted in English and Spanish. Telephone 
numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit 
dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers could be 
contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to conform more closely with census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total sample and the sample of all registered voters is plus or minus 3 
percentage points; for likely voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the 
error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors such as the wording of questions and the order in which they are 
presented. More on the Governor's Race

CRASH KILLS FIRST FEMALE F-14 COMBAT PILOT; AVIATION: LT. KARA HULTGREEN WAS 
ATTEMPTING CARRIER LANDING OFF CALIFORNIA. SHE LOVED THE NAVY, HER SISTER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Navy Lt. Kara Hultgreen, who had dreamed as a teen-ager of being an astronaut 
and then became the first woman qualified as an F-14 combat pilot, was killed 
when her plane crashed during a training mission, the Navy announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hultgreen, 29, was attempting to land on the carrier Abraham Lincoln off 
Southern California when her F-14 Tomcat crashed into the ocean Tuesday 
afternoon. The fighter's radar officer ejected and was rescued with only minor 
injuries but an extensive search failed to recover the plane or Hultgreen's 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Hultgreen, a graduate of the University of Texas, was among the first group of 
women pilots to apply for combat training when the restriction on women flying 
combat aircraft was lifted by then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin in April, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a wonderful, giving, generous person who loved flying, loved the Navy 
and loved her country," said her sister Dagny Hultgreen, a television 
journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 A high school basketball and tennis star and later an expert surfer, Hultgreen 
gave several interviews when she qualified in August as an F-14 pilot. She 
stressed both the exhilaration and the danger of flying the F-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it's fun to go fast and light up the afterburner and pull out of Gs 
and zip around the clouds," she told KNSD-TV in San Diego. "I don't think I've 
mastered it quite yet. It's going to take a lot of hours and a lot of 
training." 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled the thrill of making her first four landings on a carrier: 
</P>
<P>
 "I barely remember my first four traps because all I could think of was how 
can I work the rest of my life to buy this drug. It's just an adrenaline rush." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and other women pilots received much the same training as men, 
their career options had been limited. In fact, before the restriction was 
lifted, Navy officials had suggested that Hultgreen leave the Navy because 
there were far more pilots than needed assigned to the planes women were 
allowed to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hultgreen was born in Connecticut. Her family moved frequently during her 
youth. She remarked once about being shocked when the family moved during her 
teen-age years from Canada to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canada, high school girls had been allowed to play any sport they chose. In 
Texas, she noted, girls were expected to become football cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just never noticed being treated any differently when I was in Canada," she 
told the Navy publication Compass. "The whole girl-guy issue was never an 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Hultgreen's mother, Sally Spears, a lawyer in San Antonio, said her daughter 
had wanted to be an astronaut but then decided that flying an aircraft was more 
exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the Navy while a senior at the University of Texas and went on 
active duty after receiving her degree in aerospace engineering in 1987. Before 
going to F-14 school, Hultgreen had flown a jet designed to jam the electronic 
gear of an enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Spears said she realized that flying was dangerous but had full confidence in 
her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kara studied, she trained, she loved it so much," Spears said. "She never 
complained about anything. She was so confident that I wasn't allowed to worry 
about her." 
</P>
<P>
 Hultgreen came from a family of high achievers: Her mother was one of the 
first women admitted to the University of Texas law school, one sister worked 
as a television reporter in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles and is now doing 
independent production for the show "The Crusaders," and a second sister 
formerly owned a fitness salon and now works with a movie production company in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kara was the youngest of the three daughters. "She was our baby," Spears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, who is divorced from Spears, is a paper company executive in 
Appleton, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Mark Grissom, commander of the Navy's fighter wing for the Pacific 
fleet, based at Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, said an investigation 
is under way to determine the cause of the crash and whether Hultgreen ejected. 
One theory is that the plane may have stalled at 200 feet above the ocean as 
Hultgreen attempted the day landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This unfortunate mishap should in no way (harm) the effectiveness of women in 
combat, the integration of women into combat units or their gaining the respect 
of their male colleagues," Grissom told reporters. The F-14 is one of several 
combat aircraft that had been off-limits to women before Aspin's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Grissom said Hultgreen had initially failed to qualify as an F-14 pilot, in a 
grueling process that includes 10 daytime landings on a carrier and six night 
landings. One in four pilots fail on the first attempt at qualifying, Grissom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her second attempt, in August, Hultgreen qualified. Another woman pilot, 
Lt. Carey Lohrenz, has also qualified in the F-14, but Hultgreen did so first, 
Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did a very fine job," Grissom said. "Every person in that squadron feels 
a great sense of loss. She was upholding every aspect of what is expected of an 
F-14 carrier pilot." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently Hultgreen had called one of her sisters to discuss how the family 
should be notified if she died in the line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was never under any delusion that it couldn't happen to her," Dagny 
Hultgreen said. "She was worried about how it would affect us if she died. She 
had such a love and passion for her family." 
</P>
<P>
 Spears said the family is bearing up well in the wake of the tragedy. "We're a 
close family and we kept in touch," she said. "We had planned to be part of 
each other's lives for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Dagny Hultgreen, in a telephone interview, said her sister was so involved 
with her flying, which requires constant training and carrier missions, that 
she had not had time for a social life or to consider marriage. Because of her 
surfing, she was called "Flipper" by other members of the Fighting Blacklions 
squadron. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalists who interviewed her remembered Hultgreen as confident and 
personable, with a quick wit and bright laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of those women you met and you're convinced that she could be 
President someday," said KFMB-radio reporter Eva Beim. "She was so strong, 
beautiful and dedicated, so poised for someone so young. She was an 
All-American recruiting poster." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Compass article, Hultgreen had recalled being frustrated before Aspin 
lifted the restriction on women in combat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We dropped bombs, we shot rockets, we did air-to-air gunnery," Hultgreen told 
the Compass. "We did carrier qualifications, we did dogfighting, everything. It 
was frustrating at the time to have done so well and have very limited options 
just because I was female." 
</P>
<P>
 "The F-14 is a dangerous job, that's true," she said in another interview. 
"It's not for everyone and going into combat isn't for everyone."

COLUMN ONE; KICKING HOMEWORK OUT OF SCHOOL; HALF MOON BAY CONSIDERS ABOLISHING 
AN EDUCATIONAL ICON. PROPOSAL IGNITES A GLOBAL STORM AND REFUELS DEBATE OVER 
WHETHER SUCH ASSIGNMENTS REALLY HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The complaints came in fast and furious at Cabrillo Unified School District in 
this precious Northern California coastal town once known mostly for its annual 
Pumpkin Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 First was the woman who called from Jamaica. Half Moon Bay is the root of all 
evil. Then came the whispers at parent orientation for tony Stanford and Santa 
Clara universities. Your children will pay if anyone finds out. And now the 
threats. If this district abolishes homework, I'm sending my kid to private 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 The provocateur was farmer Garrett Redmond, an outgoing school trustee who 
dropped a bombshell two weeks ago at a thinly attended school board meeting: He 
wants this district of 3,500 students to do away with that scourge of family 
life, that torment of childhood, that untouchable American icon: the homework 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 What would Redmond have them do instead? "How the parents and children spend 
that time is not for me to say," he said in an impassioned address. "That's a 
private matter. But they sure as hell don't even have the opportunity . . . if 
homework is handed out and homework takes priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, under the glare of television lights, with radio audiences listening 
in, the board of trustees is scheduled to vote on the future of homework in 
Half Moon Bay. By the time the proceedings begin, Redmond and the other players 
in this homework hubbub will have been interviewed by media outlets from coast 
to coast, and in England, South Africa and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Such widespread interest in this most local of decisions has taken school 
board President Ken Jones by surprise. For even as students, teachers and 
parents here shrink at what they perceive as global ridicule, this 
unprecedented proposal has rekindled a longstanding debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue," Jones said, "has struck some nerve that educators did not even 
know existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Homework policies nationwide have stiffened since 1983, when the controversial 
report "A Nation at Risk" accused American education of being eroded by "a 
rising tide of mediocrity" and kicked off a fury of reflection and reform. 
Today, it is not unusual for kindergartners to have daily tasks to complete 
before being tucked in for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little agreement on how, when, why -- and even if -- homework is 
effective in improving student achievement. Little hard information exists on 
how much homework students actually do and whether that amount is up or down. 
That is because asking a child about frequency of home study is a lot like 
asking an adult about sex -- the result, at best, is often inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 There are educated guesses about why it works when it does; reinforcement of 
skills freshly learned is one good reason. However, not much is known about why 
homework fails when it does, according to at least one major study. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework is, however, the cheapest way to lengthen the school day. Although 
strapped schools cannot afford the daily cost of teachers and classrooms for an 
extra few hours, they can afford to send students home with assignments and 
admonitions: Do this by tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 But is that always good? 
</P>
<P>
 "Homework is absolutely part of the debate on school reform," said Barbara 
Willer, spokeswoman for the National Assn. for the Education of Young Children. 
"There's always this notion that kids aren't working hard enough. However, 
there is also concern that kids' lives are so overly structured that there's no 
time left over to just be kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Monilou Carter, mother and veteran teacher, will never forget the day last 
year when her sophomore daughter, Mariellen, came home in tears from Half Moon 
Bay High School, dropped her backpack in the hallway and fled to her room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bent down to pick up her backpack, and I couldn't lift it," Carter said. 
"It became clear to me at that moment what we're doing to our kids. We're 
breaking their backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter and her daughter are strong believers in the value of homework and 
think that even the suggestion of a ban borders on the bizarre. Limitations, 
however, are another story. In fact, Carter approves of a petition drive to 
restrict homework begun this week by students at Manuel F. Cunha Intermediate 
School where she teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariellen, now 16, would just like a break. It is only October, but she has 
already quit the tennis team because it interferes with chemistry class and 
homework time. She recently skipped practice for a school singing ensemble to 
study for four tests on the same day. Last week she dropped Spanish 3 in favor 
of chorus so at least she can sing on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just overwhelming sometimes," said the serious young woman with the wide 
green eyes and the red Converse All Stars. "The assignments that we get just 
pile up. And when you sit down to do your work and you realize you have seven 
or eight hours in one night . . . it's almost impossible to start." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of its counterparts throughout the nation, the Cabrillo district 
embarked on a course of school reform in the late 1980s. It hired high school 
Principal Bud Eckert -- a retired Marine who lost a leg in Beirut -- and Supt. 
Jane Martin. It passed objectives that included improving student performance 
levels by 5% a year. 
</P>
<P>
 It stiffened the homework policy, like many other districts, by establishing 
mandatory times: 20 to 30 minutes a day, four to five days a week for the 
primary grades; 40 to 60 minutes for grades four and five; 60 to 90 minutes for 
grades six through eight and an average of nine hours a week for high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Eckert is proud to point out, average Scholastic Aptitude Test 
scores rose 28 points for the verbal part of the college entrance exam and 54 
points for the math segment. With a combined average score of 1,003 out of 
1,600, Cabrillo is above state and national averages. The district went from 
offering no advanced placement high school courses to offering five. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want people to understand that we are very proud of our achievement," 
said the defensive principal, who opposes the ban that has demoralized staff 
and students. "All of a sudden we're getting painted with this brush. The 
school and the community are getting some negative comments." 
</P>
<P>
 Eckert insists that homework is a road map to learning needed by all of his 
students -- from the impoverished children of local agricultural workers to the 
affluent offspring of Silicon Valley executives. "It helps a student get to the 
place where he or she clearly understands new knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Homework has been controversial for much of the 20th Century. In 1913, the 
Ladies' Home Journal warned against the "useless and really dangerous practice 
of carrying books home and asking pupils to do evening studies." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s, two major reviews of homework research came to opposing 
conclusions. One said that homework leads to higher achievement, while the 
other said that there was not sufficient evidence to reach any conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, homework guru Herbert Walberg, a research professor of education at 
the University of Illinois at Chicago, insisted that homework worked all the 
time. He and two graduate students had scouted out more than 1,000 articles and 
studies on homework from the first 80 years of the century. Picking the 15 
studies that had empirical data, Walberg and his crew crunched all the numbers 
in a process called "meta-analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that homework has a consistent and moderate beneficial effect on 
learning. But grading it and giving feedback has a very substantial effect on 
learning," said Walberg, who considers himself a pro-homework fanatic and 
derides Redmond's proposal as typical California "looseness." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later in the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals 
Bulletin, J. Michael Palardy concluded that most research does not show a 
statistically significant correlation between homework and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things, however, are clearly shown by educational research, wrote the 
University of Alabama professor of education: "The first is that homework for 
primary grade children seems not only inappropriate but in many instances 
counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 How much homework students end up doing is another contentious point. Even if 
statistics were readily available, they would be questionable, researchers say. 
The U.S. Department of Education estimates that 31% of American 13-year-olds 
have two or more hours of homework per day, compared to 44% in Taiwan, 55% in 
France and 66% in Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 That high figure for Ireland should come as no surprise to Redmond, 65, whose 
Dublin childhood helped fuel his current anti-homework fervor. Redmond counts 
himself lucky that, as a Catholic schoolboy, he got homework help from his 
parents, older brother and sister and particularly from a retired schoolmaster 
who boarded with his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 His less fortunate classmates -- those who did not or could not do their 
homework -- found themselves on the wrong end of a flogging at the hands of 
their instructors, men who "if they were running Singapore, it would be a lot 
more disciplined than it is today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since then, the inequity of homework has stuck with me," he said. Those 
who do not have able parents or computers in the home or a place to study -- in 
short, those on the economic outs in this quasi-agricultural town just an hour 
from San Francisco -- are at a distinct disadvantage in a competitive school 
district that prides itself on achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Redmond also has been approached in his four years on the board by parents who 
complained about losing their children to schoolwork. In fact, Redmond contends 
that homework cheats him out of the company of Keelin, his studious, 
14-year-old daughter. "I think the time spent on homework would be better spent 
with the family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first response of many in the district was a chorus of "There he goes 
again." "I thought he was kidding," said school board President Jones on first 
hearing of the proposal. But after Redmond's typically flamboyant speech, Jones 
found himself a little swayed. "I'll be damned," he thought. "He's making some 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin acknowledges that new teachers receive little training in homework -- 
how to give it and what it's for. The superintendent believes that her 
district's policy could stand a little improvement, perhaps an emphasis on 
coordinating assignments and maybe limiting them. "The policy won't be 
abolished," she said, "but we can change it." 
</P>
<P>
 And so the spotlight is now firmly fixed on the man who many consider the 
antihero of Half Moon Bay. Redmond has been interviewed on the BBC and radio 
station 702 in Johannesburg, Africa. "Good Morning America" wanted this 
television-less farmer today; "Today" wanted him whenever they could get him. 
Until last week, he says, he had never even heard of "Bryant Grumble". 
</P>
<P>
 He is loathe these days to sit with his back to a door, he jokes, in a town 
where some think of him as serious of heart and others accuse him of 
self-aggrandizement. If he could make a buck off all the attention, then maybe 
he would like it a little more, he said sardonically. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, all it has given him is a steady diet of Advil and Tagamet, 3:30 a.m. 
limousine rides to San Francisco television studios and a certain cachet with 
some high school freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not do homework," said Jacob Lefler, 14, as he straggled back to 
Half Moon Bay High School after a fast-food lunch nearby. "I think this is 
pretty cool."

CLINTON SEEKS TO BUILD BRIDGE TO MUSLIM WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, rejecting a view held by many in the Middle East and the 
United States, declared Wednesday that no inherent conflict exists between 
Islam and the values of Western civilization and that the two systems together 
should confront a common enemy -- extremism. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrorist groups, many affiliated with fundamentalist religious movements, 
"cloak themselves in the rhetoric of religion and nationalism, but behave in 
ways that contradict the very teachings of their faith and mock their 
patriotism," Clinton said in a speech to the Jordanian Parliament -- the first 
by an American President. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who insist that, between America and the Middle East, there 
are impassable religious and other obstacles to harmony, that our beliefs and 
our cultures must inevitably clash," he said. "But I believe they are wrong. 
America refuses to accept that our civilizations must collide. We respect 
Islam." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's words drew loud applause from the Parliament, but in an indication 
of the tensions that his words addressed, 35 seats in the hall were empty. 
Members of the Islamic Action Front, which opposes U.S. policies and influence 
in the region, had announced that they would boycott the speech. 
</P>
<P>
 With his remarks, Clinton plunged himself into the center of a major 
intellectual debate in the West and in the Islamic world -- a debate with 
enormous implications for either avoiding or kindling future conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of fundamentalist theologians and other intellectuals in the Islamic 
world have argued that the beliefs of Islam and the West differ so 
fundamentally that they must inevitably lead to conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 That argument has been paralleled within the United States and Europe, where 
prominent writers on international affairs have developed a now-fashionable 
theory that an unavoidable clash between Islam and the West will replace the 
long fight between capitalism and communism as the central conflict of the 
coming century. 
</P>
<P>
 On both sides, those predictions draw on a history of conflict and suspicion 
that dates back a millennium -- to the ages of the Crusaders and the wars 
between the armies of Islam and Christendom -- and that has been deepened by 
the legacy of Western colonialism in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 White House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake has denounced those 
arguments in the past and has argued that the United States, with its diversity 
of cultures, should be able to act as a bridge between the differing systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Clinton chose to emphasize the theme in his 
speech in part to lend support to those who have tried to build a pluralistic 
society in Jordan, but also in hopes of using the momentum of the current peace 
process to further a basic strategy of offering support to moderates within the 
Arab and Islamic worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the idea that the United States can serve as a bridge, Clinton 
pointed out that "every day in our own land, millions of our citizens answer 
the Muslim call to prayer." Their values "are in harmony with the best of 
America's ideals," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a conflict between religious systems or cultures, Clinton said, the 
Middle East faces a clash between "forces that transcend civilizations; a 
contest between tyranny and freedom, terror and security, bigotry and 
tolerance, isolation and openness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those forces of reaction feed on disillusionment, on poverty, on despair," he 
said, and he pledged additional U.S. assistance to develop the economies of 
Jordan and other nations that commit to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the economic development effort would be a new Middle East 
Bank for Cooperation and Development -- an institution that would include the 
Arabs and Israel, excluding nations such as Iran, Iraq and Libya that have 
refused to join the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank would fund regional, multinational efforts such as building water 
projects or power grids. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have discussed the possibility of such a bank before and have 
been in negotiations with European countries and the wealthy states of the 
Persian Gulf to determine how much of the bank's initial capital each nation 
would contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope that Clinton's public endorsement of the idea will move the 
effort forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's speech came near the end of an 18-hour day that began in Cairo, 
where he met with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat, then moved on to the barren Arava Valley, north of Aqaba, where he 
witnessed the signing of Jordan's peace treaty with Israel. After a few hours 
of rest at a government guest palace here, Clinton plans to move on today to 
Syria for meetings with President Hafez Assad and then to Israel for more 
meetings and a speech to the Knesset. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule, coupled with the desert heat and dust, left Clinton looking 
exhausted and red-eyed by day's end. Aides said the schedule had taken some 
toll on him, but that he was excited by the momentous events overtaking the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 While the schedule has been grueling, it has had some comforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose birthday was Wednesday, 
awoke in Cairo's Qebbeh Palace, which the Egyptian government uses as a guest 
house. After arriving in Aqaba, Jordan, they had lunch with King Hussein and 
Queen Noor at their summer palace on the Gulf of Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after the speech to Parliament in Amman, the couple visited the 
monarchs again at Nadwa Palace before retiring for the night at Hashimiyah 
Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by reporters about all the palaces on the schedule, Clinton joked: "I'm 
still committed to democracy, but this is pretty nice." 
</P>
<P>
 * PIECE OF THE PUZZLE: Israel-Jordan treaty moves the peace process forward. 
A6 What the Treaty Says 
</P>
<P>
 Here are highlights of the Jordan-Israel peace treaty: 
</P>
<P>
 * Peace is established between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom 
of Jordan, effective at the signing Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Israel and Jordan will recognize each other's sovereignty, territorial 
integrity and political independence. 
</P>
<P>
 * The parties will develop neighborly relations of cooperation to ensure 
lasting security, refrain from the threat or use of force against each other 
and settle all disputes between them by peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
 * The parties agree to establish full diplomatic and consular relations and to 
exchange resident ambassadors within one month of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 * They agree to recognize each other's rights to Jordan River and Yarmuk River 
waters and Arava ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 * They agree to remove all discriminatory barriers to normal economic 
relations, to terminate economic boycotts and to cooperate in terminating 
boycotts against either party by third parties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Each party will provide freedom of access to places of religious and 
historical significance. Israel respects the special role of the Hashemite 
Kingdom of Jordan in Muslim holy shrines in Jerusalem. When negotiations on the 
city's permanent status take place, Israel will give high priority to Jordan's 
historic role in these shrines.

ITO DISMISSES JURY PROSPECTS EXPOSED TO MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Struggling to find jurors for the O.J. Simpson murder trial who have obeyed a 
strict order to steer clear of all media, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito 
dismissed prospects in rapid-fire succession Wednesday after they admitted to 
some exposure to radio or television in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, that exposure was brief and apparently innocent: One man 
listened to the radio, but only when his clock radio woke him up one morning. 
One woman turned on her television to watch an old Barbara Stanwyck movie, 
while another watched a soap opera on a Spanish-language station. All were sent 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 They and other panelists were removed for failing to abide by an unusually 
strict admonition directing them to avoid all media and bookstores, an order 
Ito imposed earlier this month after the release of a splashy book purporting 
to detail the last months of Nicole Brown Simpson's life. O.J. Simpson has 
pleaded not guilty to murdering his ex-wife and Ronald Lyle Goldman, both of 
whom were slashed and stabbed to death in Brentwood on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito has said that he is not looking for "hermits" or "Rip Van 
Winkles" to weigh evidence in the case, he has summarily excused every 
prospective juror who failed to abide by his Oct. 18 order. 
</P>
<P>
 One prospective juror who was dismissed Wednesday said he had overheard 
mention of a lie detector when his clock radio woke him one morning. (Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, in a hearing one day last week, said she believed 
that many potential jurors were lying to get on the panel and added that she 
wished she could hook them up to lie detectors. She later said she was joking 
about the lie detectors.) Another man, a 66-year-old retiree from Alhambra, 
said he had watched television cartoons with his grandson one day. 
</P>
<P>
 He too was dismissed. So was a man whose entire exposure to media since Oct. 
18 consisted of overhearing a snippet of a news report about the Senate race in 
Massachusetts. He heard that while sitting in a bar where a television was on, 
the man said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the questioning of jury candidates continued, still more were excused -- by 
day's end, 13 had been questioned and eight dismissed, all but one over 
exposure to media. One admitted to having watched a Spanish-language soap opera 
on television; another acknowledged that she "slipped" and watched the Stanwyck 
movie on a cable station. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ito asked that woman if she had thought about his admonition when she was 
watching, she admitted that she had thought the oversight harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of slipped," she said. "I thought it wouldn't hurt. It was just an old 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said the process reflects the extraordinary difficulty of 
abiding by Ito's requirement that the panelists avoid every type of media in a 
media-saturated society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost impossible for prospective jurors to suddenly transform 
themselves into social hermits," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor. 
"That's exactly what Judge Ito's order demands that they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Arenella and other legal experts said Ito had little choice but to excuse 
jurors who disobeyed his admonition, however innocently. But the rigorous 
standards that Ito has imposed have taken their toll: In several days of 
questioning, almost half of the 57 jury candidates interviewed so far have been 
excused. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of Wednesday's candidates were allowed to remain after they insisted 
that they had studiously adhered to the order. But it has not been easy, some 
admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, a 41-year-old City Hall office manager, said she had taken great 
care to avoid exposure to media, going so far as to avoid visiting a neighbor 
who watches a lot of television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to really isolate myself a lot," the woman said. "It's real quiet, 
and I don't like being quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the woman complained that it "feels like forever" that she has been 
part of the Simpson jury pool, Ito asked her if she could hang on a little 
longer, at least until she and other remaining juror candidates return Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," she responded weakly. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nov. 2 session, the two sides will be allowed to exercise peremptory 
challenges, removing jury candidates with whom they feel uncomfortable without 
having to state their reasons why. 
</P>
<P>
 When prospective jurors first gathered in late September, they were asked to 
avoid media coverage about the case, an admonition that is common in 
high-profile cases and one that most of the panelists in the Simpson case have 
said they were able to obey. But when the book about Nicole Simpson was 
released last week, Ito strengthened his admonition, directing the jury 
candidates to avoid all media -- television, radio, newspapers and magazines -- 
and to stay out of bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that stricter order that is highly unusual and that has proved so 
difficult for many of the panelists to obey. As one man said in trying to 
explain his inadvertent exposure to media last week: "It's in the air." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you put these people in a monastery, I don't see how they can help but 
have some innocent exposure to media," said Myrna Raeder, a law professor at 
Southwestern University. "It really seems to me that this is imposing such a 
hardship on the jurors. I question the efficacy of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has acknowledged that his admonition is a difficult one to follow, but he 
has insisted on strict adherence to it. On Wednesday, however, he did offer 
some solace to the prospective jurors who persevere: He promised to modify his 
order on Nov. 2 so that any panelist who remains after that point will not face 
such difficult restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the Simpson case has been under way since Sept. 26, exactly 
one month, and has been interrupted repeatedly for Ito to respond to 
developments and consider motions. Wednesday, the process was briefly halted 
yet again as the judge paused to consider a request by Simpson's lawyers to 
limit the number of witnesses who may testify at a crucial DNA hearing expected 
to begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 At that eagerly anticipated hearing, Ito will consider whether the state of 
DNA science and the procedures adopted by investigators in the Simpson case 
justify admitting DNA test results into evidence in this case. Those results 
are considered a mainstay of the prosecution case and already have been the 
subject of intense debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers originally wrote to Ito on Oct. 18 asking for the limit on 
witnesses, and Carl Douglas, a member of Simpson's defense team, reiterated 
that request in court Wednesday. But prosecutors strenuously objected, saying 
that there was no precedent for such a limit and warning Ito that such a move 
might be overturned by an appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from both sides Wednesday, Ito declined to impose the limit 
despite warnings from Simpson's lawyers that failing to do so means that the 
session could last as long as five weeks. Ito said he hopes to begin that 
hearing sometime around Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the schedule he has established, the trial will recess for Christmas, 
meaning that a prolonged DNA hearing could postpone opening statements, once 
anticipated for mid- to late November, until as late as January. Simpson has 
pressed for a speedy trial, and the delays have left him restless and 
depressed, according to his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very depressed at this case dragging on for six months," Robert L. 
Shapiro, one of Simpson's attorneys, said Wednesday. "Initially, when we talked 
about a speedy trial, he was hopeful that he would be trick-or-treating with 
his kids and then having Thanksgiving dinner and then spending Christmas with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito declined for now to rule on the defense request that television cameras 
not be allowed in the courtroom during that hearing, a suggestion that 
Simpson's lawyers said would prevent jurors from hearing about DNA tests during 
the period before opening statements begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has scheduled a hearing for Nov. 7 to decide whether to ban television 
cameras from the entire trial, and he said Wednesday that he will consider the 
defense request as part of that proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ito did instruct attorneys to avoid mentioning any specific results during 
the discussion of DNA testing. He asked the lawyers on both sides to inform 
their experts of that request so that no one blurts out results during the 
hearing and risks having jurors read that information in news reports.

 Years of heated political battling over the future of mass transit in the San 
Fernando Valley ended Wednesday in victory for a mostly subway line from 
Universal City to Canoga Park and defeat for the rival proposal to erect an 
elevated rail line above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Culminating a debate that at times took on the air of theater, the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted to approve the mid-Valley subway 
option along Burbank and Chandler boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a surprisingly decisive 8 to 5, though up until the last moment 
neither side dared predict victory. The losers were bitter in defeat as the 
winners exulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great day for the Valley," Los Angeles County Supervisor and MTA 
Chairman Ed Edelman, the most outspoken defender of the subway alternative, 
said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board had the wisdom to follow the facts and make a decision. I hope 
this'll end the struggle over this." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, an MTA member, introduced the winning 
motion to adopt the subway route and move forward with the environmental 
studies that must now be conducted to qualify the project for federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clearly the right decision," said Riordan, who supported an elevated 
line over the freeway during his election campaign last year, but announced 
Tuesday that he had changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he reversed his endorsement because the subway will cost far less 
than previously believed, serve more heavily populated areas, provide an 
alternate transit corridor in the event of damage to the freeway, and enjoys 
the support of most homeowner and civic groups in the Valley -- a key political 
base for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who has lobbied fiercely for years for 
the rail line above the freeway median, lambasted Riordan for "lacking vision." 
He accused the mayor of going "back on his word," and cited a non-binding 
referendum in 1990, when the freeway rail option drew the most ballots from 
Valley voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going back on the people is a bad policy," Antonovich told Riordan in a stony 
exchange after the vote, as the mayor tried to make peace with a handshake and 
explain his change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich characterized the decision as a triumph for interest groups with 
stakes in subway construction. Citing problems already plaguing work on the 
Metro Red Line in Hollywood and elsewhere, Antonovich said extending the subway 
into the Valley would be an expensive boondoggle that would drain scarce funds 
from other important transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayers were hit between the eyes by the big liberals who never bat an 
eye spending other people's money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope everybody in the San Fernando Valley will watch those change orders 
and the building costs escalate." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich pressed the case for an elevated freeway line as a cheaper 
alternative and contended that an at-grade railway would cost even less, 
possibly by as much as $500 million less than a predominantly underground 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent studies erased the huge financial advantage planners once ascribed 
to an aerial system. And fellow MTA directors rebuffed Antonovich's last-ditch 
attempt to delay a vote for 90 days to further study the at-grade freeway 
option, a relatively recent idea Antonovich has pushed to make the Ventura 
Freeway route more palatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can (keep coming) in with new proposals. Where do you end up?" Riordan 
said. "Somewhere along the line you've got to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to selecting the subway alignment, Riordan's motion called for 
exploring the postponement of some station openings to save money. It also 
asked planners to consider the use of less costly construction techniques, such 
as putting the rail line in a covered trench rather than traditional deep-bore 
tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's backing of the below-ground route was key to its success before 
the MTA board, which has wrestled with the issue for a decade. His endorsement 
just the day before the decision ensured subway supporters at least four votes, 
including Edelman, Riordan and two of Riordan's three appointees to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The third appointee, Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre, has in the 
past voted for the Ventura Freeway alignment, but had reached what Riordan 
aides called "an understanding" with the mayor Tuesday. On Wednesday, Alatorre 
underwent oral surgery in the morning and was absent from the afternoon MTA 
meeting. That cleared the way for his alternate, fellow Councilman Nate Holden 
-- a staunch subway supporter -- to cast the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the bloc of five subway votes going into the meeting, victory was not 
assured, as both sides of the debate frantically counted votes and repeatedly 
came up short of the majority of seven needed to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the discussion, lobbying continued intensely, as board members 
passed notes, drew aside for whispered consultations and jotted down facts and 
figures on stray sheets of paper. The proceedings took on the air of a 
courtroom drama as Antonovich and Edelman chided each other, quizzed planners 
and consultants, produced visual aids to bolster their cases and delivered what 
sounded remarkably like closing arguments to the panel of MTA directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Wilson, a Northridge realtor who sits on the MTA board as one of Riordan's 
appointees, gave a slide presentation -- unusual at an MTA meeting -- that 
touched on topics ranging from cost analyses to educational demographics, to 
press the case for a mid-Valley subway line. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade of elected officials from the Valley -- including Assemblyman Richard 
Katz (D-Sylmar), Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick and Rep. Anthony 
Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) -- also made appeals, mostly on behalf of the 
Burbank-Chandler route. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue is more important, more overriding, than any issue" in my 
political career, City Councilman Marvin Braude told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen audience members testified, to scattered cheers and jeers 
from the packed hearing room. Subway supporters sat on one side wearing neon 
green stickers. Their opponents sat on the other, hoisting red, white and blue 
placards in support of a monorail system over the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 One man was dragged away by police officers when he refused to leave the 
lectern after Edelman cut off public discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, voting for the subway alignment were Edelman, Riordan, Wilson, 
Holden, Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky (standing in for Riordan 
appointee Stan Sanders), county Supervisors Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, and Gardena City Councilman Jim Cragin. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the motion were Antonovich, County Supervisor Deane Dana, Huntington 
Park Councilman Raul Perez, Glendale Councilman Larry Zarian and Duarte 
Councilman John Fasana. 
</P>
<P>
 Fasana said he was not against the Burbank-Chandler route but could not 
support more underground construction in the face of the recent Metro Rail 
tunneling problems in Hollywood. A light-rail system along the Burbank-Chandler 
alignment would have been the best option, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't know what really happened down there (beneath Hollywood 
Boulevard) and whether it'll happen again," Fasana said.

<P>
 Along the bare, wheat-colored slopes of Laguna Beach and Emerald Bay, fate is 
as capricious as a wind-blown gust of fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some families who lost everything a year ago to an untamed 2,000-degree blaze 
are flourishing, grateful that their memories are more durable than Christmas 
ornaments and sterling flatware.Others, who survived with their ocean views and 
luxury houses intact, see no charm in their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oct. 27 wildfire devoured 441 homes in and around Laguna Beach, the worst 
disaster in Orange County since the flood of '38. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, on the one-year anniversary of the wildfire, arson investigators are no 
closer to discovering who set the blaze than they were the day it erupted. And 
neighbors are still struggling to make sense of the inferno that granted mercy 
to some houses and burned others to their foundations. Please see A24-A25.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: BROWN MAY BE CATCHING WAVE WITH PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I ought to be dead," Kathleen Brown shouts, diagnosing her political health 
while competing with the loud drone of a small private airplane. "All those 
polls, all those articles, all summer long. I ought to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I am not. Something out there has been keeping me alive. And I am alive. 
I am well. I am in the ring. I've got the guy on the ropes. And he has nowhere 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 For months, what has been keeping Brown alive in her slugfest with Gov. Pete 
Wilson is the Republican incumbent's unpopularity with the voters -- "high 
negatives" they're called in the politics biz. Brown's own fighting ability has 
disappointed even her most ardent rooters -- sluggish, threw the wrong punches, 
they complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, the underdog Democrat has been running on adrenaline and spunk in her 
effort to become the first woman and the third Brown to be elected California 
governor. Most experts had counted her out. But now she and her strategists say 
they sense the battle finally turning her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's debate performance two weeks ago -- particularly her surprise 
revelation that a daughter had been date raped -- showed a fiery, human side 
relatively few voters had seen. She looked sharp in contrast to the awkward 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 64-page "book" -- a "plan" for "Building a New California" -- has been 
ridiculed by Wilson and questioned as a political strategy by Democratic 
outsiders. But 1.1 million copies have been mailed to Democratic households 
and, in all, 1.8 million are in circulation. Whether or not anybody actually 
reads the thing, voters are getting the word that Brown does have a plan for 
governing. The charge that she doesn't stand for anything won't hold up. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Brown may be catching a wave on Proposition 187, the ballot measure 
that would bar illegal immigrants from most public services and require school 
and health officials to snitch on suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 She began amplifying her criticisms of 187 just as many voters started backing 
away from the initiative. A new Times poll today shows support for 187 falling 
as voter impressions of Brown rise and she edges closer to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigration and the governor's race may be different subjects in the 
voters' minds, but that will change, Brown asserts as her plane flies north to 
Burbank. She is returning from ground zero for California politicking, the 
epicenter of emotion and controversy: the California-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 Never before have so many candidates stumped along the border. Wilson has 
practically camped out there. Brown has been there several times. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, fittingly, she was interviewed on talk radio, which has emerged as 
a powerful swayer of political thought. Here it all converged: a candidate for 
California's top office broadcasting her views over an increasingly potent 
medium at the border, symbol of the season's hottest political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 She seized the moment with KABC's Michael Jackson -- seated at a folding table 
on a patch of grass near the San Ysidro pedestrian walkway -- to play an audio 
tape of Wilson debating her brother Jerry during the 1982 Senate race. Wilson 
then opposed penalizing employers who hire illegal immigrants. (He now supports 
it, but says workers should carry a tamper-proof "legal residency" card.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also assailed Wilson again for pushing, as a senator, a guest farm 
worker program that opened up a giant loophole for illegal immigrants. (Wilson 
says the loophole was added by Democrats.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her message: Wilson is "a hypocrite cynically exploiting immigrants" to stay 
in office. The solution to illegal immigration is sealing the border, 
penalizing employers and deporting illegal felons -- not passing Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This has been Wilson's issue and conventional wisdom suggests Brown should 
back off and fight him elsewhere. But, she says aboard the plane, this is about 
the incumbent's cynicism and character and her leadership. "I have been 
courageously right on 187 since Day 1," she says. "I've been standing for 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, she believes, voters are recognizing all this while a linchpin of 
Wilson's campaign -- 187 -- corrodes; while one of his political strengths 
becomes a weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sends up the red flag on 187, Brown continues, many of her apathetic 
supporters -- especially Latinos -- will become more motivated to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 I noted some insiders privately have complained that the disclosure of her 
daughter's rape distracted voters from her main campaign messages. "Politics is 
about a lot more than just messages," she replied. "It's about having somebody 
who is authentic and real and talks from the heart." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what many rooters had been trying to remind her of for months.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 186; SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM WOULD BALLOON STATE 
BUDGET, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proposition 186, the sweeping proposal to overhaul the health insurance system 
on the Nov. 8 ballot, would add a huge burden to the state budget -- $72 
billion more than now being projected -- over its first five years, according 
to a study released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the study said, the mammoth tax bite called for by the 
single-payer initiative could grow even larger than its supporters have 
calculated, amounts already in the tens of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The analysis by a national accounting firm said legislators would be 
hard-pressed to find money to finance the proposed state-run health system, 
which promises cradle-to-grave health coverage for all legal California 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the study concludes that those big taxes could mean big health care 
savings. It says that California businesses and individuals would spend 
significantly less under the new plan than they do now in health insurance 
premiums and out-of-pocket medical expenses, and would get more health 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 On average, family spending on health, even including the 2.5% levy on taxable 
personal income called for by the initiative, would decline by about 60%, said 
the study -- assuming taxes are not raised further to cover added expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the projected savings over a five-year period is perhaps more 
breathtaking than the deficits -- $112 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of the higher taxes, lower out-of-pocket expenses and staggeringly large 
deficits were part of an extraordinarily intense debate that developed in a 
downtown hotel over what is possibly the most complex initiative ever offered 
to California voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was done by the accounting firm KMPG Peat Marwick on a grant from 
the Kaiser Family Foundation, one of the nation's largest private foundations 
devoted exclusively to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was established by industrialist Henry J. Kaiser but is not 
associated with Kaiser hospitals or health plans that the businessman also was 
instrumental in starting. 
</P>
<P>
 Drew Altman, president of the Menlo Park foundation, said the study was 
undertaken because if the initiative passes, "we will have an unprecedented 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Proposition 186 health system is called "single payer" because if the 
measure passes, the state would become the single payer of all health bills, 
expected to easily exceed $100 billion annually by 1996. Backed by a 
broad-based coalition that includes physicians, consumer activists, nurses, 
labor unions and senior citizens groups, the initiative would accomplish 
universal coverage in part by eliminating private health insurance companies 
from the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians, hospitals and health maintenance organizations that provide care 
would directly bill the state, and patients would hold insurance cards issued 
by the state. In addition to an increase in personal income taxes, businesses 
would face steep payroll taxes and an additional $1 tax would be levied on each 
pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost analysis by Peat Marwick overshadowed a second study released by the 
foundation that looked at issues involved in getting a massive statewide health 
insurance system up and running. That study, by National Academy of Social 
Insurance, a Washington-based health reform think tank, said that setting up 
the single-payer system was technically possible but would require a major 
assist from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Partial results of still another foundation-backed study, undertaken by the 
Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, were 
released. They showed that the media advertising involving Proposition 186 was 
overwhelmingly negative on both sides, creating even more confusion about the 
complex initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 That study said opponents of the measure had raised $5.8 million as of Sept. 
30, at least $3.8 million of it coming from the insurance industry, most of it 
from out of state. By contrast, sponsors of the measure had raised just under 
$1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and opponents of the initiative, which is trailing in public 
opinion surveys, were on hand for release of the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative immediately challenged the size of the projected 
deficits, contending that Proposition 186 has built-in mechanisms to check 
soaring costs of health services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Peat Marwick people are saying this is the kind of scenario if there was 
no cost containment at all," said Dr. Kevin Grumbach, a San Francisco physician 
who helped draft the measure. Grumbach disputed growth projections by the 
accounting firm, saying they were higher than the yardsticks used by some other 
economists. "If you implement effective cost controls and bring the rate of 
growth down into an 8%, 7% range, then you will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wiebe, a spokesman for opponents, said the studies will fuel voters' 
concerns about creating a monumental government bureaucracy and "massive budget 
deficits if this is enacted." 
</P>
<P>
 "The financing mechanism just doesn't make sense," said Wiebe. He said the 
media advertising campaign against the initiative was focused on getting voters 
"to ask themselves whether or not they really do hate the insurance industry 
that much to give up their private insurance and turn their health care over to 
the state government." 
</P>
<P>
 While individuals would see dramatic out-of-pocket reductions in health 
expenses if Proposition 186 passed, according to the study, businesses would 
fare worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers would save from $3 billion to $7 billion annually over the first 
five years, but most of the savings would be concentrated among companies that 
now have the highest health care costs. Those are companies that now pay a 
higher percentage toward employee health care than the top 8.9% of their 
payrolls called for in the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 70% of businesses, mostly smaller businesses, would pay more," said 
Kenneth Cahill, a Peat Marwick researcher. "You are looking at households and 
businesses doing better, but that is because someone else is picking up the 
tab."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON ENCOUNTERS SNAGS ON CAMPAIGN 
TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington campaigned Wednesday on familiar 
topics -- taxes and immigration -- in familiar territory -- San Diego and Los 
Angeles -- but that didn't prevent his day from being bumpier than he bargained 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman congressman from Santa Barbara stopped first in San Diego, where 
he spoke about immigration and Proposition 187, and then in Los Angeles, where 
he won the endorsement of the National Taxpayers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 But at his San Diego appearance, Huffington found himself in an often rambling 
45-minute discussion with a small group that spent more time talking than he 
did. And one audience member was openly frustrated that his only question was 
brushed aside by the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 And while receiving the endorsement of the taxpayers' group, Huffington and 
the group's president were quizzed about why the organization recently listed 
him as among the members of Congress who have voted for large federal outlays 
despite having promised significant spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both events served to sharpen Huffington's key themes in his fierce, 
multimillion-dollar bid to defeat Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose 
principal campaign stop Wednesday was in her rival's home turf of Santa 
Barbara. There, Feinstein received law enforcement endorsements, including 
those of the police chiefs of the cities of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo 
and the sheriffs of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
 At his Los Angeles appearance, Huffington hoped to counter recent questions 
about his spending record in Congress with the endorsement of the 
Washington-based taxpayers group. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defining difference between Dianne Feinstein and me is the difference 
between night and day, Main Street and the Beltway, the future and the past," 
Huffington said. "She treats taxpayers like servants of the federal government 
-- rather than seeing the federal government as servants of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he praised Huffington's record, David Keating, the group's 
president, was pressed to explain why the organization recently listed the 
congressman as among 31 federal legislators who have voted for large federal 
expenditures after pledging to support big spending cuts. That list, published 
in the Wall Street Journal under the heading "Hypocrisy Index," has been used 
in a recent Feinstein commercial to attack Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say the real hypocrisy is Sen. Feinstein running ads that claim 
(Huffington's) record somehow is hypocritical on taxes and spending," Keating 
said, "because while it is not the best record in the Congress, it is far, far 
better than her record." 
</P>
<P>
 But, a reporter asked Keating, what about the recent description of Huffington 
as a "fiscal liberal" by another of the group's board members? 
</P>
<P>
 "He is mistaken," Keating said. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Huffington stressed his support for Proposition 187, the 
controversial ballot measure that seeks to cut all government services for 
undocumented aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last couple of years, the anger over illegal immigration has spilled 
over to legal immigrants and that is really unfair," Huffington said. "There 
are a lot . . . of legal immigrants who are as patriotic, if not more 
patriotic, than those of us who were born here. And we don't want that 
divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 But that goal seemed to belie the emotions surrounding the issue. On Tuesday, 
only hours before Huffington's visit, opponents staged a demonstration in San 
Diego against the measure. And during his meeting, the frustration over illegal 
immigration was palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're overwhelmed," said T.J. Bonner, president of the National Border Patrol 
Council, which represents about 4,500 Border Patrol employees, almost all of 
them officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, one woman told Huffington, "I heard one member of a (local) church say 
. . . that Jesus was a migrant and that therefore we should welcome everyone 
in. Now that kind of rhetoric is very hurtful . . . and it's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone at the meeting was interested only in immigration -- though that 
was the only topic that Huffington was prepared to discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Davis, a retired real estate investor and rock-ribbed Republican, 
unsuccessfully tried to ask Huffington about a recent Feinstein commercial 
accusing the congressman of owing back taxes -- a charge that he has denied. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington interrupted Davis' question and never got back to it -- a 
slight that slightly frustrated Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to hear his response," said Davis, who nevertheless said he would 
vote for Huffington, answer or no. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Huffington's San Diego appearance clearly did not energize the group of 
party loyalists. One said: "I wish he could be a stronger candidate."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN URGES MERGER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling California's current environmental regulation process "a mess," 
Democrat Kathleen Brown on Wednesday offered a plan to streamline the system 
and spur economic development by eliminating 55 agencies and programs for a 
saving of about $100 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference in Los Angeles, the gubernatorial candidate called for a 
new single agency -- the Environmental Protection Commission -- to coordinate 
regulatory activity. Under this restructuring, she said, businesses would be 
able to obtain a single environmental permit regulating air, water, toxic 
substances and waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also called for an environmental budget that would set clear goals for 
cleaning up pollution. She charged that Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has offered 
"only Band-Aids and slogans" for environmental problems and said her new 
commission would be audited every two years "so the people will know whether 
the goals are being met and who to hold accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are real changes, not cosmetic ones," Brown said. "They stand in 
contrast to the Wilson Administration's protection of environmental patronage 
appointments at the expense of the health of both our environment and our 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's proposal, her last major policy initiative before the Nov. 8 election, 
was immediately lauded by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who joined 
several conservation, labor and business leaders in flanking Brown as she made 
her remarks. The Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters and the 
California State Building and Construction Trades Council also endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign, meanwhile, found itself facing a controversy as the 
governor toured the agricultural communities of Salinas, Yuba City and 
Kingsburg on Wednesday. The controversy arose over a newspaper article that 
said he believes all Californians will have to carry identification cards if 
Proposition 187 passes. The initiative would deny most public services to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Chronicle reported Wednesday that in an interview, Wilson 
was asked: "You're governor, you're reelected, 187 passes. Will there be a card 
that people have to carry in California to prove that they are legal 
residents?" According to the Chronicle, Wilson told political editor Susan 
Yoachum, "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 But late Wednesday, Wilson's campaign issued a statement saying that the 
governor "missed the point" of Yoachum's question and therefore gave an answer 
that was misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did not, is not, and has never proposed -- nor does he envision -- that 
all Californians must 'carry' a new identification card if Proposition 187 
passes," said Dan Schnur, a Wilson spokesman. "His one-word response to a 
reporter's question was in the context of a one-hour discussion in which he 
rejected the scare tactics of Proposition 187 opponents. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chronicle now seeks to give greater weight and emphasis to the word carry 
that was the characterization of the reporter, not by the governor, who missed 
the point the reporter was trying to establish during the interview." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chronicle stood by the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who supports a tamper-proof Social Security card to verify legal 
residency, said the idea of making all residents -- including children -- carry 
identification cards is "just plain wrong. It is un-American. This latest 
suggestion from Pete Wilson crosses the line." 
</P>
<P>
 A group opposing the measure, Taxpayers Against 187, noted that national 
experts have as yet been unable to devise an identification system that is 
cost-effective, reliable and does not violate civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign, which announced the endorsements of more than 200 
agricultural leaders from throughout the state Wednesday, sought to undermine 
the impact of Brown's call for environmental regulatory reforms by questioning 
her positions on other matters affecting California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 At her news conference, a Wilson aide distributed handouts titled "Kathleen 
Brown Dead Last in Trade Olympics" that accused Brown of flip-flopping on the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown replied that if elected, she will be better at making NAFTA work for 
California than Wilson could ever be "because of the role he has played in the 
bashing of immigrants through Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 James M. Strock, Wilson's secretary for environmental protection, said he 
worried that Brown's proposed commission would create a new level of 
"super-bureaucracy" that would be expensive and would fail to provide 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is to have a single point of accountability to the governor. That 
would be lost," said Strock, who heads the California Environmental Protection 
Agency. He said Wilson is already cutting bureaucracy and reforming the 
permitting process. "It's good to see her coming this way." 
</P>
<P>
 But several of those who attended Brown's news conference criticized Wilson's 
performance. Mike Paparian, the legislative director for the California Sierra 
Club, said Wilson has "appointed staff and regulatory board members with 
financial ties to the very industries they are regulating." Wilson's proposals 
for reform, he said, "seem rooted in protecting polluters, rather than the 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's plan also drew praise from some business leaders. Merv Adelson, the 
chief executive officer of East-West Capital in Los Angeles, said the proposals 
would help decrease "redundant bureaucratic red tape. . . . They just make good 
old-fashioned common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Balgenorth, president of California State Building and Construction Trades 
Council, said, "We support this plan for one very good reason: Jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 And at least one person whose job Brown might ax said he, too, supported her. 
Wesley Chesbro, vice chair of the California Integrated Waste Management Board 
-- one of the agencies that Brown proposes to abolish -- said: "The issue is 
not protecting anyone's government job. It's protecting the environment."

FBI INVESTIGATING DEATHS AT PRISON; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SEVEN INMATES HAVE BEEN 
FATALLY SHOT BY GUARDS AT CORCORAN SINCE 1988. AGENTS REPORTEDLY ARE FOCUSING 
ON POTENTIAL CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI agents are investigating possible civil rights violations at the maximum 
security Corcoran State Prison near Fresno, where seven inmates have been shot 
to death by guards since the prison opened in 1988, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began at Corcoran within the past month and has entailed 
interviews with prison guards, inmates and officials. FBI spokesman Tom Griffin 
in Sacramento told The Times that the inquiry is focusing on "potential civil 
rights violations by people at the prison," but would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI sent a letter to the California Department of Corrections last week 
informing the state about the investigation, and "asked us not to interfere 
with them," said Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult 
Correctional Agency, which oversees the prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said he has "heard that there is either the possibility of a grand 
jury or there is one convened" to ask questions about the prison's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Novey, head of the state prison guards union, said FBI agents have 
interrogated correctional officers at their homes, adding that the questions 
appear to focus on the prison's shooting policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've (Corcoran prison officials) got a screwed up weapons firing 
policy," Novey said, suggesting that the policy calls for the use of deadly 
force too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI inquiries into California prison operations are not unheard of. But, 
referring to FBI agents visiting officers' homes, Novey said: "I've never seen 
anything like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven shooting deaths of inmates by correctional officers at Corcoran is 
higher than the toll at any other California state prison in the last 10 years. 
The next-highest number of shooting deaths by correctional officers -- four -- 
has occurred at Pelican Bay State Prison, a maximum security facility that 
opened in 1989 near the Oregon border. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall in the last decade, correctional officers have shot and killed 36 
inmates in California state prisons, including three since September, The Times 
reported last month. That is more than three times the number in all other 
major U.S. prison systems combined during the 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings County district attorney's office has reviewed each shooting death 
at Corcoran prison and found nothing improper in the officers' actions, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick Hart, who supervises the criminal division of the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said he knows of only one death that might raise questions. In 1992, 
officers trying to stop a knife attack accidentally shot and killed the inmate 
who was the victim of the attack, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources who work with inmates say prisoners told them that FBI agents 
interviewed inmates at the prison Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the inmates questioned was one who alleges that officers tried to force 
him into dropping a lawsuit over medical care at Corcoran, where a new 75-bed 
prison hospital opened last year. When the inmate refused to drop his suit, he 
was allegedly accused of assault, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the two highest-security prisons in the state, Corcoran has had its 
share of problems. In December, an officer was fired for using marijuana and 
cocaine while off duty. In 1990, two lieutenants were convicted of criminal 
assault in state court for using a Taser on an inmate's testicles.

FORMER REBELS PULL OUT OF MOZAMBIQUE ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mozambique's former rebel Renamo movement, which waged a 16-year civil war 
against the Maputo government, said it had pulled out of the country's first 
multi-party elections hours before polls opened today. 
</P>
<P>
 Renamo spokesman Rahil Khan cited fraud as the reason for the move but said 
the movement would participate if its concerns were met. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have not been created conditions for free and fair elections due to 
fraud, so we are not participating. That is our position now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement threw officials into confusion after members of Renamo and the 
independent National Electoral Commission met into the early hours today to try 
to resolve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Western diplomat said he did not regard the Renamo comment as a final 
pullout, even hours before polls were due to open at 7 a.m. local time to elect 
a national assembly and president. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. member of the team overseeing Mozambique's 2-year-old peace accord and 
transition to democracy said confusion reigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not at all clear what is happening," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets of Maputo were quiet as dawn broke over the capital of the former 
Portuguese colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic observers said it is unlikely the voting could be postponed. They 
questioned how Renamo -- the Mozambique National Resistance headed by Afonso 
Dhlakama -- would get the message to its supporters to stay away from polling 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Renamo rebels' demands included proper monitoring of voter 
registration and ballot papers and the resignation of a U.N. Development 
Program consultant who the movement said was promoting irregularities.

AMY BIEHL'S KILLERS GET 18-YEAR SENTENCES; SOUTH AFRICA: JUDGE COULD HAVE 
IMPOSED THE DEATH PENALTY ON THE THREE MEN. INSTEAD, HE SAYS THEY MIGHT BE 
REHABILITATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A judge on Wednesday gave the three killers of American student Amy Biehl 18 
years in prison instead of the death penalty, saying they have a chance to 
become useful citizens despite showing no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 Mongezi Manqina, Mzikhona Nofemela and Vusumzi Ntamo, all members of the black 
militant Pan Africanist Student Organization, might appeal their convictions in 
Biehl's Aug. 25, 1993, slaying, defense lawyer Justice Poswa said. 
</P>
<P>
 High Court Judge Gerald Friedman said Biehl "was killed for one reason only, 
namely because she had white skin." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he rejected the death penalty because there is a chance that 
Biehl's killers can become useful citizens "despite the fact that they have 
shown no remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman noted that Biehl had come to South Africa to support the cause of the 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fulbright scholar from Newport Beach, Biehl was in South Africa helping to 
educate voters. She was set upon by a mob chanting anti-white slogans when she 
drove black friends home to the impoverished Guguletu township outside Cape 
Town. She was bludgeoned and stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a coldblooded and brutal murder carried out by a mob on a 
defenseless young girl of 26 who had already sustained a serious injury to her 
head from which she was bleeding profusely," the judge said in a solemn voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Poswa said he will explore an amnesty for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus said he would oppose any such move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they must serve 18 years, full stop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the three men can demonstrate to a proposed commission that their crime was 
politically motivated, admit their guilt and give a full account of their 
actions, they could qualify for amnesty under a bill now before Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is designed to help heal the wounds of the country's apartheid past 
as South Africa begins a new democratic era. Poswa said that he would discuss 
the amnesty program with his clients, who have not admitted guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's father said that he and his family are at peace with the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any sentence cannot bring Amy back," Peter Biehl said in Newport Beach. But 
he said he hoped the killers can be rehabilitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they survive the 18-year term, they'll be 40 or so when they get out," he 
said. "I hope they make more productive use of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's mother, Linda, said she is satisfied with the sentence because the 
deaths of her daughter's killers would not "be helpful in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, two dozen young blacks chanted "Settler! Settler! 
Bullet! Bullet!" and ran through the streets after learning of the sentence. 
"Settler" is a term used for whites by black militants in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 They also shouted "One settler, one bullet," the same chant that witnesses 
said they heard just before Biehl was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ntamo's mother, Nomhle, said she felt more sorry for the victim's parents than 
for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's gone, and they won't see her anymore. Our sons are coming back," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pan Africanist Congress official, Yasien Mohamed, said it was apartheid, not 
the three youths, that caused Biehl's death and that the sentence was "too 
much."

POLITICS; BIG MONEY, BIG GAMBLE IN FLORIDA ELECTION; CHILES-BUSH GOVERNOR'S 
RACE IS A TOSSUP. SEN. MACK IS WAY OUT IN FRONT. CASINO INITIATIVE IS NO SURE 
BET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Florida voters, the Nov. 8 election is not exactly a crap shoot, but the 
top three issues to be decided all involve millions of dollars, major unknowns 
and no little risk. And only one of the ballot questions has to do with 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 8 asks Floridians if they want to see 47 casinos opened across the 
Sunshine State, adding craps, black jack, roulette and slot machines into a 
tourism-dependent economy in which betting on dogs, horses, jai alai, bingo and 
a lottery has been legal for years. At least 14 of the gaming parlors would be 
in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two key issues in the state are the races for the U.S. Senate and 
the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 One incumbent is considered a lock: Republican Sen. Connie Mack is expected to 
roll over his Democratic challenger, former Miami public defender Hugh Rodham, 
the brother of First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. A poll last month showed Mack 
leading by more than 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodham, 44, whose poll numbers are climbing, may have gotten a boost from a 
visit to Miami two weeks ago by his sister and President Clinton. But he 
remains a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Couple turned up at a $5,000-a-plate dinner in Miami to raise money 
for state Democratic candidates who are thought to have a good chance of a 
victory on Tuesday. Rodham is not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough, tough campaign," said Clinton of Rodham's quest. "But it's 
worth waging." 
</P>
<P>
 The other major Florida race, which also has a White House connection, is 
considered a toss-up. One-term Gov. Lawton Chiles, a 64-year-old Democrat and 
former U.S. senator, is trying to hold off Miami businessman Jeb Bush, the 
youngest son of former President George Bush, in a race that has turned nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 In a debate in Orlando, Bush reacted to recent Chiles television spots 
questioning the challenger's business ethics by accusing the governor of 
mudslinging and asking: "After all your years of public service, don't you feel 
a sense of shame?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you what I feel," retorted an angry Chiles. "I love the state of 
Florida. It is not a toy for somebody to experiment with, with no experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, a 41-year-old developer considered to be more conservative than his 
father, opposes abortion rights, says he would require all new state taxes to 
be approved by voter referendum and favors a two-year limit on welfare benefits 
to women and children. On the stump, he is confident and well-spoken -- in both 
English and Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles is affable and well-liked -- an effective face-to-face campaigner who 
has never lost an election. He is a champion of environmental rights and is 
credited with state health care and tax reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 After enjoying an early lead, Bush has seen the race close to a dead heat -- 
or even has fallen behind in recent days, according to polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles has made gains by portraying Bush as inexperienced. His challenger also 
may be hurt by backlash over a controversial television ad in which Bush blames 
Chiles for failing to execute a man who killed a 10-year-old girl in 1980. 
Reminiscent of the Willie Horton ad that helped Bush's father win the 
presidency in 1988, the spot accuses Chiles of being soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bush admitted Tuesday, the killer is alive because of court appeals, 
and Chiles has had no role in the delays. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot issue that may have the greatest long-term impact on the state is 
casino gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has lost twice before in Florida. But in a year when the state's 
image has been tarnished by crime and tourism is down, casinos look like a good 
bet to many voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consensus in the business community is that casino gambling is not the 
solution to every problem, but it does give us an advantage in attracting 
visitors," says Nicki Grossman, executive director of the Hollywood (Fla.) 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 8 is a "limited casinos" measure, since approval would mean that 
only 47 gaming houses would be licensed, most at established dog and horse 
racing tracks, and at bingo halls run by the Seminole Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Other casino licenses would be granted to large hotels, most in South Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich developers and companies with ties to Las Vegas gambling interests have 
poured up to $10 million into a "vote yes" ad campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers say casinos would create 67,000 jobs in Florida by 1997, lure 1.5 
million more tourists here and raise $832 million a year in new tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Those opposed say the numbers offered by the pro-casino forces are a sham. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are pirates coming to plunder," said Seymour Gelber, mayor of Miami 
Beach, which is considered a prime location for a mega-casino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Las Vegas is a city with one of the highest dropout rates in the country. . . 
. How about Atlantic City? Here's a city that had hit rock bottom before 
casinos, and it's still as bad as ever. Those are our two models. Take your 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
 In South Florida, the casino issue may pass, recent polls show, but the 
measure is likely to be defeated statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 A Voices of Florida poll last month showed voters against casinos by a margin 
of 59% to 36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Anna M. Virtue in Miami contributed to this story. Facing Off 
in Florida 
</P>
<P>
 Florida voters will decide two key races Nov. 8: governor and U.S. senator.

 YOU OK, SADDAM? In a Time magazine interview this week, President Clinton 
recalled a day in the eighth grade when he decked a bully after warning him to 
stop pushing him around. Clinton drew a parallel between that incident and his 
decision to deploy U.S. military forces against Iraqi and Haitian military 
strongmen who didn't heed his warnings. But according to Clinton friends, there 
is a bit more to the story of that old schoolboy punch. After Clinton got home 
that day, they say, he felt so bad that he had his mother call the other kid's 
mother to make sure the boy was OK. Maybe Saddam Hussein should expect a call?

 NAME DROPPER: Despite fighting for his political life in a 
tougher-than-expected reelection bid, Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.) still aspires 
to succeed retiring Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) as the Democratic leader 
next year. Sasser has nearly enough votes to put him over the top, say Senate 
insiders close to his campaign. Among his strongest backers is Sen. Barbara 
Boxer (D-Calif.). But Sasser is not counting on the vote of California's other 
first-term Democratic senator, Dianne Feinstein -- if she, in turn, survives a 
bitter reelection battle. "She's gone" as a supporter, Sasser has explained to 
associates. "I keep calling her Barbara."

 IMMIGRATION LAWS: Regardless of the outcome of the November elections, 
Administration officials see immigration as perhaps the hottest issue for the 
next Congress and want to get a jump on Republicans with a bill of their own. 
Voter passion in California for restraining illegal immigration and curtailing 
benefits has convinced the Administration that the topic will be "the crime 
bill of '95," a reference to the sweeping public demand for tougher laws that 
drove the crime legislation debate in Congress this year. Administration 
officials also now believe immigration will be a leading issue in the 1996 
presidential election, and not just in border states. Pushing for greater 
controls in the heartland is a "no-lose" issue because there's no one there to 
alienate, one official says, noting that clusters of new arrivals can be found 
throughout the country.

 LURCHING RIGHT: If the voters are out of sorts this year, maybe it is partly 
because they are confused about who stands where on the political spectrum. A 
prime example is the Connecticut gubernatorial race, where a Democrat, a 
Republican and an independent are in a furious fight to occupy the political 
center. Democrat Bill Curry, who entered politics as an anti-nuclear activist 
and derives most of his support from the left wing of his party, has made the 
most remarkable conversion. He says that three critical items are on his 
agenda: a 25% reduction in property taxes, increased crime-fighting and 
streamlining government. Maybe not surprisingly, he deplores any description of 
himself as a "liberal."

NEWS ANALYSIS; BRIDGING THE RIVER JORDAN; TREATY PLACES ANOTHER PIECE IN THE 
MIDEAST PUZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shortly after the shooting stopped in the 1973 Middle East War, Israelis told 
each other that they could not know which Arab state would first make peace 
with Israel but they were certain which would be second -- Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than 15 years after the 1979 signing of the Egypt-Israel pact, 
but the prophecy was fulfilled Wednesday in an emotional ceremony along the 
sunbaked border as Israel and Jordan signed the region's second formal peace 
treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostility between Israel and Jordan has never been quite as hard-edged as 
the animosity between Israel and its other neighbors. Moreover, Jordan and 
Israel are joined by geography in a way that seems to demand cooperation if 
either nation is to reach its full economic potential. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, King Hussein, Jordan's cautious monarch, was reluctant to 
get too far ahead of the Arab consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed no inclination to be a precedent-setter, and he never even came 
close to copying Anwar Sadat, the Egyptian president who was shunned and 
isolated by the Arab world after he made peace with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 That Hussein is willing to move now dramatizes a shifting post-Cold War 
reality: Syria no longer has a superpower patron to support its former policy 
of bullying Jordan and other Arab states into refusing to make a separate peace 
with Israel until all Arab countries were ready for a comprehensive settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also a victory for Israel's generation-old policy of dealing with 
the Arab countries one at a time, even when that approach seemed to be leading 
nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the Israeli government sees it, it is easier to negotiate a treaty 
bridging the differences between Israel and a single Arab state than it is to 
draft language that all Arab countries will accept. And, at least as important, 
if one Arab government makes peace with Israel, it increases the pressure on 
all the others to come around eventually or be left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The different Israeli and Arab approaches to peacemaking produced years of 
stalemate after the signing of the Israel-Egypt pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious negotiations did not really get started until October, 1991, when all 
of the parties to the conflict met at a U.S.-brokered peace conference in 
Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
 That gathering was carefully balanced to permit the Israelis to claim that it 
was a series of bilateral negotiations and the Arabs to say it was a 
comprehensive conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, the scale was tilted toward the Arab approach. 
</P>
<P>
 When Yitzhak Rabin was elected Israeli prime minister -- succeeding Yitzhak 
Shamir, who led the delegation to Madrid -- he announced that he would continue 
with the Madrid process, although he opposed its emphasis on dealing with all 
the Arab states at once. 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, Rabin simply ignored the Madrid focus and sought to take on the 
Arabs one at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 His first priority was Syria, but when that approach seemed to lead to a dead 
end, he reached toward an agreement with the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israel-PLO agreement has not met the expectations of either side, but it 
helped clear the way for Israel and Jordan to reach the full-scale peace treaty 
signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact with Jordan is an achievement for Israel on its face. 
</P>
<P>
 But it also upsets Syria and the PLO, a situation that the Israelis consider 
an added benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Syrian President Hafez Assad and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat objected to 
the Israel-Jordan deal, but in a much more restrained fashion than might have 
been the case a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Katyusha rockets, believed to have been fired by the Syrian-backed Hezbollah 
militia from southern Lebanon, struck northern Israel just before the 
Israel-Jordan ceremony began, but they caused little damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials concede privately that the rockets were probably intended to 
miss, delivering a message without risking a major conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Assad may be in a petulant mood when he meets President Clinton today 
in Damascus. U.S. officials hope that the Clinton-Assad talks will help to 
advance the peace process, but they admit that they do not know what Assad will 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials believe that Assad is more concerned about building a 
relationship with Washington than making peace with Israel. So Clinton is 
expected to emphasize that, unless Assad climbs aboard the peace bandwagon, he 
risks alienating Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO objects to a provision of the Israel-Jordan treaty recognizing 
Jordan's role as "custodian" of the Islamic holy places in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO, which covets the predominantly Arab sector of Jerusalem as the 
capital of a future Palestinian state, objected emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel agreed to the provision because it was an easy way to give Hussein a 
new benefit of peace and, perhaps more important, because it sent a clear 
message to the PLO that Israel was determined to maintain its hold on all of 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the signing of the Israel-PLO agreement at the White House more than a 
year ago, the Israeli authorities have been ambivalent in their relationship 
with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, the Israeli government wants the peace agreement to work. But on 
the other, the Israelis want to keep the PLO off balance, at least for the 
foreseeable future. Redrawing Borders in War and Peace 
</P>
<P>
 The borders that Israel shares with its neighbors have been redrawn several 
times. Here is a look at some of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Armistice borders 1949: The borders of Israel after it declared independence 
and fought first war with Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli occupation 1967: The territories Israel captured from Syria, Jordan 
and Egypt after the Six-Day War. 
</P>
<P>
 Current borders 1994: Israel began returning captured territory after signing 
its peace treaty with Egypt in 1979. The treaty Israel signed with Jordan on 
Wednesday provides for border adjustments. Here are the steps in the Jewish 
state's relinquishment of territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinai Peninsula: Ceded back to Egypt in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaza Strip, Jericho: Under Palestinian self-rule since May, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan: Israel will lease back farmland returned to Jordan. The two states 
will also make land exchanges.

BRIDGING THE RIVER JORDAN; THIS YEAR IN JERUSALEM FOR JORDANIANS; PACT: THE 
HOLY CITY HAS BEEN BUT A GLOW ON THE HORIZON FOR MANY WHO WISHED TO VISIT. NOW 
THEY CAN REALIZE A DREAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 All his life, when clear nights have made it possible to see for hundreds of 
miles, Abdul Salam Samarneh Ajarmeh has gazed with longing at the lights of 
Jerusalem twinkling on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, as he watched the leaders of Jordan and Israel sign a peace 
treaty and embrace, Ajarmeh started planning his first visit to the Holy City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I am going to go," Ajarmeh said, smiling broadly at the image of senior 
Jordanian and Israeli military officers shaking hands and exchanging gifts near 
the close of the desert ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajarmeh had gathered with his brothers and some friends in the tiny bookstore 
he owns to watch the signing on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look how happy, how relaxed, King Hussein looks," Ajarmeh said. "He is at 
peace with himself because he knows that he is doing the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 King Hussein is counting on villages such as Naur to form the bedrock of 
support for his bold conclusion of a formal peace treaty with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying 20 miles south of Amman, Naur is home to a mix of settled Bedouins, 
Circassians and Christians. Several thousand Palestinians who fled east across 
the Jordan River in 1948, when Israel was born, or in 1967, when Jordan lost 
the West Bank to Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, also call Naur home. 
</P>
<P>
 The village is organized along tribal lines, and tribes -- generally fiercely 
loyal to King Hussein -- are the basis of social stability in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajarmeh counts 20,000 members of his tribe -- nearly half the population of 
Naur. Four of his immediate relatives, he said, are army officers. One of his 
11 brothers is in the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, there are some saying they do not recognize the state and our 
leadership," Hussein told a group of army officers in a speech Monday night 
about opposition to the peace treaty with Israel. "We told them if we assume 
that there is no state and we were back to our tribes, my tribe is the biggest, 
and that is the overwhelming majority of the people, and my organization is the 
largest in the country, and if you want to push things to the limit, we will 
deal with this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The sons of Naur have for decades flocked to jobs in the army, police and 
muhkhabarat , or secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajarmeh estimates that about 40% of the men in this village of 45,000 are 
employed in one branch of the security forces or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, they have seen the government establish new, modern schools in 
Naur, build factories and provide subsidies to those in the security forces to 
build homes and put their children through university. 
</P>
<P>
 Nauris, Ajarmeh said, are loyal people who trust King Hussein to make the 
right choices for Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "All his life, the king has worried about leaving something for the 
generations to come," Ajarmeh said. "This peace will be a good thing, I think. 
During all these years, we were in a state of no war, no peace. Now, we finally 
have a solution that might improve the economy and create more jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ajarmeh and his friends expressed the general feeling that perhaps the signing 
was a bit sudden, but they had little patience with the strident opposition to 
the peace treaty being expressed by Islamic fundamentalists in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentalists staged a rally in downtown Amman on Tuesday -- defying a 
government ban -- and fundamentalist parliamentarians boycotted President 
Clinton's speech to the Parliament on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the powerful Muslim 
Brotherhood, has repeatedly pledged publicly that it will do all that it can, 
within democratic limits, to torpedo the implementation of Jordan's treaty with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajarmeh said he has little sympathy for the Palestinians who say that the king 
concluded a formal peace with Israel too quickly and who charge him with 
improperly maintaining Jordan's religious claims to the Muslim holy sites in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinians signed an agreement with Israel before us," Ajarmeh 
protested, referring to the September, 1993, framework accord that Israel and 
the Palestine Liberation Organization signed in Washington. That accord granted 
limited self-rule to the Palestinians in the West Bank town of Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But he shakes his head in vigorous dissent when a reporter suggests that 
opposition to the peace treaty from Palestinians -- who many believe form a 
majority of the population in Jordan -- could lead to civil war here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impossible," Ajarmeh said. "There will never be problems again in Jordan 
between Jordanians and Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, the king unleashed his army on the PLO-controlled refugee camps after 
the PLO challenged the regime's hold on power. In what Palestinians term Black 
September, the PLO was crushed and driven out of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since, control of the camps has been in the hands of the Jordanian 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Such days are behind Jordanians now, Ajarmeh insisted. The signing of a peace 
treaty with Israel offers hope, he said, of a better life for everyone, if 
peace brings the economic benefits many Jordanians expect it to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more jobs, business will be better. The government will not 
have to spend so much on the military and will give more money to local 
projects," Ajarmeh predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crow flies, Jerusalem is only a two-hour drive from Naur. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the state of Israel was born, Nauris and other villagers in what was 
then Transjordan made the trip regularly. Villagers would sell vegetables and 
livestock in Jerusalem, and bring back cloth and other dry goods to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1948, Israel accepted the United Nations' partition of Palestine into 
Jewish and Palestinian states, declared its independence and successfully 
defended itself against the combined Arab armies. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fighting stopped, Jordan held East Jerusalem, including the walled 
Old City that houses sites holy to Islam, Judaism and Christianity. It also 
held what became known as the West Bank (of the Jordan River) and the East Bank 
-- now the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The first wave of Palestinian refugees 
flooded into Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ajarmeh, a Bedouin whose mother was Palestinian, was born the year that Jordan 
lost the West Bank and East Jerusalem to Israel. That defeat led to another, 
even more destabilizing flood of refugees into Jordan and ended any contact 
between East Bank Jordanians and Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ajarmeh, Jerusalem has always been a tantalizing dream -- until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he feels about the prospect of hosting Israelis in Jordan or 
traveling to the Jewish state, Ajarmeh shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not?" he asked. "We already see many foreigners in Jordan."

'NEW' HAITI HAS MANY OF ITS OLD PROBLEMS; CARIBBEAN: THE HATED MILITARY IS 
GONE. DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN RESTORED. BUT HUNGER AND JOBLESSNESS ENDURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was perfectly normal, a little boy eating peanut butter. Except this was 
Haitian normality, and the boy was standing on a dune of filth and sucking the 
gooey food from a torn package of American garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, perhaps 10 or 12, is one of several dozen Haitians who go every 
morning to a field of despair called "the big garbage dump near the port" to 
find the day's sustenance in what the American troops here have thrown away. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day about noon, the people gather in the mounds of refuse to wait for 
the U.S. Army truck to arrive and unload the discards of the 16,000 American 
troops who remain from the force that arrived here more than five weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are barefooted children only two feet tall. There are women carrying 
babies and one-legged old men struggling on crutches made of splintered 
broomsticks, trying to survive by scraping up the leftovers and left-behinds. 
</P>
<P>
 It is neither a benign nor patient group. The people push and shove and battle 
pigs and dogs grazing among the bulldozers. When the American truck and its 
accompanying guard show up, the scrabbling becomes a grim war. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day this week when the humidity made for a particularly choking stench, 
the mob attacked the American truck with such energy that the four soldiers had 
to fire tear gas to keep them from destroying the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear this goes on every time we show up," said Spec. Frank Leinberger, a 
10th Mountain Division soldier from Las Vegas. "I guess this is normal." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, and reflects both a new and an old normality. The mass of American 
troops here, the destruction of the murderous and corrupt military regime and 
the prospect of a democratic political system and more efficient economic 
program have changed Haiti seriously and make it unlikely there can be a return 
to the old ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the troops, people who cowered in their homes at night in fear of 
the Haitian army and its death squads now crowd the sidewalks and streets after 
dark. A new government is forming, and massive foreign aid is promised. For the 
wealthy, the amenities of good restaurants and newly imported luxury cars are 
making life more pleasant than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of people, there is a tangible sense of hope. They are out every 
day, waiting at potential construction sites for jobs or in front of shuttered 
assembly plants that are expected to open any day now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is going to be work. I know it," said Pinchot Pierre, who was standing 
at the gate of an industrial park where plants produced baby clothes before an 
international embargo closed the businesses. "The Americans are here, and they 
will give us the money to start working again. It's going to be different." 
</P>
<P>
 One crucial difference is that fuel is cheaper, but only compared to the 
extraordinary cost that resulted from the international sanctions that cut off 
most petroleum. Gasoline that was selling for $17 a gallon is now about $2 -- 
but this is double what people paid until the embargo went into effect a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There are traffic jams as of old, but of such intensity that longtime 
residents say they've never seen anything like them. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of the old normality made new -- and in some cases worse -- by 
the Americans was the use of traffic police here Tuesday for the first time in 
more than a year. Driving patterns set by the free market -- big cars and 
trucks get the right of way -- were broken up by Haitian and American military 
police trying to set a new order. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers who for months had negotiated intersections and jammed streets without 
any help were now held by the police in lines that stretched for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as one U.S. diplomat put it: "This is better. I'll trade a traffic jam 
for an embargo any day. Traffic jams may be a return to what you call the old 
normality, but what is going to be normal here will be better, no doubt about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the old normality continues to intrude. There are promises of 75,000 
immediate new jobs, but that will not seriously change the old norms of 85% 
unemployment and a population that for the most part has never worked for 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 So while the country enjoys relative law and order under the American 
presence, and business people expect to prosper under a U.S.-approved economic 
system, Haitians still scavenge for survival among the oily, torn wrappers of 
U.S. Army ration packages. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who live a measure above the scavengers, daily life also remains the 
same. Prices for food and basic consumer goods haven't come down by any 
significant measure. As fruit seller Mannick Jean said: "I expect they will 
fall soon, now that President Aristide is back. Everything is going to get 
cheaper (now that) Aristide has come back." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is better," said an American who has directed humanitarian 
programs here for several years, "and I certainly don't want to return to the 
military days or even before the (anti-Aristide coup in 1991), but it scares me 
when you ask if we are creating a new normality. 
</P>
<P>
 "What scares me? That people will think the end of the military and even a new 
and better political and economic system will be enough. If that is true, then 
what was normal before -- the people you saw at the dump -- will be normal 
now."

U.N. VOTE CONDEMNS EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA; TRADE: ONLY ISRAEL BACKS UNITED

 Abandoned by close allies such as Canada and Denmark, the United States found 
itself more isolated than ever Wednesday as the U.N. General Assembly voted 
overwhelmingly to condemn the continuing American trade embargo against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 101 to 2 with 48 abstentions, the most lopsided vote against the 
United States since the General Assembly began voting on the issue two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Israel voted with the United States this time. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the vote against the embargo was 88 to 4 with 57 abstentions; in 
1992, it was 59 to 3 with 71 abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the resolution calls for an end to the embargo "as soon as possible," 
General Assembly resolutions are not binding on U.N. members, and no one 
expects the Clinton Administration to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Marrero, one of the deputy American ambassadors to the U.N., insisted 
that the embargo is a bilateral matter between the United States and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made it clear, on many occasions, that reviewing our embargo depends 
upon whether the Cuban regime moves toward democracy and observes international 
norms regarding human rights," he said. "The human rights situation in Cuba 
remains grim. It has not improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Marrero cited the recent exodus of "boat people" as evidence of the lack of 
hope in Cuba, and he denied that the embargo is the cause of Cuba's economic 
troubles. He said the real economic problem of Cuba "lies with the failed 
economic policies of the regime." 
</P>
<P>
 The American diplomat contended that a vote in favor of the resolution was an 
endorsement of Cuban repression. But this argument was clearly rejected by the 
vast majority of members. 
</P>
<P>
 The most astounding shift in voting came from American allies who abstained 
under American pressure last year but decided to vote for the Cuban resolution 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 These included Canada, Denmark, Panama, Luxembourg and Thailand. Russia, which 
had abstained last year, changed its vote to "yes" this time, accompanied by 
Ukraine and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 Other countries that shifted from an abstention to a vote in favor of the 
resolution included Antigua, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Finland, Malawi, Niger, 
Rwanda, Samoa and Sri Lanka. Despite the Clinton Administration's operation 
returning President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power, Haiti also voted against 
the United States, as it did last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the United States' closest allies, France and Britain, did not change 
their votes, with France voting "yes" again, and Britain abstaining as it had 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the international impatience with the boycott was generated by the 
Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 that prohibits foreign subsidiaries from trading 
with Cuba and prohibits foreign ships from calling at U.S. ports if they have 
called at a Cuban port within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian diplomat David Karsgaard told the General Assembly that Canada has 
refused to comply with the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Ambassador Fernando Remirez de Estenoz, who introduced the resolution, 
said the Cuban economy suffered more than $970 million in damages as a direct 
result of the embargo in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the daily suffering of the Cuban people, their difficulty in buying 
the most basic staple foods and the deterioration of health and education 
standards in Cuba "are inevitable consequences of the cruel blockade imposed 
against Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking on behalf of the European Union, which was split almost in half 
between those who supported the resolution and those who abstained, German 
Ambassador Gerhard Henze told the General Assembly: "The European Union cannot 
accept that the United States unilaterally determines and restricts European 
Union economic and commercial relations with any foreign nation."

NEWS ANALYSIS; IS U.N. PEACEMAKER AN APPEASER?; BALKANS: LT. GEN. MICHAEL ROSE 
IS ACCUSED OF TRUCKLING TO REBEL SERBS TO PRESERVE HIS REPUTATION. THE BOSNIAN 
GOVERNMENT WANTS HIM TO RESIGN. 
</P>

<P>
 With aid flights grounded, fuel convoys blocked and weapons exclusion zones 
crawling with artillery, Lt. Gen. Michael Rose was watching his peace 
initiatives unravel when Bosnian Serbs launched another provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-minute rebel fusillade against a packed Sarajevo tram killed one 
passenger and wounded 11, shattering an anti-sniping accord Rose had tried to 
broker in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than condemn the Oct. 8 assault that culminated two weeks of rebel 
harassment, Rose's office ordered U.N. public affairs workers to doctor the 
next day's "situation report" to suggest Bosnian government forces were 
behaving just as badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to the daily "sitrep," according to U.N. sources who help compile the 
unclassified cables, was an alleged eyewitness account by U.N. forces of 
Muslim-led government troops shooting at two Serbian civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say when the guy in charge is deliberately falsifying 
(reports)?" one of the officials asked incredulously. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly fearful that his image as a forceful peacemaker will collapse with 
any dramatic outbreak of fighting, Rose -- commander of the U.N. peacekeeping 
force in Bosnia -- has embarked on what U.N. colleagues describe as a campaign 
of damage control by trying to appease the rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
 They base their conclusions on his refusal to call in NATO air strikes to 
enforce the weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Gorazde, or to punish 
Serbian gunmen for hijacking aid cargoes, holding U.N. fuel deliveries for 
ransom or even launching fatal attacks on U.N. convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials with the U.N. Protection Force; the U.N. administrative team 
for Sarajevo, and the aid-supplying agency, the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, complain that Rose and his senior officers are 
creating a potential explosion as they affix a veneer of containment on this 
roiling country ahead of their planned departure on Jan. 24. The Bosnian 
government on Tuesday demanded that the general resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are under a lot of pressure from (the U.N. Protection Force) to accept the 
Serbs' demands for more fuel," said an aid official whose humanitarian convoys 
were being held up by the rebels. He added that the push for payoffs to appease 
the rebels was coming from Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian gunmen have halted most deliveries of gasoline and winter supplies for 
U.N. forces and for displaced Bosnian citizens who rely on outside aid for 
their food and shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces loyal to Bosnian Serb warlord Radovan Karadzic are demanding one-third 
of all fuel trucked across their siege lines and half of the stoves, wood, 
boots, plastic sheeting and other supplies intended to make the impending third 
winter at war bearable for homeless civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid agencies already supply some fuel to the Serbs, as they do to the Bosnian 
government; the fuel powers bakeries, water-pumping facilities and generators 
at schools and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbs have seen their military supplies reduced since Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic cut off the rebels in August in an apparent effort 
to force them to accept a negotiated peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid agency officials and diplomats say Bosnian Serb civilian services are 
suffering as a consequence, because the fuel the aid workers supply is being 
diverted to keep the rebel army rolling. But they balk at any gunpoint 
renegotiations and fear that Rose's eagerness to calm the rebels is 
shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are squeezing the Bosnian Serbs with one hand and alleviating that squeeze 
with the other. It's perfectly schizophrenic," the aid official said. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-nation Contact Group mediating a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
is trying to force Karadzic to accept a plan under which the elected government 
would be granted authority over 51% of the country while the rest would be 
ceded to the nationalist Serbs. Because Karadzic's forces already have 
conquered 72% and peace might lead to his indictment before a war crimes 
tribunal, the self-styled president of the rogue Bosnian Serb republic has 
refused to compromise and end the 30-month-old war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Contact Group's objective of pressuring the rebels to make peace has 
crashed head-on with Rose's strategy of face-saving containment. "The position 
of Gen. Rose doesn't allow for much pressure on the Serbs," complained a senior 
Western diplomat here. 
</P>
<P>
 Even officers at Rose's command center describe him as "agitated" and 
"depressed" by the steady unraveling of the accords that highlighted the early 
weeks of his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to get out in an atmosphere of success instead of failure, and in 
reality things are falling apart," the aid official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In attempts to be fair to the highly decorated general, the sources lauded his 
initial aggressiveness, which contributed to the rapid-fire succession of peace 
accords that marked the first two months of his one-year tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarcely a week after his arrival, a Feb. 5 bomb attack on a crowded Sarajevo 
market killed 68 people and spurred North Atlantic Treaty Organization threats 
of air strikes unless the Serbs' heavy artillery was withdrawn from around the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat halted rebel shelling, ushering in dramatic improvements in the 
security and atmosphere in Sarajevo. But some heavy artillery pieces stayed in 
the exclusion zone, and dozens more later found their way back into Serbian 
hands. Those weapons that had been removed from around the capital were 
redeployed elsewhere, most notably around the U.N. "safe area" of Gorazde. And 
when NATO launched air strikes April 11 and 12 to stop a Serbian attack on 
Gorazde, the rebels took hundreds of Rose's troops hostage in retaliation, 
chilling future moves to call in air power. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that volatile showdown, in which one of Rose's elite British commandos 
was killed, he has scaled down his objectives simply to preventing a recurrence 
of all-out war, his colleagues in the U.N. mission say. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose would hardly be the first U.N. force commander for Bosnia to leave under 
a cloud. Each of his three predecessors departed with harsh words for the 
misguided mission. Rose himself has lately taken to blaming the international 
community for misunderstanding his mandate, pointing out that U.N. forces in 
Bosnia have neither the equipment nor the authority to act as enforcers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've succeeded beyond our wildest expectations, but people want (the U.N. 
force) to fulfill a mandate it doesn't have," he complained. 
</P>
<P>
 While his diplomatic critics acknowledge merit in his pronouncement that "we 
don't go to war in white-painted vehicles," they claim Rose's determination to 
prevent a worsening of the conflict during his watch has taken on the quality 
of an obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than standing up to increasing instances of Serbian harassment and 
provocation, Rose and his staff have sought to cast Bosnian government forces 
as being equally amoral and have papered over destabilizing events like the 
Serbian attack on the tram riders. 
</P>
<P>
 This has alienated the Bosnian government, encouraging the Muslim-led army to 
believe its only chance to recover lost territory is by means of counterattack. 
That defiance fuels confrontation with Serbian rebels and endangers U.N. troops 
-- peacekeepers in the middle of a war. 
</P>
<P>
 The precarious position in which French forces find themselves on Mt. Igman 
serves as an example of the hazards. The U.N. Security Council proclaimed a 
demilitarized zone in the area southwest of Sarajevo in August, 1993, and 
deployed peacekeepers to prevent Bosnian Serb forces from capturing the last 
stretch of high ground around the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb-held area to the east of the zone was supposedly cleared of 
artillery in February after NATO threatened to bomb any tanks or heavy guns 
left within 12 miles of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Bosnian Serb forces gradually redeployed tanks and artillery pieces in 
the exclusion zone with impunity, the Bosnian government began using the 
adjacent Mt. Igman DMZ to move troops and equipment through to battlefronts 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb army chieftain Gen. Ratko Mladic earlier this month told Rose 
that the Serbs would attack the U.N.-patrolled area unless peacekeepers routed 
government forces from the area. Rose's troops cleared out more than half of 
the estimated 1,100 troops who had infiltrated the DMZ, then blew up their 
trenches and bunkers to deter any redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the remaining government soldiers refused to leave unless Bosnian 
Serb attacks on civilian traffic through the zone were prevented by the U.N. 
force, Rose threatened to withdraw 500 U.N. troops who patrol the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats here, in the Croatian capital of Zagreb and at Balkan-watching posts 
in Vienna complain that Rose's determination to clean out the DMZ illustrates a 
bias toward enforcing agreements that hamper Bosnian government forces while 
tolerating repeated violations of the larger and more strategic weapons 
exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows quite what to do about it except try to ride out his term," said 
one senior official at the U.N. force headquarters in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian government leaders are less patient as they find themselves on the 
receiving end of Rose's selective efforts at enforcement. When the British 
general declined to summon NATO air power after a Bosnian Serb assault on a 
U.N. convoy in Gorazde -- an attack that killed a Bosnian driver employed by 
the U.N. refugee agency -- the U.N. ambassador for Bosnia, Muhamed Sacirbey, 
accused Rose of having little regard for the lives of Bosnians and suggested he 
face court-martial.

GOVERNMENT TROOPS CAPTURE PLATEAU FROM BOSNIAN SERBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government troops, in one of their most stunning triumphs of the war, captured 
a strategic plateau Wednesday as their Bosnian Serb foes fled, abandoning 
weapons and equipment, United Nations peacekeepers reported. 
</P>
<P>
 But any government cheer at the news was tempered by injuries to seven people, 
five of them children, when a shell exploded in Sarajevo -- the worst such 
incident in months in the besieged capital. Government television said it was a 
mortar shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials said the wounded children had been sitting outside a 
high-rise apartment building. A 14-year-old girl hurt in the attack was 
undergoing emergency surgery for serious head and stomach injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina, Muslim-led government forces followed up 
the capture of a Serbian barracks late Tuesday by sweeping through as much as 
40 square miles of Serbian-held territory on the plateau east of the 
government-held town of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bosnian Serb army crumbled," said a U.N. spokesman, Lt. Col. Tim Spicer, 
citing reports from U.N. observers. "Their command and control system is gone. 
They're abandoning a lot of equipment -- which is very unusual for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He described the offensive as one of the most decisive government victories of 
the war, which until recent months was dominated by the better-armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia has been at war since April, 1992, when the heavily armed Serbian 
minority rebelled at a vote by the republic's Muslims and Croats to secede from 
the former Yugoslav federation. An estimated 200,000 people have been killed or 
reported missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted 
earlier that setbacks in the area had prompted about 5,000 Serbian civilians to 
flee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgrade-based Yugoslav news agency Tanjug also cited Bosnian Serb 
military sources in a report that Bosnian government troops had "succeeded in 
suppressing Serbian forces" on the plateau east of Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Though government troops have scored some successes in a dozen recent 
offensives across Bosnia, their territorial gains had been relatively modest 
against the better-armed Serbs, who control about 70% of the country.

FOR STYMIED FIRE INVESTIGATORS, AN UNHAPPY ANNIVERSARY; ARSON: THEIR ELATION 
FROM A SUSPECT'S RECENT CONFESSION IN LONG-STALLED LAGUNA CASE TURNED BACK INTO 
DEPRESSION WHEN IT WAS PROVEN FALSE. NOW THEY'RE BACK TO 'SQUARE ONE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When arson investigators talk about "the great fire," the one that damaged or 
destroyed 441 structures and caused $528 million in damage, they use words like 
frustrated, bewildered, depressed. For the case is back where it started: 
</P>
<P>
 "Square one," said Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The last month has given investigators their highest highs and lowest lows 
since the fire broke out last Oct. 27, scorching a four-mile area in little 
over an hour, its 200-foot flames consuming four homes and 45 acres a minute, 
jamming Coast Highway with five lanes of evacuees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five law-enforcement agencies moved out 27,000 people -- the entire 
population of Laguna Beach and 2,500 people from surrounding areas," Young 
said. "They created those five lanes of traffic. We look back and say: It could 
have been so much worse than it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the horror of watching it burn, and anger at not knowing who caused 
it, investigators remember the fire with a strange sense of relief. Never in 
their experience have they seen a fire so devastating that traveled at such a 
frightening pace -- and still failed to claim a single fatality. Even its few 
injuries were limited to firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of lingering futility comes, Young said, in not knowing who caused 
the fire -- of having little to go on a whole year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month saw the arrest of Jose Soto Martinez, a 26-year-old transient who 
led investigators to the fire's point of origin and appeared to tell them 
exactly how it started. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was later furnished a solid alibi when his mother, who lives in 
Fullerton, presented tangible proof that he was in a Mexican prison on the day 
the fire started and had no possible way of playing a part in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're rapidly getting back to where we were before (Martinez) confessed to 
the fire," Chief Dan Runnestrand of the Orange County Fire Department said with 
a sigh. "We've exhausted all the leads that we've had, more than 1,000, and 
know no more than we did to begin with: It was an incendiary fire, caused by 
somebody, who used an open-flame device such as a lighter or a match." 
</P>
<P>
 Runnestrand said Martinez has since told investigators that he merely 
"guessed" about the fire's location and how it started. Runnestrand called 
Martinez's knowledge of the fire "uncanny" but said, "At this point, we don't 
really know what he knows -- whether he knew someone who caused it, or was, as 
he said, just guessing." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began at 11:50 a.m., just west of Laguna Canyon Road. It started 
northwest of the thoroughfare, a mile and a half south of the San Diego 
Freeway. Traveling four miles in one hour, 23 minutes, it first claimed homes 
in elite Emerald Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:55 p.m., the skyscraper-like flames jumped Laguna Canyon Road and crested 
at the far north end of Park Road, invading the pristine Laguna Beach 
communities of Canyon Acres, Mystic Hills and Tahiti Skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 It was between 3:55 p.m. and 4:45 p.m. that the fire reached its astonishing 
pace of consuming four homes and 45 acres a minute, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware that that kind of pace or drive has ever been recorded in fire 
behavior anywhere," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst possible conditions conspired to create an almost inevitable 
scenario for such a tragedy: 80-m.p.h. Santa Ana winds, which occur no more 
than once a decade, Young said; 7% humidity; and 4% fuel moisture in the vast 
acreage of parched brush surrounding Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Young called the brittle dryness of the brush the most "critical, explosive" 
factor in fueling the firestorm's spread. He blamed the "tinderbox" condition 
of the landscape for much of the destruction and faulted residents and local 
governments for failing to manage the growth more responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same things that made those communities quaint and charming and 
wonderfully beautiful and wilderness-like also made them absolute fire hazards 
and disasters waiting to happen," Young said. "Today, there are still 50 
communities just like that in Orange County and 1,000 more throughout Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 But based on the experience of the Laguna Beach fire, Young said, communities 
are now more receptive to controlled burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days in Laguna Beach, we used to hear people tell us, 'We don't 
want your controlled burns, because we don't want ashes on our nice houses and 
cars.' Well, today, many of those same people no longer have those houses and 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, we're meeting with much less resistance. But had we had 
regular controlled burns in the past, we might have been able to prevent it. 
All we can do now is learn from it." Celebrating a Rebirth 
</P>

 In an attempt to thwart thieves who use computers to obtain fraudulent income 
tax refunds, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday that it will no longer 
provide immediate confirmation that a refund is on the way to taxpayers whose 
returns are filed electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that, by no longer confirming refunds 
within 48 hours of an electronic filing, the IRS will make it more difficult 
for scam artists to obtain cash advances known as "rapid refunds" from banks 
via tax preparers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crooks take the money and run, and the taxpayers and banks get burned," 
Bentsen said. "So we're no longer going to tell the electronic filing 
operations whether a refund is likely to be coming. The taxpayers will still 
get any refund they're due but we won't be sending out that notification." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks grant "rapid refunds" to taxpayers who show that they have a tax refund 
coming. The bank pays the amount of the refund, after taking a percentage for 
its trouble, then receives the full refund when the government pays. 
</P>
<P>
 When fraud occurs, if the bank has paid the person who filed the return but 
the government has not paid the bank, it is the bank that loses, said Frank 
Keith, chief of media relations at the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the government has paid the bank, Keith said, taxpayers lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials said that fraudulent tax filings cost the government as 
much as $5 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy change is aimed primarily at fraud involving the Earned Income Tax 
Credit, which provides payments or reduces tax liability for low-income working 
families with children. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen said that, during the last two weeks in January, 1.3 million 
electronic returns were filed claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit. IRS 
studies indicate that 29% of those filings probably claimed more than was due. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax preparation industry representatives are still studying the announcement 
and withheld comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also announced that he would develop proposals to deny the Earned 
Income Tax Credit to illegal immigrants. The IRS estimates that more than 
150,000 illegal immigrants claimed the credit this year on 1993 taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraud can easily occur with illegal immigrants, Bentsen said, because there 
are no records to verify the existence of children they might claim.

LIFE-SAVING FOOD TAKEN TO STRANDED DEER IN EVERGLADES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Game officers and volunteers headed into the Everglades on Wednesday to gather 
native plants to feed starving deer that are trapped by high water. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this month, more than 50 white-tailed deer have been found dead, some 
in water too deep for foraging, in an area west of Ft.Lauderdale and Miami. 
Game officials estimate that 1,500 deer are stranded in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Lawton Chiles, who joined the expedition run by the state Game and Fresh 
Water Fish Commission, said the problem was caused by recent heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The flooding also has been attributed to water being pumped south by Florida 
water managers to protect farmland in the northern Everglades. 
</P>
<P>
 The water trapped the deer on isolated hummocks that lack enough forage to 
support them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game Lt. Col. Dan Dunford, coordinator of the emergency feeding 
project, said the flooding was affecting other animals also, not just the deer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982 flooding, hundreds of deer starved to death, drowned or died from hoof 
rot.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Texas' top insurance official Wednesday put preliminary damages at $700 
million in last week's flood, which resulted in 19 deaths and drove 12,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Insurance Commissioner J. Robert Hunter estimated preliminary claims 
would amount to $400 million for private insurance companies and $300 million 
to the federal national insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, who formerly headed the federal flood insurance program, said his 
estimates were preliminary and did not include damage costs to pipelines, 
railroads and other infrastructure.

SCARS FROM LAGUNA FIRE STILL FRESH; THE HARDENS: COUPLE SAVED THEIR HOME BUT 
LOST THEIR WAY OF LIFE.

 The rooftop is a special retreat for Laurel and Michael Harden. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Hardens -- armed with garden hoses -- waged their last stand 
there against the wild blaze that showered their Emerald Bay home with burning 
embers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never occurred to us that we had any danger. We had three hoses, water 
pressure and a way out on the Pacific Coast Highway. And we had each other," 
recalled Laurel Harden, 43. "And we had that sureness that comes from 
adrenaline." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the entreaties of firefighters, the couple stayed on the roof and 
saved their home. But they couldn't save their way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old routine didn't come back," said Laurel Harden. "It came back as far 
as you go to work and the market. But you drive by homes that still are not 
completed and the people that live in the houses are friends. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "The odd part is that you never feel as confident about leaving home. Because 
there were people who couldn't get back to their houses. If I see smoke on a 
hillside, the first instinct is to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 The Harden family has debated how to mark the anniversary of the fire. Perhaps 
they will attend the Emerald Bay reunion of survivors. Or perhaps they'll 
simply retreat.

SCARS FROM LAGUNA FIRE STILL FRESH; THE RACHES: IN LOSING ALL, NEW FAMILY FOUND

 On Christmas Day, the tree in the Rach household will be decorated with shiny, 
new ornaments purchased at a post-holiday sale. A slightly scorched and 
blackened ceramic angel will also be part of the trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird having so many angels make it through the fire, but they did," 
said Laurie Cooper, 29, a law student who was the first to see the smoking 
ruins of her mother and stepfather's Emerald Bay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside were all her Christmas ornaments and childhood mementos. The house also 
held the collections and photos of two recently joined families -- Laurie's 
mother, real estate agent Micki Rach, and her stockbroker husband, George Rach. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, they have a family of seven grown children who came together 
after the fire as an instant volunteer force that shopped for clothes, sifted 
through the rubble, offered cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all knew each other," said Cooper. "But I think this tragedy brought us 
closer together. Going through the rubble, (my stepsisters) found their 
mother's wedding rings. She had died of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you find things like that and share that kind of joy, you really grow 
close," said Cooper.

NEW STUDY QUESTIONS VALUE OF GIVING IVS TO TRAUMA PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BROWN, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The universal and barely questioned practice of giving intravenous fluids to 
bleeding trauma patients in order to raise their blood pressure may be doing 
more harm than good, according to new research. 
</P>
<P>
 This treatment, considered so essential that it often is begun by paramedics 
on the street or in an ambulance, instead may increase a person's risk of death 
by throwing out of kilter the body's innate response to life-threatening 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, could affect 
virtually every hospital and emergency medical service in the country if 
confirmed by further research. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleeding from lacerated arteries or veins can rapidly deplete the volume of 
blood in the circulatory system. Blood pressure can then fall, threatening the 
delivery of oxygen and removal of waste products from vital organs. A sustained 
state of minimal blood flow is called shock, and can lead to irreversible organ 
damage and death. 
</P>
<P>
 In emergency medical care, the maintenance of blood pressure is considered 
third only to the initiation of breathing and the establishment of a heartbeat 
as essential treatment for a trauma patient. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians at Baylor University in Houston and at the University of Oklahoma 
looked at the effects of "fluid resuscitation" in people who had suffered gun 
or stab wounds requiring immediate surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians alternated fluid treatment every other day in 598 patients. On even 
numbered days, incoming patients would get fluids as soon as paramedics or a 
doctor could start an intravenous line. On odd days, they would have IV lines 
placed but no fluid started until they got to the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the patients who got "delayed" fluid resuscitation, 70% survived, 
compared with 62% of the group that got it immediately. The delayed group had a 
shorter hospital stay -- 11 days on average, compared to 14 days for the 
patients who received fluids before surgery. There was also a general trend 
toward fewer post-operative complications -- such as respiratory distress, 
kidney failure and severe infection -- in the delayed group. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found, as expected, that patients who got IV fluids during the 
ambulance ride got to the hospital with higher systolic blood pressures than 
those who got no fluids. The difference was not great, and in both groups was 
below 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, however, the groups had identical systolic blood pressures -- 
about 112 -- when they arrived in the operating room. This suggests that the 
members of the delayed group (if they survived that long) were able to 
re-establish a near-normal pressure through innate mechanisms and without the 
addition of "volume" in the form of IV fluids. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers hypothesized that IV fluids had a detrimental effect in 
several ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The main one is that higher blood pressures probably tend to dislodge the clot 
that forms naturally to close the hole in the vessel at the site of bleeding.

SUITS, CLOSURE THREATEN PET STORE AS RABIES KILLS KITTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A death threat, the likelihood of being forced out of business and the 
possibility of lawsuits are the price pet store owner Tim Jandebeur is paying 
for selling a kitten that later died of rabies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people who played with kittens in his store may also pay a price 
-- rabies shots -- though no cases of the deadly disease in humans have been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 After one kitten sold by Jandebeur died of rabies and four others that 
probably had the disease also died, state health officials called on anyone who 
bought kittens at the store or played with them to get shots. They said as many 
as 37 kittens at the store could have been exposed to rabies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 people received shots Tuesday at Concord Hospital. On Wednesday, 
scores were waiting when a special rabies clinic opened at the hospital, and 
hundreds more were on waiting lists to begin rabies shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to see people all day and into the night until there are no 
more people to be seen," hospital spokeswoman Beth Fensterwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 People can get rabies if they are bitten by an infected animal or if an 
infected animal's saliva gets into broken skin, like a scratch, or into their 
mouth, nose or eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 By Wednesday, health officials had accounted for all of the store's kittens 
and expected to release test results by today. Five still at the store did not 
have rabies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know the truth, I think I'm out of business," said Jandebeur, 
owner of the Concord Aquarium & Pet Store for four years. "My wife and I are 
scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Several store owners said Jandebeur took a risk by letting kittens run around 
his shop. Other stores don't let animals run free, and some, unlike 
Jandebeur's, don't accept kittens from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In a talk show on WKXL radio, Jandebeur accused the news media of distorting 
the story and exaggerating the threat. He said his 5-year-old son is getting 
rabies shots, though he is not himself. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rabies report surfaced, he said, the store did only $3 in business 
Tuesday morning. And he said he had received one death threat: "Someone called 
and said that he would come down and kill me if his kid had rabies." 
</P>
<P>
 Jandebeur said he gets kittens from a few local families. Each is inspected by 
a veterinarian, but cats cannot be vaccinated against rabies until they are 
about 16 weeks old, he said. Kittens often are sold before then.

FBI JOINS INVESTIGATION IN POLICE KILLING OF BLACK KENTUCKY YOUTH

<TEXT>
<P>
 The FBI joined the investigation Wednesday into the police slaying of a black 
teen-ager that touched off a rampage by about 200 blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The white officer who shot Antonio Sullivan in the head said his gun went off 
accidentally after he and four other officers tried to arrest the 18-year-old 
as he emerged from a closet at his girlfriend's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the mostly black neighborhood near downtown said the shooting was 
inevitable and representative of routine racial abuse by police. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents will look into whether Sullivan was a victim of brutality, said V. 
David Kohl, agent in charge of the FBI in Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood was tense Wednesday afternoon. A TV news crew in an unmarked 
car was hit by gunfire but nobody was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 But wooden barricades came down, not many police were on the streets and 
people went about their business. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sullivan was shot, police were trying to arrest him on charges of assault 
and wanton endangerment in a Sept. 30 street shooting. Two of the officers who 
went to arrest Sullivan are black. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer who shot the teen-ager, Sgt. Phil Vogel, was suspended until the 
investigation is complete. Vogel has been on the force for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As word of Sullivan's shooting spread, about 200 blacks overturned cars, 
smashed windows and threw rocks and bottles.

SEISMOLOGISTS SET OFF BLASTS TO MAP FAULTS; QUAKES: AS PART OF A THREE-YEAR 
STUDY, SCIENTISTS WILL MEASURE SUBTERRANEAN EXPLOSIONS TO FIND OUT WHERE THE 
HEAVIEST SHAKING WILL OCCUR DURING TEMBLORS. 
</P>

 Earthquake scientists began three nights of small subterranean blasts along a 
line from the Mojave Desert to Seal Beach early Wednesday in a new phase of a 
three-year project to map potentially dangerous faults and other structures six 
to 10 miles below the surface, where big earthquakes are usually generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Fuis, the U.S. Geological Survey scientist in charge of the $600,000 
experiment, said there were no calls from the public about the first 20 blasts 
between 1:30 and 4:30 a.m. under the Mojave. The largest explosion, of about 
4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate at a depth of 60 feet, was measured as a 
magnitude 2.6 by Caltech, Fuis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuis said when smaller, 900-pound blasts are set off early today and Friday 
under populated areas, mainly in the San Gabriel Valley and parts of Orange 
County, some residents will feel them "as small bumps in the night." 
</P>
<P>
 An array of 630 seismographic instruments placed six inches below the surface 
-- 230 provided by the Geological Survey of Canada -- are recording waves from 
the blasts to develop subterranean images that may tell scientists where to 
expect the heaviest shaking during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is primarily funded by the National Science Foundation and the 
U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, and is being 
partially staffed by the Southern California Earthquake Center headquartered at 
USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuis said it will be a year before the first rough images are available. He 
said that at the end of the three years he expects the data to support his 
contentions that building codes are not stringent enough to cope with the 
strong shaking estimated to be possible from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier phase of the project this month, in the ocean off Long Beach, 
featured a research ship firing thousands of small bursts of compressed air to 
create sound waves detectable by the instruments as far inland as the Mojave. 
Fuis said critics' concerns of injury to sea life proved unfounded.

4 SMALL, CRUDE BOMBS FLOATED OVER RIVERSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least four small, crude bombs have floated over the city in recent days, 
dangling from helium-filled trash bags and unnerving police who have yet to 
find a suspect or a motive behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the four devices exploded, but they could easily have detonated -- in 
the air or on a housetop, said Sgt. Robert Hanson of the Riverside Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are probably designed for aerial burst, but who knows where the 
fragments will come down, or whether the balloons will come down prematurely 
and start a fire or cause serious injury to someone," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeshift bombs are three-inch-long metal cylinders filled with a small 
amount of explosives. A crude detonation device is attached to the cylinder, 
which is hung from the helium-filled plastic bag by a wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said it was unclear why the bombs did not explode -- or whether other 
small bombs had detonated in the air but had not been reported to police. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recently discovered bomb was found in a bush in a residential 
neighborhood Wednesday afternoon. Another was found on a residential street 
before dawn last Friday by a passerby who alerted police. A third was recovered 
on the ground about two weeks ago by a resident who called police. That person 
reported to police on Tuesday that she saw a similar balloon get momentarily 
snagged in a tree before it blew away, Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the devices work properly, Hanson said, "there probably would not be a lot 
of physical evidence. We assume this guy wants them to go off in the air, but 
the potential to harm people is great because of possible miscalculations on 
his part."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: FINDING SOME ANSWERS AMONG ALL THE QUESTIONS FOR 
PROSPECTIVE JURORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't see the faces of the prospective O.J. Simpson jurors. Rather, I'm with 
most of the press in a small room listening to their voices piped in from the 
courtroom three floors below. 
</P>
<P>
 Analyzing by voice only is much different -- and probably often less accurate 
-- than seeing the panelists' expression and body language and watching how 
they interact with Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito and the lawyers. Bad 
working conditions add to the difficulties. The room is so crowded that some of 
us sit on the floor or stand while taking notes of the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, I thought a candidate was certain to make it to the jury. So did some 
others in the press room. The prospective juror seemed calm, mature and 
balanced. But one of the pool reporters allowed inside the courtroom saw it 
much differently. 
</P>
<P>
 No chance, the reporter said. The woman's words may have sounded strong to us 
upstairs, but when they were combined with body language and expression, they 
told another story to the reporter in the courtroom. The woman seemed 
susceptible to stress, potentially unstable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it's possible to learn something from the voices. 
</P>
<P>
 An example of that is publicity. Ito and the lawyers seem to think that people 
have nothing else to do in life but absorb news about O.J. Some of the jury 
people have been real Simpson trial aficionados, one admitting she discussed 
the case up to five times a day at work before Ito admonished the group to stay 
away from news of the case. But others are so busy they say they pay little 
attention to the news. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting is how so many of the jurors' experiences reflect the 
difficulties of modern life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've now had quite a few people who seem to have a history of domestic 
violence," said Linda Deutsch of the Associated Press. "It's a commentary on 
how much domestic violence is out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, there was even a woman who had been beaten by her mother, and later 
in life by her boyfriend. She'd also been robbed and mugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Another juror told a story Tuesday afternoon that seemed to embody the 
economic and social troubles of Los Angeles itself. He was a reader, a 
serious-minded person who said he got his news from the Daily News and C-SPAN. 
</P>
<P>
 His love of print was in his genes. For three generations, his family had 
owned a Los Angeles bookstore that is now closed. "It was Metro Rail digging 
the subway station," he explained of the closure. "It was the riots. It was the 
competition. And, L.A., as far as retail, was in a desperate situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, now retired, had had a varied work career. He'd been a 
schoolteacher. Later on, he was a teacher aboard an aircraft carrier. And he'd 
been safety compliance officer at a large university campus. All those jobs 
taught him a lesson he shared when he was asked about the Los Angeles Police 
Department: "I have yet to see an organization that runs smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft carrier job prepared him for being sequestered if he makes the 
Simpson jury. He was on the carrier, he said, 120 days without seeing land. "It 
was like living in a large weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyhood experiences with racial abuse in Arkansas remained with an African 
American man. "A group of white boys," he remembered, "tried to run us from 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who is also black, asked the man what 
the experience meant to him. The man replied he was "somewhat sensitive" to 
what "certain people" say in his presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of being in black America, right?" said Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," said the man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These words constitute a small part of my notes on jury questioning. Mostly, 
I've written down answers to the issue that occupies much of Judge Ito's 
attention -- the media. As the AP's Deutsch said: "He doesn't want anything 
electronic in their lives and that is very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he booted out a man who watched cartoons with his grandson; a 
woman who viewed soap operas on a Spanish-language station and a woman who 
watched an old Barbara Stanwyck movie on television. 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to reflect a feeling -- shared by the judge and the lawyers -- that 
the media are the sum total of a person's life, tainting every thought and 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, a jury will be chosen and the media question will recede to the 
far background. 
</P>
<P>
 Then what will matter will be the entire lives of the jurors, their 
relationships, their jobs and everything else that goes into shaping someone's 
outlook on life. These experiences will be much more important to the outcome 
of the Simpson trial than whether a grandfather happened to watch cartoons with 
his grandson. Talk To Boyarsky

FORMER CRITIC OF DNA EVIDENCE SAYS TECHNIQUE IS NOW RELIABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A scientist who has been a prominent critic of the use of DNA evidence in 
court now says the field has progressed enough that such evidence is 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The DNA fingerprinting wars are over," Eric Lander of the Whitehead Institute 
for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., wrote in today's issue of the 
journal Nature with a co-author from the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no scientific reason to doubt the accuracy of forensic DNA typing 
results" as long as the testing meets current standards, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA evidence, which compares a defendant's genetic makeup with that found in 
samples of blood or other material from a crime scene, has been in the news 
because of the O.J. Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over DNA evidence has centered on technical problems and how to 
calculate the odds that an apparent match between a defendant's DNA and a 
crime-scene sample could be due to chance. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Lander wrote in Nature that DNA evidence could be unreliable because 
of a lack of procedural standards. But now there are appropriate guidelines for 
laboratories, hundreds of scientific papers and a National Research Council 
study of DNA evidence, Lander and Bruce Budowle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they could "identify no remaining problem that should prevent the 
full use of DNA evidence in any court."

MADONNA OFFERS BLUNT COMMENT TO WILSON JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Madonna -- yes, that Madonna -- sent a blunt message Wednesday to Gov. Pete 
Wilson, who had chided his Democratic opponent the day before by saying that 
Kathleen Brown was as hard to find among crime fighters as "a nun at a Madonna 
concert . . . even harder to find than Madonna at a nunnery." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoth the singer: 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be foolish of me to respond to a statement made by a fool." 
</P>
<P>
 Her comment, forwarded by publicist Liz Rosenberg and Warner Bros. Records 
spokesman Bob Merlis, came after the singer was shown a copy of a Los Angeles 
Times article outlining Wilson's remark and Brown's angry call for an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson had used the line to pep up his regular attack on Brown for, in his 
words, failing to campaign for 1993's Proposition 172, which extended a 
half-cent sales tax and earmarked the money for local police and public safety 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, to put it lightly, was not amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a woman and as a Catholic, I'm deeply offended by Pete Wilson's latest 
smear," said Brown, who characterized the remark as "off-color." 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask him to retract his statement immediately and to apologize to California 
women and Catholics." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said the governor did not intend to 
offend either Madonna or nuns. But the singer may have the last laugh: She is a 
registered California voter.

MORE COMMUTERS FINDING METROLINK SERVES THEIR NEEDS; TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS 
REPORT INCREASE IN TRAIN TRAVEL'S APPEAL, AND USERS SOUND POSITIVE. BUT 
CONCERNS STILL CENTER ON FUNDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the shrill whistle announced the Wednesday afternoon arrival of the 
Metrolink train in Simi Valley, commuters returning home from Los Angeles lined 
up eagerly inside the train doors, poised to dash from the platform to their 
waiting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some commuters, it is a routine that began two years ago, when the plush 
periwinkle-and-white trains first rolled into Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, more reluctant to surrender the comfort of the single occupancy 
vehicle, it is a service discovered gradually, then embraced enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I didn't know if I'd like it, but now I really enjoy it," said Linda 
Bruno, who began taking the train in September to her job as a customer service 
representative in Downtown Los Angeles. "It's easy and convenient and much less 
stressful than driving." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, Metrolink has whisked a growing number of commuters 
through earthquakes, fires and traffic jams, over 346 miles of track in five 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County alone, ridership has grown from 600 passengers a day in 
Moorpark and Simi Valley to nearly 1,400 daily riders catching the train in 
those cities as well as Camarillo and Oxnard. After the Jan. 17 earthquake, the 
Camarillo and Oxnard stops were added to help handle the passenger load and 
encourage commuters to get off congested roads and onto the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, more commuters on the Ventura County Line have switched 
from driving to train riding than on any other route in the system, said Peter 
Hidalgo, a Metrolink spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County commuters have been very receptive to Metrolink," Hidalgo 
said. "It's a very good trend that shows that people do see the train as a 
viable way to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But Metrolink has not been without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuters complain that the trains don't come often enough and are too often 
late, according to a Metrolink commuter survey. Trains to Ventura County are 
late more often than on any other line in the system. Trains on the Ventura 
County route also stop in Chatsworth, Northridge, Burbank, Van Nuys and 
Glendale before reaching Los Angeles Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Loraine Qubesh regularly catches the train from Moorpark to Downtown Los 
Angeles, where she has served on a federal grand jury for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Qubesh said she would like to see more trains in the afternoon, but is 
generally pleased with the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started on this jury it didn't even occur to me to take the train 
until a court reporter gave me a schedule," Qubesh said. "Now I wouldn't dream 
of driving." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Simi Valley commuter Renee Romanowski, the cost of Metrolink is an 
important consideration. She began taking the train to work after her employer, 
First Interstate, offered a deep discount on 10-day passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The passes, which usually run $45, cost Romanowski just $15. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great deal," Romanowski said. "I think the high fares keep a lot of 
people away." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Metrolink has no plans to permanently lower its fares, transportation 
officials said they hope improvements in service will attract more riders in 
the coming year. On-time arrivals have increased substantially in recent 
months, and Metrolink officials are studying the possibility of making more 
weekday runs and adding weekend trains.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first two years we focused on getting this thing going," said Bill Davis, 
a Simi Valley councilman and member of the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission. "Now we're really going to focus on working out all the kinks and 
getting this thing running perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some city and county leaders, kinks in service are just part of the 
problem. They worry about future funding for the trains as competition for 
state and federal transportation dollars intensifies. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink is heavily subsidized, with government agencies kicking in an 
average of nearly $7 per rider. Service to Ventura County costs about $1.6 
million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless ridership increases dramatically, some city and county leaders fear 
that the price of running Metrolink may be too high for trains that carry just 
a fraction of Ventura County's commuters to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that over the next six months we really need to increase the number 
of riders, especially in Oxnard," said John K. Flynn, a county supervisor who 
also serves as an alternate on the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metrolink is a wonderful service," Flynn said. "If we can double the number 
of people boarding in Oxnard, I'll feel comfortable backing it with vigor at 
budget time." Metrolink Report Card An update on ridership and on-time

CITY HALL NEWS: POMONA AGREES TO EXPAND STUDY OF PROPOSED CARD CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a settlement with four neighboring municipalities, the city of Pomona has 
agreed to expand the scope of an environmental impact report on its card club 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also as part of the accord, Pomona officials will suspend changes to two city 
ordinances that would pave the way for card clubs until the EIR is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the cities of La Verne, Claremont, Chino and Chino Hills have 
agreed to drop a lawsuit they filed in July against the card club proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Pomona has made its commitment to conduct a full EIR," City Atty. 
Arnold Alvarez-Glasman said. "And the city has agreed it will not take any 
action to approve or disapprove card clubs while the EIR is being completed. 
And the third part is, we have agreed to expand the EIR to review the 
ordinances that were previously adopted, to review the individual card club 
proposals and to examine environmental issues that may occur to surrounding 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona already has prepared a draft environmental impact report that is in the 
early stages of a 45-day public review period, Alvarez-Glasman said. Public 
hearings will be held in late November, and the report should be completed in 
December, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City attorneys for all five cities drafted the agreement, which has not yet 
been approved. The five city councils will probably vote on it by mid-November, 
La Verne City Manager Martin Lomeli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute arose earlier this year when Pomona pursued plans to open two card 
club casinos; one at the fairgrounds and another along the Pomona Freeway. When 
neighboring cities complained, Pomona agreed to do an EIR in June, 
Alvarez-Glasman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report fell short of the neighboring cities' expectations. They filed 
suit in July, demanding a full environmental impact report on the proposal, 
claiming the card clubs might clog traffic, generate noise and bring crime to 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, Pomona agreed to perform an expanded EIR, which will 
examine alternative sites, analyze effects on transportation facilities and 
identify measures that could reduce negative impacts of the card clubs, Lomeli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thorough analysis will help us all understand what implications Pomona's 
proposal has on our citizens," Lomeli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona also agreed to pay a portion of the cities' attorney fees, Lomeli said. 
He said he could not estimate the dollar amount, but said it would probably be 
half or more of the total costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While the EIR is being completed, Pomona agreed to suspend an amendment to the 
city's business license ordinance updating a 1964 gaming law, and another 
amendment to the zoning ordinance that permits card clubs in areas zoned for 
light industry and at the fairgrounds, Alvarez-Glasman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has not, however, settled a related suit filed by a Pomona citizens 
group demanding that the council put the card club proposal up for public vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez-Glasman said that although the council considered putting the measure 
on the ballot several months ago, it later chose not to, deciding that a 1964 
ordinance already authorized card clubs in the city without a public vote.

 ALHAMBRA: City Council members agreed to lease part of the old Sears store at 
Fremont Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue to Taco Bell Corp. for a fast-food 
restaurant. The firm will pay the city $62,000 annually. Taco Bell joins 
Smith's Food and Drug Centers, which in April purchased part of the site from 
the city to build a store. El Pollo Loco and Adrays are also negotiating with 
the city for the remaining space. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: The council will consider Tuesday whether to allow sidewalk dining 
for restaurants and review the construction of a five-story, 
147,000-square-foot patient tower at Arcadia Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAREMONT: Residents are invited to attend an ongoing series of workshops that 
seek public comment on the city's budget process. The workshops will be held at 
7 p.m. on Tuesday and Nov. 9 at Western Christian School and Sumner School 
respectively. A final session will take place at 10 a.m. on Nov. 19 at Taylor 
Hall, 1775 N. Indian Hill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: The City Council has voted to support Proposition 186, a 
statewide initiative to have a single-payer, state-operated health-care system 
that proponents say will guarantee health care for all. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: City Manager Philip A. Hawkey said he will present a plan to the 
City Council on how to remedy alleged discrimination at City Hall after an 
advisory committee of minority employees and women makes recommendations Nov. 
17. Hawkey had been expected to present a plan Monday, but members of the 
advisory group instead told the council they were working on recommendations 
for change. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH PASADENA: The City Council has hired Graffiti Control Systems Inc. to 
remove graffiti from private property at no cost to the owners. Residents are 
urged to call the city graffiti hot line at (818) 799-6578 to report vandalism 
or request assistance. Once a property owner has signed a liability waiver, the 
graffiti will be removed within 72 hours, city officials said. RICHARD WINTON

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: 'TIS THE SEASON FOR HALLOWEEN HAUNTINGS 
</P>

 This is the season when everyone seems to be all dressed up with someplace to 
go. Especially here in Ventura County: Last week, the fancy-dress crowd 
gathered for festivities commemorating the grand opening of the Thousand Oaks 
Civic Arts Plaza; this week, the fancifully dressed will gather in the streets 
for Halloween celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 While local civic leaders and luminaries hobnobbed over hors d'oeuvres and 
champagne, hobgoblins were getting ready to exchange Snickers and Mars bars 
with assorted pals from the afterlife, including some witches, skeletons, 
ghosts, a few timely and clever Medflies and at least one Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-lance writer Leo Smith met several local ghouls -- all of them adults -- 
for this week's Centerpiece story on those nice neighbors among us who roll out 
the unwelcome wagon (or tombstone, or coffin, or hearse) to encourage community 
spirit(s). 
</P>
<P>
 "People really get into this holiday," Smith said. "Adults try to bring back 
the thrills and frights of Halloween as they remember it when they were 
children. Some plan well in advance for this one night, and others are pretty 
ready all year long."

 For this story, Smith talked to just a handful of people, but the county, he 
believes, is positively alive with agents of the living dead. In some cases, it 
is the guy down the street who just really gets into it; in other cases, it is 
an organized event put on by such places as the Olivas Adobe or such 
organizations as the local Jaycees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that almost every neighborhood has at least one resident Freddy 
Kreuger ready and willing to torment the local children and scare the sheets 
off them," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 For one block in Santa Paula, the night will be more rockin' than shockin'. 
That is where J. R. Shropshire dons one of his several Elvis costumes for a 
night of trick or treating followed by hip-swiveling entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to suggest that Shropshire possesses less than his fair share of 
the macabre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, he was Werewolf Elvis," Smith said. "And he did mention that he 
met his wife Terri at a funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Haunting. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the many who filled the concert hall of the Civic Arts Plaza to see 
and hear the Conejo Symphony Orchestra perform with Bernadette Peters, I was 
delighted to see the level of community support for this potentially 
world-class cultural complex. 
</P>
<P>
 And as one who watched the birth of the facility as it struggled to find an 
identity, a shape and a purpose in a somewhat awkward site next to the Ventura 
Freeway, I was amazed to see it in its finished state -- clean, elegant and 
glittering under the light of a waning moon and the warmth of a welcoming 
crowd. It was all dressed up and some place to go.

KIM RUNS LOW-KEY CAMPAIGN IN FACE OF FEDERAL INVESTIGATION; CONGRESS: POLITICAL 
DAMAGE FROM PROBE OF '92 ELECTION FINANCES SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN MINIMAL, SAY 
OBSERVERS. DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT FACES SEVERE DISADVANTAGES IN FUNDING AND VOTER 
REGISTRATION. 
</P>

<P>
 Rep. Jay Kim (R-Diamond Bar) is still under investigation for possible 
violations of federal election, tax and labor laws in connection with his 1992 
campaign, but the congressman is running for reelection as if he doesn't have a 
worry in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has not personally engaged his Democratic opponent in debate, declining to 
share the dais at several candidates' forums in recent weeks. And as of 
midweek, he had run cable television ads touting his record but had not sent 
out a single campaign mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to political scientists and consultants, Kim apparently can afford 
to run a low-key campaign against Democrat Ed Tessier in the 41st District, 
which includes parts of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 To start, registration in the district is 48% Republican to 39% Democrat, 
considered a sizable advantage because Republicans typically turn out to vote 
at higher rates than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Kim has been able to raise significantly more money than Tessier. 
As of Sept. 30, Kim had raised about $650,000, including about $125,000 since 
the primary, according to his campaign disclosure statement. Tessier had raised 
about $34,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And the political damage the federal investigation has inflicted on Kim 
appears to have been minimal because no charges have been filed so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The way the experts see it, Kim's legal problems opened the door for a 
challenge. But Tessier, a moderate Democrat who at 27 has never held public 
office, does not have the name recognition or money to walk through it. Outside 
his hometown of Pomona, Tessier, a quadriplegic, is best known for championing 
the rights of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see very little sign of Tessier's candidacy," said political scientist Alan 
Heslop of Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Tessier continues to debate empty chairs, make appearances at 
community events and put in hours on the phone trying to raise money and 
support for his underdog candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 He hammers on Kim for the possible violations of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bought his image. He bought his reputation." Tessier said of Kim, who was 
a little-known Diamond Bar councilman when he first ran for Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim became the target of the federal probe last summer after The Times 
reported that he secretly used about $480,000 from his engineering corporation 
to finance his 1992 federal campaign. Despite a prohibition on corporate 
contributions to federal campaigns, JayKim Engineers Inc. provided Kim's 
campaign with free rent, staff and office supplies, according to internal 
company records and checks signed by Kim that were obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who did not respond to various requests for interviews by The Times, has 
told other newspapers that, at most, he is guilty of only a technical 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier also criticizes Kim for presenting himself as a Republican with 
moderate leanings in the 1992 campaign. Kim campaigned in support of abortion 
rights, for example, but once in Washington, voted against various pieces of 
abortion rights legislation, including a bill to lift the ban on fetal tissue 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim also campaigned in support of a waiting period on the purchase of handguns 
and controls on semiautomatic weapons, but he voted against the Brady bill, 
which requires a waiting period before handguns can be purchased. Kim also 
opposed the recently passed crime bill, which bans 19 types of assault-style 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay Kim ran as a moderate Republican in 1992," Tessier said. "His voting 
record is 100% radical right." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's recent television commercials proclaim a strong stance against illegal 
immigration. Kim favors cutting off health care and educational benefits to 
illegal immigrants and supports using the National Guard to seal the 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a conservative district, and Jay Kim is very much in step with his 
district," said Sandra Garner, Kim's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner also noted that Kim, who is on the House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee, has secured funding for projects in his district. 
That includes grants totaling $11.3 million for improvements to airports in 
Chino and Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kim, Tessier supports using the National Guard to secure the border, but 
he would not deny schooling or health care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truancy causes crime," Tessier said of denying schooling. Cutting off health 
care would "increase health problems generally, and the state's health care 
costs would rise dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Tessier said he supports welfare reform, including work requirements, as well 
as gun control and abortion rights. He also proposes universal health care 
coverage financed by so-called sin taxes and not by employer contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenger, who heads his family's Pomona-based development company, 
serves on the Pomona Planning Commission and is president of the city's Central 
Business District.

CABLE SHOW TUNES IN TO CRIME; SAFETY: GLENDORA'S 'THE POLICE REPORT' GIVES 
OVERVIEW OF RECENT CRIMES, OFFERS PREVENTION TIPS AND SEEKS PUBLIC'S HELP TO 
SOLVE CASES. 
</P>

<P>
 It's not exactly "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 But once a month, Glendora Police Officer Brian Summers heads over to the 
local Cablevision studio to powder his face, assume Peter Jennings' posture and 
tape "The Police Report," a 30-minute public access show that will air 
repeatedly throughout the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a bare table and reading his script from papers in front of him, 
Summers bemoans the lack of a TelePrompTer while his cameraman, Sgt. Al Wadham, 
admonishes him to "sparkle. Sparkle." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, decked out in police uniform, gives an overview of recent crimes, 
offers crime prevention tips and asks for the public's help with unsolved 
crimes during "Crime Stoppers Crime of the Month." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, 34, Glendora's crime prevention and public information officer, has 
been taping "The Police Report" since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame? Of a sort. At neighborhood watch meetings, he said, he is often 
approached by residents who ask him: "Where do I know you from?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has fumbled over his wording and sweated through take after take to get it 
right. In addition, Summers must broadcast through dimming lights in a freezing 
studio. "I bet Paul Moyer doesn't have to put up with this," Summers quips. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Glendora's 17,000 homes, about 8,000 get Cablevision. Ratings are not 
tracked and it's difficult to say how many residents actually watch the show. 
Many Glendorans discover the show by accident, Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of using cable television as a way to reach residents and warn 
them about crime is not a new one. Oxnard Police Department was the first 
department in the country to produce such a show nine years ago, said David 
Keith, Oxnard Police Department community affairs manager. Since then, Keith 
said, he has received 450 calls from police departments in the United States 
and Canada interested in starting their own shows. Oxnard's show is broadcast 
live every Monday night and 5,000 to 8,000 people watch every week, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadham said the department hoped that the show would evolve into a more 
frequent production but lacked the time.  
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Monterey Park Police and Walnut sheriff's substation are among other 
agencies using cable television as a crime-fighting tool. Officer Roberta 
Villa, who hosts Monterey Park's show, "Monterey Park Police Department and the 
Community," said the department only recently aired its second show.  
</P>
<P>
 In Walnut, Deputy Frank Girard does a regular three- to five-minute segment 
for the city program "A Week in Walnut." He's been doing the show for about a 
year and said he has received positive responses from residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Police Report" airs on Thursdays at 7 p.m. before the City Council reruns 
and on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m. on Cablevision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monterey Park Police Department and the Community" airs on Fridays at 3 p.m. 
and Wednesdays at 7 p.m. on Crown Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Week in Walnut" airs Tuesdays through Sundays at 7 a.m., 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. 
on Walnut Community Cable.

SAN MARINO TO VOTE ON TAX FOR POLICE, FIRE SERVICES; PUBLIC SAFETY: RESIDENTS 
HAVE APPROVED THREE LEVIES SINCE 1982. MEASURE REQUIRES APPROVAL BY TWO-THIRDS 
OF VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While city council members in the San Gabriel Valley hear rumblings about 
recalls when they so much as discuss taxes, San Marino Councilman Eugene H. 
Dryden slings the "T" word around without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Election Day, voters in his city will decide whether to tax themselves 
several hundred dollars a year to pay for police and fire services. Such a tax 
requires approval of two-thirds of the voters, but Dryden, a supporter of the 
tax measure, Proposition I, isn't too worried. 
</P>
<P>
 City residents have passed the tax three times since 1982. The last time, in 
1990, 76% of the voters cast ballots to spend the money that would keep San 
Marino -- well, San Marino. It is a city with neatly manicured lawns and grand 
homes served by its own police, fire and paramedic agencies, and where 
emergency response times are measured in seconds and serious crimes are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in San Marino are unique in that they are very concerned about 
preserving the city as it is," Dryden said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a median household income of $127,104 and a median home price of more 
than $500,000, San Marino can afford such preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city typifies a situation that is growing increasingly common in 
California: With less state money to even things out, the gap between the have 
cities and the have-not cities is widening. 
</P>
<P>
 "As worried as San Marinians are about crime, they don't confront the crime 
faced by low-income communities that cannot afford these fees and taxes," said 
Alan Heslop, a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino traditionally ranks among the most crime-free towns in Los Angeles 
County. Tax advocates say that is partly a reflection of the 13,000-resident 
city having its own 26-officer Police Department. Those officers plus 22 
firefighters and nine paramedics working shifts around the clock within a few 
minutes of any street help keep home values up and insurance costs down, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Sierra Madre, the city nearest in size to San Marino, has 11 
sworn police officers and a volunteer Fire Department with a full-time chief 
and two fire inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Response times are much longer in other areas," said Mike Johnson, a former 
San Marino councilman. "We've got to have (the tax)." 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino Police Capt. Gary Isaacs said the departments respond to emergency 
calls within two minutes -- "three minutes, top" -- while surrounding cities 
allow up to a six-minute response time. Pasadena police answer emergency calls 
in three to five minutes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Marino tax was originally enacted in 1982 after Proposition 13, which 
was approved in 1978, rolled back real-estate assessments and set strict caps 
on property taxes. San Marino was hit particularly hard by the property tax 
rollback because with relatively little business, it had a small sales-tax 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 The public safety tax accounts for 25% of the city's budget because in recent 
years the state has grabbed more of the city's tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 If the levy is not renewed and expires in 1995, "the city will lose 
approximately 50% of its police and fire budget and 90% of the paramedic 
service budget," said Bob Twist, chairman of San Marino Citizens for Public 
Safety, the committee for Proposition I. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal opposition group has emerged to fight Proposition I. However, 
resident Gene G. Ruckh has written an argument against the proposition on the 
ballot, asking why the city has not presented residents with a comparison of 
the cost of contracting out services. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruckh, an anti-tax crusader, also contends that the city spends significant 
time helping neighboring cities with public safety services, and that plentiful 
reserves could be used instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Citizens for Public Safety disagree, saying it would cost about 15% 
more to contract out for services. They say mutual-aid requests from other 
municipalities account for only 12% of calls, and that other cities 
reciprocate, while reserves would run out in just over two years if devoted to 
public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In fiscal year 1995-96, homeowners would pay $324 to $881, depending on the 
size and location of the lot, city officials said. The average homeowner would 
pay $447 annually.

NIGHT LIFE: DEVOTED TO PLAYING THE RED-HOT BLUES; RANDY RICH, A CAMARILLO 
LOCAL, ADMITS IT DOESN'T PAY WELL BUT HE AND THE RAVENS TEAR UP THE SCENE WITH 
THEIR PEDAL-TO-THE-METAL STYLE. 
</P>

<P>
 So you're in the bar, Cupid has passed out love wings to everyone but you, and 
booze has finally removed your brain anyway. Now what? Maybe find some decent 
music that's not a cover band? You couldn't do much better than Randy Rich & 
the Ravens who will be shredding all over Charley Brown's in Thousand Oaks this 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, a Camarillo local, has been tearing up the area's scene for many years. 
Any doubters need only remember his one show-stopping, mind-bending rendition 
of "Suspicions and Doubts" at the recent Ojai Bowlful of Blues. If more guys 
played the blues like Rich does, there would be infinitely more blues fans. 
Rich doesn't do any of that cry-in-your-beer blues, but full-on 
pedal-to-the-metal assault blues with chain-saw intensity solos that Buddy Guy 
and Stevie Ray Vaughan would appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 The follicly challenged guitarist talked things over recently from his 
Camarillo home. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you learn to play like that? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I just put in a lot of time and just keep doing it. I learned by 
listening to records -- records show you how to do it. I do about 25 of my own 
songs and about 30 of other people's songs, depending on the situation. I'll do 
a song for a while, then forget it, write a new one, bring back an old one -- 
it's always changing. 
</P>
<P>
 How long have you been the local blues dude? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, I've been back here from Nashville since 1986, and I've been in and 
out of a lot of other people's bands. It's been since 1991 that I put together 
the Ravens. I play with John Marx on Wednesdays at the Classroom in the Valley; 
then the next night with a harp player named Terry Longo. Sundays, I play at 
the Studio City Bar & Grill. This Friday and Saturday thing at Charley Brown's 
is just starting. 
</P>
<P>
 How did a Camarillo local end up in Nashville? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a long and not very interesting story. Basically, it was just from 
meeting different people. I stayed there for three years and played for a 
recording artist named Ed Bruce. He made millions, then gradually started to 
wind down. He just does commercials these days, and I think he has a show on 
the Nashville Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the local scene happening? 
</P>
<P>
 I went to high school in Camarillo in the '60s and there weren't that many 
places to hang out, just like now, so I guess it's about the same. I do have a 
local following, but it's real hard to get something rolling. If you get out of 
a club you've been at for a long time, people sort of get out of the groove. 
Bar owners have to get people in there and the rents are high -- I understand 
that. They don't care what's happening as long as people come to see it. I 
can't criticize them for what they think is hip, but on the other hand, I can't 
change what I do. 
</P>
<P>
 What about playing in a restaurant when people are talking, then later, some 
drunk guy asks you to play "Born to Be Wild"? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, there are times when there's not that many people, and I feel like I'm 
standing in a library yelling. I think the people feel kind of weird, too. When 
people go out, they want to meet other people and have fun, socialize. When 
someone asks me to play some song, I tell them I do my own stuff and some stuff 
by the old blues guys. I don't know "Free Bird," anyway. But that's cool -- 
that stuff doesn't bother me. 
</P>
<P>
 What's your version of the blues? 
</P>
<P>
 It's limited -- some like a little more variety, but it's the blues. It's a 
mix of styles from all over, I guess. For years, nine or 10, I did the 
coffeehouse tour with an acoustic guitar. I played songs by Robert Johnson, 
Blind Blake, stuff like that. All that influenced how I approach the electric 
guitar. I do a lot of late '40s to early '60s blues. I put a lot of energy into 
it to give it an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Why don't more people go hear the blues? 
</P>
<P>
 People think the blues are about being sad, but it's really about making fun 
of what's making you sad. It's about finding the answers to what's bugging you. 
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't you rich? 
</P>
<P>
 The music business is a million people trying to get that one record deal. 
Keep trying, that's all I can say. I've sent stuff to everybody, but I don't 
really know what happened to it. You hear about guys like William Clarke who 
was playing, making his own records, sending out stuff, for 16, 17 years. It 
doesn't happen overnight. Getting signed to a small label is no guarantee of 
success, but it does help. Being in the right place at the right time is also 
important. Keep plugging away, that's all you can do. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the plan? 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, I'm just trying to get a band together again, keep writing and keep 
playing. The old Ravens fell apart last summer when they decided they could 
make more money playing Top 40. I've got two new guys now, Eric Monteef on bass 
and George Nixon on drums. But like I said, it's hard because I make a lot less 
now than I did in 1972. The amount of money I'm making now, I used to laugh at, 
but that's all they're paying these days. But this is what I do. Details

SIGHTS; CULTURALLY CURIOUS GET INSIDERS' TOUR OF OJAI'S ARTISTIC SIDE; ANNUAL 
FUND-RAISING EVENT OFFERS A PERSONAL VIEW OF UNIQUE WORKS AND THE SETTINGS IN 
WHICH THEY WERE CREATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom tells us that Ojai is home to all manner of artists, 
spiritual seekers, and types who tend to wander off the beaten socio-cultural 
path. But what proof is there? 
</P>
<P>
 From cursory, outside appearances, Ojai is a slightly funky, refreshingly 
unadulterated little burg with stern ideas about vulgar signage. It's an oasis 
of Spanish Colonial-esque tranquillity that caters to visitors on the weekends, 
yet refuses to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
 The culturally curious had a rare opportunity to get beneath the surface 
recently, as part of the Ojai Studio Artists tour. The annual event raises 
money for art scholarships as well as providing the artists a public forum and 
giving the Ojai art scene a rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, the tour functions as a map to the artists' homes, piquing 
the interest of voyeurs, art lovers and art buyers alike. For two days, a 
steady stream of visitors filtered through the private spaces of two dozen 
local artists, perhaps as much intrigued by the access to private spaces as the 
art itself. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot can be gleaned from the tour, which took the avid self-guided tourist 
from the Oakview end of Ojai through Meiners Oaks to the far end past Upper 
Ojai. It amounted to an economic cross-section: from a mobile home park to 
idyllic, expansive spreads, with plenty of middle ground between. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour always provides a good opportunity to check in on the state of Ojai 
artists -- a varied lot, to be sure. Although many of the artists involved 
return year after year, changes in venue, texture and personal evolution make 
the tour a special part of the cultural calendar here. 
</P>
<P>
 One-hundred-and-one-year-old Beatrice Wood, the renowned ceramist and 
two-dimensional artist, has been the tour's centerpiece in the past. In fact, 
she remains a sort of plucky grande dame of the Ojai art world. Wood, 
recuperating from an illness, was sadly absent this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consolation, the Childress Gallery showed a wall of Wood's whimsical 
drawings and examples of her iridescent ceramic vessels. Gayel Childress' space 
has, in the past year, developed into a force to be reckoned with in Ojai and 
Ventura County, generally. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, the sampler-plate show put up for the tour ranged from Childress' own 
impressive works to photographic views of the landmark Ojai Post Office -- Phil 
Harvey's paean to civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable newcomer to this year's tour was the famed photojournalist 
Horace Bristol, who has lived in and around Ojai at various junctures for 70 
years. As Bristol moved around the house in his wheelchair, visitors strolled a 
living room area liberally strewn with images that told individual stories, as 
well as the broader tale of his own itinerant life. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection particularly emphasized his work in Asia. Bristol shot many 
memorable images during the Depression and in World War II, such as the famous 
shot of a buck-naked gunner jumping into action before God and his enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Bristol's peacetime, quasi-anthropological work that leaves the 
strongest impression. In these images of quotidian life in a non-Western scene 
-- bare-breasted female divers, activity in an opium den, a tattooing session 
-- Bristol shows a keen, sentient eye for composition. He has danced along the 
line that separates, and sometimes binds, photojournalism and fine art 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Sanchez, Ojai's resident neon aesthete, played a prominent role in the 
recent show of neon art at the Childress Gallery, and her house played host to 
pieces that accommodate both physical and metaphysical aspects. Humor is afoot 
too, as in "Midnight Swim," a coffee-table-like piece with neon subtly tucked 
into the design. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicality, on an almost aggressive order, is at the heart of the metal 
sculptures by Theodore T. Gall. Gall deals in heroic and/or mythical male 
figures and warriors, sometimes with wings, and always with bad attitudes. The 
arched backs, pronounced buttocks and exaggerated musculature of his figures 
suggest that the artist has read too many heavy metal comic books. 
</P>
<P>
 In the studio, the sound of Tom Petty was spilling out of the radio, 
completing the picture of a rock 'n' roll artist at work and at play. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the road to the Gall studio wended high up off of upper Ojai. This 
year, the artist and his wife, fellow metal artist Claudia, are ensconced in a 
spacious new studio/workshop closer to the heart of Ojai. The space is full of 
industrial grade metal working machinery, while all around are orange trees and 
exotic cacti. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most interesting places to visit on the tour is Frank Kirk's studio, 
nestled deep in an orange grove to the rear of an exotic Mediterranean house. 
Kirk's art leans toward sharply detailed surreal visions, Art Deco-era manners, 
and a gentle, chic brand of dread. Muzak bubbled away incongruously in his 
studio as he brushed away at a canvas, fleshing out a tangle of foreboding 
shrubbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Other regulars whose art/surroundings were of interest: the ever-engaging 
ceramic haven of the house/studio/shop run by eminent potters Otto and Vivika 
Heino; Christine Brennan's increasingly wonderful and weird fantasy vignettes, 
with unspecified beasts caught in unspecified narratives; Gretchen Greenberg's 
sinuous, perhaps phallic wooden sculptures; Linda Taylor's variations on the 
themes of social realism and elliptical still life. 
</P>
<P>
 On his rustic hunk of real estate, Mick Reinman showed his typical 
neo-Expressionist cowboy lore, along with a weirdly striking painting of a man 
mowing his lawn, rendered enigmatic by an overhead perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Way up in the hills in her luxuriant retreat-like setting, the gifted and 
prolific Nancy Whitman showed walls and walls of her deceptively idyllic 
Bonnard-ish canvases. The new one, "Family and Hibiscus Tree," is a dream 
landscape characteristically pregnant with pinks, host to a small, amiable 
group of mythical people. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it an allegory for Ojai herself.

TOPICS / HOLIDAYS; A WALK ON THE WILD SIDE; AGAIN THIS HALLOWEEN, THE SWITZERS' 
CARVED JACK-O'-LANTERNS WILL LINE THEIR LONG, SCARY SIERRA MADRE DRIVEWAY. THE 
SIGHT ATTRACTS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EACH YEAR.

<P>
 Getting to Bud and Donna Switzer's yellow house in Sierra Madre requires 
walking up a curvy 250-foot, tree-lined driveway. At night, the route is 
pitch-black, and for young children, pretty scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really bothered me that kids wouldn't come up to the house at Halloween," 
Bud said. His wife added: "But now look what he's got himself into." 
</P>
<P>
 What he's gotten himself into is 50 humongous pumpkins that right now take up 
most of the front porch. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, as they have every Halloween for the past 15 years, Bud, 66, and 
his son Kevin, 30, will scoop out thousands of seeds from those pumpkins, pull 
out hundreds of handfuls of squishy insides and carve the skins into elaborate 
faces that Monday night will transform the Switzers' potentially spooky Alegria 
Avenue driveway into a wild walk among candle-lit jack-o'-lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween loneliness is no longer a problem. Last year, the jack-o'-lanterns 
attracted more than 5,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m., the place was packed, kids came from all over the area 
and there were a lot of adults who just came to admire the pumpkins," Donna 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud, a retired Hughes Aircraft worker, wouldn't disclose how much he spends on 
the pumpkins he buys in Camarillo, but said he and his son spend two solid days 
carving the 100-pound squashes, using nothing more than a five-inch fruit 
knife.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the pumpkins' twisted smiles, outlandish pointed teeth and expressive, 
lifelike eyes, the father-and-son team have turned what many consider a chore 
into something of an art, although Bud said he rarely plans a design. "The 
faces are all in the pumpkins, just waiting to come out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once finished, the great orange fruits, which take two people to carry, are 
lit with candles that exaggerate their freakish features, said Donna, who 
doesn't carve herself, but helps with the massive cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always more seeds than we can use," she said. "And we use the rest 
of the pumpkins as mulch for our trees." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of work is involved in their unique Halloween ritual, admitted Bud, who 
almost didn't do it this year. And he didn't want his exact address given out 
because crowd control has become a problem, although he doesn't mind if folks 
drive by for a peek. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son was very intent on keeping up the tradition," he said. "It's become a 
real family event that Kevin will probably take over one day."

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: COSTUMES REQUIRED THIS WEEKEND; BESIDES THE SCHEDULED PUMPKIN 
EVENTS, THERE'S A TWO-DAY HISTORICAL RE-ENACTMENT CELEBRATION AT LAKE CASITAS 
NEAR OJAI.

 If you cowgirls have been looking for an excuse to climb into that old cat 
suit hangin' in the back of the closet, this weekend is as good a time as any. 
And gents can indulge that wanna-be "hat-hunk" fashion urge at several 
countrified Halloween events planned around the county. Here's a sampling of 
what's in store. 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Lovers Western Dance Club should get the weekend off to a good 
start Friday with a Happy Halloween Dance featuring a costume contest and 
plenty of two-steppin' and line dancing. Last year's event was great fun. And 
you can't miss with Shiloh, one of the area's most popular country bands, and 
the American Legion's huge dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 David Graves will teach at 7 p.m., then Shiloh plays until midnight. Tickets 
are $7 per person for members, $8 for non-members. (American Legion Hall, 83 S. 
Palm St., Ventura, 647-1893). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday you've got more choices than Carter had pills. But whatever you 
decide to do, don't leave home without wearing a costume. On Saturday and 
Sunday an estimated 12,000 visitors are expected to attend Gold Coast 
Productions' first-time "American Country Celebration" on the shores of Lake 
Casitas near Ojai. Two hundred costumed characters will perform re-enactments 
illustrating ways of life from historical periods including the European 
colonization, American Revolution, Civil War, the Mountain Man-fur trade era 
and settlement of the West. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find stuntmen demonstrations, food and crafts booths and pony rides. 
The "Western States Fast Draw Finals" competition is sure to attract scores of 
gunfighters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most colorful cowpoke is sure to be Montie Montana, a living legend 
and inductee in several rodeo halls of fame. The veteran of more than 60 
television shows and films since 1934 will perform his world-famous rope tricks 
and sign copies of his book, "Not Without My Horse!." 
</P>
<P>
 For a musical treat, head for the main stage where Rick Henderson will teach a 
line dance at 10 a.m., then emcee an alternating series of one-hour sets by two 
popular bands. On both days at 11 a.m., 1 and 3 p.m. Buck Page's Original 
Riders of the Purple Sage will delight the crowd with classic cowboy tunes 
dating back to the '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday the Rhythm Rangers will play their popular mix of high-energy 
country-rock at noon, 2 and 4 p.m. And on Sunday, look for dance-along 
entertainment from Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers at noon, 2 and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The fun goes both days from 10 a.m. to dusk. Admission is $6 adults, $5 for 
students with I.D., $4 for seniors and children age 12 and under; $2 parking. 
For directions or more information, call 646-8126 or 496-6036. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Crazy Bull folks in Camarillo have put together a real wing-ding Halloween 
concert and costume party for Saturday night. The fun starts at 7 p.m. when 
local favorites Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers take the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then get ready for a special show starring Branscombe Richmond and the 
Renegade Posse. Fans of the hit television series, "Renegade," will recognize 
Richmond as the character Bobby Sixkiller. There will also be appearances by 
American Gladiators, "Gemini," Ms. California, Page Adams and Tony Pena of 
television's "The Young and the Restless." 
</P>
<P>
 K-Hay's "Miss Radio," Charlye Parker, will host the evening. And instead of 
Saturday's usual dance lesson, you can bet on a great costume contest including 
special prizes for the best Darlene O'Connell and Branscombe Richmond 
look-alike outfits. Details

MAN KILLED IN LEAP FROM 'SUICIDE BRIDGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old San Dimas man jumped from the Colorado Street Bridge in Pasadena 
on Monday, the first person to kill himself by leaping from the historic 
structure since its reopening 10 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 John David Parkerson jumped from the bridge about 4:50 p.m., said Pasadena 
Police Sgt. Chris Vicino.A police helicopter responded to a call about a man on 
the far side of the bridge but Parkerson jumped before patrol cars arrived 
minutes later, Vicino said. The helicopter pilot witnessed the suicide, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the bridge opened in 1913, about 100 people have committed suicide by 
leaping into the Arroyo Seco 160 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Police Lt. Alex Uribe said the bridge has been dubbed the "Suicide 
Bridge" because of the number of people who have chosen to leap from atop its 
spiked railing. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge was closed from November, 1989, to December, 1993, for seismic 
renovations. During renovations in March, 1990, a 52-year-old Anaheim woman 
leaped to her death.

 PASADENA: A 39-year-old La Canada Flintridge woman was found dead in a park

SCHOOLS; SCHOOL BOARD KILLS PROPOSAL FOR MULTICULTURAL YOUTH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN UHRICH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Controversial plans to build a multicultural youth center on a Rosemead 
elementary school campus have been scrapped, sparking concern that the $700,000 
county grant awarded for the project may be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Youth Center's proposal to build a multicultural center on the 
Arlene Bitely School campus ranked second among 53 grant applications submitted 
last spring to the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the high score was based on the Asian Youth Center's contention that 
part of the Bitely campus would be bought in a joint partnership with Garvey 
School District and then developed into a 6,500-square-foot multicultural 
center for at-risk children and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garvey School District Board of Education last week voted 3-0 to scuttle 
the youth center's plans for the Bitely school site. School board members David 
Lau, who was a member of the Asian Youth Center board of directors, and John 
Nunez abstained from voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth center officials will have to develop another plan, which in turn will 
have to be re-evaluated, said county administrator Ilona Volkmann. That could 
mean the youth center will not have enough time to qualify for any grant money 
this year, Volkmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a duty to others" who didn't win a grant this year, Volkmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Youth Center has been operating out of United Methodist Church on 
Rosemead Boulevard for the past four years. Youth center officials pitched the 
new facility in April as a multicultural center, and told county officials the 
school district was ready to sell a portion of the Bitely school site. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April 28 letter, Supt. Anita Suazo said the school district was 
interested in the idea but not ready to make a commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Youth Center board chairwoman Judy Chu said she is confident a private 
site or another school property can be acquired and developed. Chu, who is the 
mayor of Monterey Park, said if another site can be found quickly, there is 
still a chance to qualify for the grant. Chu said youth center officials are 
looking at Hillcrest Elementary School in Monterey Park as a possible 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-campus Garvey School District serves Monterey Park, Rosemead and San 
Gabriel. Of the district's 7,697 kindergartners through eighth-graders, 44% are 
of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there was so much misunderstanding," Chu said of the 
controversy. Some opponents expressed concerns over at-risk youths and possible 
gang activity at the new center. Others said the Bitely site was acquired 
through bitterly contested eminent domain proceedings 12 years ago and should 
be used only to expand the existing school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there were a lot of stereotypes about what at-risk meant," Chu said. 
"Right now I'm relieved. I don't want to be at a site where residents don't 
want it."

CENTERPIECE: HOME IS WHERE THE HORROR STARTS; SOME COUNTY PRANKSTERS ENJOY

 It seems like another quaint, residential Ventura neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how the zoning commission missed that cemetery in the front yard on 
South Dos Caminos Avenue is hard to say. And that pile of skulls isn't a pretty 
sight near the half a dozen or so cement headstones. 
</P>
<P>
 What about that beat-up old wrought iron fence tilting every which way? It 
can't be earthquake safe. And go figure -- no matter what the weather, on at 
least one night a year there's that pocket of dense fog just hovering around 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it would be a nice piece of property if it weren't for that coffin 
out front. It sort of detracts from the well-manicured lawn. Now why didn't 
that thing get buried, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably for the best, though, considering that each time someone gets 
near the coffin, the presumed corpse starts pounding on the lid, seeking relief 
from a suffocating predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a setting that would be the source of pride for Vincent Price, Bela 
Lugosi, Stephen King, or any other of the legendary horror folk. It certainly 
pleases Jim Sindelar, the Ventura resident -- or caretaker -- of this property. 
That's why, for the past three Halloweens, he's been dragging out the cemetery 
props. He is one of those county residents who still takes time out to 
celebrate the ghoulish occasion with zest and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 While concern for children's safety has cut down on trick-or-treating in some 
areas, there are still eerie signs of the old days when gangs of costumed 
creatures headed from house to house, never sure what lay waiting behind the 
fake cobwebs and dangling skeleton; never sure how the normally nice man next 
store would be transformed once the doorbell rang. 
</P>
<P>
 Most neighborhoods have at least one resident who goes out of the way to make 
Halloween the terrifying and/or bizarre night it was meant to be. 
</P>
<P>
 We found a coven of them around the county: SAVORING CEMETERIES 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids in the neighborhood know what I'm going to be doing and they love 
it," said the 34-year-old Sindelar, a mailman. "The first year we had well over 
100 kids come by. It surprised me because Halloween was getting to the point 
where nobody was coming around. It was kind of depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sindelar said he enjoys doing what he can to preserve the spooky spirits of 
the holiday. He's a fan of real-life cemeteries, and once Halloween is over, he 
doesn't exactly put the decorations in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I set the headstones up in my back yard all year long, the cement skulls sit 
in a pile," said Sindelar. "As I've grown up I've gotten more and more into 
cemeteries, mostly the older ones with the headstones and the work that goes 
into them. There is a peaceful feeling about the places." 
</P>
<P>
 Sindelar's Halloween display has become more elaborate each year. First there 
was just the coffin. Then last year he commemorated the 300th anniversary of 
the first witch burnings by re-enacting the scene with a mannequin. Then there 
was the fog machine. Last came the homemade headstones -- all blank, except for 
the one belonging to Lord Byron, poet and rumored vampire of the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the neighborhood kids seem to find the headstones unimposing the rest 
of the year, on Halloween, it's a different story. "A lot of them won't come up 
the block," said Sindelar. "We have to take the candy half way down the street 
to them." EXPANDING THE SHOW 
</P>
<P>
 Each September, Camarillo's Ken Carter sits down with a Halloween mail order 
catalog from the Oriental Trading company of Omaha, Neb., and makes a wish 
list. This year's wishes-come-true included a silhouette-making machine and a 
flying bat with a 10-foot wingspan, additions to an already noteworthy 
collection of Halloween decor. 
</P>
<P>
 There's "The Surprising Arm," a "Graveyard -- Enter at Your Own Risk" sign, 
cardboard tombstones marked "Unknown" and "Reserved," an open coffin with fake 
body, a spider attached to a fishing line that drops on unsuspecting visitors, 
cobwebs, a flying ghost, battery-operated noisemakers, bales of hay, a 
scarecrow, and various other tricks of the trick-or-treat trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out small and has gradually gotten worse," said Carter, who has 
been doing this since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like the scary things that go bump in the night. It brings back 
childhood memories of how scared we would be about ghosts, headless horsemen, 
haunted houses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with guys where we all got pillowcases and started 
trick-or-treating when the sun went down and didn't stop 'til people told us to 
go away. I remember the houses I enjoyed going to were the ones where people 
went out of their way to make it more entertaining." 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old firefighter lives with his wife Tanya and their two children 
-- Lauren, 8, and Kyle, 5 -- in a two-story home on Heritage Trail in the 
Mission Oaks area. It's a young, family neighborhood, Carter said, where lots 
of things go bump on Halloween night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a friend down the street with a guillotine, and there's someone with 
strobe lights," he said. "And around the corner there are people who have a 
cage with a guy inside rattling it." 
</P>
<P>
 And where is Carter while all this is going on? In his trademark role: propped 
up in black cape, mask, and dark makeup at the foot of the coffin, next to his 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put myself in an awkward position, lying in the bushes, in a way nobody in 
their right mind would," he said. "I'm limp and still. When they turn around 
after getting their candy, and start walking away, I reach out and grab 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he tries not to scare the little kids too much, but the big ones 
are another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of years ago, there was a group of eight older guys -- the ones who 
don't put on costumes and just come up on skateboards and want candy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One was acting real tough, real brave, real loud. I was out front sitting in 
my chair as a skeleton with a black cape on and he didn't even notice me. He 
took some candy and as he turned to walk off I grabbed his arm. He screamed 
like a girl in front of his buddies. I semi-humiliated him, but it was kind of 
fun." GHOSTLY VISITS 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween is a great time to bring out all sorts of scary devices, but it's 
not like Ventura County needs make-believe spooks. Ghosts regularly come around 
to check out their old haunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Lady in Black. She was last spotted at Ventura's Olivas Adobe about a 
year ago, with sightings going back more than 20 years. No doubt, she or 
someone resembling her will be hovering around the Adobe this Saturday, during 
the fourth annual Halloween tour of the nearly 150-year-old house. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will be led through the Adobe's seven rooms, each of which will be 
decorated for the occasion. And guides will share plenty of ghost stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the Faceless Woman, the Lady in Black, mysterious sounds," said 
Richard Senate, Adobe historian and local ghost aficionado. "Basically, workers 
have heard footsteps on the balcony when no one is there. Doors have opened and 
closed. Pictures have turned by some force. I think there is at least one ghost 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case the real ghosts are no-shows for the tour, Senate and his staff 
have devised alternative ways of creating that cozy, haunted feeling. "Bells 
will ring by themselves, music boxes will play by themselves," said Senate. 
"For very young kids it might prove frightening, but for ages 5 or 6, it 
probably will not be a problem. We're not trying to frighten kids into 
nightmares." 
</P>
<P>
 And in case you were wondering about that Lady in Black, she's often been 
spotted staring out a window or a door. "Nobody knows who she is," said Senate, 
"but it's assumed she's a member of the (Olivas) family. She kind of comes and 
goes." ELVIS SIGHTINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Who would know more about ghosts than someone who pretends to be a dead guy 
all year? Take Santa Paula's J.R. Shropshire, construction worker by day, Elvis 
impressionist by night. 
</P>
<P>
 Shropshire, 33, has been doing Elvis for 15 years, but it's only been for the 
past three that he's taken his act on the road for Halloween. He wears his 
$3,500-plus show costume (the Indian suit off The King's Boulevard album, for 
you Elvis buffs) to go trick-or-treating with his 12-year-old daughter Lisa 
Marie. 
</P>
<P>
 Shropshire said the reaction when an authentically attired, adult Elvis comes 
to the door looking for candy is generally one of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I show up on Halloween and it gives them the feeling that the ghost has 
returned," he said. "I'll be in full jumpsuit and I get this neat look from the 
little ones. They ask, 'Mommy, who is that?' And mommy stares and says, 'I 
think it's Elvis."' 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Elvis' trick-or-treating has proved a boon for his daughter. 
"She gets extra candy," said mom Terri Shropshire, Elvis' manager and wife. 
"They say, 'Could you give this to Elvis?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shropshire and his daughter like to complete their trick-or-treating rounds by 
about 8:30 p.m., because that's when the real fun starts. Their neighborhood, 
Venus Avenue, becomes a block party. While the neighbors barbecue, Elvis rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time it's different. Two years ago someone said, 'Well, how about 
putting on a show?' Next thing you know there are people from across the 
street, down the street, kids with their parents. I just cranked it up and let 
it go," he said. "Last year I had a party for my daughter's school friends, and 
I was dressed up as Werewolf Elvis. After that we split and went over to the 
Frontier Bar and had a real nice party going there." 
</P>
<P>
 One note: If you do run into this particular Elvis on Halloween, please don't 
grab his mutton chops or pompadour. They're not part of the costume. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're mine," he said. "They don't come off." SPOOKY FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
 It's Halloween on Calle Crisantemo in Thousand Oaks -- starring the Clark 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 There's mom Terrie, age 38, as the fortuneteller; daughter Soozee, 12, as "The 
Hand;" son T.J., 10, as the part-time "Face" and occasional epitaph writer; 
daughter Leia, 16, as occasional "Face" and cobweb stringer; and father Bruce, 
40, doing the props. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a family show, but enter at your own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The front lawn is cute, decorated with a ghost on a stick and some cardboard 
headstones, with sayings like, "Dum Dan -- Thesse Wer His Las Werds. 
Geronamo!!!," and R.I.P. -- I TOLD YOU I WAS SICK! -- LUCY THE LIAR -- 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 After passing the lawn, though, trick-or-treaters beware, because before they 
get to the candy, they must meet with the fortuneteller. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come up and get their fortunes read," said Terrie Clark. "I give them 
some kind of corny little thing like, 'You'll come into money as soon as you 
get your chores done." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the candy-seekers have two options: Reach into the candy caldron sitting 
on the fortuneteller's table, or go for the "special treats" behind door No. 1, 
which happens to be a standing coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 If they reach inside the caldron, they get the candy, but they also get "The 
Hand," reaching back at them. And if they go for the special goodies inside the 
coffin? Well, let's just say they're greeted by the "Face." 
</P>
<P>
 The director of this show is, of course, good old mom, a performer (member of 
the Southern California Mummer Choir) who grew up with a painting of a witch 
hanging in the house, and celebrations on all the major holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes life gets really boring," she said. "You have to think up 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 And Halloween has always been a prime focus for the Clark family. Terrie can't 
understand those who suggest that the occasion is too violent or sacrilegious. 
Her intent is not to terrify, she said, just to startle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why can't we let the kids have fun and let it rip?" she said. "I grew up with 
people dressed up all weird, and I'm normal."

 PASADENA: Washington Middle School now has the only soccer field in the 
Pasadena Unified School District, thanks to corporate and civic donations. The 
city of Pasadena, World Cup USA and Times Mirror Corp. contributed a total of 
$100,000 to the school district to build the outdoor facility, which was 
formally dedicated last week. The facility can be used by students and 
community members and is open during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 REGION: A $155,000 grant from the Los Angeles-based W.M. Keck Foundation will 
help the Claremont Colleges, Cal Poly Pomona, Caltech and Occidental College 
upgrade their computer programs with Ariel software. The software enables 
libraries to send written materials and photographs through the Internet with 
better speed and clarity, reducing the need for inter-library loans and 
facsimiles. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN GABRIEL: San Gabriel Mission High School administrators raised $156,732 in 
grants and through fund raising to begin the first comprehensive renovations of 
the school's science laboratories in its 45-year history. The chemistry 
laboratories were the first to undergo construction with remodeled stations and 
state-of-the-art computer and projection systems. Air conditioning and new 
lighting fixtures were also added to create a more comfortable learning 
environment. School officials are eager to extend reconstruction to the 
school's physical science, biology and physics laboratories, which they expect 
to cost about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Students from Pomona's Marshall Middle School and Ganesha High School 
have teamed up, under the direction of Marshall science teacher John Rubio, to 
build a small airplane propelled by a hamster running on a treadmill. Since 
last summer, the 36 students have studied subjects ranging from animal 
physiology to aerophysics, to build a plane that will have a 10-foot wingspan 
and a healthy hamster at, or more appropriately in, the wheel. The plane, which 
will fly a few feet off the ground at about 4 m.p.h., will be steered by remote 
control. The project is supervised by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Animals to ensure the hamster's safety. TALLY GOLDSTEIN

THEATER REVIEW; CENTURY-OLD STORIES COME TO LIFE IN 'FIDDLER ON THE ROOF'; 
BASED ON LIFE AMONG RURAL JEWS IN PRE- REVOLUTIONARY RUSSIA, THE TALES HAVE A 
UNIVERSAL APPEAL IN OJAI PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If half the population of Ojai is on stage for the current Arts Center Theater 
production of "Fiddler on the Roof" -- as it seems to be -- then the other half 
is in the audience: Several shows were sold out before the first performance. 
The number of capacity audiences should increase as word of mouth spreads; this 
is an ambitious production with much to recommend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories from Sholom Aleichem's 1894 "Tevye's Daughters" served as the 
inspiration for Joseph Stein's script, with music and lyrics by the team of 
Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick. Based on life among rural Jews in 
pre-revolution Russia, Aleichem's stories prove to be much more universal. And 
of course "Fiddler," which celebrated its 30th birthday in September, included 
the hit songs "Sunrise, Sunset" and "If I Were a Rich Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Tevye, the village milkman, is the father of several girls, three of whom are 
of marriageable age. But times are changing, and eldest daughter Tzeitel 
refuses to participate in the traditional match he arranges with butcher Lazar 
Wolfe, who's prosperous but several years her senior. Instead, she's fallen in 
love with her childhood friend, Motel, a poor but otherwise worthy tailor. Oy, 
veh! 
</P>
<P>
 Perchick, a revolutionary firebrand student from the big city of Kiev, 
eventually wins the affection of second daughter Hodel, and third daughter 
Chava . . . well, we won't give everything away here, other than to note that 
Tevye and his wife, Golde, are not thrilled by Chava's choice, either. In the 
meantime, Russian soldiers are moving closer in another of the government's 
efforts to eliminate Jews from the country -- not only is "Fiddler" universal, 
it's timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Evelyn Raft, also responsible for the Arts Center's fondly remembered 
version of "Cabaret" a few years ago, has again surrounded herself with capable 
hands, on stage and backstage. Gabriel de la Vega is literally larger than life 
as Tevye, commanding the stage whenever he's on it -- which is most of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandy Myers, Brittany Adams and Rachel Atkins portray Tzeitel, Hodel and 
Chava, with George M. Lemire as Motel, the tailor; Patrick Murphy as Perchick, 
the revolutionary; and David Douglas as Chava's intended, Fyedka. Debra 
Massarella plays Golde, and there's a strong comic turn by Marianne Johnston as 
a spirit who appears to Tevye, he says, in a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Massarella choreographed, along with Trudy and Peter Israel, both alumni of 
the Aman Folk Ensemble. Musical director Betsy Goodspeed heads perhaps the 
sharpest pit band seen in Ventura County in some time, and some of the choral 
singing is quite inspiring (vocal coaches: Heidi Goodspeed and Diane 
El-Shafey). Elmer Bladow has designed an ambitious set. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, director Raft gets as many as 33 cast members on stage 
simultaneously, which is probably a dozen more than fit comfortably on the 
relatively small stage, and too often the bystanders seem unsure of what they 
should be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a frustrated Tevye asks his fellow villagers, "Why are you all 
standing around like a bunch of goats?" It's a question that Raft might have 
asked during some of those more static passages. Details

WATER: SEWAGE RECLAMATION PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposed San Gabriel Valley sewage recharge project is not a private war 
between the Miller Brewing Co. and the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water 
District (July 28). It is a program that worries many business people and 
residents of this area as is evidenced by the concerns voiced by members of the 
Irwindale Chamber of Commerce.In fact, on Sept. 12 our board of directors voted 
to adopt a resolution opposing the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley is already No. 1 (and mentioned four times) on the list 
of polluted sites in the United States, and no cleanup efforts have been made. 
Is it not legitimate for all of the companies here to be against even the 
slightest chance of further contamination? 
</P>
<P>
 Miller Brewing Co. has been a good corporate citizen and twice converted part 
of its plant to bottling water to aid earthquake victims. As a business, there 
is nothing wrong with being concerned about their public image. Why has the 
water district refused to allow the company to conduct independent testing? 
Isn't it also true that as a business, the water district gains a lucrative 
project if it can sell reclaimed water for drinking purposes rather than for 
irrigation or industrial use? 
</P>
<P>
 The Irwindale Chamber of Commerce is opposed to this project.

VIOLENCE: TRAGIC SHOOTING OF INFANT GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vicki Torres' article on the tragic shooting that took the life of 
16-month-old Maureen Ramirez and the apparent lack of response within the South 
El Monte community ("A Baby, a Shooting and a Puzzling Question," Sept. 29) was 
very thoughtful in its overall treatment and quite accurate in its handling of 
quotes and other factual material, but neither as comprehensive nor as 
well-focused as it could -- and should -- have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me first note that the shooting did not "pass silently by in the city." It 
was widely deplored and the subject of much discussion among residents when it 
occurred, poignantly mentioned the following Sunday at the Epiphany Catholic 
Church and the front-page story in the local paper, the South El Monte Mirror. 
Only the City Council's lack of response was anomalous, and my remarks on that 
matter were accurately quoted. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sept. 8 meeting, the first meeting after the shooting, the City Council 
made a presentation to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jesus Anguiano for 
his service to the city and some comment could have been made at that time. At 
the conclusion of the meeting, the council could have closed in the memory of 
Maureen Ramirez. Neither course was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 That the various city officials who control what does and does not appear on 
the agenda could say, as Assistant City Manager Steve Henley did, that "no one 
spoke" and let it go at that, is indicative of the dismissive manner in which 
the council and the city staff deal with such matters. Henley's comment that 
the public had nothing to say because (the shooting) occurred in an industrial 
area was both fatuous and insulting. As a staffer who does not live in the 
city, his lack of familiarity with what we residents had to say among ourselves 
on the matter is hardly surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 I am afraid that part of the problem rests with the media's curious and highly 
selective determination of what counts as newsworthy. The general crime problem 
in South El Monte and the particular problems on Sastre Street have been raised 
on numerous occasions, especially by Councilman Joseph J. Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 Why hasn't The Times covered any of these efforts? Why weren't they even 
mentioned in the article under discussion? 
</P>
<P>
 The circumstances surrounding Maureen Ramirez's death were particularly 
tragic, but the failure of the City Council to either respond to or comment on 
that tragedy says far less about the overall character of the city than it does 
about the inability of the elected city leaders and city staff to pull together 
to address the civic and public safety aspects of such a tragedy.

HEALTH EFFECTS OF SARGENT-FLETCHER PLANT ARE HARD TO DISCERN; CHROME-PLATING 
FACTORY REPORTED TOXIC EMISSIONS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE AREA. BUT THE 
COMPANY DISPUTES THE DATA, CITING SMOG AS A MORE PROBABLE REASON FOR NEIGHBOR'S 
BREATHING AILMENTS.

 Look at the neighborhood surrounding Sargent-Fletcher and you are looking at 
the complexities of sorting out the relationship between health risks and 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte chrome-plating plant, which turns out aerospace parts, showed the 
highest cancer-risk level of any business in the San Gabriel Valley, according 
to a 1991 report the company submitted to regional air quality officials. 
Company officials now say the finding resulted from an outdated and erroneous 
report and that they have cut production of the aerospace parts that it makes, 
reducing the amount of chromium being emitted. But neighbors still wonder if 
their coughs and wheezing might be linked to chromium or other toxic air 
pollution from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty surrounding the issue is as thick as the gray-brown haze that 
often obscures El Monte's skyline on a sunny day. Backed up against the San 
Bernardino (10) Freeway, the neighborhood surrounding the plant is rife with 
smog and auto emissions, which Sargent-Fletcher officials maintain are far more 
likely to cause breathing problems than their company's emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring out what, if any, health problems are cause by the factory emissions, 
or from the the smog and exhaust -- or from just plain coincidental illnesses 
that would have cropped up even without pollutants -- is no easy task. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality experts acknowledge that breathing more than one type of pollutant 
can add to, or even multiply, the health risks. And neighbors fear the 
cornucopia of chemicals in their air is more than their lungs can handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smog plus the chromium from this company will injure us doubly," said 
Aniano Vicente, a former surgeon at Monrovia Community Hospital, who resigned 
this year after he was hospitalized with asthma, pneumonia and bronchitis. 
Several nearby neighbors complain of chronic respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 A report the company submitted to the AQMD in 1991 estimated that the 
factory's emissions may increase the cancer rate in surrounding areas by 120 
cases per million people.  
</P>
<P>
 The company maintains that mistakes in its original report exaggerated the 
amount of chromium the plant releases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emission factors used to calculate hexavalent chromium in the 1991 
health-risk assessment do not represent actual processes at Sargent-Fletcher 
Co.," said Ed Hilbert, the plant's environmental consultant. "These factors 
were based on incorrect estimates by a contractor who completed the report. . . 
. The company is in the process of preparing a revised health-risk assessment 
based on a more realistic emission factor." 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier contractor estimated the emissions from the plant's manufacturing 
process to be 10,000 times higher than those of other facilities that use the 
exact same process, Hilbert said. In addition, he said, aerospace cutbacks have 
meant downsizing at the plant since the report was submitted; therefore, it 
uses, and releases, less chromium. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that the emissions levels are based on a theoretical model and would 
probably be lower if they were actually measured. 
</P>
<P>
 When scientists at the state agency reviewed the original report, they found 
that the risk was in fact lower -- but not by much. Their review showed that 
Sargent-Fletcher poses a cancer risk of 85 in a million, said research 
scientist Judy Rosenbaum. In addition, its acute hazard level -- the index used 
to measure health effects other than cancer -- is 3.3. An acute hazard level of 
1.0 requires a company to notify neighbors. A level of 5.0 forces them to 
reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 And a profile of chromium by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
links exposure to the chemical among workers to respiratory ailments such as 
nasal irritation, perforated or ulcerated septums, labored breathing, coughs 
and wheezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melanie Marty of the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard 
Assessment, which reviews the health risk assessments companies such as 
Sargent-Fletcher have submitted to the AQMD, said that chromium is more likely 
to cause cancer than respiratory problems -- a chilling reassurance to 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbert suggested that the health hazards of smog and car pollution are 
probably greater than the danger of emissions from Sargent-Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I drive through the San Gabriel Valley, I have trouble breathing," he 
said.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; OJAI FILMMAKER CALLS SELLING THE HARD PART; 
THOMAS HORTON JOINED JEAN MICHEL COUSTEAU AND JOHN BURRUD IN 1993 IN PRODUCING 
ADVENTURE DOCUMENTARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Turn on Discovery or any of the other cable channels that broadcast adventure 
documentaries and the chances are pretty good that you'll be looking at a 
product of Burrud Cousteau Horton Inc. of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The company owns more than 1,400 hours of documentary footage, including the 
"Search for Adventure" series, "Jean Michel Cousteau's World of Sharks" and 
"Beyond Bizarre." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Michel Cousteau is, of course, the son of underwater explorer Jacques 
Cousteau. John Burrud is the son of documentary film pioneer Bill Burrud. Then 
there's Thomas Horton, 68, of Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the three principals, he is by far the least likely filmmaker. A World 
War II Marine and a business school graduate, Horton spent most of his career 
years working for a string of blue-chip defense contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Westinghouse, he worked on a project to design a research submarine 
with Jacques Cousteau. After six years on the sub project, Cousteau asked him 
to manage the film company that produced "The Undersea World of Jacques 
Cousteau." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was looking for somebody who had experience in contracts, not a 
filmmaker," said Horton. 
</P>
<P>
 During the eight years he worked with Cousteau, ending in 1978, Horton was 
responsible for organizing the explorer's far flung filming expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
 His reputation as a manager got him involved with an effort to cross the 
English Channel in a human-powered airplane. The Gossamer Albatross project was 
badly in need of sponsorship. Horton got Dupont to underwrite the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once Dupont agreed, I went back to them and said, 'You know, we ought to film 
this.' I was 52 years old, had never made a documentary before, but I was 
experienced at organizing filming expeditions on water, so they said all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane made it and Horton's documentary earned him an Emmy. Two years 
later, in 1983, he produced "America Remembers John F. Kennedy," which earned 
him another Emmy, this one for Outstanding Information Special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to learn how to make films and sell them. I had to do it on my own and 
on the fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Now more than 70 films later, Horton said selling films is still hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think I could show up with an Emmy in both hands and a backpack full of 
films and say, 'Hey, it's ol' Tom. Let's do this thing.' But it's never that 
easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, it's not as hard as it might be. The advent of cable channels like 
Discovery, A&E and others greatly expanded the market for adventure films. The 
opening of markets in formerly Communist countries provides still more venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said that animal films, their primary product, adapt well to foreign 
markets. They're not based on any particular culture, the way a situation 
comedy or drama might be, and because there's only one narrator, they're easy 
to translate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining forces with Burrud and Cousteau in 1993, Horton moved his 
production facilities from Ventura to Santa Barbara. Two of Horton's children 
work in the business. Drew is a production supervisor and daughter Jean Garner 
distributes the products. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton has been married 45 years and has lived in Ojai for 18. He was a member 
of the U.S. Olympic kayak teams in 1948 and 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since given up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent 14 years doing that. My wife finally said, 'That's enough. Now mow 
the lawn.' "

THEATER REVIEW; IT'S NO SINGULAR SENSATION, BUT A FEW SHINE IN 'CHORUS LINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Covina Valley Playhouse, an adventurous, 10-year-old community theater, 
has managed another ambitious undertaking with the classic dance musical "A 
Chorus Line." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 show about dancers auditioning for an unnamed Broadway musical is a 
particular challenge for a community theater, requiring a 19-member ensemble 
that can sing, dance and act. 
</P>
<P>
 The results in this case are uneven but salvaged by the hot hoofing of the 
show's best dancers, Raphael Barragan, Alec Isbell and Edward Johnson; the 
show's strongest singer, Lisa ("What I Did for Love") Kakassy, and the 
singularly vivacious, sassy and sexy Lori Halopoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmed by Louis A. Velazquez, this production draws its diverse talent from 
throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties. If you've ever seen the show on 
whatever level, the Covina interpretation enjoys pockets of crisp energy and 
the cast is an attractive, disciplined ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 What it misses, though, is that driving, aggressive edge -- that sharp 
tapping, crackle and snap -- that vaults you into a special world. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not entirely the production's fault. The show's concept remains fresh, 
but in the nearly 20 years since the musical's debut, its self-indulgent tone 
has flunked the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show, a tough director named Zach (Dorman Smith) attempts to size up 
how well his eventual dancers will work together by insisting they all talk 
about their private selves. 
</P>
<P>
 This opens up a Pandora's box of personal odysseys about oafish, terrible, 
upper-middle-class parents, sexual confusion and societal rejection. That was 
fine for the "me decade" of the '70s, but it seems flat and outdated now. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst-case scenario, actor Paul Rivera's dancer, mumbling -- you have 
to strain to hear him, and it's complicated by the theater's rough acoustics -- 
almost lulls the house to sleep with a self-consciously dreary litany about 
growing up gay. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the unraveling of a frayed onetime relationship between 
Zach and dancing aspirant Cassie (Sonni Louiseau) works because it illuminates 
the grinding life of a dancer who could have been a star but didn't make it and 
is now back to the chorus line. 
</P>
<P>
 Louiseau is a much better actress than dancer, however. Her performance of the 
centerpiece dance number, "The Music and the Mirror," is more cautious than 
thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Marvin Hamlisch's sprightly music (enlivened by musical director Tom 
Robinson's offstage band) and the intricate dance formations by Covina 
choreographer Angelo B. Collado make for plenty of engaging moments. 
</P>
<P>

ON THE ROAD: HAWKING HAPPINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sean (Salsa) Hill knows about people. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have you believe he knows instead about the speedy preparation of 
sparkling fresh salsa. Or hash browns. Or, for use in other dishes, mound upon 
colorful mound of chopped onion, green bell peppers and tomatoes. After all, he 
produces such things in seconds, with his very hands before your very eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Salsa Hill would have you believe he is just a widget salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 His clever crank-operated widget, called the Quick Chopper, was on sale here 
over the weekend at the annual Home & Garden Show at Seaside Park. But nobody 
knows, particularly, about the Quick Chopper, which is where Hill comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see this thing sold by my friend Joan Rivers on TV for $29.95, but I sell 
it to you here for $20," he tells an entranced crowd. "You wanna pay $1.49 for 
16 ounces of bottle salsa and choke on sodium benzoate, or have the real thing, 
in seconds, for 60 cents a quart?" 
</P>
<P>
 Upon stating the word ben-zo-ate , he feigns choking, draws a few laughs, and 
quickly spins yet another magic mound of hash browns. Quickly the clean white 
countertop before Hill crowds with vegetable peaks, a psychedelic topography of 
color and texture. 
</P>
<P>
 His Socratic provocations complete after the six-minute pitch, Salsa Hill 
looks up over his horn-rimmed glasses, lowers his voice and says, "The first 
three $20 dollar bills I see, I pay the tax." 
</P>
<P>
 People sprout money from fists. They carry bills before them like candles in a 
procession. Hill smiles and politely thanks every last one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things aren't going nearly as well across the way. Hill's immediate neighbor 
is a Corian purveyor named GW Surfaces. GW's two company representatives spend 
their time customer-less and watching Hill's show. One of them has purchased a 
Quick Chopper. "I don't even cook," she tells a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like that all up and down the line at this show, a patchwork of vendors 
who believe they sell the goods and services necessary to The Better Life. In 
this, the largest of the three main buildings, consider the lineup around Salsa 
Hill: 
</P>
<P>
 Dynasty Oriental Rugs, Dura Loc Metal Roof Systems, Gem Care Products, 
Eurotech Kitchens, ADT Security, Heritage Fine Art Gallery, Woodshed Plus, 
Betta Creations (fish in jars with a salesman who says, "Yeah, they take their 
air from the surface, not some aerator pump"), FHP Healthcare Senior Plan, 
Electro-Gun Termite Control, Pacific Aire, Linoleum & Carpet City, Refinishing 
Clinic, FHA Title 1 loans, Everything Under $15, Schlossadler Wines, Toilet 
Seat Reminder, Cabinet Savers, Regency Carpet Cleaners, Vari Pulse Jet Spray 
(jewelry cleaning), VS Alarms, Rainbow Water Washed Air, Hippo Waterbed Co., 
Smart Products, American Cemwood Corp., Gold Coast Garage Door, John Thomas 
Shutters, Martin Steel Garage Door, Cellular One, Closets to Go, 
Laughlin/Bullhead City, Gourmet Water Systems, Quick 'N Brite, Tallon Termite & 
Pest ("We Freeze Their Buns Off"), Attic Access, Broadway Custom Shutters, ADS 
Financial Services, Dennert Garage Door, Closet Crafters, Milgard Windows, 
Robin's Nest Knitting Center, Racer's Edge Teflon Polymer Auto Polish, Pacific 
Water Conditioning, Top to Bottom Awnings, Table Charm, All Stars' Dips & 
Spreads, Steve's Plumbing, Kitchen Places & Spaces, Bibbo's Gallery, Holly's 
Enterprises (foot massagers), Dragonchuck Alarm Systems, Catalina Spas, RCA DSS 
Direct Dish TV, Mr. Build/Ace Awning, Micro Miracle Steamer, Bath Crest Tub 
Restoring, Kirby Tech-Driven Vacuum, Henderson Windows, The Closet Factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Some do, in fact, draw knots of people with genuine interest. Smart Products, 
whose booth featured a girl dancing with a sponge mop, was selling mops rather 
briskly. And Micro Miracle Steamer fascinated those who have long suffered hard 
spots in their microwave spuds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Micro Miracle, which makes steam-emitting plates for cooking within the 
microwave, had to be on guard. A sign placed on the food display counter said, 
"Please Do Not Eat This Food." John Ryan, Micro Miracle's salesman, said, 
"People come by when I'm not looking, open the dish and take the piece of 
chicken away. This crap sits here for three days. Are they crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa Hill faces no such problems. He's got things set up so that people watch 
his show as much as learn about a product and sample salsa. He's an 
entertainment pro first, widget salesman second. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not by accident. Hill has long followed people and strapped a meter to 
certain of their urges. He made half a million dollars in 1967, when he and 
partners produced the soft-core 3-D film "Stewardesses." He parlayed that into 
a nightclub business in Los Angeles. Which led, through a series of turns, to a 
carnival business in Marin County. That went sour in a liability case, but Sean 
(Salsa) Hill remains a man who was married on his own Ferris wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 People who eat the salsa don't know that, of course. It doesn't matter. Hill's 
a riot. And his salsa's as bracing as the man.

FOR THE KIDS; GIANT RATS, LIVE BATS AND OTHER SPOOKY STUFF; COUNTY'S HALLOWEEN 
OFFERINGS RANGE FROM YOUTH GROUP'S SHOW AT THOUSAND OAKS' ARTS COUNCIL CENTER

 What's Halloween without a little dripping blood, vampires, a mad scientist 
and a man-eating rat or two? 
</P>
<P>
 If it all sounds delightful to your kids, bring them to the Arts Council 
Center in Thousand Oaks this weekend for the Young Artists Ensemble's Halloween 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth group has taken over the center and turned it into "The Haunted 
Center." But it's much more than just a haunted house. The kids put on a show 
that takes the audience on a horror-filled walking tour through the old Janss 
home that now serves as the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows run nightly beginning Friday and end on Halloween. Tickets are $7. 
The shows are fund-raisers for the ensemble's children's theater productions, 
now in their 10th season. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third year the group has served up the ghoulish offering. Last 
year's shows sold out, and some performances this year already are filled, 
according to director Mark Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is made up of three 12-minute mini-plays set in three rooms, along 
with three-minute skits in seven of the house's rooms. The performers are 13 to 
19 years old. After the audience has walked its way through the rooms, they are 
treated to a 25-minute comedy-horror show in the courtyard. It all takes about 
90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 What are some of the sights on this spook-filled tour? The stops include: The 
House of Wax, where Madame Facade introduces a few lifelike characters like 
Lizzy Borden of ax fame; The Giant Rat of Sumatra, which sends Sherlock Holmes 
and his buddy on a ghoulish hunt; The Tell Tale Heart, a takeoff on Poe's 
heart-throbbing tale, and Graverobbers of the Living Dead, who tangle with 
flesh-eating zombies. The finale in the courtyard features a mad scientist 
intent on breathing life into some sort of creature. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not an in-your-face kind of happening where spooks jump out and yell 
boo at the audience, according to Reyes. But because of its horrifying nature, 
he doesn't recommend it for impressionable children. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger kids can get a toned-down version of The Haunted Center at "The Creepy 
Courtyard," another Halloween offering by younger members of the ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's junior production is called "The Witch Academy," a spooky comedy 
by Reyes and directed by Holly Anne Holst. The performers are 10 to 14 years 
old. The mini-tour is offered Saturday and Sunday afternoon, with three 
performances each day. Tickets are $4. Children may come in costume and receive 
treats from the cast during the performance. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For a truly scary experience, there's the Ventura Jaycees' Factory of Terror 
at the Ventura County Fairgrounds. This is the 20th year the Jaycees have put 
together the ultimate haunted house. It's in the 6,500-square-foot livestock 
building, where nine horror-filled rooms and two confusing mazes will please 
the fearless. 
</P>

EARTHWATCH: IT TOOK MANY SPIRITS TO MAKE UP HALLOWEEN; TODAY, SOME THINKERS ARE 
LINKING THE ANCIENT LORE OF THE CELEBRATION TO MODERN EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE 
PLANET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging from my in-box, it must be Halloween season, election time or both, if 
there is a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 I got to thinking about Halloween. These days you see pumpkins all over the 
place -- acres and acres. Didn't Halloween used to be a harvest festival? 
Thanksgiving for Druids or some kind of earth festival? 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it turns out to have been a pagan new year's day, plus ancestors' 
day. Many cultures, in fact, have chosen the end of October to celebrate the 
onset of winter. Halloween, is actually a sort of universal holiday that has 
historically been co-opted and sanctified by most religious groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you are an ardent environmentalist or not, you're celebrating Pomona, 
the Roman goddess of fruit and trees, when you bob for apples at this time of 
year. When you traipse around the neighborhood with your trick-or-treating 
kids, you're following in the spiritual footsteps of ancient Celts who honored 
a god, Muck Olla in this same way. It caught on in this country when Irish and 
Scottish immigrants brought the custom with them. Country folks moved to the 
city and used it as a way to get acquainted with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 These ecumenical and neighborly feelings are of recent vintage, though. But 
some old tensions persist. Technically, were looking at a celebration -- 
originally called All Hallow e'en -- that falls on the eve of All Saints' Day, 
Nov. 1, which was placed at that time of year because the unchurched persisted 
in having their religious observances at the very end of October. 
</P>
<P>
 This melding of the pagan and the monotheistic still bothers some traditional 
Judeo-Christian communicants, who feel it smacks of sorcery and witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-superstitious American thinkers have, nevertheless, been coming up with 
ideas that unite spiritual feelings, including planetary consciousness, with 
modern science. Pounding away on the part of their computer keyboard that has 
letters rather than numbers, some Nobel laureates, working-stiff physicists and 
an Anglican priest have produced some dazzling exercises in scientific 
speculation for us to contemplate this All Hallow e'en. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Physics of Immortality: Modern Cosmology, God and the Resurrection of the 
Dead," by F.J. Tipler from Doubleday; "Evidence of Purpose: Scientists Discover 
the Creator," an anthology published by Continuum; and "The Faith of a 
Physicist: Reflections of a Bottom-Up Thinker" by John Polkinghorne from 
Princeton University Press all look at old faiths in a new way. 
</P>
<P>
 For readers uncomfortable with the linking of science and religion -- rather 
as paganism and monotheism have gotten together for this weekend's holiday -- 
it might be helpful to reflect on an old saw from the world of science: "If a 
little science takes one away from God, a great deal of science brings one back 
to Him." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking all this a step beyond Halloween, there is even a new book out entitled 
"Spiritual Politics: Changing the World From the Inside Out," by Gordon 
Davidson and Corinne McLaughlin. It takes on some Big Questions we'll all be 
facing next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the election the authors will be conducting a seminar in Ojai. 
Their theme is planetary stewardship, with lots of emphasis on the very earthy 
matter of business and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as though the old Druid priests are back, trying to reconnect modern 
people to the earth using the ancient church's idea of making common cause with 
one another. Their goal is to approach the secular business and political 
community and raise their planetary consciousness. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information on the Nov. 8 presentation by the authors of "Spiritual 
Politics: Changing the World From The Inside Out," Gordon Davidson and Corinne 
McLaughin, call The Meditation Group in Ojai 646-5508.

 * READ: Copies of the book published by Ballantine Paperbacks at $12.95 are 
available at local bookstores.

FASHION; IN HALLOWEEN MASKS, NIXON'S THE ONE; MARILYN, HILLARY NEXT; BILL

 When it comes to Halloween fashion, we feel pretty efficient. We always manage 
to come up with something around the house that serves to transport us away 
from our mundane persona of journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Although someday it might be fun to party as a journalist -- wearing a copy of 
the First Amendment, say, with a huge pair of shears around our neck to 
symbolize the editorial process. 
</P>
<P>
 But we have long taken a prosaic approach to costume parties -- often choosing 
to be a generic household object, such as a pillow. It avoids trying to find a 
hero worth copying -- although it doesn't exactly bring down the house when we 
walk in, either. 
</P>
<P>
 One year we went to the trouble to be a grandfather clock. 
</P>
<P>
 We wore a tall electronics carton with a big clock face painted in the chest 
region and a round opening for black-gloved arms to indicate the time, plus a 
tiny slit at the top for visibility -- which proved to be inadequate. We 
crashed into furniture, stairs and our host and had to abandon the costume to 
preserve our dignity, and possibly our life. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was a successful costume, and cost nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people don't look at costuming in this way. By and large, they want 
an identity beyond furniture. And many of them wish to be celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 But not many celebrities make it to mask status. Possibly because of lawsuits, 
but also because fame is fleeting -- except for the classics. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few personalities whose popularity never fades; year after year, 
their masks are in demand. The most dependable classic, it turns out, has been 
out of the limelight for decades: Richard Nixon. But, if you haven't already 
chosen him for your identity, you may miss the wave. Each location had sold 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always been a wonderful mask," said Bonnie Mihalic, who owns Bonnie's in 
Ventura and Oxnard. "He's so easy. All you do is put on the mask and put your 
fingers up in a V and you've got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Show business mask options include old favorites Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, James 
Dean -- whose mask looks about as much like him as Bart Simpson -- and a new 
addition: Whoopi Goldberg. The Goldberg mask goes well because people like to 
team it with a nun costume, Mihalic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-most popular celebrity locally after Nixon appears to be either 
Marilyn Monroe or Hillary Clinton, depending on whom you ask. And close behind 
them is Bill Clinton, particularly if there is a saxophone prop to go with the 
mask. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween Adventure in Thousand Oaks had five Bill Clintons to choose from, 
ranging from bargain to deluxe, while its Ventura store had only two. 
</P>
<P>
 The two stores are stocked according to demand, and demand for political 
figures is apparently much greater in the east county. The only politicians in 
the west county store were the Clintons and the Bushes, while the east side had 
a range of state figures, from Al Gore to Boris Yeltsin and Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 At Magic Planet, also in Thousand Oaks, Reagan masks were reported to be hot, 
while at Bonnie's on the west side, they were totally flat, and those available 
were actually leftovers from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Gore was low on the charts in all areas, and Dan Quayle requests were 
virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in between a hot property and obscurity is Ross Perot. In spite of 
never having held political office, the Texan has inspired several masks, and a 
fair number of Ventura County shoppers do want to look like him, for whatever 
reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we make no political assumptions from any of this data; and neither 
should you.

</P>
<P>
 The Mission Valley League said that larger enrollments at schools in the other 
leagues would make competition unfair.

winning ways Saturday after suffering defeats last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Citrus College (2-3-1), which had its two-game winning streak ended in a 53-21 
Foothill Conference loss to Grossmont, plays host to Mt. SAC. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena (2-3-1), which lost to San Diego Mesa, 39-28, last week, travels to

Conference victory over PCC on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties, who finished 2-17 last season, are led by sophomore middle 
blocker Robin Sebric and freshman Maria Dennis, who is from St. Petersburg, 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a nightmare," said Ward, who coached in the early 1980s at 
Walnut High. "I wasn't named to the position until late and we didn't get a 
chance to recruit like we would have liked. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're developing a good, strong program now." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena, led by sisters Mary and Paula Morgan, was unbeaten before defeats to 
Cerritos and Mt. SAC last week. Coach Lori Jepsen's team entered the week 11-2.

JAUNTS; TOP GUNS FACE OFF IN TEST OF AIM, GRIT -- AND BALLOONS; SOME OF THE 
QUICKEST GUNSLINGERS AROUND WILL GATHER AT OJAI'S LAKE CASITAS FOR THE WESTERN 
STATES FAST DRAW CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A quarter of a second. The blink of an eye. That's how long it takes today's 
competitive gunslinger to draw his gun, cock it, aim and fire fast enough to 
most likely whip the top guns of Wyatt Earp's day. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport of quick-draw shooting is flourishing, and some of the fastest guns 
around will gather at Ojai's Lake Casitas this weekend for the Western States 
Fast Draw Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the American Country Celebration, a two-day ode to the Old 
West and other periods in history. Modern-day cowboys will perform gunfighting 
stunts and compete in gunfighting skits. The shore of the lake will be 
transformed into encampments of authentically costumed fur traders, mountain 
men, soldiers, cowboys -- even pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition will give fast-draw pros a shot at $2,500 in prize money and a 
chance to qualify for the World Championships next month at the Roy Rogers 
Museum in Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
 When these gunslingers face off, it's not at all like the famous gunfight at 
the O.K. Corral. First, they don't use real bullets. Second, they don't shoot 
at each other. Their fearless foe is usually a small balloon they must pop in a 
fraction of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for the shooters, it's a tense moment. "I'm a bowl of jelly," confessed 
Tom Wentz, a competition organizer and teacher of the fast-draw sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained how it works. The competitor waits for a light to go on, 
signaling him to draw his gun and fire. The light, timed randomly between two 
and five seconds, kicks on a timer that stops when the target is hit from 
varying distances of up to 15 feet. The world record is .207 second -- just 
about a fifth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunfighters are coming from as far away as Deadwood, S.D., for this 
weekend's competition, Wentz said. They'll be duded up in western attire and 
will wield modern-day revolvers, most likely the Ruger .357 Magnum with a 
.45-caliber barrel. The newer guns are lighter and the holsters of today slide 
more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's top guns would easily outshoot those of yesteryear, Wentz believes. 
"They didn't practice that much," he said, "and their guns were difficult to 
cock fast and hit accurately." 
</P>
<P>
 The sport of fast draw boomed during the late 1950s and early 1960s when 
television Westerns were hot. At that time, there were 10,000 shooters in the 
United States. It was a hobby for celebrities like Clint Eastwood. But the 
numbers dwindled to about a thousand in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot hung up their guns," Wentz said. Today, there are about 500 shooters 
worldwide -- many in Japan -- who belong to fast-draw organizations. But those 
numbers are now growing because of a flurry of recent Western movies like 
"Tombstone." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend competition won't be all serious shooting. The gunfighters will 
also compete in the "Shootout at Lake Casitas," a quick-draw test that might 
find them shooting from a card table or at the bar. And wanna-be gunslingers 
can test their own quick-draw reflexes at a special booth. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne impersonator Ermil Williamson will perform his one-man show on both 
days at noon, and rodeo legend Montie Montana, 84, will do rope tricks and sign 
copies of his book, "Not Without My Horse!" The 15-member Ghost Town Drifters 
from Vacaville will stage shootouts and do stunt falls from a 14-foot water 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Country-music bands will perform from two stages on both days, and anyone who 
wants to learn line dancing can pick up a few tips. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: American Country Celebration 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Lake Casitas, near Ojai 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to dusk 
</P>

Westmont College, not with the Westmont Classical Repertory Theatre production 
of "The Art of Dining Out" opening tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 This comedy centers around a couple who has just purchased a small, elegant 
restaurant. While the husband tries to build up the clientele, the wife is busy 
preparing gourmet meals -- something she actually will do on stage. The cast of 
nine includes seven diners, all of whom will be consuming the food in front of 
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Art of Dining Out" is co-produced by Chad's Restaurant and Jordano's 
Marketplace, with the staff of Chad's providing the food and training the chefs 
and diners. The play will run tonight through Saturday and Nov. 3-5. Show time 
is 8 p.m., with 2 p.m. matinees on both Saturdays. Tickets are $9 (general), $6 
(students and seniors). Call 565-7040. Westmont is located at 955 La Paz Road.

 Mariachi Lo Camperos de Nati Cano, the Los Angeles-based ensemble that has 
helped revive mariachi music and is touring with Linda Ronstadt, will perform 
at UC Santa Barbara's Campbell Hall tonight at 8 p.m. General admission is $12 
and $16. Call 893-3535. 
</P>

<P>
 For another musical option, don't forget Kenny G, who is expected to perform 
tonight at the Santa Barbara Bowl -- assuming he doesn't cancel, as the last 
three scheduled bowl acts have. Show time is 7 p.m. Tickets are $40.50, $35.50, 
and $30.50. Call 568-BOWL or 583-8700. The Bowl is located at 1122 N. Milpas

 Santa Barbara's Access Theatre, starring a cast of local high school students, 
will present "Stix and Stonz," tonight and Friday at the Center Stage Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-act play centers on eight students representing an ethnic and social 
mix who end up locked in a room together and have to confront their differences 
and learn to accept one another. The production toured Santa Barbara schools 
last spring and is doing so again this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Show time is 8 p.m. both nights. Tickets are $7 (general), $5 (students and 
children under age 12 -- though the play is not recommended for those under age 
13 due to "strong language"). Call 963-0408. The theater is located on the 
second level of the Paseo Nuevo shopping center.

 Imagine watching actor William Devane and former Monkee Mickey Dolenz battle 
it out on the polo field? A little surreal, perhaps, but they will be two of 
the celebrities involved, Saturday in a Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera benefit 
dubbed "An Afternoon of Polo and Other Pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
 Those other pleasures will include lunch prepared by Chef Michael Hutchings 
and entertainment provided by civic members. There will also be a fashion show 
and auction. It will all take place at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club, 
3375 Foothill Road in Carpinteria, from 11 a.m.-3:30 p.m. Tickets are $125. 
Call 962-1922.

<P>
 On Saturday, it's the popular "Black and Orange Ball," now in its fourth year,

MUSIC; JAMES HARMAN MAKES A LIFE OF THE BLUES, 'MUSIC OF THE PEOPLE'; THE 
ALMOST-ALWAYS- ON-THE-GO MUSICIAN'S FIRST RECORDS OF THE 1960S ARE NOW WORTH 
MORE MONEY THAN HE EVER MADE FROM THEM.

 Huntington Beach finheads are as territorial as other locals when it comes to 
putting bumps on surfers with a different ZIP code. Don't blame James Harman, 
who's lived in Huntington Beach since 1970 and never ever hogged anybody's 
wave. He plays the blues. He doesn't give them. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-dressed harmonica player and "those dangerous gentlemens" in his band 
will be making their Underground debut in Santa Barbara on Friday, across from 
the X Files. Harman talked things over recently by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cards On The Table" is doing OK? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yeah, it's great. I'm gonna take out the trash as soon as I get done with 
you. Black Top is a good label and everybody is really nice, but I'm not sure 
they have the distribution to get me to the next plateau. But I'm happy. I've 
been doing this for 32 years, just telling my stories. 
</P>
<P>
 So you've lived on the beach for a long time. Is there any danger of your 
taking up surfing or learning any surf songs? 
</P>
<P>
 I never have and I never will do any beach music. I've lived in Huntington 
Beach since 1970, and I've never set foot on the pier, probably never will. I 
live close to the beach, but I have skin cancer and I don't go outside unless 
I'm covered up. It's too expensive to live here, but if you live in a really 
beautiful place, there's always winters, and I can't do that again. Here you 
can play all winter long. The worst thing that happened to me here is that I 
got hit in the head with a Frisbee in the park. Here in Orange County, we have 
drive-by swearings, that's about it. 
</P>
<P>
 So how's that endless road trip going? 
</P>
<P>
 We've cut it back to about 250 gigs per year. Those rock stars can make an 
album, tour for a year, then take three years off, but they have the big 
publicity campaign with a lot of power and hype behind them. It's a 
double-edged sword -- out of sight, out of mind. Then again, absence makes the 
heart grow fonder. Plus those rock stars can afford it. I can't, so I have to 
get around every year. My dream is to have a Cadillac, three blondes and dress 
like a pimp. 
</P>
<P>
 What was your background growing up in Alabama? 
</P>
<P>
 I started out in the church choir, and all my family were musicians. I started 
playing the piano when I was 4, plus I had about 30 aunts and uncles that 
plucked, picked or pulled something. So, I really didn't have many options. We 
were really just a bunch of Appalachian hillbillies. I remember turning the 
dial of that big ol' Philco radio and discovering Howlin' Wolf and Sonny Boy 
Williamson. That changed my life. When I was 16, I started working on a 
mustache, and I got into the places to see all the great black guys that are 
dead now. They used to say, "Look at that little white kid that sings like a 
man." I cut my first record in 1962 and started touring in 1964. Those first 
nine singles -- all on little Southern labels -- are pretty hard to find now. I 
see them mostly in Europe when people want them autographed. They tell me they 
paid 75 bucks for one. I never made that much off of them. 
</P>
<P>
 No MTV and no radio, but the blues is doing all right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the biggest problem with the blues is that I'm afraid it's becoming a 
fad, just like the urban cowboys were in the '70s. Then, it'll be on to the 
next -- World War I soldiers, pirates, whatever. I'm in this thing for life. I 
ain't no Eric Clapton, doing my blues album. This is my being, my entire heart 
and soul. I'm very disheartened to see two kinds of opening acts. One, the 
Blues Brothers, or two, a rock band that couldn't make any money, then became a 
Delta Blues band. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the blues gets too big, that's bad? 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, there's a B.B. King's and House of Blues everywhere, and I'm afraid 
they're going to kill all the little clubs. Don't get me wrong, the House of 
Blues is cool, nice stage, nice dressing room and all that, so I'm not 
complaining. But when I call up some of these smaller blues places, they say 
"James Harman, man, we can't afford to pay you; you'd never play here." But I 
don't mind playing for 50 people -- I can sell them a CD, a tape, or a shirt 
and they'll go home and tell five more people. Or else I get owners who want me 
to send them a tape. 
</P>
<P>
 You've played Santa Barbara, what, a million times? 
</P>
<P>
 I've played everywhere on that street (State) that has electricity. I think 
it's sort of a hip, groovy place, but all the money's up on the hill and they 
spend it on opera or something. People that come to see me ride bicycles and 
don't have any money. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere you haven't been? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I'd like to go to Antarctica. I'd kind of like to go to Russia. I've 
been to Finland, but never to Russia. You can't take any money out of Russia, 
and I don't want no fur; they don't have nothin' I want, but I'd just like to 
go sometime. 
</P>
<P>
 Has your vision of hell changed? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. It's still a bunch of hippies sitting around smoking dope -- with 
tapestries on the walls and those beaded things in the doorways -- and 
listening to Country Joe and the Fish. 
</P>
<P>
 What's James Harman's brand of blues? 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for realizing that there is a brand of James Harman blues. Well, 
blues used to have a regional identity. If you were from the East Coast, it 
sounded that way. But now it's all getting gray. I do whatever I like, sort of 
a Mississippi goes to Chicago, Deep South goes to New York and Texas goes to 
the West Coast blues. I'm not teaching a lesson. All you have to do is be alive 
-- the human condition is what I'm talking about. It's the end of the week, and 
you want to party. Blues is the music of the people. It's honest, and I'm just 
having a good time. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; HUNAN BOASTS AN ARRAY OF SAUCY DISHES; CHEF TUNG-CHUN LIN 
ADDS PIQUANT FLAVORINGS TO A VARIETY OF LAMB, CHICKEN AND SEAFOOD CHOICES. 
</P>

<P>
 The Chinese are obsessed with good food, which is very fortunate for those of 
us devoted to Oriental cooking. Even a fortune cookie reports: "A man cannot be 
too serious about his eating." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons for my Chinese-food passion is its sheer variety, coming 
from the diverse culinary styles tied to each of China's vast geographical 
regions. In southeastern China is the province of Hunan, reputed to serve the 
lustiest-flavored cuisine of all. If you've never tried this tasty food, I 
suggest you visit China or drop into Hunan, an inconspicuous spot near a Ralphs 
supermarket in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the 6-year-old restaurant is much larger than it initially appears, 
with ample booths, walls accented with modern mirrored tiles, well-spaced 
tables and plants hanging from ceiling fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef-owner Tung-Chun Lin, who is 37 and comes from Taiwan, has been cooking 
professionally since he was 13. I remember sampling his cuisine in the early 
'70s when he was one of the highly acclaimed chefs at the Hunan Restaurant in 
Manhattan. Chef Lin is also a culinary artist who arranges and garnishes every 
dish to look like edible art. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to begin with chicken sizzling rice soup ($6.25 for four) in which the 
toasted rice really snaps, crackles and pops beneath a pouring of chicken- and 
vegetable-laced broth. A nice foil to the soup is an appetizer of shredded 
chicken in assorted flavors ($4.95) with cold chicken and cucumber strips in a 
peanut, sesame and chili sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Because lamb is a specialty of the Hunan repertory, I highly recommend the 
earthy Mongolian lamb ($8.95), which is cooked with green onions in a sauce 
that's fragrant with star anise. General Ching's chicken ($8.25), billed as 
chicken in a tingling hot sauce, turns out to be way too mild and an insult to 
that ancient general who led the Hunan army. An order of lemon chicken ($8.25) 
is disappointing due to a cloyingly sweet sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 A much better option is the sesame chicken ($8.25), with crisply fried 
sesame-covered chunks of chicken tossed in a sauce that's simultaneously spicy 
and tart. If you're a duck fancier, I suggest the tea-smoked duck ($9.95), 
which is served in the style of Peking duck. I fill a delicate rice pancake 
with the dusky-flavored meat, add some piquant prawn sauce and roll it into a 
very sophisticated-tasting burrito. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Hunan is landlocked, it contains enough rivers and lakes for its 
cooks to have become adept at fine fish preparations, such as the rock cod 
filet ($10.95) sauteed with green pepper and onion in a smooth black bean 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Lin shows inspiration with such seafood dishes as Gan-Shao lobster, 
succulent pieces of lobster bathed in a sherry-based sauce filled with ginger, 
garlic and chilies ($14.95); deep-fried scallops in a biting preserved orange 
sauce ($10.95); and spicy scallops and shrimp in a crunchy mixture of shredded 
black mushrooms, bamboo and water chestnuts ($11.75). 
</P>
<P>
 The most unusual dish on the entire menu and probably a first for Ventura 
County is simply called "shrimp in crispy brown bean sauce" ($11.75). Large 
stir-fried shrimp are served in a celestial sauce of garlic, wine, ginger and 
star anise and topped with the most delicious and crunchy fried azuki beans 
I've ever sampled. Bravo! 
</P>
<P>
 On the meat side of the menu, I like the curried beef ($7.95) in an unstinting 
hot sauce rich in turmeric and ginger, twice-cooked pork ($7.55) with shredded 
cabbage and mushrooms, and sliced pork sauteed with zucchini ($7.55) in a rich 
brown sauce. Bean curd country-style ($6.95) combines slivers of pork with 
green beans ($7.55), fried string beans with minced, pork, preserved turnips 
and dried shrimp in a tantalizing mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetarians can do extremely well here by ordering tangy pepper and salt 
mushrooms ($5.95), wonderful sweet-and-sour eggplant ($7.55), sauteed Chinese 
baby greens ($6.25) in a soy-based topping and Chinese broccoli ($6.25) in a 
tangy oyster sauce. An order of rice noodles with vegetables ($5.55) is so 
bland, however, that I plea-bargained my waiter into adding extra chilies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh melon ($1.95) or canned litchis ($1.50) are offered as desserts; I 
prefer instead to finish my tea, and head over to Ralphs for a pint of Ben & 
Jerry's Cherry Garcia to consume in my car on the way home. Details

 Giovanni's Restaurant in Camarillo last week presented a revised menu that 
includes a new brodetto di pesce (a bouillabaisse-type dish served with pasta) 
and an upgrade of its nightly five-course gourmet specials. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Giovanni Tromba offered a couple of samplings: Tuesday night's five 
courser consists of salad, a half-portion of the pasta of the day, and a veal 
chop stuffed with prosciutto and fontina cheese in a reduction of Cabernet 
Sauvignon. On Wednesday night, it's Caesar salad, pasta, and a whole, grilled, 
boneless Iowa corn-fed chicken, marinated in herbs and served with roasted 
garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned for details on a planned Dec. 12 champagne dinner at the 
establishment. Giovanni's is located at 5227 Mission Oaks Blvd.

 About 40 people turned out for chef Louis Ludwig's winemaker's dinner last 
Saturday at Ventura's Pierpont Inn. The Fall Harvest Winemaker Dinner & Dance 
paired Ludwig's creations with wines from Zaca Mesa Vineyards in Los Olivos. 
Judging by the applause following the last course -- a chocolate-covered, 
hazelnut mousse-filled pear -- the evening was a success. The Pierpont's next 
scheduled wine (actually champagne) dinner is scheduled for New Year's Eve. 
Ludwig said to look for pheasant and alligator on the menu.

 The Santa Ynez Winery Tasting Room opens its Ventura outlet this weekend. The 
grand opening will include events Friday for the local dignitaries and Chamber 
of Commerce members, and Saturday (noon to 7:30 p.m.) and Sunday (noon to 6 
p.m.) for the regular folk. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the winery's fourth tasting room, but the first outside Santa Barbara 
County. It is located at 1591 Spinnaker Drive (upstairs at what was formerly 
Berto's Ristorante). 
</P>
<P>
 Call 644-WINE for more information.

</P>
<P>
 And next door to the wine tasting room, at the Greek at the Harbor restaurant, 
Tuesday nights will now be Folkdance Fun Nights. Beginning Tuesday, the Haverim 
Dancers of Ventura -- a group open to dancers of all levels of ability -- will 
gather for some authentic dancing. The public is welcome to join in. For more 
information, call group leader Ann Taylor at 643-2886. The Greek is located at 
1503 Spinnaker Drive.

5 SOUTHLAND LOCALS SECEDE FROM TEAMSTERS COUNCIL; UNION: OFFICERS OF THEIR 
NEWLY CREATED JOINT COUNCIL WILL BE INDUCTED TODAY AT LOCAL 952'S ORANGE 
HEADQUARTERS. 
</P>

 Reflecting lingering divisions in the Teamsters Union since national President 
Ron Carey began a reform movement three years ago, five Southland locals have 
seceded from Teamsters Joint Council 42 in Los Angeles, stripping the longtime 
West Coast power base of 32,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The secession is being challenged in court by Mike Riley, head of Joint 
Council 42 and an opponent of Carey. But Riley's effort to obtain a preliminary 
injunction to block the move was denied Wednesday by a federal judge in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by U.S. District Judge William J. Rea clears the way for the five 
Southland Teamsters locals, plus two others in Central California, to operate 
under a new joint council. Earlier this month, Carey's Administration in 
Washington approved the secession and issued a new charter for Joint Council 
92, one of dozens of regional groupings of Teamsters locals. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Carey is scheduled to induct officers of the new joint council at a 
meeting at the Orange headquarters of Local 952, one of the seceding groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we can bring better service to the membership at a lesser cost than 
Joint Council 42," said Ed J. Mireles, head of Local 952, the 15,000-member 
local that led the effort to establish a new joint council. Mireles, who will 
be president of Joint Council 92, said that Riley "has not lived up to his 
duties and obligations as joint council president." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who has been president of Joint Council 42 for 16 years, ran against 
Carey in 1991 and has been critical of Carey's actions, including his recent 
move to dismantle the union's four regional conferences, which were umbrella 
groups of joint councils. Riley was head of the Western Conference of 
Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Riley blamed Carey for the defection of the locals, saying that 
Carey is trying to stifle dissent in the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is encouraging these locals to make this move to weaken the joint 
council," Riley said. "It is pure retaliation, pure intimidation," he alleged, 
adding that he will pursue his lawsuit to reverse the secession. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. His 
spokesman in Washington, as well as leaders of the new joint council, said that 
the secession is not politically motivated but reflects members' 
dissatisfaction with Joint Council 42's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the defections, Riley's Joint Council 42 remains formidable, with 
about 95,000 members from two dozen locals. Nationwide, the Teamsters Union has 
1.4 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the secession is a blow to Riley's power base and will probably hurt 
his budget as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Joint Council 42 now charges each of its affiliated locals $1.56 per member 
per month. The fees go to pay for staffing and union activities such as 
lobbying, organizing and bargaining on behalf of the members. With the loss of 
32,000 members, the joint council's operating budget has been clipped by 
$50,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Riley said, he will lay off five of the 13 employees at the joint 
council. In addition, he said, there will most likely be salary cuts for the 
remaining workers, including himself. Last year, Riley received about $81,000 
as president of the joint council. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, 60, also drew a salary of $187,876 for his role as president of the 
Western Conference, which was abolished in June. Union records show that Riley 
also received $29,000 last year as president of Local 986. Altogether, he 
earned more than $300,000 last year in his various posts -- making him the 
top-paid Teamster in the nation, with double the salary of Carey. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, a maverick New York union leader who took over the nation's largest 
union in a government-supervised election three years ago, has taken steps to 
cut salaries as part of his reforms.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been crying for years that the Teamsters need to be more responsive and 
less bureaucratic," said Ward Allen, head of Bakersfield-based Local 87, which 
is part of the new joint council. The other members are Local 572 in Carson, 
Local 63 in Rialto, Local 208 in El Monte, Local 578 in Los Angeles and Local 
517 in Visalia.

TORONTO FIRM TO ACQUIRE DIEDRICH COFFEE; MERGER: THE O.C. CHAIN WILL BE 
COMBINED WITH SMALLER ARIZONA-BASED COFFEE PLANTATION. MORE STORES ARE PLANNED. 
</P>

<P>
 As part of a push into the Southwest, Canada's largest chain of gourmet 
coffeehouses agreed Wednesday to acquire Orange County's Diedrich Coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Cup Ltd., a Toronto-area franchiser of 200 Canadian coffeehouses, said 
it will pay an estimated $5.5 million in cash and stock to merge Diedrich with 
its first U.S. acquisition: the five-store Coffee Plantation chain that serves 
the Phoenix area. 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich was founded by Carl Diedrich, a German-born Guatemala coffee grower 
who came to the United States in 1972. The company opened its first coffeehouse 
that same year in Costa Mesa to augment its gourmet coffee bean retailing 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich expanded into gourmet coffee shops in the mid-1980s and has added 
seven stores since then. Its latest shop, which opened earlier this month, is 
an espresso bar in the lobby of Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bregman, Second Cup's chairman and chief executive officer, said the 
combined Diedrich-Coffee Plantation operation expects to open about a dozen 
more stores in California, Texas and Arizona by June and at least 20 more in 
the southwestern United States by mid-1996. The stores will keep the Diedrich 
and Coffee Plantation names. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal with Diedrich, expected to close next month, keeps Second Cup firmly 
in place as North America's second-largest gourmet coffee chain behind 
Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee Inc., which has nearly 450 stores across the 
United States and in some Canadian markets, including Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly in the past five years, both aging baby boomers and their 
twentysomething offspring have begun frequenting so-called coffee bars for both 
the specially blended beverages and the ambience. The increasing popularity of 
gourmet coffeehouses, in fact, has turned the industry into one of the fastest 
growing in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly traded Starbucks, for example, will sell about $200 million worth of 
coffee drinks, coffee beans and accouterments this year, up from $165 million 
in its fiscal 1993. The company began selling its stock to the public in June, 
1992, at $10.75 a share. In Wednesday's trading on the Nasdaq market, the stock 
closed at $25 a share, up 62 1/2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Cup reported revenue of $64.5 million for its latest fiscal year. The 
18-year-old company's stock, traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, has been 
selling recently in a range of $5.25 to $5.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be about 10,000 gourmet coffeehouses in the United States by 1999, 
according to projections by the Specialty Coffee Assn. of America, a trade 
group. That is up astronomically from only 200 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Starbucks officials would not comment Wednesday on Second Cup's strategy to 
expand in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Bregman, however, said his company doesn't consider Starbucks' presence in 
most major U.S. markets to be a significant challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an immature industry, and the competition comes from a lot of small 
operations. And, frankly, it has been rare so far for the presence of a 
competitor nearby to affect our sales," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a huge potential for growth as coffee drinkers become more 
discriminating," he said. "And as the market becomes more and more crowded, the 
prize will go to those who keep their customers completely satisfied. And you 
don't have to be a giant chain to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bregman said Second Cup views the U.S. Southwest as "a tremendous opportunity 
for us to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The company will continue using the Diedrich and Coffee Plantation names 
outside Canada to capitalize on the two chains' reputations, he said, given 
that Second Cup is an unfamiliar name to most U.S. consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich's eight stores are all in Orange County, and the family-owned company 
is reputed to be one of the most profitable coffeehouse operators in the area. 
Its annual sales, however, are modest compared to those of giant Starbucks: 
They have yet to top $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical Diedrich store is about 1,500 square feet and features a wide menu 
of coffee drinks. The coffee is brewed from beans roasted by the company in 
machines built by an Idaho firm owned by a member of the Diedrich family. 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich also sells coffee makers, espresso machines and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The five Coffee Plantation stores are larger, including two super shops of 
more than 3,500 square feet that bring in more than $2 million in annual 
revenue each. Bregman said the stores, which seat up to 300 at a time, have the 
highest volumes in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Both chains are also beginning to experiment with smaller stores suited for 
airports, office lobbies and other places where space is at a premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Lupinacci, chief executive of Diedrich, said the merger of the two 
companies will enable them to share management expertise as they expand. He 
said Diedrich will continue operating its stores under its own name and will 
function as a separate company with headquarters in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Diedrich principals -- Lupinacci and vice presidents Martin Diedrich 
and Don Holly -- also will become vice presidents of the combined operation. 
The company has about 200 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Diedrich is the coffee specialist; Lupinacci, a former Price Waterhouse 
accountant, is the self-described "bean counter." Holly specializes in 
strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupinacci said merger talks began after Second Cup Chairman Bregman wandered 
into a Diedrich shop near the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd been out jogging, and it started raining," Lupinacci said. "So he came 
into the shop to get out of the rain, liked what he saw and tasted, and asked 
the manager to put him in touch with the owners." Merger Brewing 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring Diedrich Coffee would make Canada's Second Cup Ltd. the No. 2 
coffeehouse chain in North America, second only to Starbucks. A look at the two 
companies involved in the merger:

 SECOND CUP LTD. Home office: Toronto Founded: 1976 Number of stores: 205 
Employees: 2,750 Revenue, fiscal 1993: $8.5 million Revenue, fiscal 1994: $15

<P>
 THE DEAL 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar acquisition, Second Cup purchased Arizona-based Coffee Plantation 
in September, 1993, for $5 million to $7 million in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>

FORD SHIFTS INTO HIGH GEAR; COMPANY POSTS RECORD PROFIT; INDUSTRY HEADS FOR ITS 
BEST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ford Motor Co. reported the best third quarter in its history Wednesday and 
said the U.S. auto industry could be in for a prolonged expansion that could 
yield strong sales and profits for several years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, the nation's second-largest car builder, said it made $1.12 billion from 
July through September, compared to $463 million in the third quarter of 1993. 
The strong profit resulted from brisk U.S. vehicle sales, improvement in 
European operations and a strong performance by Ford's financial services arm. 
Quarterly sales totaled $30.6 billion, up from $24.5 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's performance surpassed that of Chrysler Corp., which earlier reported 
earnings of $651 million. Both Ford's and Chrysler's results stood in stark 
contrast to General Motors Corp., whose auto operations lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 Together the Big Three earned $2.3 billion in the third quarter, compared to 
$773 million a year ago. For the year, Detroit auto makers have already earned 
$9.6 billion and appear certain to surpass the industry record of $11.2 billion 
earned in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry's performance over the past two years has been a main driver 
of the nation's economy. And auto industry officials say they are just revving 
up their engines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect the vehicle demand in the U.S. will continue to be healthy," Ford 
Chairman Alex Trotman said. "There should be plenty of life left in this 
cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 With demand for vehicles high, the auto makers have been boosting profits by 
reducing marketing costs. For instance, the average incentive offered consumers 
by Ford was $725 per vehicle, down $135 from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 David McCammon, Ford's treasurer and vice president of finance, predicted 
industry sales will hit 15.5 million this year, up 9% from last year. Barring 
an unexpected sharp increase in interest rates, annual sales could peak at a 
record 16.5 million to 17 million vehicles before the next downturn in the 
economy, McCammon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street recently bid down auto stocks, reacting to GM's poor performance 
and fearing higher interest rates could curb demand. On Wednesday, the Big 
Three were all among the most heavily traded shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Ford shares added 37.5 cents to $29.25 and Chrysler gained 25 cents 
to $47.75. But GM fell 62.5 cents to $40.75. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, GM, the nation's No. 1 auto maker, reported third-quarter earnings 
of $552 million, but that was all attributed to its non-auto operations. Its 
North American auto operations lost $328 million, and its European auto 
earnings fell as well. GM's problems were tied to two strikes, production 
problems and high labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "GM's problems are of its own making and not indicative of problems in the 
industry as a whole," said David Garrity, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson 
in New York. "As long as demand holds up -- and there is every indication it 
will -- auto earnings should continue to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's earnings were a record in a quarter that is typically the weakest 
because of plant shutdowns for vacations, retooling of factories for model 
changes and higher costs for vehicle introductions. Ford earned $1.71 billion 
in the second quarter, its highest three-month profit ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat everybody's expectations," said Nick Lobaccaro, an analyst with 
S.G. Warburg & Co. "They showed good progress all across the board." 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Ford reported its first quarterly profit in five years. It earned 
$25 million, contrasted with a loss of $217 million last year. The company's 
financial services group continued to perform strongly, with earnings of $523 
million, compared to $391 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is undergoing a major reorganization aimed at reducing costs and 
integrating engineering and design operations worldwide. It is also making 
record capital spending on new vehicles, engines and transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
 In its U.S. automotive operations, Ford earned $578 million, up from $333 
million a year ago. It sold nearly 1.1 million cars and trucks, an increase of 
17.5% over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford made a profit of $865 on each vehicle it sold in the third quarter. 
Chrysler earned about $1,000 per vehicle, while GM lost $296 on each. 
</P>
<P>
 GM, which lost nearly $18 billion in North America in the last four years, has 
made great strides in turning around its operations. It has closed inefficient 
plants, laid off workers and wrested savings from suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've run out the string on those things," said David Healy, analyst with 
S. G. Warburg & Co. "The only way to cut costs now is to bring out new models 
that are less complex and costly and easier to produce. But that will take 
time." Comeback for Auto Makers 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by record earnings from Ford Motor in the third quarter, the 
nation's Big Three automakers appear headed for their best year ever in 1994. 
The Big Three automakers made $2.3 billion from July through September, roughly 
triple what they earned in the third quarter of 1993.

TEAMSTERS LOCALS DEFECT TO FORM THEIR OWN DISTRICT; LABOR: A LAWSUIT SEEKING TO 
BLOCK THE MOVE SAYS IT IS DESIGNED TO WEAKEN THE POWERFUL WEST COAST JOINT 
COUNCIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting continued turmoil in the Teamsters union since national President 
Ron Carey began a reform movement three years ago, five locals in Southern 
California have pulled out of Teamsters Joint Council 42 in Los Angeles, 
stripping the longtime West Coast power base of 32,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
 The defection is being challenged in court by Mike Riley, head of the council 
and an opponent of Carey. But Riley's effort to obtain a preliminary injunction 
to block the move was denied Wednesday by a federal judge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge William J. Rea's ruling clears the way for the five 
Southland Teamsters locals, plus two others in Central California, to operate 
under a new joint council. Earlier this month, Carey's administration in 
Washington approved the secession and issued a new charter for Joint Council 
92, one of dozens of regional groupings of Teamsters locals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we can bring better service to the membership at a lesser cost than 
Joint Council 42," said Ed J. Mireles, head of Local 952 in Orange, the 
15,000-member local that led the effort to establish a new joint council. 
Mireles, who will be president of Joint Council 92, said Riley "has not lived 
up to his duties and obligations as joint council president." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley, who has been president of Joint Council 42 for 16 years, ran on a slate 
against Carey in 1991 and has been critical of Carey's actions, including his 
recent move to dismantle the union's four regional conferences, which were 
umbrella groups of joint councils. Riley was head of the Western Conference of 
Teamsters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Riley blamed Carey for the defection of the locals, saying he is 
trying to stifle opposition within the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is encouraging these locals to make this move to weaken the joint 
council," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is pure retaliation, pure intimidation," he alleged, adding that he will 
pursue his lawsuit to reverse the secession. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey was traveling Wednesday and could not be reached for comment. His 
spokesman in Washington, as well as leaders of the new joint council, said the 
secession isn't politically motivated but reflects members' dissatisfaction 
with Joint Council 42's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the defections, Riley's Joint Council 42 remains formidable, with 
about 95,000 members from two dozen locals. Nationwide, the Teamsters union has 
1.4 million members. Still, the secession is a blow to Riley's power base, and 
the loss of members is likely to trim the council's operating budget by $50,000 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Riley said, he will lay off five of the 13 employees at the joint 
council. In addition, he said, there will most likely be salary cuts for the 
remaining workers, including himself. Last year, Riley received about $81,000 
as president of the joint council and $300,000 in total compensation for 
various Teamster posts, making him the top-paid Teamster in the nation for 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey, a maverick New York union leader who was catapulted to head the 
nation's largest union in a government-supervised election three years ago, has 
taken steps to cut salaries as part of his reform. But he has run up against 
plenty of opposition, some of the most vocal from Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Joint Council 92 said it will charge its affiliated locals 65 cents 
per member per month -- less than half what Joint Council 42 collects. In 
addition, as head of Joint Council 92, Mireles will receive a salary of $500 a 
month.

TIMES MIRROR CO. LAUNCHES ON-LINE INTERACTIVE SERVICES; COMMUNICATIONS: THE LOS 
ANGELES TIMES AND NEWSDAY JOIN NEARLY 100 PAPERS IN OFFERING ELECTRONIC 
DELIVERY OF THE NEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joining the rush of newspapers seeking a new incarnation in the digital age, 
the Los Angeles Times and Newsday on Wednesday announced the launch of dual 
interactive services over Prodigy Co.'s on-line network. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Times Mirror Co. newspapers are among nearly 100 worldwide -- the 
number has doubled in the last year -- hoping to protect their traditional 
franchise as primary information providers by establishing a foothold in the 
on-line world, where the barriers to entry are low and new competitors are 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 Both The Times' service, called TimesLink, and Newsday's, called Newsday 
Direct, will seek to use the near-infinite space of the digital format to 
create not only an electronic version of what is already available in the daily 
paper, but also something akin to an interactive community database. 
</P>
<P>
 "In print journalism, we're always fighting two formidable foes: time and 
space," said Richard T. Schlosberg III, executive vice president of Times 
Mirror and publisher and chief executive of the Los Angeles Times. "This gives 
us the ability to publish whenever we want without waiting for the next press 
run." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Southern California subscribers to TimesLink will be able to 
enter their ZIP codes and call up recent news stories about their 
neighborhoods, a list of local libraries, real estate information and 
restaurants. Clicking on another icon will conjure up a portfolio on the O.J. 
Simpson trial, complete with photographs, profiles of the main characters and 
the juror questionnaire. 
</P>
<P>
 An interactive surf report will also be included, as will regular on-line chat 
sessions with reporters, which other newspapers have found to be a key 
attraction in their electronic efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 TimesLink and Newsday Direct are among the most ambitious of the on-line 
newspaper efforts to date. Unlike most of the other services, for example, they 
allow subscribers to dial in directly to the newspaper service, rather than 
first passing through the "main menu" of the on-line service itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Prodigy technology enables the newspapers to offer rich color 
graphics and on-screen advertising. The downside is that many consumers don't 
want advertising. And Prodigy, a joint venture of Sears, Roebuck & Co. and 
International Business Machines Corp., has struggled through years of losses 
and industry criticism of its sometimes-cumbersome technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers have many reasons for jumping into the on-line world -- not the 
least of which is that a wide range of companies are now using electronic media 
to distribute news and information that was once the exclusive province of 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that always kept competition out of the face of newspapers was it 
cost a zillion dollars to build a plant and buy equipment and invest in a 
distribution system before you could play the game," said Tod Jacobs, 
publishing analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "With on-line distribution, 
the newspaper loses its competitive advantage in a significant way." 
</P>
<P>
 By expanding on the newspaper's customary role, the logic goes, the on-line 
service will appeal as a supplement to regular readers and fend off rival 
information vendors at the same time. The two newspapers also hope to draw 
readers from outside their circulation areas. They point to the Atlanta Journal 
and Constitution, which went on line via Prodigy's service earlier this year 
and now draws half its electronic subscribers from outside of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Media analysts say newspapers face an uphill battle in making a profit on 
their interactive experiments, in part because advertisers, which provide the 
bulk of newspaper revenues, have yet to get on board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they don't make money," said Mary Modahl of Forrester Group in 
Cambridge. "No one's been able to figure out how to get ads to work in the 
on-line context. So the concept of content driving circulation which in turn 
drives advertising revenues is broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Although TimesLink and Newsday Direct will include some advertising, the 
newspapers' executives said that given the initial limited reach of the 
services, advertising revenue will probably be negligible in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both services say they expect to be profitable on an operating basis 
within three years. TimesLink hopes to garner about 40,000 subscribers by the 
end of 1995, while Newsday Direct forecasts about 30,000 to 40,000 subscribers 
in the first year. Prodigy members can use the two new services for $4.95 a 
month. Non-members can subscribe for $6.95 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror executives emphasized that they do not expect digital 
distribution to replace newsprint anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe newspapers have a great future," said Times Mirror Chairman and 
Chief Executive Robert F. Erburu. "And an important part of that future depends 
on using their prodigious information-gathering capabilities in new ways."

JURY AWARDS $89.5 MILLION IN HUGHES RACE BIAS LAWSUIT; WORKPLACE: THE JUDGMENT 
IS ONE OF THE LARGEST OF ITS KIND GIVEN TO INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS. THE COMPANY 
VOWS TO APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a huge racial discrimination judgment, two former Hughes Aircraft Co. 
employees -- an engineer who claimed he was denied promotions and pay raises 
because he is black and a Latino supervisor who backed him up -- have been 
awarded $89.5 million by a Los Angeles Superior Court jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a small number of class-action lawsuits have yielded bigger awards, 
the judgment in the Hughes case is one of the biggest ever nationally in a 
discrimination case involving individual plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the judgment came in punitive damages decided Monday, with $40 million 
awarded to engineer Jeffrey Lane, 39, and another $40 million going to Lane's 
former supervisor, David Villalpando, 36. Both live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes said it will appeal the judgment, calling it, in a two-sentence news 
release, "irrational, irresponsible and outrageous."  
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts also said that, given the size of the award, it is very likely 
that the Superior Court judge handling the case, Malcolm H. Mackey, will reduce 
the judgment within the 60 days he has in which to take such an action. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the Santa Monica lawyers representing Lane and Villalpando, Ian 
Herzog, said the award was warranted because "racism is rampant" at the 
company. Hughes has denied that it discriminates against its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Hughes didn't get the message from this, and I don't think they did, it is 
not enough," Herzog said. "How else do you get to lawbreakers like these . . . 
unless you hit them in the pocketbook?" 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of racial discrimination, often involving alleged bias against Asian 
Americans, have emerged with some regularity in the aerospace industry. Hughes 
itself, in a separate court case, was ordered last year to pay $1.4 million to 
a black accountant who claimed he was denied promotions and underpaid because 
of his race. The company says the case ultimately was settled for a smaller 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, another black engineer and his white supervisor are suing Hughes 
in a racial discrimination case similar to the Lane-Villalpando suit and 
brought by the same lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case brought by Lane and Villalpando, the plaintiffs claimed Lane was 
denied a promotion he was due to receive because he lodged internal complaints 
with the company about racial discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 Villalpando testified that he was pressured by management to give Lane 
negative performance reviews, but that when he instead came to Lane's defense, 
he eventually was pushed out of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear testimony like that, it's very, very powerful. When it comes 
from a supervisor, it has credibility with a jury," said Larry J. Shapiro, 
publisher of California Employer Advisor newsletter on employment law. Shapiro 
said he knows of no larger award in a non-class-action case. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, in its court filings, asserted that race played no part in Lane's 
treatment, maintaining that he "had not shown the leadership or put forth the 
extra effort to merit being promoted." 
</P>
<P>
 During two earlier phases of the eight-week trial, the jury had awarded $6.1 
million to Lane and $3.4 million to Villalpando for emotional distress, lost 
wages and benefits. Herzog said Lane, who worked for Hughes from 1977 through 
1992, has been largely disabled by chronic fatigue syndrome and Epstein-Barr 
disease that he claims stemmed from the stress he suffered at Hughes.

10% of China's Zhenhai Petrochemical Co. stock, Hong Kong fund managers and 
securities analysts said.Atlantic Richfield Co. will buy about 40% of the 600 
million shares to be issued by Zhenhai in private and public placements, 
representing 25% of its capital, analysts said. About 120 million shares will 
be listed as H shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange. The issue is expected to 
raise about $180 million for the refinery. Arco plans to use Zhenhai's port 
facilities to ship gas, diesel and lubricant products into China, fund managers 
said. Zhenhai is based in Ningbo, about 100 miles south of Shanghai.

 City National Corp. to Reinstate Dividend: The parent of Los Angeles-based 
City National Bank said its improving profit will allow it to reinstate a 
quarterly dividend of 5 cents a share. The dividend was suspended in 1991 as 
the recession took hold and the bank's profit plummeted. The business bank, 
which last week reported a third-quarter net income of $10.4 million compared 
to a $3.5 million profit a year earlier, said the new dividend will be payable 
Nov. 18 to shareholders of record Nov. 8.

 New York Court Dismisses Bid to Stop Electric Cars: The Empire State can 
continue with its California-style plan to set stringent emissions standards 
for motor vehicles, including a requirement for electric cars, the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern District of New York ruled. Ford Motor Co., 
Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Co. had argued that the plan would force them 
to make special cars just for sale in New York. The auto makers have proposed 
one low-emission design for the California market and another for the other 
states.

 Chrysler Expected to Add a Shift at Neon: The No. 3 U.S. auto maker is 
reportedly ready to begin staffing a third shift at its assembly plant in 
Belvidere, Ill., a move that could mean hundreds of new jobs.Demand for the 
sporty, bubble-shaped car has outstripped supply since it was introduced in 
January. Chrysler officials would not comment, but a spokesman for the United 
Auto Workers union said management today would announce stepped-up production 
at the plant, which has been turning out cars at a rate of 300,000 a year. 
Chrysler also makes Neons in Mexico.

THE ECONOMY; MANUFACTURING INDICATOR INCHES UP IN SEPTEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The indicator: The Commerce Department released figures on factory orders for 
durable goods. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it did: Orders rose 0.1% in September, the second straight increase.But 
the rise was nowhere near August's revised 6.4% jump, which was led by higher 
automobile orders. Orders for ships and tanks led the way in September, 
offsetting declining demand for cars and aircraft and producing a 2.1% advance 
in all transportation orders. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it means: The measure of orders for items expected to last more than 
three years is seen as a key indicator of the nation's manufacturing strength. 
September's overall rise was smaller than analysts predicted. But given other 
recent data, analysts said, they doubt it is a sign of a slowdown. They cited 
the previous month's surge and a large increase for the year as evidence that 
the manufacturing sector remains strong. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highlights: Durable goods orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $154.7 
billion in September, up from $154.6 billion in August. Orders for 
transportation equipment climbed to $39.6 billion. Excluding transportation, 
orders fell 0.6% last month. Orders for electronic and electrical equipment 
were also up, climbing 3.2%, and metals gained 2.7%. Industrial machinery and 
equipment dipped 2.5% after surging 4.6% the previous month. Durable Goods

BANKERS GROUP SAYS CREDIT UNIONS SHOULD FACE SAME REGULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of community bankers on Wednesday proposed taxing credit unions and 
bringing them under the same federal laws as banks, saying that would even the 
competition between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent Bankers Assn. of America said most credit unions provide the 
same services as commercial banks and should be regulated like them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's high time that credit unions faced the same (fair-lending) rules, 
capital standards and tax requirements as banks," said John Shivers, a Ft. 
Worth banker and president of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit unions dismissed the plan as a sour-grapes effort to weaken the 
competition. Credit unions currently do not have to pay federal taxes because 
they are technically nonprofit institutions owned by their members. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers association, which represents 6,000 small banks, proposed 
legislation titled "The Credit Union Reform and Regulatory Improvement Act of 
1995." The seven-part plan would impose taxes on credit unions with more than 
$10 million in assets, allow the unions to offer services to people linked to 
only one employer or organization, and subject unions to capital standards 
similar to those for banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would also apply the Community Reinvestment Act to credit unions, 
a move already advocated by some activists, lawmakers and regulators. (The act 
is a fair-lending law intended to keep banks from discriminating against the 
poor and minorities.) 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers group said it does not yet have a congressional sponsor, but 
expects to have one after the November elections.

TIMES, PARENT FIRM TO KEEP HEADQUARTERS

<P>
 The Los Angeles Times and its parent, Times Mirror Co., announced Wednesday 
that they will retain their landmark headquarters at Times Mirror Square in 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision ends the newspaper's deliberations about relocating, although The 
Times said some non-editorial employees are likely to be transferred to a 
suburban location.A Glendale site is under consideration for those employees, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times said it is evaluating a refurbishing program for the Downtown 
complex that could include infrastructure and office improvements and exterior 
renovation and preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a win-win situation for The Times and for Los Angeles," Times 
Publisher Richard T. Schlosberg III said in a statement. "We will preserve the 
historic Los Angeles Times buildings and continue to play a role as the major 
private-sector anchor in the Civic Center." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times and Times Mirror last year offered to renovate and sell the building 
for $87.35 million to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California 
for use as a headquarters. MWD rejected the offer in November, citing concerns 
about rehabilitation costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moderne-style headquarters, designed by architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, 
opened in 1935 at the southwest corner of 1st and Spring streets, diagonally 
across from City Hall. It connects to the 10-story Times Building South, 
erected in 1949. The adjoining Times Mirror Building on 1st Street opened in 
1973.

ANALYSTS SEE LILLY LIMITS AIDING PUBLIC

<P>
 Consumers could have more drug choices at better prices if federal regulators 
restrict drug maker Eli Lilly & Co.'s purchase of a big drug-benefits manager, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed conditions -- which Lilly has reportedly agreed to accept -- 
would force it to keep an arms-length relationship with PCS Health Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 That means Lilly wouldn't be able to funnel its drugs to PCS' 50 million 
members while shutting out drugs made by others. 
</P>
<P>
 However, while applauding the FTC actions, the experts said the highly 
competitive drug marketplace would eventually have the same effect, preventing 
Lilly from reaping unfair profits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street on Wednesday, some investors decided the FTC restrictions make 
Lilly's $4-billion purchase of PCS a money loser. They sent Lilly's stock down 
50 cents to $60 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lilly-PCS deal illustrates the fundamental changes occurring in the way 
Americans buy prescription drugs. Traditionally, doctors alone decided which 
drugs to prescribe. If a patient had insurance, price wasn't a big factor. 
</P>
<P>
 With drug costs soaring in the 1980s, the actual buyers of health care -- 
insurance companies, large corporations, HMOs and doctor networks -- began 
looking for alternatives. They hired pharmacy benefit managers, known as PBMs, 
to pick the most effective, safest and reasonably priced drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 PBMs put their favorite drugs on lists called formularies. Because 
participating doctors are supposed to prescribe only drugs on the formularies, 
drug companies offer big discounts to the PBMs in exchange for getting on the 
list.

STUDY: BLACKS STILL MOST LIKELY TO BE REJECTED FOR HOME LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite an anti-discrimination crackdown by the Clinton Administration, 
mortgage lenders continue to reject black applicants more than twice as often 
as whites with similar incomes, according to a regulatory report released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the data for 1993, banks, savings institutions and credit unions 
turned down 34% of mortgage applications received from blacks, 27.8% from 
Native Americans, 25.1% from Latinos, 15.3% from whites and 14.6% from Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth year the data has been released by the Federal Financial 
Institutions Examination Council, a coordinating body for five federal 
regulatory agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection pattern in the latest report differs little from that of the 
first year, 1990, when 33.9% of blacks were turned down, 22.4% of Native 
Americans, 21.4% of Latinos, 14.4% of whites and 12.9% of Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 And, as in past years, the disparity in rejection rates for whites and blacks 
in 1993 remained wide even when the data was adjusted for income. 
</P>
<P>
 For low-income applicants -- those with less than 80% of the median income in 
their areas -- the rates were: blacks, 32.3%; Latinos, 28.6%; Native Americans, 
27%; whites, 19.3%, and Asians, 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejection rates for applicants with more than 120% of the median income were: 
blacks, 18.2%; Latinos, 17.1%; Asians, 13.7%; Native Americans, 13.6%, and 
whites, 7.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers Assn., 
said the data is "at best a flawed measure" of his industry's commitment to 
fair lending. Although the report groups applicants by income, it does not take 
into account such factors as previous indebtedness and credit records. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogilvie said that despite the still divergent rejection rates, the actual 
number of applications and approved loans increased more quickly for blacks and 
Latinos than for whites. He attributed that both to bankers' efforts and to low 
interest rates in 1993, which made home purchases more affordable for 
first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is getting ready to send each of its members a "Fair Lending 
Toolbox" containing information on how to improve their lending records.

 The licenses are for a new service that will let people send and receive a 
variety of information -- faxes, messages and pages -- without being tethered 
to phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Bids in the opening round Wednesday totaled $186 million, compared to the 
$103.7 million offered by 27 companies in the opening round of the July 
auction. When that auction for 10 national licenses was over 47 rounds later, 
the Treasury Department had been pledged more than $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight companies are now competing for 30 licenses to provide the 
regional service. The United States is divided into five regions covering 220 
million people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first round, licenses for the Northeast region, which includes New York 
and Boston, drew the heaviest bids: $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern region, which includes the Washington-Baltimore region and Miami, 
and the Midwest region, which includes Chicago, each drew bids of $38 million. 
Bids for the Western region, including Los Angeles, totaled $36 million, 
followed by the Central region, which includes Dallas, and drew $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The auction, which is taking place in a specially built 12,000-square-foot 
room in a government building near the Capitol, could last for weeks, according 
to Federal Communications Commission officials running the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidding continues until there are no new bids for any of the licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The most aggressive company in the first round was PCS Development Corp., a 
minority-owned firm, which bid a total of $100 million for 10 licenses in each 
of the five regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Durham, N.C.-based company is backed by one of the country's leading 
minority financiers, Maceo Sloan, according to FCC officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Sloan, the chairman of PCS Development, said his company 
wants to secure and string together licenses in all five markets in order to 
provide a nationwide communications service. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the products offered would be "pocket voice mail," he said. The price: 
"Under $50 a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Other aggressive companies in the first round included divisions of big paging 
companies. They are Pagemart, bidding about $56 million, and Mobilemedia, 
bidding $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bidders for the regional licenses range from affiliates of big regional phone 
and paging companies to small entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Minorities are hopeful they will come away from this auction with some 
licenses. None of the national licenses sold in July went to minority-owned 
firms, which were quickly outbid by deep-pocketed telecommunications companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of this, the FCC revised the rules for the current auction.

SETTLEMENT OKD FOR FINANCIAL CORP. OF AMERICA; THRIFTS: IRS CLAIMS ARE 
RESOLVED. THE S&L'S CREDITORS WILL RECEIVE UP TO 10 CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial Corp. of America, once a high-flying savings and loan holding 
company run by maverick money man Charles W. Knapp, on Wednesday won court 
approval of a settlement that will allow it to repay bondholders and other 
creditors up to 10 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement of the Internal Revenue Service claim resolves a lengthy saga 
for the company that built the nation's largest thrift, American Savings & 
Loan, with risky loans and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement paves the way for the trustee for now-defunct FCA, which filed 
for bankruptcy protection in 1988, to pay $9 million to creditors and close the 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all these years, that's better than nothing -- and nothing is what we 
were looking at before," said Pamela Webster, a lawyer representing the 
bondholders' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 David M. Gill, the trustee for the bankrupt estate, said that until Wednesday, 
he had no idea whether there would be any money available to pay the nearly 
8,000 minor investors who were left holding about $80 million in FCA bonds when 
the company went bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, the IRS, which 
originally sought $301.2 million, will have a claim for $26 million. The tax 
agency will take $6 million immediately and share the remainder with creditors 
after administrative costs are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill and local IRS officials reached the agreement two years ago, but he had 
to fight to save the deal through numerous reviews by higher officials in the 
tax agency and the Justice Department. Recently, the congressional Joint 
Committee on Taxation approved the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 A year's worth of work remains, however, to determine the exact number of 
unsecured creditors and how much is owed each one.  
</P>
<P>
 Gill, with his law partner Richard Diamond acting as his attorney, collected 
more than $28 million from legal proceedings against the government and others. 
Ironically, the biggest single chunk -- $10 million -- came from the federal 
government. Diamond had argued that regulators wrongly seized and sold FCA 
property when they took over American Savings. 
</P>
<P>
 FCA still has about 1,000 unimproved residential lots for sale in an area near 
the boundaries of Los Angeles, Kern and San Bernardino counties, but the land 
is estimated to be worth less than $500,000. The estate has spent about $2 
million for various services, including legal, accounting and brokerage fees. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings & Loan was seized in late 1988, recapitalized by Texas 
billionaire investor Robert Bass and renamed American Savings Bank.

 California Energy Wins Magma Shareholder List: A Nevada state court ruled that 
Magma Power Co. must supply the Omaha-based company with the names.California 
Energy Co. is attempting a hostile takeover. Last Friday, the geothermal power 
company boosted its bid for San Diego-based Magma Power to $38.50 a share, or 
$925 million, from its earlier offer of $35 a share, or $840 million. The court 
ruled late Monday that Magma must provide the shareholders' names to Ben Holt, 
a director of California Energy who is also a Magma shareholder. Holt had sued 
Magma individually to obtain the list. "It's not a significant setback," said 
Jon Peele, Magma's general counsel.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW SLIPS 2.36 AS BOND YIELDS RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Financial markets mostly treaded water Wednesday, as stocks closed mixed while 
bond yields inched up to new 2 1/2-year highs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average eased 2.36 points to 3,848.23, its fifth 
consecutive decline. But most broader market indexes were marginally higher in 
active trading, even though losers topped winners by 12 to 10 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Tuesday's session, strength in energy stocks helped pull up blue-chip 
indexes such as the Standard & Poor's 500, which added 1.09 points to 462.62. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the stock market fought to ignore creeping bond yields. The 
30-year Treasury bond yield, which jumped past 8% on Monday for the first time 
in 2 1/2 years, continued to rise Wednesday, but at a snail's pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-bond closed at 8.06%, up from 8.04% on Tuesday and the highest since 
April, 1992. Shorter-term yields were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds had rallied briefly in the morning on a weaker-than-expected report on 
September big-ticket durable goods orders. But by afternoon, traders were 
focused again on the probability that the economy remains stronger than the 
Federal Reserve Board would like -- raising the risk of another Fed 
credit-tightening move soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are increasingly concerned that the Fed is dragging its feet on 
monetary policy tightening and are worried that the economy won't slow down to 
nip inflation pressures in the bud," said Robert Giordano, director of economic 
research at Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A key number for the Fed will come Friday, when the government gives its 
estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product growth. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, bond investors' reluctance to buy at current yields was evident 
in the Treasury's auction of new five-year notes. The notes carried an average 
yield of 7.55%, the highest in more than three years and slightly above 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, continued to be a problem for bond and stock markets. 
It fell to 1.4918 German marks in New York from 1.4940 on Tuesday, though it 
rose to 96.90 Japanese yen from 96.70. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the dollar was helped late in the session when French Economy 
Minister Edmond Alphandery said that "France would examine seriously the 
possibility of participating" in concerted central bank intervention to boost 
the ailing U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, analysts say stocks are likely to remain hostage to bond and 
dollar moves. "We need a strong bond market rally and a strong dollar rally to 
get the market to rally successively," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at 
Reich & Co. "Just a relief rally isn't going to do the trick here." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks were broadly higher for a second day, on the heels of Mobil's 
announcement that it plans new cost cutting. Mobil rose 5/8 to 83 7/8, Arco 
jumped 2 1/8 to 106 1/8, Exxon climbed 7/8 to 61 1/4, Phillips gained 3/4 to 35 
5/8 and Louisiana Land jumped 3/4 to 45 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology issues rebounded, led by semiconductor issues. A forecast by 
the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics group predicted that the worldwide 
semiconductor industry will continue to grow at a 15% annual pace during the 
remainder of the decade and will reflect greater stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Among computer chip makers, Motorola gained 1 1/8 to 57, Intel added 1 1/8 to 
60, Texas Instruments jumped 3 to 71 3/8 and Micron Technology surged 2 1/2 to 
38 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some software stocks sparked to life. Powersoft soared 6 1/16 to 61 1/8, 
Peoplesoft zoomed 2 15/16 to 59 1/4, Sybase leaped 3 to 52 1/4 and Microsoft 
added 1 5/16 to 61. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, Continental Airlines B shares tumbled 2 3/8 to 15 after its 
third-quarter earnings disappointed investors and its CEO was forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Surgical slumped 2 5/8 to 23 7/8. The Wall Street Journal reported that 
corporate insiders are selling the stock, suggesting that a rumored takeover of 
the company is not imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 * International Game Technology lost 1 to 17 7/8. The slot machine maker 
announced layoffs to reduce production. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX 30 stock index rebounded 45.87 points to 2,020.50, 
while London's FTSE 100 index eased 1.00 point to 2,999.90. In Tokyo, the 
Nikkei 225 index rose 14.20 points to 19,746.35. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index rose 1.62 points to 2,580.00. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, copper prices rallied to a new round of four-year 
highs Wednesday, setting off warning signals among some traders who feel the 
market may be overbought. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Comex in New York, December copper futures jumped 2.75 cents to $1.22 a 
pound, the highest level since September, 1990.

CONVERSION INDUSTRIES TAKES LOAN FROM AFFILIATE CVD TO SHIFT DEBTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conversion Industries of Pasadena, whose assets have collapsed over the last 
12 months, said Wednesday it has borrowed $3.1 million from one of its 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan, the latest of several controversial transactions between Conversion 
and its subsidiaries, was made by CVD Financial, also of Pasadena. It allowed 
Conversion to repay $2.2 million in bank and margin debt, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversion, a "merchant bank" whose business is investing in and spinning off 
other businesses, created CVD Financial in August, 1993, mainly to lend money 
to other Conversion affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last fall, Conversion's investment portfolio has plummeted in value and 
the company has had to scramble for capital. And, in a rare move, the American 
Stock Exchange on Oct. 11 said it would delist shares of Conversion and its 
Beta Well Service affiliate, citing unspecified issues of disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Conversion and its affiliates have become targets of an informal 
Securities and Exchange Commission probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the loan agreement with CVD Financial, Conversion will pay the prime 
rate (now 7.75%) plus 7 points, but won't owe interest for six months. 
Conversion also surrendered its 35% stake in CVD Financial and gave CVD 
Financial a first lien on all Conversion assets. 
</P>
<P>
 But the relationship between the two firms is further complicated by 
guarantees Conversion previously issued to CVD Financial for loans it made to 
certain other Conversion affiliates. CVD Financial said it eliminated $2.3 
million of the $8 million in Conversion guarantees as part of the loan pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy McCann, president of CVD Financial, said the loan's terms were reviewed by 
a special committee of CVD directors. He said the loan and the stock give-back 
offered "a way to keep Conversion as a solid company" while also allowing CVD 
to cut Conversion's direct ownership tie to CVD and thus function more 
independently. 
</P>
<P>
 However, McCann said he could not comment on whether Conversion may need 
additional capital to shore up its investment portfolio. Conversion officials 
did not return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in CVD Financial shares has been halted on the Amex since Oct. 13, at 
the firm's request. McCann said trading would resume today. CVD was last quoted 
at $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading in Conversion and Beta remains suspended as the Amex pursues delisting 
of the stocks.

LEHMAN FIRES ELAINE GARZARELLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elaine Garzarelli, a prominent Wall Street stock strategist best known for 
calling the October, 1987, market crash, was fired by Lehman Bros. on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Garzarelli was dismissed because she and the research operation she led, which 
tracked the relative investment attraction of different industries and their 
stocks, had become too expensive, a Lehman official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garzarelli, 42, who pulled down a seven-figure salary, did not return phone 
calls. She "left by mutual consent," a Lehman spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ouster points out the difficulties of maintaining star status on Wall 
Street, especially as the securities industry tries to cut costs amid declining 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 While Garzarelli's 1987 market call and her subsequent research had earned her 
wide acclaim, in recent months she found herself at odds with Katherine Hensel, 
Lehman's chief investment strategist. Garzarelli has been relatively bullish on 
the market, while Hensel has been cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a mutual fund Garzarelli had managed since 1987 was folded into another 
fund in August, in part because of disappointing long-term results. 
</P>
<P>
 In her tenure at Lehman, Garzarelli, a colorful speaker, had become a media 
darling. Last year, she even starred in commercials for pantyhose, chosen as 
the exemplar of a "real powerhouse woman on Wall Street," an advertising 
executive said at the time.

TWO INVESTORS TO BUY MEDIA GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Southern investors have agreed to buy Park Communications Inc., a 
newspaper and broadcasting group, for $711.4 million, Park's board announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tentative agreement, all nine Park television stations, 22 radio 
stations and 106 newspaper publications would be sold to Donald R. Tomlin and 
Gary B. Knapp.  
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the deal is contingent upon the approval of federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval of Park's shareholders is also needed, but that is considered to 
be a formality. The estate of founder Roy H. Park, which owns nearly 90% of the 
company's stock, favors the transaction, Park spokesman Jack Claiborne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Communications, one of the nation's biggest media groups, was put up for 
sale following the death of Roy H. Park at age 83 in October, 1993. Park took 
the fortune he made by helping create Duncan Hines foods and built Park 
Communications by collecting small-city newspapers and broadcast outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin is a Columbia, S.C., financial planner who previously invested in radio 
stations in South Carolina, North Carolina and Indiana, said John Fiorini, a 
Washington attorney representing the prospective buyers. Tomlin has since 
divested those holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp is a securities brokerage dealer in Lexington, Ky., and former 
University of Houston professor, Fiorini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiorini said the two have been interested in buying Park since shortly after 
it went up for sale in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp and Tomlin will finance the deal in part through a $573.4-million loan 
from Retirement Systems of Alabama, Fiorini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park settled on Knapp and Tomlin over a "sizable" number of other offers, 
Claiborne said. He declined to give an exact number or reveal whether Knapp and 
Tomlin were the high bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase price offered by the Tomlin-Knapp group represents a per-share 
price of about $30.50, based on the 23.3 million outstanding shares of Park 
Communications stock as of Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Communications closed up 87.5 cents at $28.50 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul T. Sweeney, media analyst for Wheat First Butcher Singer of Richmond, 
Va., said the sales price is "pretty much in line" with what analysts had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, would they sell the company as a whole or in parts?" he 
said.

EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; MOVIE TICKET TECHNOLOGY TO BE LICENSED; ENTERTAINMENT: DEAL 
WOULD ALLOW PUBLIC TO BUY TICKETS THROUGH TV, KIOSKS, PCS AND OTHER OUTLETS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a move that could give filmgoers more ticket-buying choices, PacerCats said 
it will license its ticket information systems technology to film exhibitors, 
enabling them to more easily install or build custom interactive ticketing 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is expected to accelerate efforts to allow movie customers to buy 
tickets through television, interactive kiosks, personal computers and other 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 PacerCats, which made the announcement Wednesday at the ShowEast convention 
for exhibitors in Atlantic City, N.J., is a joint venture between Los 
Angeles-based Ticketmaster and Great Britain's Wembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal raises the stakes in the increasingly advanced movie ticket business, 
which is now served by such firms as New York-based MovieFone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that Justice Department officials looking at 
Ticketmaster's operations have talked to officials at MovieFone, who have 
expressed concern that Ticketmaster may soon dominate the film ticket business 
as it does the concert ticket business.  
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for PacerCats denied that the decision announced Wednesday to 
license the technology to exhibitors is designed to defuse those concerns, 
saying the company believes it "is the right thing to do and is good business." 
</P>
<P>
 PacerCats will license its "electronic box office TeleTicketing technology" to 
the exhibitors without necessarily using the company's own software. That will 
give exhibitors the freedom to choose ticketing services or build their own 
from scratch.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; ENIGMATIC TAIWANESE MILLIONAIRE AT CENTER OF STOCK 
SCANDAL STORM; TRADING: FEW SEEM TO BELIEVE OUNG TA-MING'S CLAIMS THAT THE ONLY 
THING HE PLAYS THESE DAYS IS VIDEO GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oung Ta-ming insists he's out of the stock market and into playing video 
games. But few believe him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, the enigmatic millionaire has been at the center of a 
storm over an alleged stock manipulation that stunned the Taiwanese stock 
market, jolted the political establishment and forced the firing of a 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 It even turned bloody when a fellow legislator stabbed himself on a podium in 
a highly theatrical declaration of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Five executives of two brokerages owned by Oung's Hualon Group have been 
detained, police have raided Oung's home and offices, and investigators say 
they are uncovering an intricate web of mutual back-scratching among business 
people and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the Bureau of Investigation, Taiwan's crime-busting agency, 
summoned Oung on suspicion of masterminding the stock manipulation, but Oung 
did not show up for interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is new to the freewheeling Taiwanese business world. But it has 
shocked a government that hoped the bad old days of corruption and market 
manipulation were gone and that Taiwan could claim respectability in the global 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal emerged in early October when two brokerages controlled by Oung's 
group defaulted on $120 million in loans taken out to finance stock purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 The market immediately went into a five-day tailspin in which its main index 
plunged 15% to 6,124.71 points on Oct. 11, before beginning a slow recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say they are convinced Oung was behind the default. Dubbed the 
"Warrior in the Shadows" for his ability to move the market, Oung is alleged to 
have pushed up stock in Imperial Hotel more than fivefold over a year, to 
$14.80 in August. 
</P>
<P>
 That price was so high, investigators say, that he could no longer attract 
small investors to help keep the bubble intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Oung, 44, built a textile, electronics and real estate empire out of an 
inherited pig farm. He now claims to have dropped out of Hualon's operations 
and the stock market years ago and says he spends much of his time playing 
video games. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Taiwanese are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Oung was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison for selling unlisted 
stocks cheaply to a politician's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Oung promptly got himself elected as an independent legislator, but he was 
rarely seen in the chamber, prompting suspicions that he ran for office simply 
to stave off imprisonment. He has yet to serve his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest affair took on a strong political hue when investigators who raided 
Oung's offices Oct. 6 were confronted by about 30 lawmakers from all political 
parties. Many of them tried to stop authorities from seizing documents. 
</P>
<P>
 This led to accusations that the lawmakers were implicated in the stock 
scandal. One of them, Hou Hai-hsiung, was dismissed by his opposition 
Democratic Progressive Party, which was anxious to protect its 
corruption-busting image. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeh Hsien-hsu, an independent, stunned the legislature by mounting the podium 
and stabbing himself in the arm, shouting that he wanted to spell out his 
innocence in blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou pledged a full-scale crackdown and dismissed 
claims that he might be pressured to protect the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Oung emerged for a rare news conference, protesting that he only wanted to 
help his fellow legislators and declaring that "not everything is done with a 
profit motive." 
</P>
<P>
 Linin Day, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, saw a bright 
side to the affair, saying it offered an opportunity to drive "the street rats" 
out of the market once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big players used to be honored and followed as Robin Hood-type heroes," 
he said. "Investors must become more mature and rational now."

 MEXICAN STOCKS 
</P>
<P>
 * The market edged up Wednesday after four days of deep losses, with the Bolsa 
index rising 1.62 points to 2,580.00. It had tumbled to an 11-week low earlier 
in the day, on carry-over selling from Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * Another rise in Mexican short-term interest rates weighed on stocks, but 
analysts noted that much of this week's selloff stemmed from disappointment 
over third-quarter corporate earnings reports. Phone giant Telmex's 
lower-than-expected results, released Tuesday, sparked a plunge in the Bolsa 
that left it down 55 points at the close that day. Telmex said foreign currency 
fluctuations and higher expenses hurt earnings.

 Privatization Nearly Complete in Former East Germany: After selling off nearly 
40,000 inns, stores and other companies, the agency charged with privatizing 
East Germany's state sector said its task is nearly over.The Treuhandanstalt, 
or Trustee Agency, which once was reportedly the largest corporation in the 
world, said it has only 131 companies left to sell before it closes shop as 
scheduled at year's end. The agency took over ownership of state companies 
employing 4.5 million East Germans when Germany was united in October, 1990. 
Since then, it has disposed of more than 14,000 companies, along with 25,000 
small operations such as restaurants, inns, pharmacies, bookstores and 
theaters.

 India Invites Foreign Telecom Investment: Communications Minister Sukh Ram 
urged foreign telecommunications firms to set up factories in the nation, 
saying a massive pent-up demand for phones could bring them huge profits.He 
said India needs 10 million phones by 1997. "There is a waiting list (for 
phones) of 3 million, and the density of phones in India is less than 1%. This 
provides immense business possibilities," Ram said.

 China Bans Rice Futures Trading: Signaling growing alarm at rocketing grain 
prices that are fueling inflation, the government said it is banning the 
trading in Shanghai, dealing a blow to a key Chinese commodities market.Some 
contracts in long-grain polished rice on the Shanghai Cereals and Oils Exchange 
were suspended Monday, and others will be phased out. Rice accounted for about 
90% of volume on the exchange before September, when Beijing began clamping 
tight controls over trading by narrowing intra-day price movements and ordering 
traders to unwind positions. Rice prices have been soaring since July, when 
floods and drought devastated vast grain-growing areas of the country.

GRANT TO AID PARTNERSHIP TO IMPROVE WORKER SKILLS; PROGRAM: THREE COLLEGES AND 
NINE FIRMS WILL CREATE THREE CENTERS TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO EMPLOYEES WITH THE 
HELP OF $3.4 MILLION IN FEDERAL JOB LITERACY FUNDS.

 Three community colleges will join with nine businesses in Orange County to 
create three centers for work-force training and development, with the help of 
a $3.4-million federal grant, college officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Community College District, Irvine Valley College, Rancho Santiago 
College and nine companies will sponsor the centers, which are designed to give 
undereducated workers and those with limited English skills the necessary 
training to become better workers so they and their employers can be more 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The "workplace literacy" grant is the only one awarded in California, and is 
the fourth largest in the nation. It is part of $18 million in federal job 
literacy grants awarded this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Project organizers intend to demonstrate to businesses "the return on 
investment for providing basic skills training to their work force," said Ed 
Langley, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Newport Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Corp., a maker of precision equipment related to lasers and optics, 
currently has a training site -- the Job Link Center -- at its Irvine facility 
that will be the pilot site for the three-year program. By 1996, the project 
expects to have additional centers at sites in Santa Ana and at the Irvine 
Spectrum, said Ann Garten, a spokeswoman for Coast Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers will use tape players, computers and multimedia displays to help 
improve workers' English vocabulary, reading comprehension and math skills, 
Garten said. The training will be free to the employees, who will be encouraged 
to participate in mentoring and reading clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees will be taught skills geared to their jobs during and after work 
hours, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other participating companies include: CDI-3M Health Care; Deft Inc.; 
Mallinckrodt Medical TPI Inc.; Printronix; Rosemount Analytical Inc.; Steelcase 
Inc.; 3M Dental Products, and 3M Surgical. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope to spread the project to 50 businesses by the second year and 
100 businesses by the third year. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal funding for the first year of the project will total $894,034, Garten 
said, and businesses and colleges will provide $402,315.  
</P>
<P>
 Money from the federal government for the second year will total $1.2 million, 
and $1.3 million during the third year, Garten said. Colleges will provide 
$630,948 and $637,148, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said the diverse population of Orange County's work force 
and the county's changing demographics made it an ideal location for the 
literacy grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 30% of the employees of the partner companies have basic skills that are 
insufficient for their jobs," Garten said. The training aims to improve 
workers' technical skills and enable them to work better in teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to give (workers) the ability to perform their current jobs 
better," he said, "and move up."

the same period in 1993, which included a gain of $4.2 million from an 
accounting change. Revenue rose to $1.1 billion from $989.3 million.

 Speculation that Charter Medical Corp. might launch a bid to acquire Community 
Psychiatric Centers pushed up the price of the former Laguna Hills company's 
stock in New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital operator Community Psychiatric, which moved its headquarters to Las 
Vegas in August, saw its stock price gain 37.5 cents to close at $10.25 a share 
in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 CNBC correspondent Dan Dorfman said during a TV program Wednesday that Charter 
might make a $700-million hostile bid for the hospital company. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Hovdey, a spokeswoman for Community Psychiatric, said company 
officials have no comment on the acquisition speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Psychiatric has 7,000 employees and owns 47 psychiatric hospitals 
and 12 acute-care medical facilities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter Medical, based in Macon, Ga., has nearly 12,000 employees and provides 
psychiatric and medical treatment through a network of hospitals worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman said that if Charter acquired Community Psychiatric, it could sell the 
company's acute-care facilities for up to $300 million to help pay for the 
merger.

HOMEOWNERSHIP OFFERS BIG BREAKS, FEW RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is nothing like homeownership to make people feel they are active 
participants in the economy, for better or worse. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the basis of their wealth, their ticket to mobility, the source of funds 
for meeting emergencies. It gives them an added reason to become involved in 
community affairs and to vote. It may be their pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative advisers like to remind people that the main reason for owning a 
home is to put a roof over one's head, and that thoughts about financial gain 
should be secondary at most. But it is hard to ignore the finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Sam gives tax breaks to people who borrow to buy and maintain houses -- 
breaks that, for example, are denied to credit-card borrowers. Banks and 
creditors like to do business with them. Even inflation may be kinder to them. 
</P>
<P>
 True, inflation can cause a run-up of interest rates, and that can cause 
problems for those with adjustable-rate mortgages. But offsetting this is the 
long experience of housing prices rising faster than prices generally. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeownership is a foothold for new Americans. Harvard University's Joint 
Center for Housing Studies points out that nearly 50% of immigrants in the 
1970s were owners by 1990. Between 60% and 70% of those who immigrated before 
1970 had homes of their own at the beginning of this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And more than 20% of immigrants during the 1980s owned houses at the beginning 
of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Those homes are their primary wealth, amassed by improvements, principal 
reductions and housing inflation. As a group, homeowners of all ages have many 
times more wealth than renters, much of it acquired through ownership alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just part of the story, the good part. The bad part concerns those 
who cannot own and therefore are deprived of all the advantages that accrue.  
</P>
<P>
 Census Bureau statistics, and tabulations and interpretations by the Joint 
Center, reveal imperfections in the picture that could worsen, primarily the 
rising burden for renters and minority ownership rates that lag badly. 
</P>
<P>
 Black ownership rates remain well below 50%, Hispanic rates slightly above 
that mark and Native Americans higher, but still below 55%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden within those statistics are reasons and explanations having to do with 
some of the worst social problems facing the nation, among them slums, 
discrimination, drugs, unemployment, crime and political instability. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is well-known, but the problems continue and may even worsen in spite 
of the billions of dollars thrown at them by the private and public sector.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, when all the benefits of ownership are considered, especially the 
economic and civic aspects, an opportunity lies ahead for the entrepreneurial 
genius of home builders and the wisdom of financiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with municipalities and Uncle Sam, such efforts might raise ownership 
rates a percentage point or two, not just putting a roof over some heads but 
solving a host of social problems along the way.

FAIR OR FOWL: KENTUCKY WEIGHS EFFECTS OF GROWING POULTRY INDUSTRY; ENVIRONMENT: 
WITH CHICKEN PROCESSING PLANTS NOTORIOUS FOR POLLUTING WATERWAYS, THE ECONOMIC 
BENEFITS TO THE STATE COULD BE OFFSET BY ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The yellow fluffballs of chicks ride to Ricky Wilson's farm aboard old school 
buses, 100 to a crate. When they arrive, the 30,000 hatchlings, weighing only a 
few ounces each, cover only half the floor inside his cavernous coop. 
</P>
<P>
 As the chicks grow fat over just six weeks of gorging on grain and water, they 
plump up to pack the entire coop in a solid wash of white feathers. It will 
take four semi-trucks to ship the four-pound adults from Wilson's farm near 
Mayfield to slaughter at the processing plant down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The poultry industry in Kentucky is growing as dramatically as Wilson's 
chicks, lured to the state by tax breaks to create jobs in mostly rural 
counties with high unemployment. State officials predict that Kentucky will 
move from 25th in nationwide poultry production to ninth in only two years, 
with its new $600-million industry churning out 5.4 million broilers weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Poultry offers an alternative for Kentucky's tobacco farmers, who expect to 
earn less under declining production quotas and higher cigarette taxes linked 
to health reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry also brings a dubious record of corrupting lakes and rivers 
in the Southeast over the past decade. Chicken processors have paid huge fines 
and court settlements because of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The new industry may be a big problem for Kentucky clean-water regulators, who 
are charged with monitoring lakes and rivers and who say they are understaffed. 
Three poultry companies plan to build sprawling complexes in Kentucky, and a 
fourth, Seaboard Farms, is already operating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For every chicken processed, plants produce three to four gallons of water 
tainted by blood, guts and feathers. That waste water is treated by the company 
or local municipal waste-water plant, then dumped back into streams or sprayed 
onto cropland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet for Natural Resources, a state agency, has only 47 field 
inspectors to oversee all aspects of clean water, including agricultural 
permits, drinking-water plants and waste-water licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not a whole lot when you consider the size of the state," said Meleva 
Chamberlain, a spokeswoman for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If officials are concerned, it's because of the experiences of other states. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 families near Green Forest, Ark., sued Tyson Foods Inc. 10 years 
ago, charging that blood and grease from the company's chicken plant 
contaminated drinking-water supplies. Tyson settled the suit last year for an 
undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Missouri regulators sued Hudson Foods Inc. in 1991, charging that its 
processing plant in the southwestern part of the state overloaded a waste-water 
treatment plant and polluted the Elk River, a popular stream for swimmers and 
canoeists. In a consent decree, Hudson and the water plant agreed to pay 
$340,000 in fines and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky regulators have already fined Seaboard $10,000 for the accidental 
release of untreated waste water directly into a stream in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Some states have enjoyed the economic benefits of chickens without the 
environmental damage. The industry's movement into North Carolina since the 
mid-1980s has been less damaging than in Arkansas, said Rodney Dietert, 
director of the Institute for Comparative and Environmental Toxicology at 
Cornell University in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietert, who tracked the industry in both states using figures from the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, credits tough state regulations and the poultry 
industry's approach in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that it's perfect," he added. "Minimizing the potential impact on water 
resources is not a simple solution. I don't think it's just the state 
regulatory bureaucracy, but it's also the matter of design and self-policing 
within the industry itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry says its problems stem from municipal waste-water plants that are 
incapable of handling the tremendous flow from its processing plants, which can 
discharge more than 1.5 million gallons of effluent each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Roenigk of the National Broiler Council, a Washington, D.C.-based trade 
association that represents the industry, said that poultry plants are solving 
the water problems that affected the so-called Broiler Belt, from New York and 
Pennsylvania into the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It did take us a little time to do it," Roenigk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken plants now almost always build their own water treatment facilities, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kentucky, Perdue Farms Inc. told regulators that it will build its own 
plant. Cagle's Inc. said a new waste-water plant will go up at its site. 
</P>
<P>
 In Henderson, the city will build a new $7.2-million waste-water plant big 
enough to accommodate the Hudson poultry plant. It will handle up to 4 million 
gallons a day, far more than Hudson's projected 1.2 million gallons a day, said 
Bob Gish, general manager of the city's water and sewer utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Kim Nelson, a longtime critic of the Cabinet for Natural Resources, 
defended the poultry industry, saying that its environmental record does not 
necessarily reflect its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is that the industry has moved forward, recognizing its 
responsibility to operate in a manner that will not cause danger to human 
health or the environment," he said.

FORMER ROADIE FOLLOWS NEW TRAILS; MUSIC: FRED CURDTS TOURED WITH THE NITTY 
GRITTY DIRT BAND BEFORE HIS SOUND COMPANY PUT DOWN ROOTS. NOW IT BUILDS SYSTEMS 
FOR MAJOR ARENAS AND CONCERT HALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to picture middle-aged, clean-cut Fred Curdts as a roadie for the 
Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. 
</P>
<P>
 But there he was, riding the soundboard, touring the country, listening to 
"Mr. Bojangles" for the umpteenth time. 
</P>
<P>
 Orleans, Livingston Taylor, Jonathan Edwards and others used Curdts' 
equipment. But the former musician eventually gave up his touring sound company 
for a more stable life at a Baltimore audio company. Then he and two co-workers 
struck out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was Signal Perfection Ltd., which in 2 1/2 years in business has 
installed sound systems at the new Boston Garden, the Grand Ole Opry and a 
variety of other arenas and concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Curdts, 41, put aside a budding rock music career to go into the sound 
business. In the early 1970s, his band Morningstar, for which he played guitar, 
was starting to become successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred has actually cut a couple of albums. (Billboard magazine) said his band 
was going to take over from Crosby, Stills & Nash. Obviously, it didn't 
happen," said partner and co-founder Chad Gillenwater. 
</P>
<P>
 After giving up the band, Curdts spent several years as a roadie during what 
he called "a wonderful time, the post-Woodstock area. Festivals were popping up 
all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The quiet Penn State civil engineering graduate now handles the electronic 
engineering side of his company. Gillenwater handles the financial side while a 
third co-founder, William Parry, concentrates on marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high-tech nature of the job, most of the company's employees got 
into the business through their love of music and show biz, Curdts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been into music and then into studios and then into designing and 
building traveling sound systems. That's how Will and I got into the business 
of touring sound systems," Curdts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curdts and Parry met at Maryland Sound Industries, where they worked after 
selling their separate touring sound businesses. The pair met Gillenwater after 
Maryland Sound formed an audio installation division. The three left to form 
their own company in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Curdts' life is now more mainstream than it was 20 years ago. He lives in 
Silver Spring with his wife, Leigh, and their year-old son, Evan. However, he 
is often still sent on a moment's notice across the country to trouble-shoot 
audio problems threatening to cancel the show at an arena or stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held Signal Perfection expects to complete $8 million in 
projects this year. Gillenwater said the company expects to level off at the 
$10-million range and retain earnings for several years to finance future 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillenwater estimates the company is in the top 20% of audio firms nationwide 
and the largest company specializing in high-performance installations in 
arenas, concert halls and similar venues. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly are not the biggest, but that in itself is not a liability. 
They do extremely professional work that is on the cutting edge of the audio 
industry," said James Beattie, general sales manager at Crown International 
Inc. in Elkhart, Ind. His company produces amplifiers and microphones used by 
Signal Perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pay a lot of attention to detail. They are looking at long-term 
excellence in design," Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signal Perfection's reputation persuaded the Boston Symphony Orchestra to use 
the company to install a new audio system at its Tanglewood Hall, and symphony 
officials are pleased with the results, spokesman Bob Gleason said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their craftsmanship of installation and wiring sets an industry standard," he 
said. "In short, if they are not the leader in the industry, I do not know who 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 However, maintaining that lead will not be easy, according to one industry 
watcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The audio-visual equipment and installation business is growing, but changing 
quickly as video, audio and computer technologies merge, said Dick Larson, 
editor of the Communications Industry Report, a magazine produced by the 
International Communications Industries Assn. in Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "In communications, everything is coming together. They're all merging into 
one industry, so there's a demand for companies that can come with a 
communications system and tell a customer how their system will work with all 
of these other systems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curdts was among the first to begin using computers to control the amplifiers 
driving the large speakers often seen hanging in clusters from the roofs of 
arenas, Beattie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Controlling the amplifier with a computer allows placing it closer to the 
speaker, shortening the amount of speaker wire needed and cutting resistance, 
which produces a cleaner signal, Curdts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the first ones to do it, and now we're kind of growing with the 
trend," Curdts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes in the industry also mean that stadiums and other large projects 
that take several years to complete often need their audio system plans changed 
as new technology makes older equipment obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for someone who started lugging soundboards, and plugging analog 
amplifiers and equalizers together, the computerized digital future doesn't 
worry Curdts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all read science fiction, so of course we expected it," he said.

LOCKOUT FORCES DISNEY TO SHUFFLE DUCK FRONT OFFICE; BUSINESS: PARENT COMPANY 
RECASTS ITS HOCKEY EMPLOYEES TO WORK IN A VARIETY OF ROLES IN THE COMMUNITY AND 
AT DISNEYLAND.

 With no end to the NHL lockout in sight, what are idled Mighty Duck front 
office employees going to do next? 
</P>
<P>
 In a twist on the Walt Disney Co. slogan, some of them are going to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are reassigning 22 of their 41 administrators and other staff in 
lieu of layoffs, and eight workers are being sent across the Orange Freeway 
(57) to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to be sweeping or dressed up as Dumbo or working on the 
rides," said Bill Robertson, Ducks director of public relations. "They'll be 
working in administrative jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson will work with young hockey players in Disney's GOALS charity 
hockey program. Wilson and his staff might also work with the Anaheim Junior 
Ducks, a teen-aged developmental team loosely affiliated with the Ducks, or the 
San Diego Gulls, the Ducks' minor league affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Television commentator Brian Hayward and radio commentator Charlie Simmer, 
both former NHL players, also will work with youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipment manager Mark O'Neill and his assistant, John Allaway, will be 
assigned to help stock three new stores that will sell team merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might be making deliveries," O'Neill said. "But I'd rather stay busy than 
sit around. We've already reorganized and inventoried everything. A few guys 
come by and get their skates sharpened, but mostly we show up here for half a 
day then go play golf and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 The workers will continue to earn their full pay from the team while 
performing duties for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It beats the hell out of the alternative -- laying people off," Ducks 
President Tony Tavares said. "They were going to get to the point of boredom 
and I had to make a choice whether to keep them busy or lay people off. 
Fortunately we're in a company where we can cross-utilize people. I feel badly 
for the other companies that don't have that option." 
</P>
<P>
 The moves, most of which will take effect next week, are one indication that 
few people think the lockout will end soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this says is we're not going to just sit around in anticipation of that 
happening," Tavares said. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-ranking administrative employee who will take another assignment 
is Bill Holford, director of sales and marketing. Holford will work three days 
a week with Disneyland in marketing and ticket sales while continuing to work 
with the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Seltzer, the team's director of broadcasting, and associate producers 
Mark Vittorio and Tim Davis probably will do some work for Disney-owned KCAL 
Channel 9. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two more Ducks, defensemen Tom Kurvers and David Williams, are seeking 
unemployment benefits during the NHL lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurvers, a 10-year veteran who was scheduled to make $450,000 this season, 
filed an unemployment claim in New York because he was employed by the 
Islanders the last three years before being traded in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there will be people out there who don't quite understand, but a lot 
of people don't understand the issues unless they're directly involved," 
Kurvers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any complaints with my income, (but) I, or my employer, has paid 
into the system for 10 years, and I'm out of work. I'm a hockey player and I'm 
seeking to be employed as a hockey player. I have a contract and I'm not being 
allowed to work. I think I'm entitled to it. I certainly think (past employer 
payroll contributions) have covered it." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has played parts of three seasons in the NHL and was scheduled 
to make $250,000, filed in California, one of about 20 states that consider 
locked out employees eligible for unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Don McSween filed an earlier claim, becoming the first NHL player 
seeking to collect benefits. He is still waiting to hear if his claim will be 
approved.

FULLERTON UNION DISTRICT REJECTS PROPOSED O.C. SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fullerton Union High School District would not join an Orange County 
athletic section, Superintendent Kenneth Jones said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo sent to the State Federated Council, State Commissioner Tom Byrnes 
and the commissioners of California's 10 sections, Fullerton officials said 
there was "no compelling" reasons to join a new section. It said that, with the 
current information, the district's six high schools -- Buena Park, Fullerton, 
La Habra, Sonora, Sunny Hills and Troy -- would remain in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our principals are unanimously against it and so are our athletic directors," 
Jones said. "At this time it is not possible for Fullerton to become part of 
the proposed section." 
</P>
<P>
 The State Federated Council will take action on a proposal Friday that would 
allow the county's 75 schools to break from the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo was sent Wednesday and came from a staff report, which Jones 
requested. The report expressed concerns about the lack of information 
regarding playoff formats, competitive equity, administration and finances. 
Jones said in the memo "the disadvantages outweighed potential benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton schools are the latest defection and the most significant. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 15 small private schools already have chosen to remain in the 
Southern Section. An official at a Catholic high school said Mater Dei, the 
county's largest Catholic school, will stay with the Southern Section. Mater 
Dei officials deny a decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 But the loss of the Fullerton schools would be more devastating because it 
involves public schools. It would leave an Orange County section with 54 
schools, and damages the united front of county superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County superintendents will meet Friday to review the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen of the county's 15 public school districts have passed resolutions 
supporting a county section. Fullerton and Anaheim, which has eight schools, 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Grennan, Anaheim superintendent, and Jones sent out a joint memo to 
the Federated Council three weeks ago asking that the state take action on its 
strategic plan before making any changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The state strategic planning committee has yet to release its report. It is 
not expected to contain criteria for the formation of sections, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton announcement comes at a time when supporters of the proposal are 
attempting to gather support for Friday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Council, which has 26 of the 104 votes on the State 
Federated Council, voted overwhelmingly last week not to support the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Section and Sacramento-San Joaquin Section officials have 
indicated they would support an Orange County section. The Northern Section is 
leaning in favor of supporting the proposal. The North Coast Section has 
indicated it would vote against the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the proposal down 10 votes, 37-27, with 40 undecided votes.

AND THE LAST SHALL BE THE FIRST? ASK LOS ALAMITOS, ESPERANZA; FOOTBALL: AFTER 
LOSING TO THE AZTECS IN 1991, THE GRIFFINS STARTED AN UNBEATEN STREAK THAT HAS 
REACHED 42 GAMES. THEY MEET AGAIN TONIGHT.

 There was nothing surprising, nor much memorable, about that night. Certainly, 
no eyebrows were raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza merely cruised to another victory, a 28-7 romp over Los Alamitos. 
Victory No. 21 in a streak that would reach 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were banged up pretty good and I think we returned a kickoff for 
a touchdown," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. "But I really don't remember that 
much about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Who does? But who knew the significance? 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins have not lost since, an unbeaten streak that has reached 42 games 
heading into tonight's Sunset League showdown against Esperanza (7 o'clock, 
Long Beach Veterans Stadium). Los Alamitos is the most successful program of 
the last three seasons, with three Southern Section titles to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza and Los Alamitos have played four times since that night and the 
Griffins have dominated. Los Alamitos is 3-0-1 since. The closest the Aztecs 
came was a 14-14 tie in the 1992 Division II title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos leads the series 8-6-1. The unbeaten streak, which includes 21 
consecutive victories, is closing in on the section record of 46, held by 
Temple City (1969-73) and Canyon Country Canyon (1983-86). 
</P>
<P>
 But no one saw it coming on the night of Oct. 25, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked off the field that night saying, 'Man those guys are really good,' " 
Barnes said. "If we'd had played them for 20 hours, nothing would have changed 
except they would have had a lot more points." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs gained 349 yards, 199 rushing with their wing-T offense. Garrick 
Emery rushed for 116 yards. Jeff Gaeta gained 52 and Marcus Tayui 42. They did 
it without three starting offensive linemen, who were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos hung close for a while. Junior Tim Carey -- the last Griffin 
quarterback to lose a game -- passed for 197 yards. George Sagen caught six 
passes for 77 yards and intercepted a pass. Running back Marchant Wright gained 
70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Griffins could not overcome three turnovers or an 83-yard kickoff 
return by Esperanza's Ryan Corbett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we played a perfect first half, but the kickoff return broke our 
backs," Barnes said. "We couldn't beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins were having trouble beating anyone. True, they were 5-0 after 
nonleague play. But that record was a bit deceiving. They were still adjusting 
to the run-and-shoot offense, which at times shot itself in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blocking in it real well and we were coaching it real well," Barnes 
said. "We had been getting by on big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, meanwhile, was king of the hill. The Aztecs were defending Division 
III champions and on their way to a second league title. They also were ranked 
No. 1 in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had back-to-back freshmen classes that were exceptional," Meek said. "High 
school athletics are like that. We had a great run in 1990-91-92." 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins (7-0, 2-0) are now having theirs. It came from humble beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Esperanza loss left them 0-2 in Empire League play, and they were in 
jeopardy of missing the playoffs. The Griffins had been shut out, 7-0, by El 
Dorado the previous week, the first time they had been shut out in 50 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins struggled and barely beat Katella, 9-3, the week after the 
Esperanza game. They ended the season against Loara and needed a two-point 
conversion to pull off a 14-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly the makings of a dynasty. In fact, the Griffins were looking at a coin 
toss just to get an automatic berth into the Division III playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos beat Loara on a Thursday. Those two teams would be tied for 
second with El Dorado, if the Golden Hawks beat Katella the following night. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes, fatigued, didn't attend. But two Griffin assistants went to watch and 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 9:30 a.m. the phone rings and I knew immediately what it was," Barnes 
said. "I said, 'El Dorado lost.' Barry (Sher) said, 'Yeah.' My only comment 
was, 'Oh man.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins routed Burbank, beat Hawthorne in overtime and rallied to defeat 
Newhall Hart in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 It set up a rematch with the Aztecs. This time the Griffins won, 8-0, stopping 
the Aztecs' 27-game winning streak -- the second longest in Orange County 
history -- and propelled the Griffins on theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a young team," Barnes said. "We weren't ready for the power they 
brought at us the first time. Seven weeks later, we were." 
</P>
<P>
 And they have been ever since. ESPERANZA VS. LOS ALAMITOS

 Clay McKnight of Mater Dei orally committed to play basketball at UC Irvine, 
Monarch Athletic Director Gary McKnight said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fortunate to see a lot of kids come through our school and earn 
scholarships," said Gary McKnight, also Mater Dei's basketball coach."But it's 
kind of neat to see it happen for your own son. It's an exciting time for our 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Irvine Coach) Rod Baker did a great job working with us and Clay will get a 
real chance to play right away." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight, a 6-foot-2 guard, averaged 14.6 points and shot 54% from the field 
for Mater Dei last season. The Monarchs finished 33-1 and won the Southern 
Section Division I-A championship before losing to Los Angeles Crenshaw in the 
Southern California Regional Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight, a second-team Times All-County selection, was the South Coast League 
most valuable player and made 49% (95 of 192) of his three-pointers and 86% of 
his free throws last season. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

KEEPING TRACK / JASON REID: DRAFT STAYS IN CONSTANT MOTION AT STANFORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adjusting to college courses and dorm life is enough to freak out the most 
mature freshman, so imagine a guy's psyche after dealing with all that and four 
position changes in his first seven games of major Division I-A football. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that's a full schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Stanford's Chris Draft, versatility is something he possessed 
long before he arrived in Palo Alto. Draft is playing all over the field as a 
true freshman for the Cardinal, at various times lining up at inside 
linebacker, outside linebacker and strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 But get this: Stanford recruited the former Valencia High standout to carry 
the ball. It all makes for a dizzying early college experience -- one Draft 
revels in.  
</P>
<P>
 "That first week (of practice) was tough because I had a lot to get used to," 
Draft said. "(Playing defense) was a big adjustment for me because (the 
coaching staff) told me I was only going to play offense when they recruited 
me, and I expected to play offense, but it's going all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Draft is being modest. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford relies on many freshmen and sophomores, partly explaining the 376.3 
yards per game it allows. Stanford's defense is seventh overall in the Pacific 
10 Conference and ninth against the run (187.9 yards per game). 
</P>
<P>
 However, Draft's play has been mostly solid. He's 6 feet 2, 215 pounds, and as 
swift and powerful as his frame leads one to suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft has started two games, one at strong safety and one at outside 
linebacker, and he has played in every game for Stanford, 2-4-1, 1-3 in the 
Pac-10. He is seventh on the team in tackles with 25 (18 solo, seven assists), 
has two sacks and is an integral member of the special teams unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling was that Chris is so precocious we needed to get him in the 
lineup," Stanford defensive coordinator Fred vonAppen said. "That's not the 
ideal scenario for a freshman, obviously, but our needs dictated we move him 
around into a variety of places." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's coaches have switched him to inside linebacker for Saturday's game 
against UCLA at the Rose Bowl. He's No. 2 on the depth chart at right inside 
linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft had a fine high school career at Valencia, rushing for 3,038 in three 
varsity seasons. He helped the Tigers win consecutive Southern Section Division 
VI championships (1991-92) and shared The Times 1993 Orange County player of 
the year award with Tony Gonzalez of Huntington Beach, now a tight end at 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior, Draft rushed for 1,338 yards and scored 24 touchdowns. On 
defense, he finished third on the team in tackles and had nine sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Draft could have received a free education from almost any school, but choose 
Stanford partly because of the advice of a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Vickers, then a freshman, encouraged Draft to attend Stanford when Draft 
visited Palo Alto on a recruiting trip. Vickers, a standout at Rancho Alamitos, 
has since left school to devote time to a controversial Garden Grove church. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shocking," Draft said of Vickers' departure. "He was one of the guys 
telling me how great it was here." 
</P>
<P>
 Draft, though, plans to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like my classes," he said. "There are a lot of cool people in my dorm and 
the social life is a lot better than I thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been losing a lot, and that's hard, but we've got a good team. We just 
haven't clicked yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Setting the pace: Before this season, Mike Maceranka hadn't taken a snap from 
center since the fourth game of his senior year at Laguna Hills in 1991, but 
his timing has been great for Pace University. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first start at quarterback, Maceranka helped Pace, a Division II school 
in Pleasantville, N.Y., break a 15-game losing streak with a 28-24 victory over 
Division I-AA Iona on Oct. 8. Oh, how they partied at Pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was crazy," Maceranka said. "I mean, really, it was just like we won the 
Super Bowl around here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Greg Lusardi: "It was huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Maceranka, a redshirt sophomore transfer from Boise State, fractured his left 
collarbone three times in 1991. The final break occurred when Maceranka, 
playing safety, intercepted a pass to seal Laguna Hills' 35-28 victory over 
Trabuco Hills in the 1991 Division VII title game. 
</P>
<P>
 A starter at strong safety all season, Maceranka pleaded with Lusardi to let 
him play quarterback after the Setters' third game. At that point, they were 
0-3 and had been outscored, 77-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Maceranka completed six of 10 passes for 102 yards and no interceptions. He 
ran the Setters' complicated wing-T offense better than, well, anybody had in 
the previous 15 games, rushing for 51 yards and setting up the team's four 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Maceranka started at strong safety. He intercepted a pass, 
returned it 13 yards and made four tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to put in numbers what he meant to the team that day," Lusardi 
said. "He definitely led us to that victory. His play was the key to the game." 
</P>

 Keeping Track is a regular column in The Times following the progress of 
former Orange County athletes competing at colleges elsewhere.

YOUNG WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER GRAPPLE WITH EXTRA DOSE OF DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For five years, the pair had been inseparable, a dazzling combination of 
contrasting good looks: Gina Shafonsky, the sporty blond; Lynne Stan, an 
elegant, leggy brunette. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the "Salt and Pepper Package" by other models, they booked jobs in 
Hawaii, San Francisco and Las Vegas, and, in the process, became fast friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like we were sisters," remembers Shafonsky of Newport Beach. "We 
tried to sell ourselves together as a package, rather than individually. It was 
a great friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 When Stan was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 28, Shafonsky was 
heartbroken. As Stan withered from the effects of the disease, Shafonsky stayed 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan died Nov. 14, 1992, just one month past her 30th birthday. She was 
survived by her mother and father, two brothers and a sister. And a dear 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafonsky, now a volunteer for the American Cancer Society in Orange County, 
golfed Monday in Stan's memory at a breast cancer benefit in Huntington Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought breast cancer was for older women," she says. "I never knew it 
could touch someone so young." 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer, traumatic for women of any age, can be devastating for women in 
their 20s who may lack the life experiences and sturdy support systems to help 
them cope with the disease, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some young women are learning of the dangers of breast cancer and the 
importance of self-examination, regular doctor visits and -- for those with a 
family history of the disease -- early mammography. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in Orange County are trying to help by offering awareness programs and 
a new support group targeting young women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though they are very small in number, (young women with breast cancer) 
are very important," says Hoda Anton-Culver, director of cancer surveillance at 
UC Irvine. ". . . The number of years lost, the severity of the disease, the 
fact that it's . . . more (often) hereditary, make them more important to be 
looked at for prevention and control." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society says one in nine women will develop breast cancer 
in their lifetime and 46,000 women will die of the disease this year. The 
chances of contracting it depend on a variety of factors, including age and 
family history. One percent of all breast cancer victims are men. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Young women, feeling less 
threatened by the disease, may slough off regular self-examinations and 
recommended checkups by their doctors, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, mammography -- the most powerful tool for early detection of 
breast cancer -- is less effective in spotting potential cancers in young 
women, because their breast tissue is so dense. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree about what risk factors should prompt young women to have 
early mammographies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dava F. Gerard, medical director of the Breast Health Center in Santa Ana, 
says young women should consider themselves in a higher risk category if they 
have a sister or mother with the disease. Young African American women also 
have a higher incidence of breast cancer, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Anton-Culver, who is also chief of epidemiology at UC Irvine's Department of 
Medicine, says women should also take into consideration an incidence of breast 
cancer in aunts and grandmothers, on either side of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 These young women, she says, should pinpoint the age that their relative was 
diagnosed and schedule their first mammography 10 years before that age. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is an imperfect tool for cancer detection in young women, that 
X-ray technique, combined with a careful breast examination, offers the best 
chance at early detection, she says, adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "If a young woman has a positive familial history of breast cancer, she should 
not dismiss that fact. She cannot say, 'I'm too young for breast cancer,' 
because that is not true." 
</P>
<P>
 American Cancer Society statistics say one woman in 2,426 will develop breast 
cancer by age 30; by age 50, that risk rises to one in 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the incidence of breast cancer is lower for young women, the stakes 
may in some ways be higher. Since young women often do not consider themselves 
breast cancer candidates, they may be diagnosed at a later stage when the 
disease is more aggressive and the mortality rate is higher, Anton-Culver says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so shocking when it happens in women that young," says oncology nurse 
Nancy Raymon. "It doesn't fit the norm." Raymon launched a breast cancer 
support group at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana this month. Although the 
group includes women in their early 40s, it will focus particularly on issues 
affecting women in their 20s and 30s, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the disease poses keen emotional trials for young women, who are 
just beginning to establish their families, careers and romantic relationships. 
And although husbands are likely to stick with their mates, young boyfriends 
very often do not. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult on a relationship to go through aggressive treatment for 
cancer," says Donna Farris, who with Raymon is planning a breast cancer 
survivor retreat called Healing Odyssey in Santa Barbara next month. "That's 
kind of a repeated theme we've heard among the younger women." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have not married yet may be especially horrified at the prospect of 
losing a breast. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lynne (Stan) couldn't even comprehend that," says her friend Shafonsky. "In 
your 20s, you're still young and dating and your appearance is a little more 
important -- or you think it is -- than when you're in your 30s and you start 
to realize the physical appearance is not everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Young mothers have the added burden of juggling children and chemotherapy 
treatments -- and with wondering what will become of their offspring if they 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial is not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 La Trice Mack, then 27, learned she had cancer in the milk ducts of her 
breasts on March 25, 1993. She had been bleeding from her right nipple for 
about three weeks but could not see it as something serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was nothing, there was no lump," she says. Then, "one day, it 
bled through my shirt at work and the ladies I work with demanded I call my 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, cancer did not occur to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cancer, right, yeah," she now says, in a tone sarcastic and disbelieving. 
"That was the last thing on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack's mastectomy and breast reconstruction was scheduled for May 10, two days 
before her 28th birthday. Next, she underwent seven months of aggressive 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got really sick," she says. She spent a long time in the hospital. "I'm a 
single parent. I was really having a hard time." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends who "just couldn't handle it" began staying away, she says. Mack's 
young daughter moved in with her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she has been taking tamoxifen -- a hormone blocker commonly given to 
women with breast cancer -- the Van Nuys resident now experiences hot flashes, 
night sweats and other symptoms of menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 Being fast-forwarded into midlife is a jagged experience for one not yet 
through her 20s. And Mack, whose father had four sisters with breast cancer, 
admits she has not made peace with this new reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like someone's pushing the remote control, and it's not me," she says. 
"Women our age are supposed to be so together in these times. We're supposed to 
be in control and very independent." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack, who once bowled and taught aerobics, works as a hospital clerk and has 
enrolled in college and is hurriedly reading the classics, currently, John 
Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things I didn't do and I want to do it," she says. "I might not 
live to see 30. I want to sky dive and bungee jump. I want to go to Paris." 
</P>
<P>
 In what could be another turn of bad news, Mack says recent tests indicate the 
cancer may have resurfaced in her body. On Friday, she plans to consult with a 
new doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other options," she says. "I know there have to be other options." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society says that women 20 and older should do monthly 
breast self-examinations and that women 20 to 40 should be examined by their 
physicians every three years. Mammographies are recommended every one or two 
years for women from 40 through 49 and annually for women 50 and over. A 
base-line mammography should be done by age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Vancil, director of cancer control for the American Cancer Society in 
Orange County, says these guidelines are intended for women who have no 
symptoms and no known risk of breast cancer. All other women should consult 
with their doctors to determine the appropriate screening schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that caught early, breast cancer is more than 95% curable, using 
techniques such as lumpectomy, radiation, mastectomy and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan, whose maternal aunt is a breast cancer survivor, had fought the disease 
with chemotherapy, but it was a battle that did not begin until the disease had 
already progressed, her father, Lou Stan, says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought was there that we were going to lose her, but we didn't want to 
face the reality it could happen," he says, squinting in the bright sunshine at 
the breast cancer benefit Monday. "She kept telling me she was going to pull 
out of it: 'Don't worry Dad.' She was so strong, I couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before she died, Shafonsky and another friend took Stan to a 
waterfront restaurant for her 30th birthday dinner. She ordered prime rib, her 
favorite. She was thin and weak but ate most of her meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great day on the water, the sun was out, she was able to walk to and 
from the car," says Shafonsky. "The will to live was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Losing Stan has made Shafonsky -- and Stan's other young friends -- both 
sadder and wiser. They no longer feel immune to breast cancer, a disease that 
had once seemed remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told all my girlfriends," says Shafonsky. "We've taught each other and 
told each other how to do the self-examination. It's unfortunate we lost Lynn, 
but we've all learned a great deal about breast cancer."

PARTY LINES; A BIG NIGHT OUT CAN PRESENT A BIG PROBLEM FOR GUESTS WHO OVERSTEP 
THE BOUNDS OF ACCEPTED DRESS. ORANGE COUNTY IS MORE RELAXED THAN SOME AREAS, 
BUT THERE ARE RULES TO AVOID BEING THE OBJECT OF ATTENTION FOR ALL THE WRONG 
REASONS. 
</P>

 They are the fashion victims of Orange County's social scene: 
</P>
<P>
 There's the society matron who overdresses for every opening night at the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center. There's the woman who attends an opera 
ball looking like she just left the office. And there are a few female guests 
who turn up at the Newport Harbor Art Museum's Black and White Bash every year 
and impress the crowd not by what they're wearing, but by what they're not 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the dress code for Orange County's social engagements is more relaxed 
than in areas such as New York, there are some rules of social dressing worth 
following lest one end up the object of attention for all the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, when the invitation calls for black-tie attire, a man is safe in a 
tuxedo and a woman can usually wear a short or long dress. When in doubt, opt 
for a long gown, says Gayle Anderson, chief of protocol for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm personally more comfortable in long -- it's a little safer," she says. 
"But in modern times, a woman can wear a short dress. We're becoming a more 
casual society." 
</P>
<P>
 At some black-tie events, women can even get away with wearing palazzos. 
</P>
<P>
 Never wear work attire to a black-tie function, as one woman did to an Opera 
Pacific ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wore a suit. Oh, what a faux pas," says Anderson, a former opera ball 
chairwoman. "If you're going to do that, you'd be better off not to go." 
</P>
<P>
 White-tie events are rare in Orange County -- they're usually reserved for 
extremely formal weddings and an occasional ball. Still, when the invitation 
says "white tie," even in laid-back Southern California men are expected to don 
a tuxedo with tails and a white tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Dark suits are not appropriate for a white-tie event, although they can be 
worn to some black-tie affairs. Women should wear their fanciest ball gowns to 
white-tie functions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to have a really formal event to go to a few times a year. It's fun 
to see what you really look like in all that stuff," says Gael Lauritzen, owner 
of 341 Bayside in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocktail attire means sport coats or suits for men and short dresses or 
pantsuits for women, Lauritzen says. The trouble starts when there's a vague 
dress code tacked onto the invitation, such as "dressy casual," "casual 
elegance" or the nebulous "California chic." One person's idea of casual might 
be blue jeans, while another's can be a suit or sparkling strapless dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Any mention of casual or California signals that clothes should be relaxed, 
colorful and not too structured, but made of a fine material, such as silk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs some comfort level, and it needs some glamour. It's not casual 
sloppy," says Billur Wallerich, spokeswoman for South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. 
"That's when you bring out your silk palazzo pants and tunic. The fabrics are 
drapey rather than stiff." 
</P>
<P>
 For women, silk pantsuits work well for such occasions. Men can wear a dark 
suit and leave the ties at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Still confused? The invitation, gala theme, season and location of the event 
offer clues to expected dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in doubt, wear black," says Catherine Thyen, chairwoman of this 
year's Candlelight Concert to benefit the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
"Choose a dress with a simple line and pearls, and you can get away with 
anything. You'll be pretty tame-looking among all the peacocks, but at least 
you won't be a peacock among swans."

BY DESIGN; CLOSET RX; EXPRESS MALE COSTUMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guys aren't immune to fear, especially at Halloween. Last week we took a look 
at how women could respond to a last-minute invitation to a costume party. Now 
it's the man's turn -- what can he pull out of his closet to turn into a great 
costume? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, you're somewhat of a pack rat," says Matt Blanchard of Polo Ralph 
Lauren in Costa Mesa. "If you still have a lot of clothing in your closet that 
you haven't tossed out yet, you could pull together a great outfit." 
</P>
<P>
 A retro costume can be created from a few items you may not have thrown away. 
"If you're lucky enough to still have a leisure suit, you can turn into '70s 
disco-man," Blanchard says. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if your closet is relatively bare, you still might have the makings of a 
clever look.  
</P>
<P>
 "A suit, a newspaper, maybe some glasses and a bottle of antacid and you can 
become a stockbroker," says Mark Schell of Mark Schell Designs for Men in 
Corona del Mar, who also suggests a pair of swim trunks, an American flag and 
slicked-back hair to appear as an Olympic swimmer or a trench coat and shoes to 
show up as a flasher.  
</P>
<P>
 Tight slacks that are a little too short and a polo-style shirt that's a 
little too small can be accessorized with cans of talcum powder and beer and . 
. . you're a bowler, just add a ball bag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to step back and really give your costume some thought," says 
clothing designer Blaine Kiel of San Clemente. "The details make a great 
costume." 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular and easy look for Halloween is the nerd. "Take your loudest 
shirt and button it to the neck, add a pen protector and horn-rimmed glasses," 
Blanchard says.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because the retro look is in, you can also make yourself look like a cast 
member from 'Grease.' " Slick your hair back, wear jeans and a leather jacket 
and don't forget to stop on your way to the party for a cigarette pack you can 
roll up the arm of your T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Still have memories of that first job? If you have hidden away the vest, bow 
tie and name tag you received working as a movie usher, add a flashlight and 
show people to the party. If you've kept private the fact that you once worked 
at a fast-food restaurant that required you to wear a hat with a big chicken 
hanging off it, now's the time to pull it out and reveal something about your 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a costume is hard to recognize without the addition of a little 
padding. "Wear a white short-sleeved shirt, clunky blue slacks, carry a beer 
can and you could be anybody," says Kiel. "Add a small pillow to give you a 
spare tire and you can turn yourself into Homer Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who favor a quick costume a little less than tasteful, try the 
Forrest Gump: Wear high-water pants, a bow tie and carry a box of candy. Stuff 
shrimp in your pockets to be a little more outrageous.

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: BY DESIGN; THE ART OF CRAFTS; TO SOME IT'S JUST A HOBBY, 
BUT TO PROFESSIONALS IT'S CREATIVE LICENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 'Tis the season when holiday bazaars bombard every town with their unique, 
handmade creations. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the '70s, when every mom dabbled in decoupage and macrame, the term 
craft has taken a few downturns into a realm that has less to do with talent or 
skill and more to do with hot glue guns and following manual instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, some artists aren't letting the true meaning of craft become 
extinct. Friday and Saturday, 38 such craftspeople will display their work at 
the Artistic License Fair at Estancia Park in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the artisans had been a part of the illustrious Denwar Craft Fair, an 
annual forum that for 28 years drew 5,000 patrons each year. But when founders 
Jo and Esther Dendel retired, its participants decided to continue the 
tradition in the form of the Artistic License Fair. Responsibility was given to 
Nancy Gary, a Corona weaver and jewelry artist who also represents other 
artists under the Artistic License name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The caliber of this show is very high," Gary says. "We look for a particular 
quality and professionalism. We don't take someone who would do it on the side 
as a hobby." 
</P>
<P>
 Jewelry, leather work and garments made of hand-dyed and hand-woven fabrics 
are among the fashionable finds, in addition to works of ceramic, paper, wood 
and handblown glass. "Many patrons who attend this fair collect works by these 
artists," Gary notes. "So there's a real eagerness and excitement for this 
fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Entrants, who come from throughout California and other states, are judged by 
a panel of eight veteran members. This weekend's exhibitors represent a range 
of styles reflecting age-old techniques and modern applications. Three local 
participants are Vesta Ward, Joanell Connolly and Georgia Allen. Georgia Allen  
</P>
<P>
 Art glass and ceramics are usually linked more with accessorizing the home 
than a wardrobe. But what if it can do both? Filling that order is jewelry 
maker Georgia Allen of North Tustin, whose necklaces, pins and other pieces are 
considered art to display as well as art to wear. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who appeared at the Denwar Fair for eight years, assembles items she 
finds or fashions into collages of elements that include everything from shells 
to antique pewter buttons. But what distinguishes her work from other montage 
jewelry is her heavy use of clay pieces she shapes, imprints and glazes, and 
the pieces of colored glass -- from discarded shards handblown by herself or by 
friends to pieces of broken wine bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 A necklace might connect iridescent purple glass, copper beads, antique Czech 
beads, amethyst, Mohave agate, pressed silver, ceramic balls and Dutch coins. 
Or a pin can feature mustard-colored glass from a wine bottle, antique brass 
buttons, granulated African beads and a tiny shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recycle," she says, wryly. "I see everything as a resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a former librarian, says she never fit in art classes because she was 
constantly going against prescribed or favored methods. "Glassmakers usually 
like the fluidity of glass. I prefer sharp edges, so I was considered the rebel 
of my class." 
</P>
<P>
 She has taken bits of information from classes and tips from friends and 
incorporated them into her unorthodox approach to design. 
</P>
<P>
 To maintain that sharp yet polished edge, Allen cooks glass shards at low heat 
in her kiln, which liquefies the glass just enough. Cracks and chips are left 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of her ceramic pendants and beads look like they're straight out of an 
archeological dig. She presses found objects and tidbits from nature and 
saturates them in rich color. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use any set principles of artistic design," says Allen, whose pins, 
barrettes, necklaces and earrings run from $20 to $120. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally seat of the pants. I just keep adding until it's finished. You 
can't take anything out without spoiling it or add anything without overdoing 
it." Joanell Connolly 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration doesn't always have a source. For Huntington Beach designer 
Joanell Connolly, it's been an "unexplained lifelong urge to always paint on 
silk." 
</P>
<P>
 The former social worker found teachers and supplies and did what she could do 
to pay for her "expensive silk habit." Today, her interest has become a 
full-time enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Her scarves, vests, earrings, ties and kimono-like gowns have attracted the 
attention of clients who share Connolly's affection for a vivid palette. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the colors. That's why I enjoy playing with vintage Japanese kimonos 
or Guatemalan weaves," she says, referring to the piecework she occasionally 
focuses on when she needs a break from painting silk. "Working with those 
textiles actually inspires me to go back to silk." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a flow and movement to her patterns even when the yardage is laid out 
on the grand table in her family room-turned-studio. Gem tones bleed into each 
other or are splattered like raindrops on once-white silk. She applies "lots of 
big motion" when brushing on the dyes and uses wax blocks to create more 
specific designs. The result is couture-quality fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 For her men's ties ($44), Connolly prepares the fabric and sends it to a 
tailor. Scarves ($30 to $150), kimonos ($300 and up) and vests ($125 and up) 
are made on the standard sewing machine and industrial over-lock machines in 
her studio. She also uses scraps to cover earrings ($12). 
</P>
<P>
 Connolly says: "It's the process of painting that's so exciting. I have no 
idea what the end product will be. But once a fabric is done, I want to move on 
to another." Vesta Ward  
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of the Denwar show for 25 years, Vesta Ward is revered among its 
participants and the many students she taught at junior colleges countywide 
from 1965 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This Orange artist takes gold and sterling silver and turns them into 
miniature sculptures for fingers, wrists or decolletage. 
</P>
<P>
 Each piece reveals or hints at its inspiration: labyrinthine English gardens, 
dry bones, dripping candle wax, cobblestone paths, the bottom of a lake, the 
rings in disrupted water, folded fabric, coral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in the Rockies and have always been interested in how wood 
grows, water flows, how nature evolves," Ward says. "So I am always trying to 
capture it." 
</P>
<P>
 Extensive travel -- including crossing the poles nine times and visiting 
China, Russia, Turkey, Egypt and Japan -- contributed to her bank of 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each ring has an interesting history and spirit. Everything I do I invest 
(with) a certain energy and love. I just explore when I'm working on 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 That adventure may include colorizing silver with liver of sulfur, detergent 
and ammonia. Lapis lazuli, pearls, garnets, moonstones and amethysts also find 
a place in Ward's jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Her silver rings, pendants, pins and bracelets range from $25 to $125. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while Ward was getting her master's at Cal State Fullerton during the 
late '60s that she shelved mosaics for three-dimensional art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did three rings that were ghastly. And from then on I knew what I wanted to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades later, her hands reveal the effects of arthritis, but that 
hasn't deterred her or changed her work. 
</P>
<P>
 She "putters" at the four stations in an impressive home studio, following the 
process from start to finish. There, the fruits of her explorations fill cases 
and boxes.

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; THAT MIGHT BE A WRAP; WRITER SAYS HER 
'GREEN ICEBERGS,' IN WORLD PREMIERE AT SCR, HAS CAUGHT HOLLYWOOD'S EYE

<P>
 Bet it becomes a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the backstage buzz at South Coast Repertory now that Cecilia Fannon's 
"Green Icebergs" has had its world premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon says that "a major producer and the president of a major motion picture 
company are very interested" in the play -- a romantic comedy that takes a 
serious look at the marriages of two American couples vacationing in Tuscany. 
</P>
<P>
 The play begins with a case of mistaken identity. Jeff Allin (Justus) mistakes 
Nike Doukas (Veronica) for his wife when he enters a cafe. The two click like 
goblets of Chianti, leaving their respective spouses played by Robert-Curtis 
Brown (Claude) and Annie LaRussa (Beth) to learn they, too, have something in 
common. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannon, who lives in Newport Beach, got the idea for the play when she mistook 
a man for her husband years ago. "My husband and I were in New York doing some 
Christmas shopping -- it was one of those crowded days -- and I left him under 
a chandelier to go to the ladies' room," she said. "When I returned, I went up, 
touched him on the shoulder, and when he turned around he was 80 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this panicky feeling that 50 years had passed, that I'd fallen through 
that hole in time we hear about. So I took it to the extreme in the play." 
</P>
<P>
 After the premiere on Friday, Fannon was surrounded by theatergoers who 
related to the play's statements about mismatched couples and long-term love 
versus short-term passion. "That's the story of my life," one woman told 
Fannon. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the curtain, Fannon mingled in the theater lobby, sipping champagne 
with good friend Meg Cowles of New York ("We bumped into each other underwater 
in Aruba 25 years ago and have been friends ever since," Fannon explained) and 
her mother, Kay Drew of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Was she nervous? "Just about the reviews," said Fannon, flashing a wry smile. 
"It will probably infuriate the reviewer that an audience will laugh at such 
trash, you know?"

 Western Medical Center bash: Philanthropist Zee Allred was honored at the 
"Wild, Wild West" gala benefit for Western Medical Center in Santa Ana on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 About $100,000 was raised for the WestMed Regional Trauma Center, one of three 
regional trauma centers in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Bollman-Field of Newport Beach chaired the gala, held under a huge tent 
on the center's grounds. Field, who was once married to movie producer Ted 
("Three Men and a Baby") Field, will marry Gary Levine on Thanksgiving in her 
Harbor Ridge Home "with about 80 friends" and her three children in attendance, 
she said. Then the couple is off on a European honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, they're relaxing in Aspen. "I loved doing the event, but I needed a 
rest," Field said.

 Laguna Art Museum auction: The Laguna Art Museum ended up with about $100,000 
in its coffers from Saturday night's "Untitled: Untethered" art auction and 
buffet supper.

Plantains" by Laddie John Dill ($3,400) and Scott Schoenherr's "Everglade" 
($2,400). 
</P>
<P>

 Today's fashion headlines boldly proclaim that a new generation of designing 
women is closing the gender gap. On both sides of the Atlantic and the Pacific, 
man as fashion dictator still retains some validity, but female designers have 
reached new prominence.Much of the impetus for today's fashion creativity is 
the work of Vivienne Westwood, Rei Kawakubo, Donna Karan and others. This book 
focuses on contemporary designers from the fashion capitals of the world -- 
Paris, Milan, New York, London and Tokyo -- and also discusses international 
innovations and trends. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's true that men have dominated the fashion industry for more than a 
century, some of the most famous and creative fashion designers have been 
women. This study of women's ongoing role in fashion design presents a 
historical and critical view of the industry as it has developed and flourished 
in Europe, the United States and Japan. Insights into the contributions made by 
Coco Chanel, Claire McCardell and other famous designers are offered, as well 
as an appreciation of the work of now-forgotten innovators such as Jeanne 
Paquin.  
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Steele is the author of "Fashion and Eroticism" and "Paris Fashion: A 
Cultural History." These books are available at Barnes & Noble, Costa Mesa, and 
other area bookstores. MARIA D. LASO

A SOCIAL GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Here's a fashion guide to Orange County's social calendar: 
</P>
<P>
 Opera Ball. A dinner-dance for Opera Pacific on Saturday, the opera ball is 
"one of the most grandiose, elegant events in the county," says Gayle Anderson, 
chief of protocol for Orange County, who has served as opera ball chairwoman 
three times. "Bring out your finest ball gown." This year, however, patrons 
also need to bring out their masks -- invitations request that guests dress as 
their favorite opera characters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Candlelight Concert. For the benefit for the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center on Dec. 11, chairwoman Catherine Thyen describes attire as "black tie 
with a Christmas look." Women wear their fanciest dresses. "It's as ball gown 
as you can get," Thyen says. Ideally, both men and women will sport touches of 
red and green -- a red cummerbund and bow tie for men works nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 International Protocol Ball. Staged by the International Visitors and Protocol 
Foundation of Orange County, most party-goers to the March 18 event will follow 
the fashion lead of the members of the consular corps, who are accustomed to 
very formal black-tie galas. Men wear tuxedos, and women wear their big ball 
gowns, although long dresses are acceptable, too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Oaks Classic. The biggest mistake most people make when dressing for the 
Oaks' brunch that accompanies the equestrian competition each September is to 
don country-Western attire. Actually, "beautiful sportswear with an equestrian 
dash" is more appropriate, Thyen says. Think of going to an English hunt rather 
than a Western hoedown. She suggests a great-looking formal blazer for men and 
women, tailored pants and a cravat. "No fringe, no Western hats, no cowboy 
boots," Thyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South Coast Repertory Gala. This is a formal affair, which is why the 
appearance of pantsuits at September's Viva Teatro gala puzzled some 
party-goers. "That's definitely not the place for a pantsuit," Thyen says. The 
gala, which kicks off Orange County's social season, began as a white-tie event 
but has since been downgraded to black tie because the men were uncomfortable 
in those high collars and tails, Thyen says. Now the men don their ordinary 
tuxedos, sans the tails, while women can wear short or long dresses, although 
Thyen says a formal ball gown with full skirt is preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Museum Gala: Those who attend a gala at the Bowers or any museum must master 
the art of "creative black tie." In keeping with the spirit of the Bowers, men 
and women often wear ethnic attire such as costumes from their native lands or 
countries featured in current exhibits. For instance, at La Fiesta, the Bowers 
main black-tie fund-raiser held in September, party-goers wore 
turn-of-the-century Edwardian looks in honor of the museum's retrospective on 
California paintings. "When you deal with Bowers patrons, you're going to get a 
creative edge," says Brian Langston, spokesman for Bowers. "These are some of 
the more interesting people in the county, and they dress accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Concours d'Elegance. Elegant outdoor affairs that require a lot 
of walking such as this one held on the first Sunday in October call for "your 
best silk sportswear," says Thyen, a former chairwoman of the Concours. "Silk 
pants are fine, and comfortable shoes. Don't wear high heels. You'll be walking 
on grass."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening Night. At the Orange County Performing Arts Center, South Coast 
Repertory and other theaters, opening night fashions run the gamut from 
gorgeous dresses to jeans, Thyen says. For ballets and plays, Thyen suggests a 
short cocktail dress for women and a suit for men. Barbara Glabman, a frequent 
events chairwoman and board member of the center and SCR, offers practical 
advice for dressing for the theater: "You shouldn't wear something more to the 
theater than fits in your seat," she says. Sleeves and skirts should not invade 
another's space. "And don't wear something that rides up when you sit," Glabman 
says. KATHRYN BOLD

MATADOR ATHLETE IMPROVED; ASSAULT: VOLLEYBALL RECRUIT HEMENOVER WAS IN CRITICAL 
CONDITION AFTER BEING HIT WITH CROWBAR. 
</P>

 James Hemenover, a freshman walk-on with the Cal State Northridge volleyball 
team, is expected to be released from Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills 
today as he recovers from an attack with a tire iron that nearly killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemenover's skull was fractured when he was struck twice on the head during an 
attack and robbery last Thursday in Panorama City. After the attack, he managed 
to walk half a block to a friend's house where paramedics were summoned. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rushed to Holy Cross in critical condition where surgery was performed 
to stop bleeding in the brain area. Gari Reed, supervisor of nurses, said that 
he also broke his left middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemenover, a 6-foot-10 middle blocker who played at Valley Alternative, was 
riding his bike to meet a friend to study. He said a car pulled up and blocked 
his path, and four males and a female jumped out, grabbed him and threw him to 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailants demanded his house keys, then struck him before he could comply 
with their orders, according to Hemenover. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses helped break up the attack by yelling and running to the scene. 
According to police records Hemenover's book bag and pager were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing happened so fast," Hemenover said from his hospital room. 
"They came from nowhere and then started hitting me with the tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course I'm happy to be alive but the whole thing is disappointing. For the 
next month I have physical therapy and who knows when I can play volleyball 
again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Added Reed: "Once the pressure is released from his brain, a patient usually 
improves. He didn't have any complications with his head trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemenover only recently moved from the neighborhood where he was attacked, 
according to John Price, Northridge's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy had lived there for something like eight years, moves away and then 
when he returns three months later this happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "James is awesome. Of the all jerks out there they had to pick out one of the 
nicest guys around." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemenover attracted the attention of Price while attending summer volleyball 
camps when he was a sophomore and junior at Valley Alternative. He was an 
invited walk-on and was likely to redshirt his first season.

THE LEGEND GROWS; A DOMINANT 282-POUNDER, CSUN'S WILSON BATTLES INCONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The basketball game was decided, but what happened in the closing moments of 
that 1988 playoff became just another part of the Oscar Wilson legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar got loose on a breakaway," said Century High Coach Greg Coombs, then 
the coach at Santa Ana High, where Wilson was playing. "He was only a 
sophomore, playing in a big playoff game, but he dribbled to the free-throw 
line and just took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tossed the ball off the backboard, caught it, then dunked it. It seems 
like he came out of nowhere; everyone remembers it." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how a brawny power forward, who is now a 6-foot-3, 282-pound football 
player and the linchpin in Cal State Northridge's defensive line, could steal 
the spotlight from two of the area's top prospects six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans packed the Chapman College gymnasium to see that Southern Section 
Division 4-A semifinal featuring Simi Valley's Don MacLean -- a future UCLA and 
NBA standout -- and Santa Ana's Bobby Joyce -- one of Orange County's top 
recruits who would attend Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Wilson's athletic display that became folklore. He scored 17 points 
in the Saints' 76-61 loss to Simi Valley on that March evening, but it was the 
last two points that everyone in Santa Ana still talks about. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Santa Ana will see me and say, 'Are you the guy who had that dunk 
against Simi Valley?' " Wilson said. "It's become a running joke with some of 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Wilson's acquaintances broke his arm at school, trying to do the same 
dunk jumping off lunch tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson: "Whenever he sees me, we laugh and he says, 'You're the reason I 
broke my arm. When you sign that NFL contract, we're getting ready to sue you.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Physical potential is something Wilson has always possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Santa Ana High, he was a multisport star who earned Times Orange County 
lineman of the year honors in 1988 and '89. Only one other player in Orange 
County history, UCLA sophomore Travis Kirschke (Esperanza High), was named 
lineman of the year twice ('91 and '92). 
</P>
<P>
 After Wilson played for two seasons at Rancho Santiago College in 1990 and 
'92, he received little attention from major college programs and happily 
transferred to Northridge, calling the school a good fit because of its 
proximity to his home in Orange County. As a Matador, the pre-season Division 
I-AA All-American has drawn the attention of numerous pro scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "A scout from every NFL team has been here to see our quarterback, J.J. 
O'Laughlin, and Oscar," Northridge Coach Bob Burt said. "I think Oscar will end 
up in an NFL camp. He's just too big, too fast and too strong not to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's high school grades kept him out of Division I college football's 
limelight. 
</P>
<P>
 "His academic abilities were not there in high school," said Orange football 
Coach Dick Hill, who coached Wilson at Santa Ana. "He didn't have that work 
ethic and didn't sacrifice enough to succeed in the classroom. But that's an 
area where the community colleges excel." 
</P>
<P>
 With Proposition 48 in effect, Wilson said, his low grades and test scores 
would have made him ineligible for his freshman year at a Division I 
university.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play, so I went to Rancho," Wilson said. "I ended up being 
academically ineligible my second year there, but actually that experience was 
good for me too. It was like a vacation from football, and it helped me 
straighten things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rancho Santiago Coach Dave Ogas: "Oscar could have written his own 
ticket. He had some academic problems, but he persevered. He got himself 
eligible for his sophomore year, got his Associate of Arts degree, and now it's 
great to see him succeed at Northridge." 
</P>
<P>
 But coaches, fans, and even Wilson admit that he hasn't played to his 
potential consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can dominate a game when he wants to," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hill: "There were things in high school that would seem completely 
impossible, but Oscar would do them. He would get double- or triple-teamed and 
still get the job done. We'd see it again on the game films, but still not 
truly believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticisms don't irritate Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad even tells me I'm not playing like I'm capable of," Wilson said. "My 
coaches aren't saying those things to put me down, but they're trying to make 
me better. I don't know what it is, but when I find that right chemistry. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson hasn't fulfilled all of the lofty expectations, he still leads 
the American West Conference with 5 1/2 sacks and is the team's fourth-leading 
tackler. Many times, his impact is felt even when he doesn't make the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar is constantly double-teamed," Burt said. "But that aids our defense 
because it frees up everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, Oscar will try too hard or try to do too much. Sometimes it's an 
effort thing, other times it's positioning. It's hard to describe why he hasn't 
been more consistent. But when he gets it right, whoa. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's raw ability was apparent even when he was a ninth-grader at Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a man among boys," Coombs said. "I remember watching the freshman 
football games and people were just running to get out of Oscar's way." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Burt's favorite Wilson moments came two weeks ago in a 20-10 loss to 
St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a first down on our four- or five-yard line but Oscar completely 
dominated the next three plays," Burt said. "He had a batted ball, maybe a 
sack, but he just about stopped them on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "But things like that don't surprise me any more." 
</P>
<P>
 What may surprise people is Wilson's soft-spoken style off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 He is quick to credit his teammates for his success and thanks his parents and 
coaches for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy I got the opportunity to play at Northridge, and as far as the NFL 
goes, that will take care of itself," Wilson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Burt knows pro scouts like O'Laughlin, a 6-3, 200-pound senior, and Wilson 
although they compete for a Division I-AA program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always see kids playing in the pros from small schools so no, I don't 
think they're at a disadvantage," Burt said. "And hey, if J.J. was throwing to 
J.J (Stokes) at UCLA, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilson knows that men smaller than he have made it to the NFL as 
defensive linemen (such as Ram defensive tackle D'Marco Farr, who is 6-1, 270) 
he is not obsessed with the dream of playing professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot more to life than football," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, the son of Oscar Jr., a cabinetmaker, and Ruth Ann, said they helped 
keep him focused on obtaining an education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have about a year and a half to finish my sociology degree and I'll get 
there," Wilson said. "I'd love to get a job working with kids, maybe a social 
worker, probation officer or something to give back something to my 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because if I could get just one kid to get off the streets, or to stay in 
school and maybe go to college, it would make it all worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hill: "You see many fine young men that didn't stick with it like Oscar 
did. They drop by the wayside and it breaks your heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's been great. He's going to be a successful individual in whatever he 
does. He had to work on things that weren't natural to him, yet he hung in 
there."

ROYAL TEACHES AGOURA ANOTHER HISTORY LESSON; WATER POLO: WITH HELP FROM PAST, 
HIGHLANDERS IMPROVE CHANCES FOR 14TH CONSECUTIVE TITLE, 11-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ghosts of Royal High's 13-year Marmonte League water polo championship 
streak became much more tangible to the Highlanders' Bill Bruininga this week. 
</P>
<P>
 They came in the form of his older brother, Andy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'You lose this streak and I'm going to kick your butt,' " said 
Bruininga, whose brother played water polo at Royal until he graduated last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Bruininga appears safe for now. 
</P>
<P>
 With dozens of Royal water polo alumni on hand, the Highlanders beat Agoura, 
11-10, on Wednesday at Rancho Simi Community Pool. The victory likely insured 
that Royal will hold at least a share of the Marmonte League title for the 14th 
consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Royal (10-10, 3-1 in league play) has four league matches remaining 
and Agoura (15-4, 5-1) has two, it would be considered a major upset if either 
team lost another league match, which means the teams likely will tie for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was monumental," Royal Coach Steve Snyder said. "The Agoura kids, our 
kids, they were babies when we started this streak." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also avenged Agoura's defeat of Royal earlier in the month, which 
snapped the Highlanders' 66-match league winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Agoura beat Royal twice earlier in the season -- once in the San Luis 
Obispo tournament -- there was fear around Royal that another loss to Agoura 
would end the Highlander streak that began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, several former Highlanders came back to give the team moral 
support and also showed them a thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really helped a lot, showing us moves and helping with our passes," 
Bruininga said 
</P>
<P>
 Royal had a balanced attack, with Matt Landre and Randy Owens each scoring 
three goals. Bruininga and Kris Kunkel each scored two. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key for Royal might have been stifling Agoura's Chris Driscoll, who 
scored seven goals in the team's last meeting but was held to two this time. 
Andy Cohen, David Arons and Joey Vona each scored two goals for Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal goalie Randy Zielinski made seven saves. Agoura's goalie Chris Miko made 
14 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was tight early. Royal pulled away in the second half, then held off 
a furious Charger rally at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal took a 2-0 lead, but Agoura scored the next three goals. The teams 
traded goals throughout the second quarter. There were four lead changes in the 
first half, with Royal taking the lead for good on Landre's goal with 1 minute 
26 seconds to play in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal scored the first three goals of the third quarter to pull away, 10-6. 
After the Chargers fell behind, 11-7, they scored three goals in the next four 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura had a final chance to tie the game, when the Chargers had a free pass 
in front of the goal with two seconds remaining, but were unable to get off a 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Agoura Coach Jason Rosenthal was ambivalent about the game -- a 
nice finish but a loss -- and about the prospect of tying for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really isn't (a good feeling), but we'll take it," he said.

SIMI VALLEY GYM WORK SPEEDS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although Simi Valley High will not get its proposed air-supported dome as a 
temporary home for its basketball and wrestling teams, plans for repair of the 
school's earthquake-damaged gym have accelerated this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs are now expected to be completed by Sept. 1, 1995, said Lowell 
Schultze, director of information services for the Simi Valley Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, about a week after the temporary dome plans were rejected by the 
state architect's office, the district received word that the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency had approved plans to go ahead with repair of the school's 
gym and a multipurpose room, used for the band and other large groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneer basketball and wrestling teams will continue to practice at 
various off-campus sites, including the Apollo continuation school and at a gym 
at the Rancho Santa Susana Park. Games will be held primarily at Royal High, 
with some at Moorpark College or Apollo. 
</P>
<P>
 The school proposed a dome containing basketball courts and room for 
spectators, but the state architect's office rejected plans for a dome of that 
size because there was no code for such a building on school grounds, Schultze 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building would have been similar to one constructed at Alemany High. 
Schultze said Alemany did not need approval from the state architect's office 
because it is a private school.

BEAUREGARD MUST TRAVEL ON HIS OWN; JURISPRUDENCE: CSUN LINEMAN TO FLY SOLO 
BECAUSE COURT DATE CONFLICTS WITH TEAM'S ITINERARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jonathan Beauregard is expected to travel to Cedar City, Utah, for Cal State 
Northridge's Nov. 5 football game against Southern Utah, but he must arrange 
his own transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a senior offensive lineman who is charged with two counts of 
attempted murder, was released from jail Tuesday morning after posting $100,000 
bail. Beauregard returned to practice Tuesday afternoon and has not lost his 
starting job, according to Coach Bob Burt. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving the state is not a violation of his bail agreement, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beauregard has a court appearance in San Bernardino at 10:30 a.m. on Nov. 
4. The team bus will depart from Northridge around 8 a.m. that day, according 
to Barry Smith, Northridge sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's not on the bus, I'm sure he'll get there at his own expense," Smith 
said. "As you may know we don't have a lot of money. We can't afford to make 
special arrangements for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard is accused of shooting his former girlfriend and a male 
acquaintance of hers outside a San Bernardino bar on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 George Ashwoot, who posted Beauregard's bond for Greenwood Bail Bonds in San 
Bernardino, said the Utah trip was never an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to the bondsman, not the court," Ashwoot said. "I've known, we've 
talked and it's OK by me." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard paid his own way to a game last season. He left the team bus to 
join students who urged players to boycott a game in Las Vegas because of an 
inadequate meal plan for CSUN athletes. Beauregard changed his mind, flew to 
Las Vegas on his own and was in uniform but did not play in Northridge's 
victory over UNLV. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, CSUN spokesman Bruce Erickson clarified the university's 
position on Beauregard's status with the team, saying he would not be suspended 
unless a judge were to order him to stand trial on the charges, or Beauregard 
himself were to plead guilty prior to a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his preliminary hearing, where the case either proceeds or is 
dismissed, is still weeks away and CSUN's football season is due to end in 
mid-November, the university's approach effectively means Beauregard should be 
able to play the rest of the season.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: ARIZONA'S DICE ROLLS WITH THE PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking like a prizefighter who has absorbed too many blows, Richard Dice 
winces and wills himself out of the Arizona football locker room to meet with 
reporters on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 His blond crew-cut is a mess. The lampblack that reduces glare is smeared 
across his cheeks. The 6-foot-3, 215-pound wide receiver from Alemany High has 
acquired severe bruises on his hip, calf, knee and lower back in a 34-24 
victory in Tucson over UCLA -- the team that ruined the Wildcats' Rose Bowl 
plans in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands," he says, "are the part of my body that don't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays on Monday would determine the severity of Dice's injuries. For Dice, 36 
hours isn't too long of a wait; he has just caught six passes for 138 yards to 
help Arizona bury the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dice, whose X-rays proved negative, gets any award from the Wildcats (6-1, 
4-0 in Pacific 10 Conference play), it should be a medal for bravery. The 
oft-injured sophomore, who is playing despite cracked vertebrae in his lower 
spine, is somehow able to block out the pain and make big plays with the speed 
and agility that make him one of the top young receivers in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Dice overwhelmed UCLA defensive backs Andy Colbert and Teddy Lawrence, both 
5-9, on a second-quarter scoring drive. On his eight-yard touchdown reception 
from Dan White, Dice leaped in the end zone to catch the pass while Lawrence 
seemed to disappear in his shadow. Dice couldn't get up on his own after the 
catch because of severe back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's nothing new. Arizona has all but put Dice's name on one of its 
training-room tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the X-ray room every Monday since the season started," he said. 
"They know me by my first name. Just to get ready for each game, I've got to go 
to the training room each day. I've never been this banged-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dice injured both elbows in the opener at Georgia Tech. Since then he has 
fought through a bruised tailbone and a hip-pointer. The injury to the 
vertebrae is not considered serious. "They say that's not unusual for a 
football player," he said. "But I just gotta be out there -- I can't let my 
teammates down." 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't. He is usually listed as "questionable" on pregame injury reports. 
He always plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times this season Dice has eclipsed 100 yards receiving in a game. Each 
of his receptions last week produced a score or a first down. His 35 catches 
for 644 yards (an average of 18.4 yards) are the most at Arizona since Derek 
Hill had 45 for 798 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 His seven touchdown receptions are the most by a Wildcat receiver since 
Theopolis Bell had 11 in 1974. Dice currently ranks 23rd in the nation in 
catches per game (five) and 14th in yards per game (92). 
</P>
<P>
 But for Dice, it's no pain, no gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking a lot of Advils, getting a lot of ice," he said. "As long as I'm 
there by Saturday, it doesn't really matter." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Colorado dreaming: Senior tight end Christian Fauria (Crespi) of Colorado was 
featured on an ESPN show two weeks ago in a spoof of the cable network's 
"SportsCenter Highlight" ads that feature the "fantasies" of professional 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 In his joke segment, Fauria, who throws left-handed, is called on to throw the 
winning touchdown pass in the national-championship game. He completes a bomb 
to Derek West, a 6-8, 285-pound tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is Fauria's No. 1 dream, No. 2 must be beating third-ranked Nebraska 
this weekend and catching three passes in the game. With a victory, 
second-ranked Colorado (7-0) would have the inside track for an Orange Bowl bid 
and a shot at the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 With three receptions, Fauria would replace Jon Embree (80 receptions) as the 
No. 1 pass-catching tight end in Colorado history. Fauria currently has 78 for 
946 yards in his third season as a starter. He leads the team this season with 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just playing Nebraska is a highlight in itself," he said. "It's going to be a 
tough game. I don't care if I have one (reception), as long we win. I'll be the 
happiest guy in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I catch three balls, that would be the cherry on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing off the ESPN fantasy ads, the Colorado media guide features several 
would-be SportsCenter Highlights of several Colorado players. 
</P>
<P>
 NCAA rules prohibit college athletes from appearing in the ads. But ESPN's 
Chris Fowler, host of the station's College Football Game Day, tabbed potential 
All-American Fauria to play out his fantasy for his show after seeing the 
media-guide version. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came during two-a-days and taped it," Fauria said. "I thought it was 
hilarious. It was fun to do and see it on TV. And within a serious season, it's 
nice to find something to laugh about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Senior running back Ontiwaun Carter (Kennedy) of Arizona 
needs 175 more yards to overtake Art Luppino (1953-56) as the school's all-time 
rusher. He had 164 yards and two touchdowns in 30 carries against UCLA last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior defensive tackle Chuck Osborne (Canyon) of Arizona has 23 tackles, nine 
behind the line of scrimmage, and leads the team with seven sacks. Twenty-three 
tackles might seem a bit few for seven games, but former teammate Rob Waldrop, 
the 1993 Outland Trophy winner, had 34 tackles, nine behind the line, and seven 
sacks at the same point last season. . . . Senior right tackle Joe Smigiel 
(Newbury Park) of Arizona suffered a sprained right ankle in the fourth quarter 
against UCLA and is listed as questionable for the Oregon game this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back Pathon Rucker (Glendale/Glendale College) of Emporia 
State, an NCAA Division II school, has been sidelined because of a strained 
shoulder and hamstring and has played only one down in seven games. Rucker, the 
projected starter, is now playing behind senior Quincy Tillmon. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's volleyball, UCLA junior outside hitter Jennifer Johnson, a Sherman 
Oaks resident, had a career-high 27 kills in a victory over USC last week. 
Johnson, daughter of Olympic decathlon champion Rafer Johnson, has reached 
double figures in kills and digs 11 times each. The Bruins are ranked third in 
the nation.

DIGEST: FISCHER, TUIMOLOAU HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Fischer and Dolores Tuimoloau, state champions for Camarillo and 
Channel Islands highs in June, have been selected to Track & Field News 
magazine's 1994 high school All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, a freshman at Wisconsin, was the top-ranked high jumper in the 
country and also finished third in the balloting for boys' athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Scott of Seminole (Fla.) High, who moved to second on the all-time 
national high school list in the triple jump (53 feet 7 1/2 inches), and 
Deworski Odom of Philadelphia Overbrook, who timed a nation-leading 10.26 
seconds in the 100, finished first and second in the voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer was undefeated against high school competition and his personal best 
of 7-4 at the Santa Barbara Relays in March moved him to second on the all-time 
state list and into a tie for eighth on the all-time national list. 
</P>
<P>
 He cleared 7 feet or higher in 11 meets and posted a grand slam of sorts by 
winning the State, Golden West, National Scholastic Outdoor and USA Track & 
Field Junior championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, a freshman at Ventura College, was ranked third in the girls' 
shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Her personal best of 49-2 moved her into a tie for seventh on the all-time 
state list and she suffered only one defeat during a season that was capped 
with a victory in the Golden West meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other athletes from the region made the national top-10 performer list 
in their respective events during the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Arce of Palmdale was third in the 3,200 (personal best of 9 minutes 
3.19 seconds), Jason Medearis of Hart was fourth in the 300-meter intermediate 
hurdles (36.80), Danny Haag of Granada Hills was fifth in the decathlon (6,084 
points) and Brett Strahan of Hart was seventh in the 1,600 (4:09.71). 
</P>
<P>
 Esa Sallinen of Burroughs was eighth in the pole vault (16-4 3/4) with No. 10 
positions going to Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill in the boys' triple jump (49-11) 
and Kathy Watson of Saugus in the girls' high jump (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
 Arce and Strahan were juniors while the others were seniors. JOHN ORTEGA

THE COLLEGES / STEVE ELLING; CSUN FOOTBALL TEAM FACES SQUEEZE PLAY BUT MAY NOT 
BE SACRIFICED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Cal State Northridge first opened its doors in 1958, students held an 
election to select school colors and an athletic nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise guys served up hundreds of sarcastic nominations that ranged from obscure 
to absurd. Printable nominees included Aeolians, Minotaurs, Sundogs, Hustlers, 
Phaetons, Chmultapultapecs, Outcasts and Desert Rats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hustlers. Outcasts. Hmm. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain color schemes were just as unpalatable. Try flame and emerald, yellow 
and lavender, pink and black or plaid and white. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, in a rare moment of conservative enlightenment, chose Matadors, with 
red and white as primary colors. 
</P>
<P>
 All these years later, another eyebrow-raising combination is worth a gander. 
How about the Sacrificial Lambs, with colors of black and blue? 
</P>
<P>
 With the athletic department on the budgetary ropes because of projected cuts, 
the Division I-AA football team has been mentioned as the first program on the 
chopping block.  
</P>
<P>
 With 70 players and the biggest budget in the department, deep-sixing football 
likely would provide the quickest fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, bean counters. 
</P>
<P>
 Though school officials aren't exactly receptive to the idea, maybe the 
Matadors can survive as the Door Mats. Say, for the sake of discussion, that 
football could become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 The team could cover its expenses by playing a college high roller or two, 
perhaps even turning a small profit while grabbing some headlines. The notion 
is relatively simple: Sign up to play fully funded Division I teams on the road 
for lucrative fees, which would help keep Northridge's struggling program 
afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 For players, the benefits of playing established teams are roughly two-fold. 
First, the payouts keep them in chin straps and ankle tape. Second, it 
generates publicity, though not always for the right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The downside, of course, is obvious. Funny thing is, players don't think the 
idea necessarily qualifies them as cannon fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bigger they are, the better," said tight end Travis Hall, a junior. "I'm 
all for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Play your best against the best. There's notoriety, you get to play in great 
facilities with big crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a nice thing. You feel respected." 
</P>
<P>
 That particular feeling would be a welcome change. The Northridge student body 
last week voted down an election referendum that would have generated $2.25 
million annually for athletics. Matador athletes, particularly football 
players, interpreted the tally as a vote of no-confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy budget problems loom, which could result in the elimination of football, 
which annually costs $450,000, coaching salaries included. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for Northridge administrators, with respect to the Payday Plan, 
is whether the end justifies the means. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe it isn't such a problem. Nobody wants to be viewed as a 
punching bag. Payday means Mayday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an option," said Bob Hiegert, the Northridge athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert would prefer a more "equitable balance" in scheduling. This season, 
Northridge was beaten in road games by Boise State and Southwest Texas State, 
both fully funded I-AA teams. Northridge, a cost-containment program with 17 
scholarships, received $30,000 for each game and was more than competitive in 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to fund any program with big paydays," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay for play is hardly a new proposition in the NCAA, particularly for teams 
that don't draw well or command much attention from television. For instance, 
Pacific was buried this month at Nebraska, 70-21. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a published report, the Tigers earned $400,000 for the game and 
will make a return trip to Lincoln in 1995. Pacific, in turn, this season 
guaranteed $22,500 to UC Davis, a Division II team. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton, which ultimately 
pulled the plug on their Division I football teams, tried a similar tack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't work for them, and we don't even have the same level of funding 
they had," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it worked for Northridge -- in a manner of speaking -- last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was the body double for Fullerton last fall. After Fullerton axed 
its program after the '92 season, Northridge filled in for the Titans at San 
Diego State and Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of many, Northridge recorded one of the biggest victories in 
school history by defeating UNLV, 24-18. Against San Diego State, the Matadors 
twice held first-half leads before losing their quarterback and the game, 
34-17. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a huge upset and a moral victory, which wouldn't have happened 
without playing larger opponents. Combined earnings for playing the two 
middle-of-the-road Division I teams was $95,000, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extrapolate the dollar figures over a handful of similar opponents, toss in a 
high-profile school to sweeten the pot, and the team might be within reach of 
bottom-line solvency. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge foe, huge fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Fee, fie, foe, fumble, say Northridge administrators. Sure, the bigger the 
giant, the bigger the payday. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the worst-case budgetary scenario comes to pass and the program is 
facing elimination, administrators believe the trade-offs aren't worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's ethically a good idea to sacrifice players for money," 
said Ron Kopita, Northridge's dean of students. "I think I'd have a hard time 
accepting that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard times equal status quo for the football team. The election defeat came 
during homecoming week. Somehow, those halftime fireworks didn't mean much to 
the players, who before the game peeled the Matador logos from their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Players said it was a way of turning their backs on voters they felt did 
likewise to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they need a new logo. How about a knapsack on a stick?

BY DESIGN; Q & A; DAVID LAUREN; YOUNG BLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the first issue of Swing magazine hits newsstands this week, it will join 
a host of publications trying to voice the concerns and interests of Generation 
X. What separates Swing from the competition is its 22-year-old editor and 
publisher -- David Lauren, son of designer and marketing genius Ralph Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
 While the younger Lauren won't say if dear old Dad is among the private 
investors backing Swing, the magazine's impressive initial circulation of 
100,000 and distribution deal with Hearst make it clear the famous name didn't 
hurt. And the name of the magazine? Swing, explains Lauren, is what the 
nation's 46 million 18- to 29-year-olds can do to an election. With that notion 
of power in mind, it's not surprising that profiles of America's most powerful 
twentysomethings are offered up in the first issue. Question: What's the point 
of the magazine? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's a reaction to the times in which we're living. It's to say to my 
peers: Everybody thinks this generation of Americans is lazy or unimaginative. 
I'm going to show you that young people today are intelligent, worldly, curious 
and they're looking for something to inspire them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There were no magazines that did this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I looked around and saw that no one had put together a magazine that I 
could take seriously. Magazines targeting my age were mostly about music, 
fashion, celebrity gossip, horoscopes. They were saying the only way to target 
this group is to do MTV-style trendy downtown images. What I'm doing is a 
reaction to hip-hop and all the crazy graphics that go through a page and are 
very distracting. I'm saying there's a huge America out there that looks for 
quality reading. My goal is to do it clean and honestly, with simple integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With the debut of Swing, you came out with a magazine before your father 
could publish his magazine, Lauren. 
</P>
<P>
 A: We're a little astounded ourselves. It seemed like it was going to take us 
longer. Things that were supposed to be difficult were easy, and things that we 
thought would take us an hour took three days. We're proud we were finished by 
this date. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What did your father say? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I just showed it to him for the first time just a few days ago. He thought 
it was fantastic. My parents were very proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: It's obvious he wishes you well -- his companies have six ads in the debut 
issue. He's not an investor? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's all private investors. I can't say who they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Was he an influence on any part of the magazine? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Naturally, in the sense that I grew up in that world and was inspired by 
things that my father has done. But this is something for people in their 20s. 
It had to be done by us. My father didn't want to become too involved. He 
wanted us to do it by ourselves because we understood the market. He's too 
busy. The magazine really has nothing to do with my father at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You grew up in privilege, while many of your readers, one would assume, are 
struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 A: My parents kept us very well grounded. They grew up without any money and 
tried to instill in us that we'd have to make it on our own. I walked to school 
every day and saw the homeless on the street. I went to Duke, one of the best 
schools in the country, but I was exposed to people who didn't have enough 
money to finish school. The people I portrayed in the magazine are people who 
are not from a particular background, but who've succeeded at something based 
on their own creative merit and their own energy. That's what I admire. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Having a famous father seems like it could only be an asset and door 
opener. Is this the case? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It works both ways. Some people expect you're going to carry on a tradition 
of quality and integrity. But there's always somebody out there who doesn't 
feel you can do it on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why don't you have fashion spreads? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We're not a fashion magazine, although there might be a statement about 
style that we can make through a story about someone in fashion. We're a 
general-interest magazine, a lifestyle magazine. I tried to create a smart 
magazine to express who we are in a positive way. And to deal with the issues 
as they affect us.  
</P>
<P>
 You're only going to read about politics, for example, because it has 
something to do with your life. Take something as offbeat as the S&L scandal -- 
most young people wouldn't care to read about it because it has nothing to do 
with them. But if you can take the story and explain how that's going to affect 
college loans, getting your first job, starting a business, paying the mortgage 
on your home or getting married -- all of a sudden it's pertinent to your life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Politics and business seem to be the gist of Swing. But there are some 
titillating tidbits on sex, alcohol and rock 'n' roll. It's interesting to see 
pieces on new, nearly lethal bar drinks, cigar smoking and rock climbing 
juxtaposed with stories on urban sexual myths and retirement plans. What a 
message of immortality versus mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are some who believe "I don't have to vote, it's not going to affect 
me. I can drink as much as I want, I'm not going to get heavy. I can have sex, 
I'm not going to get AIDS." Then there are the opposites -- people who say, 
"I'm not going to have sex because I don't want to get AIDS. I need to vote 
because it's going to make a difference."  
</P>
<P>
 We're not trying to take any sides. We're trying to present different 
lifestyles, attitudes and ways of living that exist. We're not creating 
anything, we're showing what's going on. Without defining ourselves, we're 
creating a forum, a vehicle of expression for our peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You call it the "Paradox Generation," and say, "We don't know who we are 
and we're not sure what we want." Another message seems to be: "Stop whining 
and grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's exactly what it's about. It's about getting a sense of yourself and 
figuring out who you are and fulfilling what you want to accomplish. The point 
of the "Paradox Generation" is that we're not definable. We're only definable 
in the sense that there are very clear conflicts within us. That's the one 
universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You say you're not creating any inter-generational conflicts, but you have. 
In the introduction to one story, you say it was a boomer who perpetuated the 
myth of Generation X, even though it was one of your own generation, author 
Douglas Coupland, who coined the phrase. In another you call the President a 
"non-inhaling boomer," and another talked about boomers mortgaging the next 
generation for their own comforts. There's a sense of us against them. 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not us against them. It's us doing for ourselves. And showing we can 
accomplish something. In a way we're reacting to negative stereotypes sometimes 
given to us. Sometimes given by people of our generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So this isn't a revival of the old expression, "Don't trust anyone over 
30"? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not at all. It's not an angry magazine. I trust people over 30.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; NO BREATHING ROOM; AN AQMD EFFORT TO TARGET 
TOXIC HOT SPOTS HAS BOGGED DOWN. THUS, FEW RESIDENTS WHO LIVE NEAR POTENTIAL 
AIR POLLUTERS HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE HAZARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DEBORAH SULLIVAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Monte homemaker Estelle Ruiz, 53, was hospitalized twice this year with 
water in her lungs. Her husband, Felipe, 55, nurses a nagging sore throat and 
stuffy nose. Next door, two children suffer nasal polyps that have turned their 
sinuses into solid blocks, and a doctor across the street resigned his hospital 
job with a crippling lung disease. 
</P>
<P>
 People are worried in a blue-collar El Monte neighborhood adjoining the San 
Bernardino Freeway; they lack statistics but it seems to them that breathing 
has become a struggle for too many people. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say it's the smog or car pollution that muddies the air. But lately, 
residents are raising questions about emissions from a nearby chrome-plating 
plant, Sargent-Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 report the company submitted to regional air quality officials found 
that the air pollution caused by the company's emissions posed the biggest 
health risk of any factory in the San Gabriel Valley. Residents, however, only 
found out about the report's findings when a reporter came to call. And they're 
not happy that no one told them before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're citizens here, and we've got our rights," said Felipe Ruiz, an 
evangelist. "How many people have gotten sick without even knowing about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under South Coast Air Quality Management District rules, neighborhoods such as 
this one are supposed to be notified about air polluters in their midst. But 
both businesses and environmentalists complain that the new rules set up an 
unwieldy procedure so mired in bureaucracy that they doubt the program will 
ever get in gear. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the five-county South Coast Air Quality Management District began an 
ambitious program to target toxic hot spots throughout Los Angeles and 
surrounding counties. Companies had to report the amount of toxins they release 
into the air and calculate the likelihood that those pollutants would cause 
health problems, ranging from cancer to lead poisoning, among their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 After the agency performs a series of reviews on each report, the program's 
regulations require a business to inform neighbors if its emissions could cause 
more than 10 cancer cases per million people. 
</P>
<P>
 If emissions increase the cancer rate by 100 cases per million, the company is 
required to take steps to reduce the toxic chemicals that it releases. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD officials say they have been working as fast as they can, but the 
exhaustive study has been under way for five years now and officials say it may 
be years more before it is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary documents on file at the AQMD show that of 45 San Gabriel Valley 
companies that were required to submit reports to the agency, 12 might have to 
notify neighbors. Only Sargent-Fletcher, with a cancer risk estimated in 1991 
at 120 per million, showed levels high enough to require reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The company disputes the risk, saying the environmental consultant who 
prepared the report made technical errors that resulted in mistakenly high 
numbers. In fact, government analysts have tentatively lowered the company's 
health risk levels, but to a still-high 85 per million. The company also 
contends, however, that it has reduced emissions since the writing of the 1991 
report, which is still awaiting final AQMD review. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies targeted by the study make everything from aerospace parts to 
glass bottles to mothballs. They're mostly found in lower-income areas such as 
El Monte or industrial towns such as Irwindale and Industry. But one is across 
the street from a sparkling new senior citizens complex in Claremont. And 
virtually none of their neighbors know of the health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 As stacks of reports awaiting approval pile up at the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District, both businesses and environmentalists are holding their 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD's Toxics Hot Spots program was intended as "the first sweeping 
approach to air toxics," said Ben Shaw, the program's senior enforcement 
manager. "This was the first one where we said, let's look at everything." 
</P>
<P>
 So they looked at everything. More than 5,000 facilities in the district's 
five-county area filed reports on their emissions. Of those, 343 facilities 
that appeared to be polluting the most were required to perform a more detailed 
study called a health risk assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the assessment, a company estimates how much toxic chemical it emits, using 
mathematical models of its manufacturing processes and air-flow patterns. Then 
it combines that with toxicology studies of people and animals to put a number 
value on the risks to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 One part of the report calculates how many extra cancer cases per million 
people the plant's pollution is likely to cause. Another index measures other 
health risks, such as lung problems, nerve damage or kidney disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers in the reports are largely educated guesses rather than facts. 
It's almost impossible to measure the hazards of long-term exposure to low 
levels of a chemical, so environmental consultants fill in gaps in data with 
best-guess assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, neither industry representatives nor environmentalists are happy. 
Industry decries the Toxics Hot Spots program as burdensome bureaucracy that 
exaggerates health risks and drives businesses from the state. Air quality 
activists say the program ignores some hazards and creates "human sacrifice 
zones" in the interest of economic gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a jobs-or-an-environment type of issue," said Randle Solganik, a 
board member of the Metal-Finishing Assn. of Southern California, a trade 
association of the metals industry, which relies on some highly toxic compounds 
in its manufacturing processes. "It really comes down to that. The question 
really is, how protective do you want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses point out that although the program measures the risk per million 
people, the number of residents exposed to the emissions is generally much less 
than that -- maybe a few hundred at most. So the actual number of extra cancer 
cases that would occur is usually less than one. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the model calculates the amount of chemicals a resident would be 
exposed to over the course of a lifetime, literally 24 hours a day, for 70 
years. Few, if any, people would remain in one place for that long, industry 
experts assert, and therefore the regulations overestimate the level of 
exposure, and thus the risk, to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, they say, the hazards from industrial chemicals pale in 
comparison to other carcinogens, such as cigarette smoke or smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Cooper, a Bay Area environmental consultant to industry, calculated the 
health risks of air measured at various sites throughout California. He 
concluded that the average cancer risk was 600 in a million -- six times the 
level permitted for industrial emissions. And the biggest contributors to that 
risk were auto emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 And Gene Huber, an environmental consultant who performed the health risk 
assessment for an Azusa firm, Rubber Urethanes, said matching a cancer case 
with a particular chemical is like looking for a needle in a haystack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Statistically, it's very impossible to even prove," he said. "We're looking 
at one cancer death per million people in 70 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The general cancer rate suggests there will be 350,000 cases of cancer in 70 
years in any group of 1 million people, he said. "How do we pick out the one 
(caused by toxins)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists see those arguments as evasions. Air quality activists 
lobbied the AQMD board to require facilities with risks higher than one cancer 
case per million to reduce emissions. AQMD staff recommended setting the 
standard at 10 in a million, the same level at which companies are required to 
notify neighbors. The board finally adopted the 100-in-a-million standard 
proposed by industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say that leaves neighbors in limbo because many companies 
will have to tell neighbors about the risk but won't have to do anything to 
reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule the board adopted is woefully weak and will provide scant protection 
for members of the community," said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air. 
"It gave a false expectation of protection when no protection was being 
offered." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melanie Marty of the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard 
Assessment, which reviews the health risk assessments for AQMD, said the method 
of calculating the risks is designed to balance uncertainties on both sides of 
the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there are a number of glitches the method cannot account for, Marty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Risk assessments don't measure the mixed effects of different chemicals -- 
toxic substances may cancel each other out or multiply each other's effects, 
but the reports don't include those reactions, Marty said. Nor do they count 
the combined hazards of different facilities in the same area. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a real concern in parts of the San Gabriel Valley. Of the 12 companies 
that might have to notify neighbors based on their preliminary reports, three 
are located in the City of Industry and three are in the El Monte-South El 
Monte area. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk assessments also ignore chemicals that are transformed into 
carcinogens, or more potent carcinogens, after they are released, Marty said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although 729 chemicals must be listed in emissions reports, there is only 
data on the health effects of about 200 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, danger is measured in terms of healthy adults. But toxics may be 
more dangerous to children, the elderly or those with a genetic predisposition 
to cancer or other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the health risk assessments are overly (cautious)," Marty said. 
"They are designed to be health protective, but they are not overly (cautious) 
like industry likes to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Solganik, though, complains that the limits set by California laws exceed 
those of other states, which could send businesses fleeing toward looser 
regulations -- or could close them down completely. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to be overly protective," Solganik said. "There's a price that 
you have to pay for that, and the price is economic well-being."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seven employees of Specialty Organics in Irwindale paid that price five years 
ago, said the company's president, Joe Seruto. In 1989, the company compiled 
the health risk assessment required by the AQMD. The report estimated a cancer 
risk of 27 cancer cases per million for neighbors and 80 cases per million for 
workers, based on the chemical para-dichlorobenzene, used to make mothballs. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsure about what changes AQMD would require of the company as a result of 
those risks, and facing other regulations over emissions, Seruto simply stopped 
making the chemical, he said. That meant laying off seven of nine employees, 
some of whom had been with the company up to 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty Organics had been manufacturing para-dichlorobenzene since Seruto's 
father opened the plant in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically just mothballs," Seruto said. "The problem with these rules 
is, they go overboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Garner, president of Garner Glass in Claremont, said his company has 
danced a toxic two-step trying to keep up with the regulations but still can't 
match the pace. Garner Glass is among the 12 area companies that might have to 
notify neighbors of the potential health hazards of their emissions. Its health 
report showed a cancer risk of 74.9 per million as a result of the chemical 
trichloroethylene, which its factory emits in the process of manufacturing 
glass tubing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of problems with this program," Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most other glass manufacturers switched from trichloroethylene, which causes 
smog, to a related chemical that creates less air pollution, he explained. But 
that chemical, it turns out, tainted the water supply, raising an outcry from 
water quality officials. So now the EPA is urging manufacturers to go back to 
the original chemical, Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Judy Snow, manager of Claremont Villas Senior Apartments across the 
street, knew nothing of the risk when the seniors complex, with its gleaming 
commons room and cozy apartments, opened in January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They really should have notified us when we opened," she said, "because we 
have 154 seniors living here, and some of them have lung problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the El Monte neighborhood near Sargent-Fletcher didn't even know 
the rules existed, much less that emissions from a facility near them might be 
so high. Now they think the rules don't go far enough. Or fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know about this company," Felipe Ruiz said. "If I knew about (it) . 
. . I would have organized the neighbors. I want to know what they're releasing 
and how long this has been going on. I think people should get together and 
start complaining." 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent-Fletcher says it has cut production of the aerospace parts that it 
makes, reducing the amount of chromium it emits. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ed Hilbert, the company's environmental consultant, said the first 
consultant, who wrote the report, made mistakes that exaggerated the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 A state environmental official said that when her agency reviewed the report, 
it found that the risks were indeed lower than the original estimate -- but not 
by much. Judy Rosenbaum, a research scientist with the state Office of 
Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, said the company's health risk level 
now is set at 85 in a million -- below the original 120 per million but well 
above the 10 in a million level that would require the company to notify 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the fear of angry neighbors is what makes these rules work, said Pat 
Leyden, AQMD's deputy head of stationary-source compliance. Proposition 65, an 
earlier right-to-know law, prodded facilities to reduce emissions on their own, 
simply to avoid bad publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen is that right-to-know legislation is very powerful, that 
companies do take aggressive steps to reduce emissions that they release. And 
they do that to maintain good relations with the community," she said. "We've 
seen many companies reduce emissions simply to avoid notifying the community. 
So it's a powerful tool." 
</P>
<P>
 But only if the community knows about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People affected have to be notified so that they can organize and work with 
the emitter to clean it up," said Doug Doepke, an environmental activist from 
Azusa. "I don't know how the public can take action unless they're notified." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, frustration over delays in the review process is probably the only 
point agreed on by both industry and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole process has been typical bureaucracy at its worst," said Gene 
Huber, the Bay Area environmental consultant who measured the risks of 
background air. "They went out and did this and no one did it before. So they 
did it en masse and they did it very badly. . . . They haven't completed the 
process in five years. They're supposed to repeat it every two years." 
</P>
<P>
 To date, AQMD has finalized two of 343 health risk assessments received. Shaw 
said 20 more will be done before the end of the year, and the first batch of 
notifications will go out in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Air quality officials say they would have liked reviews to go more quickly, 
but they bristle at criticism that they've dropped the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program began, many companies submitted late reports, incomplete 
reports or didn't submit them at all, Shaw said. The ones that did come in 
often had to be sent back for corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marty said by far the biggest problem was volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the program, nobody had any idea how many facilities 
would need risk assessments," she said. "We thought (there would be) 60 or 70. 
The final number (statewide) was 725. Nobody foresaw that, so the resources 
needed to keep up with the workload aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said that, among those 725, between 100 and 200 companies in the South 
Coast district will probably have to notify neighbors about their facility, the 
toxic air pollutants they emit and the health risks they might cause. The 
facilities will then hold public meetings to answer their neighbors' questions 
and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without notification and meetings, Shaw said, the program already has had 
an effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies reduced because they didn't want to notify. . . . Let's face it, 
the public has an effect on policy." Excessive Emissions 
</P>
<P>
 Under a regional air-pollution program, 12 San Gabriel Valley companies 
reported that their emissions of toxins would cause 10 or more cases of cancer 
among 1 million people, meaning they might need to notify their neighbors about 
potential health risks:

YO! MTV . . . SHOPS?; IF THE NETWORK LIKES THE TEST RESULTS, IT'LL JOIN QVC'S 
WORLD. THERE'S MOOLA TO BE MADE -- AND PITFALLS TO OVERCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On video shopping channels, it's not uncommon to hear hawkers describe cubic 
zirconia jewelry as stunning or call polyester pantsuits irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Beavis and Butt-head have joined the ranks of the electronic shills, 
"it doesn't suck" can be added to the list of home shopping's fawning phrases. 
</P>
<P>
 MTV Networks -- which includes VH-1, Nickelodeon and MTV -- began testing the 
home shopping waters in August. On the distant horizon -- if the tests went 
well -- was a separate, 24-hour shopping channel that could compete for a share 
of a $2-billion-a-year industry. But since a wildly successful initial outing 
during the broadcast of Woodstock '94, complications have arisen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Products aren't ready, customized merchandise is late. We're walking in a 
world we've never been before," says Mark Rosenthal, executive vice president 
of MTV. "Some of the stuff we've never done before and we're having to piece it 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Which explains why viewers who want their MTV shopping shows have only two 
chances left this year to shop -- the premiere edition of "The Goods," which 
airs tonight, and what Isaac Mizrahi calls his "Frocumentary," which airs 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Goods" is the MTV and VH-1 showcase for clothes from Marc Jacobs, Todd 
Oldham and Anna Sui. Oldham, who has a recurring segment on MTV's "House of 
Style," has also designed housewares to be sold on VH-1. Mizrahi's line of TV 
sitcom-inspired clothes will be sold -- where else? -- on Nick at Nite. 
</P>
<P>
 Another show, "Gotta Get It," features such disparate items as NBA Courtside 
merchandise, Doc Marten boots and Tommy Hilfiger's combination 
backpack-campstool. It was supposed to air on VH-1 but, as with the other test 
programs, it will be pushed to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal views MTV's foray into home shopping as only a test, one whose 
objective is instructional. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the testing period," he predicts, "I will have a series of 
programs with enough different shows, spread across three very different TV 
networks, selling a ton of different merchandise, from housewares and 
electronics to high fashion items and fashion items that are nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the day, I'm going to have a pretty good idea what works with 
an audience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two major competitors in the home shopping arena: QVC (in 50 
million homes, with 1993 sales of $1.22 billion) and the Home Shopping Network 
(in 60 million homes, with 1993 sales of $1.04 billion). 
</P>
<P>
 But the numbers speak even louder at MTV. The music channel is in 59 million 
American homes and another 240 million internationally. Asia and India got 
their MTV this month, jacking those figures into the stratosphere. VH-1 and 
Nickelodeon each are in more than 50 million U.S households and are beginning 
their global conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say that should MTV Networks launch a shopping channel, it could be 
at the $1-billion mark in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take a typical cable audience of 60 million homes, 8% have bought from 
QVC and Home Shopping Network," Rosenthal notes. "How do you get the other 92%? 
Higher quality. That's the opportunity. Our focus is narrow and specialized." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Doppelt, former editor in chief of Mademoiselle, lined up self-confessed 
Nick at Nite-watching Mizrahi, Oldham, Sui and Jacobs to create items exclusive 
to MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of (shopping channels) have approached us, but the audience was not 
right," says Robert Duffy, Jacobs' partner. "Our customer is younger, smaller. 
. . . When Gabe approached us, it felt right." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs reproduced a dress from his collection for MTV at a fraction of the 
price. The original stretch wool-jersey dress, embedded with Swarovoski 
crystals, cost $500. The MTV version in rhinestone-covered cotton jersey sells 
for less than $100, a price ceiling Doppelt put on all the designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sui cranked out an MTV-friendly black vinyl wrap skirt and brilliant-colored, 
cropped T-shirts printed with the theme of her last collection -- a 
cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Mizrahi has stitched up a full-body, Laura Petrie apron. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Crawford's commercials for "The Goods" sold Todd Oldham on MTV shopping. 
"When we saw that they were doing (the shows) in a young, enticing, 
professional way, we were inspired," says Oldham's business partner, Tony 
Longoria. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet critics from rival shopping networks say the look of MTV shopping is too 
entertaining, too hip and too fast-paced -- folks won't buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldham says that's exactly where the critics are wrong: People don't need to 
be bored into a stupor to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 During MTV's first 30-minute shopping show, featuring Woodstock '94-related 
items, more than $1.5 million worth of telephone orders were taken in two days. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-to-34-year-old MTV audience bought it all -- the T-shirts, programs, 
hats and a $75 package of framed ticket, backstage pass and commemorative coin. 
Price seemed to be no object, nor did getting their youthful hands on a credit 
card. 
</P>
<P>
 But can that success be duplicated on a 24-hour MTV shopping channel? 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal says that next year, after all the checks have cleared, the network 
will decide whether to start such a channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a future for us in electronic retailing, we will study the 
process, figure it out, make a prudent investment and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And with any luck, it won't suck. TV Shopping Channels That Are On -- and Off 
-- the Launching Pad 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies, lusting after the profits generated by electronic shopping, 
have announced plans to launch shopping channels. As yet, not one has become a 
permanent fixture in the cable program guide. 
</P>
<P>
 * In April, Time Warner and Spiegel Inc. launched a test of a show called 
"Catalog 1" in 400,000 homes, selling items from catalogue companies such as 
Spiegel, Eddie Bauer, Neiman Marcus, Sharper Image, Crate & Barrel and Bombay 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 After four weeks, Catalog 1 shoppers spent twice what QVC shoppers do, says 
Gordon Cooke, president of Time Warner interactive merchandising. An additional 
500,000 homes in the Pittsburgh market were added Oct. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 * In June, 1993, Macy's announced plans for a 24-hour shopping channel. Myron 
E. Ullman III, Macy's chairman and CEO, touted TV Macy as equal to 20 branch 
stores with the merchandise investment of one. A test run was scheduled for 
this fall with 2.3 million viewers in Long Island, but because of the 
Federated/Macy's merger, says a Macy's representative, the test has been 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nordstrom was one of the first retailers to announce plans for an 
interactive shopping channel. So far, though, the company's participation is 
limited to partnership with Lands' End and JCPenney in Bell Atlantic's 
Stargazer program, a video-on-demand service that sells products via an 800 
number. (JCPenney tried its hand at home shopping in the late '80s and failed; 
QVC ultimately absorbed the operation.) Stargazer will begin testing in 1,000 
homes this winter.  
</P>
<P>
 * The Box, an interactive cable music channel out of Miami, said last year 
that it was developing a shopping component. But the plan is still tacked to 
the drawing table. Company spokeswoman Lois Schmatz says the Box will open a 
retail store stocked with Box merchandise. Eventually, the company hopes to 
test the products over Box request lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bertelsmann Music Group, which owns RCA and Arista records, announced plans 
to produce a music shopping channel in 1993, but did an about-face and decided 
that a music channel without shopping, real-life dramas and cartoon shows would 
be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shopping project was discontinued, and we have joined with other labels 
-- Warner, Sony and Polygram -- to start a music video channel," says BMG 
spokesman Jim Kelly.

By RIP RENSE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I phoned Frankenstein the other day, seeing as it's Halloween season and 
there's a new Frankenstein movie on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 I found him working as a certified financial planner for a San Fernando Valley 
insurance company, where he's been employed for 20 years. You know, let's have 
a look at your -- RARRRGGGHHH! -- stock options . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty mundane existence," I wanted to say, "for a guy who has been variously 
electrocuted, boiled in sulfur, burned, frozen in ice and God-knows-what." 
</P>
<P>
 But I didn't say it. Frankenstein hears that kind of stupid stuff all the 
time, and he's tired of it. So tired, in fact, that he makes a point of 
pronouncing the last syllable steen -- just as Gene Wilder did in Mel Brooks' 
"Young Frankenstein" -- to discourage comparisons to Dr. Frankenstein's 
ill-fated experiment in better living through electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 I also resisted an urge to ask Frankenstein how it feels to have Robert De 
Niro portray you in "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," coming Nov. 4. (Yes, it was 
the doctor who carried the Frankenstein appellation, but the monster is 
popularly identified with it.) Instead, I asked what it's like to go through 
life named Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Frankenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one time I worked as an orderly in a hospital in Pittsburgh," 
Frankenstein said. "And I used to take people down to the operating room. And 
I'll never forget, I had this one person going down for surgery who looked at 
my name tag and said, 'Frankenstein!' I said, 'Yes, and if the surgery isn't 
successful, we have other places for you to go!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Such is Frankenstein humor. Of course, what else can you expect from a person 
who must share the name of a reanimated brute whose primary problem-solving 
technique involved strangulation? If I were named Rip Frankenstein, for 
instance, I'd make sure that my business cards proclaimed: "Strength of a 
Hundred Men" or "Cannot Die." Or "If Found Dormant, Recharge at Own Risk." Or, 
a subtle one for Frankenstein film buffs, "Sit Down. " (The movies are 
curiously full of people ordering each other to "sit down. ") Or "Lighting 
Cigars in My Presence Is Inadvisable." Or just plain, "Fire -- No Good!" 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters more dicey for Bill Frankenstein, he is the son of Dr. 
Frankenstein -- Dr. Herbert Frankenstein, a prominent (yes, you guessed it) 
surgeon. It was the good doctor who first took to pronouncing the family name 
Frankensteen (correct German pronunciation is Frahnk-en-stine.) Small wonder! 
Life was initially tough for, um, young Frankenstein. (Sorry -- it's hard to 
resist.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I used to get in a lot of fights when I was a kid," Frankenstein said. 
"You know, they'd yell 'Frankenstein monster!' My dad told me how to avoid it. 
I'd say, 'You're just jealous because I have a famous name.' And I'd walk away. 
It worked. I told my daughter to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Has the name always had such a, er, scarring effect? Nah, he insisted, it's 
even helped in his business: "People practically wander in off the street," he 
said, "and make remarks like 'Gee, you don't look anything like, uhhh . . . ' " 
Once, it got him a free lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a lieutenant in the Army in Germany back in 1965, and outside 
Frankfurt, there's a town called Frankenstein," he said. "My jeep driver and I 
were taking back roads, and all of a sudden, we passed by a town, and I said, 
'Stop! Back up! The sign said Frankenstein.' So we went into a Gasthaus, a 
mom-and-pop operation, and the woman looks at my name tag and says, 'You're 
kidding!' And we got a free meal!" 
</P>
<P>
 I resisted an urge to ask him if he complimented the chef by saying, "Food. 
Drink. Goooooood. " 
</P>
<P>
 The reason I contacted Frankenstein, I should point out, was to find people 
with what you might call Halloween-appropriate names, and ask them for colorful 
and amusing anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Bill Frankenstein, I placed a call to attorney Janet Mummey -- who 
sadly, wasn't able to get back to me. (Probably wrapped up in her work -- har!) 
Frank Stein was polite, but said the name hadn't caused him any trouble since 
childhood. I couldn't find any Renfields or Van Helsings in the phone book, and 
Lorenzo Draculan's number had, not surprisingly, been disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry and Selma Wolfman had nothing to offer; neither did Jeff nor Wilf 
Wolfman. (I was especially disappointed about Wilf, because of his name's 
unique doubly lycanthropic symbolism. Wilfred Glendon was the name of Henry 
Hull's werewolf character in the 1936 classic "Werewolf of London.") I was 
wondering why all the Wolfmans were busy -- a full moon? -- when the phone rang 
with a Wolfman on the line. Marv Wolfman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone just thought my name was cool," Marv said. "No one ever believed the 
name at first, but no one ever thought it was silly." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfman, it turns out, writes comic books. While working for Marvel Comics in 
the 1970s, his bosses decided he was just the guy to write stories for a series 
of Wolfman comics -- solely because of his name. "I had never seen a single 
Wolfman movie," he said, "but no one cared." (He now writes for a Sunday 
morning cartoon show called "Monster Force," in which the Wolfman's grandson is 
a major character.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfman added that he is not especially hairy and feels quite all right during 
the full moon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I gave up on other Halloween-y names and decided to concentrate on 
Frankensteins. Certainly, they have the most notorious legacy. I found the 
Daughter of Frankenstein (no relation to the financial planner), who hails by 
the quite non-threatening first name of Keri. She's the great-granddaughter of 
the founder of the H. (Herman) Frankenstein Co. (yup, it's also pronounced 
Frankensteen ), prominent men's dress shirt manufacturer and Downtown Los 
Angeles bastion since 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day," said Keri, vice president of the family business, "you get 
people who seriously say, 'It must have been really hard for you growing up as 
a kid, getting teased all the time' -- and then proceed to continue teasing 
you! That's the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it must have been terrible, Keri. Tch-tch. Really awful. Sad. All those 
guys talking about . . . dating Frankenstein's daughter. And getting electric 
shocks when they kissed you. (Sorry, don't know what came over me.) Things were 
roughest, Frankenstein claimed, when she was on the UC Davis volleyball team. 
Those pregame introductions were murder. "There were always chuckles," she 
said. "Luckily, because it was UC Davis, the crowds weren't too big." 
</P>
<P>
 Frankenstein insisted that she absolutely loves her name and wouldn't change 
it for anything -- including marriage. However. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "In all honesty," she said, "it's a tough time for business right now. And I 
wish my name was Guess or Armani." (Such is Frankenstein humor.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I spoke with one Alan Frankenstein, a retired podiatrist and the 
Uncle of Frankenstein (Keri). He -- and all the other Frankensteins -- have, as 
you might guess, been periodically plagued by prank callers asking things like, 
"Get that criminal brain replaced yet?" Their responses, Alan reported, tend 
toward things like, "I've got a lab in the basement. Come on over." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan was the only Frankenstein who admitted that he has never been terribly 
pleased with his surname. "When my parents got married," he said, rather 
ruefully, "there was a newspaper clipping reading 'Bride of Frankenstein,' and 
later, after a birth, 'Son of Frankenstein.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he said with a sigh, "you want to put the whole thing to bed, but 
it just keeps coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Cannot die. Has strength of a hundred names.

BY DESIGN; NEW YORK'S RUNAWAYS FROM THE RUNWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two giant white tents went up in Bryant Park this week in preparation for the 
spring '95 New York collections. And, as always, renegade designers have made 
it a point to stage their shows elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a group called 7th on Sixth decided to spare buyers and 
journalists the ordeal of traipsing all over Manhattan twice a year by 
presenting most of the shows in a central location.  
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, it worked. Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and 
Richard Tyler -- along with more than 50 other designers -- will show their 
spring collections in the tents starting Saturday and ending Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the rest? Those who cannot afford the tents (which can cost as much 
as $25,000 per show) have come up with ingenious alternatives: a cavernous 
downtown nightclub, a tiny SoHo art gallery, a Fifth Avenue beauty salon, a 
coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitty Boots is one of seven New York designers who plan to show their spring 
lines during what they're calling Alternative Fashion Week -- several days 
before 7th on Sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything over $300 is out of my range," says Boots, who will show her spring 
Teddy Girls line Friday at Webster Hall. The 40,000-square-foot space, Boots 
notes, "is where the first anarchist balls were held in the early 1900s." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the most attractive aspect of Webster Hall is the price -- next to 
nothing. Boots' models are personal friends, as is her music engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the concept of having the shows all in one place is good," she says, 
"but if they're going to charge such a high fee, it rules out a lot of 
designers." 
</P>
<P>
 The price of showing is not outrageously expensive, says Fern Mallis, 
executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America and 7th on 
Sixth. "But young designers just out of the starting gate don't necessarily 
belong in this venue yet. Clearly, this was created as a platform for the major 
designers." 
</P>
<P>
 Boots' entire line cost less than $4,000. "I'd much rather put the money into 
filling orders," says the designer, whose label is sold at Red Balls of Fire on 
Melrose Avenue, "than on a venue." 
</P>
<P>
 Lola Faturoti showed her fall collection at New York's African Museum. Her 
spring line will be unveiled in the plush comfort of the ABC Carpet & Home 
store, accompanied by "live Indian music." 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Blanken, former designer for Zoran and Michael Kors, will make his 
debut at the Jonathan Morr Gallery and Coffee House in SoHo. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the opposite end of the trendy spectrum is the local Howard Johnson, 
where Basco is staging its spring show. Coffee regular, anyone? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Bryant Park expatriates are youthful rebels or struggling 
up-and-comers. Design icon Geoffrey Beene considers himself "a runaway from 
runways." 
</P>
<P>
 As he did last season, the designer will show his spring line -- a tribute to 
Santa Monica -- on models and dancers. While models can work a narrow catwalk, 
dancers need an expanse of stage. So Beene's show will be presented at a 
theater in the Equitable Life building. 
</P>
<P>
 His decision, however, is not motivated solely by practical considerations. 
Asked by magazine editor Grace Mirabella why he avoided the Bryant Park tents, 
Beene recounts: "I told her I thought animals perform best under tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "She added, 'Comedians do too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as the pre-show countdown continues at Bryant Park, the atmosphere seems 
closer to controlled chaos than comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Command Center!" snaps a woman who answers the phone at the 7th on Sixth 
headquarters across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 There, a cafe has been set up for press and buyers, catered by Mad 61, the 
deli at Barneys New York. More phones have been installed to accommodate the 
1,140 media members who will descend on the park. 
</P>
<P>
 And the weather? 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a downpour when the tents were going up," McCarthy says, "but it's 
supposed to warm up over the next few days." 
</P>
<P>
 All the better for modeling swimwear. And schlepping to out-of-the-way fashion 
shows.

LIUZZI'S EFFORTS NOT ALWAYS VIEWED AS HELPFUL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Father Peter J. Liuzzi's efforts, the Church's position on 
homosexuality is unacceptable to many gay groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's lovely that they have this ministry to gays and lesbians," says Lee 
Werbel, executive director of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, 
"but until lesbians and gay men are allowed to be fully who they are, as loving 
human beings, it's still discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Father Liuzzi a long time," says Jack Stafford, treasurer of the 
Los Angeles chapter of Dignity, an organization of gay Catholics meeting 
outside the church. "He's served Dignity by coming and saying Mass. We're not 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position regarding his ministry is that it's not helping gay and lesbian 
people be fully who they are because the Church says its goal is to have them 
choose the right way, which is to become celibate. We believe gay and lesbian 
people can express sexuality in a loving, caring way in accordance with the 
Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Liuzzi perseveres. GARY LIBMAN

NEWS BITES: HACKER CHOW

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Giga Bites: The Hacker Cookbook," by Jenz Johnson (Ten Speed Press; 1994), 
reads like a wheeze but has a terrible air of authenticity -- a lot of computer 
freaks really cook this way. The only utensils called for are spoon, bowl, can 
opener and microwave. All recipes are basically snacks, mostly dips (e.g., 
chopped-up day-old hamburgers moistened with ketchup and mayonnaise); more 
substantial snacks include Chinese leftovers lasagna (using pretzels for the 
pasta) and French fries and ketchup soup. Sour cream, mayonnaise, onion soup 
mix, beef jerky and Cheese Whiz appear to be the fundamental ingredients of the 
cuisine, and espresso jolted up with instant coffee powder the primary 
beverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson justifies these bloodchilling dishes by noting that if a hacker makes 
$40,000 a year and spends 1 1/2 hours making meat loaf and mashed potatoes, the 
effective cost of the dish (ingredients plus hourly wage rate) is $28.85. 
Meanwhile, "oinkers" (deviled ham, sausage and Canadian bacon on bread, zapped 
in the microwave), taking 10 minutes, work out to only $5.21. For hackers, the 
logic may be unassailable. The Internet Isn't a Thing, It's a Process

 We own a book called "The Complete Guide to the Internet." We own a book

 Dashi , the Japanese fish stock, is made from dried bonito. Or is it? It turns 
out that to an ichthyologist, the fish it's made from -- skipjack -- is a true 
tuna, while bonitos are merely close relatives of tuna.

 Dried tuna! Omigod, we've been eating dried tuna! The FDA must crack down on 
this gross mislabeling! It's a Recipe Collection! It's a Music CD! It's Both!

 Musical Meals is a whole new direction in multimedia -- a series of music CDs 
with appropriate recipes. The chefs are certainly top-drawer. The CD for the 
cocktail hour has recipes for spiced cashews, citrus-marinated chicken morsels 
and the like by Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, with accompanying music by 
Dean Martin, Peggy Lee and their like. The Cajun volume -- zydeco and Dixieland 
music -- features recipes by Emeril Lagasse. Alice Waters did brunch dishes 
(Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington), the Southwestern volume is by Dean Fearing 
(Willie Nelson, Patsy Cline, Los Lobos), and Roger Verge did French cuisine 
(Piaf, Chevalier). Available at Tower Records, Sam Goody, Musicland, Pier 1 . .

 "Starbucks is North America's leading sponsor of CARE, contributing $200,000

international charity. One way it supports CARE's relief to places like Rwanda 
is the CARE Sampler, four pounds of coffee (Kenya, Guatemala Antigua, Sumatra, 
Estate Java), of which Starbucks donates more than 20% of the purchase price. 
CARE applies 93% of all resources received directly to overseas aid and 
development programs. At Starbucks coffee stores. Brit Tea Prob

 American tea companies are having a tough time selling the English on the idea

INDIA'S FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 India's glittering festival of lights, Diwali, takes place Nov. 3. It's a 
happy holiday that celebrates the triumph of good over evil and signals a fresh 
start for the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Diwali comes from Sanskrit words meaning row of lights. In India, 
window ledges and roof tops gleam with rows of tiny pottery lamps that are 
fueled by oil or ghee, the clarified butter used in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 People dress in their finest clothing. Homes are swept clean. Diwali cards are 
exchanged, and hours are spent preparing holiday sweets. Merchants open and 
bless new account books at this time and offer prayers for prosperity to 
Lakshmi, goddess of wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration starts days before Diwali with ritual dances and dramas that 
depict the victory of the Hindu god Rama over evil forces. Drawn from the 
Ramayana, an Indian epic, the dramas are performed by townspeople on 
neighborhood stages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sparkling and magical; it's a very rich and exciting time," says Linda 
Alipuria of Chameli, a north Indian vegetarian restaurant in Rosemead. The 
restaurant hosted a Ramayana reading last weekend and has on display Diwali 
storybooks and handworked dresses for the seasonal dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Thursday, Chameli will stage a Diwali dinner with a special menu 
accompanied by Champagne. In India, drinking and gambling are allowed on this 
holiday, Alipuria explains. A pandit (priest) will conduct a religious 
ceremony, and a limited number of silver coins bearing the image of Lakshmi 
will be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers on the Diwali menu will include papdi chat , a layered dish of 
potatoes, garbanzos and crisp flour chips with yogurt dressing. Spoonfuls of 
mint and tamarind chutneys and a dash of ground cumin decorate the top. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the desserts will be halwa , a sweet pudding that is traditional for 
religious observances. Hari Alipuria, chef-owner, has been experimenting with 
whole-wheat flour halwa like that used as temple prashad . (The prashad is an 
offering consecrated to the gods, then presented in small portions to 
worshipers.) Alipuria, who is from the Punjab, recalls how halwa was made in 
giant woks in Sikh temples there. The mixture was kept over heat until it 
became caramelized, enriching the taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Halwa is also made with semolina, farina and other ingredients, and may 
include nuts and raisins.  
</P>
<P>
 FARINA HALWA 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup farina or Cream of Wheat 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds from 10 green cardamom pods 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups water 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup golden raisins 
</P>
<P>
 Heat ghee in saucepan. Stir in farina and cook until fragrant and golden. Stir 
constantly. Add cardamom seeds, then water. Add sugar and raisins. Cook, 
stirring, until thick. Makes 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 8 servings contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 176 calories; 90 mg sodium; 23 mg cholesterol; 9 grams fat; 24 grams 
carbohydrates; 2 grams protein; 0.14 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Butter is essential for halwa because it is pure," says Hari Alipuria. "Oil 
cannot be substituted." This whole-wheat halwa has a roasted flavor and is as 
brown as gingerbread.  
</P>
<P>
 PRASHAD HALWA 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup ghee (clarified butter) 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup whole-wheat flour

</P>
<P>
 1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Heat ghee in pot. Stir in whole-wheat flour and cook, stirring, until fragrant 
and browned. Add cardamom seeds, water and sugar. Cook and stir until thick. 
Mixture will be deep-brown. Makes 6 to 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 6 servings contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 468 calories; 314 mg sodium; 83 mg cholesterol; 31 grams fat; 48 grams

 Chameli chef Raj Sharma simplifies this dish by frying cut-up flour tortillas 
rather than making the crisp chips from scratch. Using canned garbanzos is 
another shortcut.  
</P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cut tortilla into small diamonds. In skillet fry in oil until crisp. Drain on 
paper towels. Line bottom of serving bowl with some of fried tortilla pieces. 
Add potato, then garbanzo beans and remaining fried tortilla. Spoon yogurt over 
mixture. (If yogurt is very sour, thin with milk.) There should be generous 
amounts of yogurt, like salad dressing. Sprinkle with ground cumin. Top with 
Mint Chutney and Tamarind Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Top with more yogurt. Makes 4 servings.

PRAISING BRAISING; COOKING IN THE SLOW LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm going through a braising phase. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, hungry, I looked in the refrigerator and found two miserable 
turnips and part of a leek. I felt like one of those characters in a fairy tale 
who has fallen on hard times: "She only had an onion and a crust of bread . . . 
she had only a knob of cheese and a trusty dog . . . she had only two turnips 
and a piece of leek. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 True, I could have gone to the store. Better, I thought, to rise to the 
culinary challenge. So I heated some olive oil in a pan, sliced the vegetables 
and tossed them around in the hot oil until the leeks went limp and the turnips 
began to glisten. Then, I turned down the heat and put on the lid. This was a 
thick, reliable pan, so I added only a tablespoon of liquid. 
</P>
<P>
 I went about my business -- folded laundry, chatted with the parrot, patted 
the dog -- and checked once or twice to see how things were cooking. Turnips 
sweating away, leeks softening; everything was slowly acquiring a faint golden 
glaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Had I sauteed these vegetables, I would have ended up with a dry, 
strong-flavored dish something like American fries, only made with browned, 
still-firm turnips flecked with dry brown wisps of leek. 
</P>
<P>
 Braised, however, both turnip and leek became velvety, moist, buttery and 
meltingly rich, with a golden, caramelized glaze. I ate them spread over 
orecchiette (little ear-shaped pasta) with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and fresh 
ground pepper and felt like the clever, blessed heroine of a fairy tale: "The 
meager roots on her plate turned into a golden stew redolent of the finest oils 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't always a braiser. For years, I was stuck in saute mode. For dinner, 
I'd heat some olive oil in a pan, stir some mix of meat and/or vegetables until 
done, then toss it into pasta or rice. I liked the movement of sauteing, the 
constant participation in the cooking process from start to finish, the 
immediate gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving something to cook slowly on the stove or in the oven always made me a 
little nervous, bored, fretful. It didn't feel like cooking. Food, I believed 
-- like pets, roses and people -- responded to attention. The proper amount of 
touching and nudging would coax the flavor out. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm over that now. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, I became busier. The few hours a day I'm home, I have better 
things to do -- like collapse on the couch -- than keep a pan full of vegetable 
chunks in motion. Braising gives me free time even as my dinner cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 If I don't mind a late dinner, braised meat dishes can give me a couple of 
hours of free time. But not all braising takes that long. Some vegetable dishes 
are done in less than 30 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Even they don't ask much of me. I can ignore a pan full of braising lettuce 
for 20 minutes -- long enough to read the cartoons in the New Yorker, take a 
shower, water the roses, or give each of the animals a good scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The true seduction of braising, however, has nothing to do with the fact that 
you can fiddle while dinner cooks. The reason I braise really has to do with 
what braising does to its object, be it $8-a-pound radicchio, $2-a-pound lamb 
shanks or a lowly turnip. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy as it is, braising is a two-stage process, and in both stages, a certain 
attention to details is required. The first stage is a fast hands-on saute 
wherein you introduce whatever you're cooking to hot fat. With vegetables, this 
means a quick fry to brown tips and edges without cooking the vegetables 
through.  
</P>
<P>
 With meats, this first stage involves a good browning on all sides. (A browned 
crust helps produce that deep meaty flavor and roasty-brown gravy, so it is 
worth the time and trouble of having to wash the resulting oily film off your 
glasses and face and stove and walls.) Then, after the meat is browned, there's 
also the brief sauteing of the mirepoix , or finely chopped vegetables, that 
will cook with the meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The second stage of braising -- for both meat and vegetables -- involves 
adding the liquid, covering the pot and consigning it to low heat for the 
duration. While this slow-cooking stage is generally uneventful, it's a good 
idea to give the food a peek and a poke from time to time, lest burning occur 
due to sheer inattention and/or uncooperative cookware. Recently, while I 
blithely chatted in the dining room, I inadvertently manufactured charcoal from 
endive in the kitchen, thanks to a new, unfamiliar pan -- the low heat was, 
clearly, not low enough.  
</P>
<P>
 Braising is the best way to prepare some of the most flavorful but problematic 
cuts of meats. Shanks, ribs and oxtails all require long, moist cooking in 
order to be chewable. In the meantime, your kitchen smells like the best home 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Braising vegetables is a somewhat more delicate and faster process than 
braising meats. Good vegetables to braise are cabbages, celery, Florence 
fennel, artichokes, eggplant, okra, onions, leeks, root vegetables (turnips, 
celery root, carrots, beets, etc.), and chicories (endive, escarole, 
radicchio). 
</P>
<P>
 Some cooks, such as Julia Child, do not saute the vegetables first, but 
arrange them in a buttered pan and add a few inches of liquid, which cooks down 
and is used for basting. I prefer a fast saute in hot oil; I like to imagine 
that the heat binds the fat to the vegetable before any water touches it, so 
that later, as the vegetable cooks in a closed pot, the oil is pushed deep into 
the vegetable, where it does its slow, insinuating, softening work. 
</P>
<P>
 If you become a converted braiseuse or braiseur , you'll need to keep some 
braising liquids on hand. I like to use fresh vegetable broths. Some cooks call 
them insipid, but I prefer to think of them as subtle. Also, they're easy to 
make, aromatic, not too salty, and they don't impose a meat flavor on braised 
vegetables when I don't want it.  
</P>
<P>
 But meat broths and stocks, canned or fresh, with or without a dash of wine, 
make good braises too. I've had excellent braised endive where the braising 
liquid was reconstituted bouillon. Use your imagination. I still remember some 
wonderful oxtails braised in Bourbon. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm happy eating braised meat just as it comes from the pot, with the 
vegetables and de-fatted pan juices spooned over it, but some people like to 
have a sauce they can pour on potatoes or noodles. One simple way to get a 
sauce is to puree the cooked vegetables with the pan juices. Or you could make 
gravy by flouring the meat before browning it or, at the end of cooking, 
stirring in bits of beurre manie (equal parts butter and flour rubbed together 
into a paste) and cooking the pan juices until they thicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Braising is best done in good, heavy pans that conduct heat well and can move 
from the top of the stove into the oven. (The thinner and lighter the pan, the 
greater the tendency to scorch.) Cast iron is almost ideal. Due to the steam 
and liquid involved in braising, however, unless it's remarkably well seasoned, 
cast iron imparts a watery-rusty taste and can discolor vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, nothing stops a devoted braiser. For a long time, I finessed braised 
dishes with frying pans, clay roasting pans and a lot of aluminum foil. 
Recently, a friend advised me to buy those enameled cast-iron pans from France 
whose price tags make you burst into tears. For the same money as a 3 1/2-quart 
oval pot, you can buy a denim jacket at Banana Republic, a portable CD player 
or a permanent wave with comb-out. But if you have the braising bug, the 
pleasures from this pot, I guarantee, are greater than all these items put 
together.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, braising is a forgiving science, and with a little vigilance, your 
pans, whatever they are, won't exclude you from the best results. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a rich, meaty dish with intense mushroom flavor. Serve it with pasta 
dressed with butter and good Parmigiano-Reggiano.  
</P>
<P>
 BRAISED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS WITH PANCETTA 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 large onions, halved and each half quartered 
</P>
<P>
 4 (1/4-inch-thick) slices of pancetta, sliced into 1-inch sections 
</P>
<P>
 4 (4-inch) portobello mushrooms cut into 1/2-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
 2 (4-inch) sprigs fresh rosemary, leaves pulled off stem. 
</P>
<P>
 In heavy Dutch oven heat olive oil over medium-high heat on stove top. Add 
onions and pancetta and cook, stirring gently, until pancetta starts rendering 
and onions become tender, about 2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Add mushrooms. Cook briefly, about 3 minutes, making sure everything is coated 
with hot fat. Stir in rosemary. Cover and cook in 300-degree oven 1 1/2 to 2 
hours, until onions are meltingly tender. Makes 4 servings.

<P>
 Stove-top braising gives bitter lettuces an irresistibly tender, melting 
texture. Handle gently so they don't fall apart when cooking. For a less 
expensive variation, substitute long wedges of Napa cabbage for Belgian endive. 
Even the common yellow onion takes on luxurious dimensions when handled in this 
way.  
</P>
<P>
 BRAISED CHICORIES 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, cut into 4 thick, vertical slices  
</P>
<P>
 2 Belgian endives, halved lengthwise 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1/2-pound) head radicchio, cut into 4 thick slices 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup vegetable stock, about 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 In large skillet or 2 (10-inch) skillets, heat olive oil over medium-high 
heat. Place onions and endives in pan and cook quickly until browned. Turn, 
being careful not to break apart slices. Brown second side, then turn heat to 
low. Add 3 to 5 tablespoons of stock, or until there is small amount of liquid 
simmering in pan.  
</P>
<P>
 Cover and cook over low heat until tender, about 20 minutes. After chicories 
are fork-tender, remove lid, turn up heat to medium and reduce liquid. Allow 
vegetables to brown, turning carefully. Season to taste with salt. Remove to 
platter. Makes 4 servings.

 This is one of the easiest soups I know. The sweetness of the onions and sweet 
potatoes is tempered by the bacon's smokiness.  
</P>
<P>
 BRAISED SWEET POTATO SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 5 slices lean smoked bacon (Canadian bacon or applewood-smoked bacon), chopped 
into 1-inch pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil, optional 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-pound) sweet potato, cut into 1/2-inch slices 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 quart hot vegetable stock 
</P>
<P>
 Roasted pumpkin seeds 
</P>
<P>
 In heavy Dutch oven or enameled cast-iron pot, heat bacon over medium-high 
heat until fat begins to render. Add chopped onion. If more fat is needed, add 
few drops of olive oil.  
</P>
<P>
 Cook onion and bacon together over medium-high heat until tips of onion are 
browned. Add sweet potato and stir, making sure sweet potato slices are coated 
with hot fat. Season to taste with pepper. Cover and cook at 350 degrees 40 
minutes to 1 hour, until sweet potatoes fall apart at touch of fork. 
</P>
<P>
 Add 2 cups hot stock, stirring with fork to loosen all browned particles 
sticking to pan, and smash sweet potato. Add another 2 cups of stock. Simmer 
few minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste. Garnish with pumpkin seeds. Makes 4 
appetizer servings, or 2 main-course servings.

 Have a butcher cut each small shank in two. That way guests aren't confronted 
with hunks of meat that look like cavemen's clubs. In this recipe, the mirepoix 
is made of leeks, celery and carrot, then enhanced with 10 whole cloves of 
garlic and coarsely chopped shiitake mushrooms. If you used dried shiitakes, be 
sure to reserve your soaking water and use it, strained, as some -- or all -- 
of your braising liquid.  
</P>
<P>
 BRAISED LAMB SHANKS 
</P>
<P>
 Olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 small lamb shanks, each cut in half 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups chopped leek, white part only 
</P>
<P>
 1 stalk celery, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 carrot, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 10 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 12 fresh or dried-and-reconstituted shiitake mushrooms 
</P>
<P>
 1 sprig fresh thyme 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup beef stock 
</P>
<P>
 Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in heavy Dutch oven or enameled cast-iron pot 
with lid. Brown all sides of lamb shanks over medium-high heat, about 30 
minutes. Remove shanks to plate. 
</P>
<P>
 If browning oil is scorched, discard and heat fresh oil in pan. Otherwise use 
remaining oil and saute leek, celery, carrot, garlic and mushrooms over 
medium-high heat until brown at tips. Add thyme and enough stock to loosen 
cooked-on particles and fill bottom of pan. Place lamb shanks on vegetables, 
cover tightly and bake at 300 degrees 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until meat is 
thoroughly tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Skim fat from cooking juices and vegetables. Add stock, if necessary, to 
loosen cooked-on bits. Serve shanks with pan juices and vegetables spooned over 
them. Makes 4 servings.

 These oxtails will caramelize beautifully after about three hours in the oven. 
Although one generally figures on one pound of meat-with-bones per person, 
oxtails are so rich that four pounds should serve six healthy appetites. Serve 
with boiled or mashed potatoes and a green salad.  
</P>
<P>
 OXTAILS WITH ORANGE 2 cups fresh orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 20 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
 5 whole allspice 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons peppercorns 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons coarse salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 pounds oxtails 
</P>
<P>
 4 medium-large onions, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 carrots, peeled, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup beef stock 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce orange juice to 1 cup over medium heat, stirring often. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Grind cloves, allspice, peppercorns and salt. Rub oxtails with ground spices, 
using only as much as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat olive oil in heavy Dutch oven or enameled cast-iron pan with lid. Brown 
oxtails thoroughly on all sides over medium-high heat, about 20 minutes. Set 
aside. Unless oil is scorched, use same oil, adding more if necessary, to fry 
onions, carrots and orange zest quickly until just brown at edges. 
</P>
<P>
 Add enough stock to fill pan scant 1/2 inch, about 1 cup. Loosen particles 
sticking to pan and bring to boil. Set oxtails on top of vegetables and 
simmering stock. Drizzle reduced orange juice over each oxtail. Cover and bake 
2 1/2 to 3 hours at 300 degrees, until meat on bones is tender and caramelized. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove oxtails to platter or individual plates. Skim fat off pan drippings. 
Serve oxtails with pan drippings spooned over them. Makes 6 servings.

 Mayi Brady, a food stylist in The Times Test Kitchen, gave us this recipe for 
dessert. This is a gentler braise than most -- the pears bake in butter for the 
first half of the cooking, then bake in cream for the second half -- but the 
characteristic deep flavors and melting textures still emerge . PEARS BRAISED 
IN CREAM 1 1/2 tablespoons butter 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 4 firm pears, peeled, cored and halved 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream 
</P>
<P>
 Rub bottom of 6x9-inch baking dish with 1 tablespoon butter. Sprinkle both 
sugars evenly over bottom of dish. Place pears, cut-side down, in dish and dot 
with remaining butter.  
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees 20 minutes. Pour cream into dish and tilt dish back and 
forth several times to mix with butter-sugar mixture. Bake another 15 minutes 
or until pears are tender when pierced with sharp knife. Serve warm. Makes 4 
servings.

<P>
 I never thought of my mother as a Francophile since the only two French dishes 
that ever came out of her kitchen were bouillabaisse and cassoulet. On the 
other hand, when I was 5, she did redecorate the house and plastered one wall 
of the living room with a map of Paris, which she had had made into wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember spending hours lying on the white shag rug, staring at the picture 
of the Eiffel Tower on the wall (the closest I ever got to Paris when I was a 
kid), and I remember distinctly the smell of those two dishes as they came from 
the kitchen. Bouillabaisse will always remind me of elegant dinner parties. But 
cassoulet I think of as the ultimate comfort food. Haute cuisine comfort food, 
but comfort food nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 There are people who would argue that cassoulet is a provincial dish, not 
haute cuisine . Besides, they'd point out, it can be made from leftovers. In 
fact, I once ordered cassoulet at a three-star restaurant in Paris and all the 
snotty Parisians I was with laughed at me. Why was I ordering a peasant dish at 
a three-star restaurant? Because it reminded me of my mother and I wanted to 
see what it should really taste like. (For the same reason, I once ordered 
chicken mole at a fast-food stand outside a rug store in Tehuatitlan. I did get 
violently ill but still maintain it was one of the best things I ever ate.) 
</P>
<P>
 I have a friend who thinks cassoulet is commune cooking (the inclusion of 
beans, perhaps?), but I don't know how many communes have leftover duck or 
saucisson in their refrigerator. Julia Child thinks cassoulet is an elaborate 
dish best cooked, in leisurely fashion, over a two- to three-day period, and 
for a perfect cassoulet, she's probably right. It probably takes that long for 
the lamb (if you're using lamb) to soak up every bit of flavor of the red wine 
it has been braised in and for the taste of the beans to merge with the 
tomatoes and sausages and other meats. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother agreed with Julia Child, but mother had a full-time cook named 
Evelyn Hall, who operated as a sous-chef on the rare occasions (cassoulet and 
bouillabaisse being two of them) when mother did more in the kitchen than hand 
over the recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother was always bringing food home from her trips. Other people's mothers 
brought home paperweights and snowballs; mine returned with packets of paprika 
tucked in the side pocket of her suitcase. She once smuggled a saucisson from 
France in her white satin hosiery bag and flew home from New York via Boston 
just so she could buy, at Logan Airport, a crate of live lobsters packed in dry 
ice. In fact, the first time we made cassoulet was after she returned from Long 
Island with a shopping bag full of Long Island ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother didn't have much cookbook loyalty. Sometimes she used Julia Child's 
recipe for cassoulet, sometimes this recipe from a cookbook called "The Flavor 
of France" by Narcisse and Samuel Chamberlain (which I'm using here because 
it's much the simpler of the two). 
</P>
<P>
 I like to improvise and use duck instead of goose or chicken sausages instead 
of pork and sometimes, olive oil instead of butter. I make it from leftovers 
because I think it's silly to cook a goose in order to make a cassoulet. 
CASSOULET 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound dried white beans, soaked overnight 
</P>
<P>
 1 onion, stuck with 2 cloves 
</P>
<P>

same skillet cook onion, garlic, tomatoes, 1/2 cup reserved bean stock and salt 
and pepper to taste, covered, 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In large casserole, put half beans, salt pork, sausage, goose and add half of

to come just to surface. Bake at 275 degrees 2 hours, adding more bean stock 
occasionally if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle top with buttered bread crumbs. Bake uncovered 1 hour more, until 
brown crust has formed. Makes 8 to 10 servings.

 For a fast, wine-braised meat, nothing beats a small pork tenderloin. 
</P>
<P>
 Pork tenderloin has the satisfying mouth appeal of a beef tenderloin, with 
about half the fat: 4 ounces of choice grade roasted beef tenderloin that has 
been trimmed to zero fat has about 11.5 grams of total fat; 4 ounces of roasted 
pork tenderloin has 5.5 grams of total fat.Pork tenderloin with capers and 
green olives is a livelyMediterranean-influenced recipe that is quickly 
prepared for two. The combination of oregano, capers, olives, garlic and 
sun-dried tomatoes delivers great taste in this relatively low-fat dish. PORK 
TENDERLOIN WITH CAPERS AND GREEN OLIVES 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic 
</P>
<P>
 1 small onion, cut in half, then into thin half circles 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3/4 pound) pork tenderloin, sliced 1 inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon crushed, dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon capers, drained 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 8 cracked Greek green olives 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup diced sun-dried tomatoes, packed in oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cooked orzo or rice 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in medium skillet. Add garlic and onion and saute until transparent, 
about 5 minutes. Push onion and garlic to side and add pork. Brown on both 
sides. Remove pork and set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir in oregano and wine and cook over medium heat, scraping up browned bits 
in skillet. Stir in capers, olives and tomatoes. Return pork to skillet. Reduce 
heat to low and simmer, covered, until pork is thoroughly cooked, 10 to 15 
minutes. Season to taste with salt and white pepper. Serve over cooked orzo. 
Makes 2 servings.

BACK TO BASICS: PRAISING BRAISING; COOKING WITH THE LID ON

<P>
 Stewing and braising are moist-heat cooking methods, used to tenderize tougher 
(and generally more flavorful) cuts of meat.  
</P>
<P>
 The main difference between the two techniques is the amount of liquid used 
during cooking. Stewed meats are submerged in simmering liquid, while braised 
meats are cooked in just enough liquid to cover the bottom of the pot and keep 
the meat from sticking. Meat is usually left in a whole piece if it's going to 
be braised, but cut into small chunks for stew. 
</P>
<P>
 A heavy Dutch oven with a tight-fitting lid is ideal for both methods. The 
slow simmering can be done either on top of the range or in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the meat is browned before the liquid is added, though this isn't 
necessary. The meat may be just patted dry with paper towels and browned in its 
own juices, allowing the excess fat to be rendered. This technique, called 
"sweating," reduces the amount of fat in the stew. 
</P>
<P>
 The meat may also be dredged with flour, which enhances the browning, helps to 
thicken the liquid and gives the finished stew a rich color. Place some flour 
in a plastic food bag or clean paper bag, add the meat (Step 1), then close the 
bag and shake until evenly coated. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever method you choose, brown the meat slowly over moderate heat. If the 
meat is cut up, cook only a few chunks at a time. Crowding the pan lowers the 
heat, and the meat will turn gray instead of browning. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn the meat (Step 2) until cooked evenly, then remove to a bowl. Continue 
this process until all the meat is browned. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour off any excess fat left in the pan. Return the meat to the Dutch oven and 
add just enough liquid (Step 3) to cover the meat. Water, stock, wine or a 
combination may be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover the pan and place over high heat until the liquid begins to boil. At 
this point, reduce the heat or transfer the Dutch oven to an oven. 
</P>
<P>
 The pan should be left covered during the slow-cooking period, and the 
temperature needs to be controlled to maintain a simmering temperature. This 
gentle cooking tenderizes the meat, leaving it succulent and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing varies with the size of the pieces of meat, but about three hours is 
usually sufficient. Vegetables and additional seasonings may be added during 
the last hour of cooking (Step 4). 
</P>
<P>
 During cooking, the liquid thickens, becoming a sauce. If it hasn't reduced to 
the consistency desired, make a flour-and-water slurry and stir into the 
simmering stew (Step 5). Continue stirring as the liquid thickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although stews take a considerable amount of time to prepare, they can be made 
ahead and refrigerated or frozen. Reheating actually improves most stews 
because there is more time for the flavors to blend. BEEF STEW

WINE: SAUTERNE AND SEDIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What ever happened to sauterne?" asked the reader's letter. The lack of the 
final "s" was the tip-off. She was not asking about the gorgeously rich French 
dessert wine called Sauternes, but about the American "sauterne" we sipped and 
cooked with back in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Properly speaking, Sauternes (note the capital letter and the final "s") is 
the name of a village in Bordeaux that makes a wine of the same name from the 
Semillon grape variety, occasionally blended with Sauvignon Blanc. Wine can't 
be marketed as Sauternes unless a special mold has hit the grapes in the 
vineyard, concentrating the juice. So Sauternes is always a rare wine, and the 
best Sauternes, the luxuriously flavored Chateau d'Yquem, is incredibly 
expensive (about $200 a bottle on release). 
</P>
<P>
 American sauterne (no capital, no final "s") is what is known as a "generic" 
designation, one of several names the U.S. wine industry appropriated from 
European wine regions. There were no legal definitions for names such as 
burgundy, chablis, rhine and sauterne, but over time the first three at least 
developed de facto definitions. Burgundy meant a dry red, chablis a dry (or 
relatively dry) white, rhine a slightly sweet white. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauterne loosely meant a white table wine that was sweeter than chablis. How 
sweet? There was no definition -- and that was the problem. The name sauterne 
was given to wines that were not much sweeter than chablis and to wines that 
were definitely sweet. The buyer never knew what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened to sauterne? People stopped buying it, so wineries stopped 
making it. Lou Foppiano, of Sonoma County's Foppiano Winery, once put it to me 
this way: "We made two white wines back then, a chablis and a sauterne. They 
both came from the same tank and they were the same price. "One year we sold 10 
times as much chablis as we did sauterne. The next year we didn't make 
sauterne." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Another reader wrote asking about a recent dispute in a restaurant. He had 
ordered a bottle of 1990 Bordeaux and found the wine had sediment. After a 
minor flap with the staff, he sent the wine back. He wrote that he was 
concerned about the "chemistry experiment going on before my eyes," as he 
called it, in the wine glass, but said the staff of the restaurant told him the 
wine was sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, sediment in a red wine is no cause for alarm, especially if the 
wine is old. Most red wines get their color and flavor from the grape skins, 
which remain in contact with the juice while the juice is fermenting. The color 
and flavor components are unstable; over time some of them precipitate out. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter formed by the precipitate can be a fine-grained sediment that can 
cling to the inside of the bottle (the French have a lovely term for this: 
chemise ), or it can be chunks of dark matter that float around when you pour 
the wine. This sediment is tasteless and harmless, but it can be slightly 
bitter, which is one reason to decant a wine, leaving the sediment in the 
bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 So the wine was probably fine, and the restaurant, to its credit, took the 
wine back -- just another of the ways restaurateurs can lose money even though 
it's not their fault. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Probably the question readers most often ask is: "Why did they start adding 
sulfites to wine? Ever since they did, I get headaches."  
</P>
<P>
 They didn't just start adding them. Sulfites have always been present in wine, 
and there's actually less in wine today than ever before. The reason people are 
aware of sulfites now is mainly because a decade ago the federal government, 
concerned about how sulfites in food affect asthmatics, began requiring the 
sulfite statement on wine labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulfites are natural byproducts of fermentation, so trace amounts of them are 
present in all young wine. (Old red wine typically has little or no sulfite 
content.) Because sulfites have fungicidal and antioxidant qualities, 
winemakers have long added small amounts of them to wine to protect it from 
spoiling. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, better techniques in fermentation and bottling procedures and 
improved winery equipment have led to smaller and smaller additions of sulfite. 
The average bottle of young wine today contains so little that you'd get as 
much sulfite from one dried apple as from four full bottles of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors say non-asthmatics have little to fear from sulfites in wine because 
the pH of wine (between 3.0 and 3.9) is high enough to keep it from becoming a 
problem. A sulfite solution commonly sprayed on salad bars to preserve the 
bright color of the greens is far more volatile, and it's rendered dangerous by 
the low pH of vinegar- or lemon juice-based salad dressings (well below 2.8). 
These could react with the sulfites on the greens and create a reaction in 
asthmatics and others with respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say there is probably no connection between sulfites and red wine 
headaches. Research continues into why some people get headaches after 
consuming red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of wineries are now making wines without adding sulfites, including 
Frey Winery, Organic Wine Works, Fetzer Vineyards and H. Coturri and Son Ltd. 
Some of their wines are permitted to be released without the sulfite statement 
on their labels. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Joseph de Vienne Macon-Villages ($10) -- Remember a decade ago when you 
had to pay $20 to get a decent Pouilly-Fuisse, when it was even more popular 
than Chardonnay? As American demand for Pouilly-Fuisse drove its price up, the 
prices for the related Macon Blanc and Macon-Villages rose with it, to the $15 
level in many cases. But in the last two years, white Burgundy prices have 
eased as consumers have discovered alternatives. Most Pouilly-Fuisse today is 
in the $15 to $18 range, Macon is $7 to $14. 
</P>
<P>
 This Macon-Villages is sprightly and fresh, with loads of fruit and a racy 
aftertaste. Not much oak here, it's just a crisp, food-friendly white wine that 
tastes as good as most Pouilly-Fuisse, and better than some selling for a lot 
more. It may be discounted to $9 or so.

 What's the secret of these fabulous plump roasted peanuts, and why do they 
smell so incredibly good when you open the package? Simple. They're fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our peanuts are roasted and shipped within a week," says Susan Cloutier of 
Jimbo's Jumbos Inc. "People don't realize peanuts are perishable and will go 
stale within six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 After the peanuts (Virginia-type, the best variety for eating) are harvested, 
they are transported to Jimbo's processing plant in Edenton, N.C. -- a small 
coastal town (population 6,000) about 120 miles northeast of Raleigh -- where 
they're stored raw until there's an order for them. Then three full-time peanut 
sorters choose only the jumbo-sized ones for roasting. (The rejects become 
peanut oil and other products.) Using a closely monitored process that controls 
the temperature and moisture level, these premium goobers are roasted and 
immediately packed for shipping.  
</P>
<P>
 The gift shop and mail-order division of Jimbo's Jumbos, called Nuts Divine, 
is located on the plant premises. A 10-pound bushel basket of salted or 
unsalted jumbos in the shell sells for $25.75. A 13-ounce burlap bag costs 
$4.95. Since there's a $2.95 shipping and handling charge for every order, the 
best buy is the 25-pound bag, $41. Besides, who can eat just one peanut?

 Mail never smelled so good.

CALAVERAS AND JACK O' LANTERNS; BEYOND JACK O' LANTERNS

 Most of us tend to think the principal use of pumpkins (apart from Halloween 
jack-o'-lanterns) is pumpkin pie. Even then, most people use pumpkin from a 
can, rather than from a fresh pumpkin. That's a pity, because fresh pumpkin is 
easy to prepare and certainly more tasty than the canned type. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always take advantage of the fresh-pumpkin season as soon as it starts," 
says Terrance Brennan, chef-owner of Manhattan's popular Picholine. "The 
pumpkin soup I prepared for our new menu is now a vegetarian dish -- I stopped 
using chicken stock in the soup, first because that was the choice of many of 
our customers who avoid meat and meat products, and also because water does not 
obscure the delicate pumpkin flavor. We also serve pumpkin and wild 
mushroom-filled ravioli with brown butter and Parmesan cheese, and a delicious 
pumpkin bread pudding." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarabeth Levine, known to many for her Sarabeth's restaurants in New York and 
also for her line of homemade preserves, is wild about pumpkins too. "In my 
restaurants the pumpkin muffin has no special season. It has been my signature 
muffin and a year-round favorite since I opened." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 If you want to cook your own pumpkin for a pie, make sure to buy an 
orange-fleshed sugar pumpkin or pie pumpkin, usually available at farmers 
markets and at roadside stands in the fall. Don't under any circumstances use 
the jack-o'-lantern-type pumpkin (the most common kind in supermarkets), which 
is watery and insipid when cooked. You may also substitute cooked sweet 
potatoes or acorn squash for the pumpkin. 
</P>

 This quickly made soup would be perfect as a first course for a fall or 
Thanksgiving dinner.

CALAVERAS AND JACK O' LANTERNS; DISHES FOR THE DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUADALUPE RIVERA and MARIE-PIERRE COLLE, Rivera and Colle are the authors of 
Frida's Fiestas, (Clarkson/Potter), from which this article is excerpted. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frida Kahlo was a noted artist who was married to Mexican muralist Diego 
Rivera. They lived together in the Blue House in Coyoacan, outside of Mexico 
City. This is a remembrance by his daughter of one particular celebration of 
the Day of the Dead.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of October, the Blue House moved into high gear. The night 
before, Ines the carpenter had put the finishing touches on the table that 
would hold our offerings to the family dead, among them Frida's mother, dona 
Matilde. This was in keeping with one of the Mexican people's most ancient and 
deeply rooted customs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since dona Matilde had been born in Oaxaca, Frida asked the carpenter to build 
the table according to the customs of that beautiful southern state, and Ines 
followed the instructions to the last detail. The holiday would take place on 
two consecutive days: Nov. 1, which honors the dead children of the family, and 
Nov. 2, the Day of the Dead, also known as the Day of the Faithful Departed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ines had begun cutting zempazuchitl flowers from the family garden on the 
night of Oct. 31. Some of these he scattered over the table, so that "when the 
little angels returned they will be greeted by the brilliance and shining 
colors of these flowers, the color of the sun." He strung other flowers 
together into garlands, which he then placed on three wooden chests already 
decorated with golden flowers. The chests stood at the head of the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My stepmother, "Fridu," as I liked to call her, had already been to the 
Coyoacan market for the necessities: fruit for the punch, chiles and other 
ingredients for the moles. She also bought tamales and other dishes dear to her 
mother, since popular belief had it that the family dead, dona Matilde among 
them, would come on Nov. 2 to enjoy their favorite foods, which should be 
properly prepared and attractively served. 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of the 31st, Frida and I went to the old Merced neighborhood 
in the center of town to collect her friend Carmen Sevilla, a great artist with 
papier-mache. Sevilla's calaveras (sugar skulls and dancing skeletons) were 
valued by connoisseurs of this popular genre as authentic works of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Frida decorated the offering table with the smallest of the dancing skeletons 
and sugar figurines of lambs, chickens, bulls and ducks, along with other 
calaveras. The ones that Carmen Sevilla had made decorated the dining room 
walls and Frida's studio. The house was transformed into a place where death 
was an object of wonder and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 1, the first day of the festival, the children's food was placed on 
the table: mugs of atole (a sweet cornmeal beverage), plates of beans and 
mildly seasoned food, fruit and sweets. Frida provided dessert: sugar paste 
candies, pumpkin smothered in traditional brown-sugar syrup, and sugar skulls 
with the names of the family dead written on their heads in sugar letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, local confectioners make sugar skulls in all sizes, from truly 
astonishing life-size ones to bite-size miniatures for the children. Frida 
bought four of the largest and had the names of Matilde, Guillermo, Diego and 
Frida written on them as a tribute to her parents, her husband and herself. The 
names of other adult members of Frida's family were written on medium-size 
skulls, while the smallest bore the names of the four youngest people in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge pumpkins were decorated with little silver and gold flags, and the center 
of the table was occupied by a Oaxacan platter piled with Frida's mother's 
favorite fruits and nuts in season: sugar cane, limes, mandarin oranges, 
peanuts and jicamas, which were also decorated with little colored flags. 
Finally, Frida placed sugar paste figurines here and there on the table and, 
for the final touch, set candles at the four corners of a mock grave fashioned 
of paper flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, Nov. 2, the altar was dedicated to the Faithful Departed, 
with special attention to dona Matilde. Early in the morning, Frida placed a 
picture of her mother on the mock grave. The offerings to the children were 
replaced with adult food and sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional foods were served throughout the day. Breakfast consisted of atole 
and chocolate, dead man's bread, cookies in the shape of little bones, beans, 
tortillas and pasilla chile sauce, along with the brown corn tlacoyos that 
Matilde Kahlo had so enjoyed. The midday meal consisted of yellow and red moles 
, Oaxacan beef jerky, red rice with dried shrimp, chicken sauteed in chile 
pipian , pumpkin in syrup, sweet potatoes in sancocho, tamales in plantain 
leaves, white atole and fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 At that time Frida was teaching painting at La Esmeralda, a public art school 
dedicated to furthering the tradition of Mexican mural painting. Some of 
Frida's students were painting the exterior walls of a small pulque shop owned 
by a woman named "La Rosita" (Rosy) and these students paid Frida a visit on 
Nov. 3. She invited them in to see the offering and to eat their share of the 
food that was left on the table "after the departed had paid their respects." 
It was traditional for the living to finish the remaining food and sweets -- to 
wipe the plates clean, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to the usual practice, on this Day of the Dead alcoholic beverages 
were allowed. Frida's students contributed a delicious fresh pulque that Rosita 
had made and sent to their illustrious teacher. Frida also urged people to 
drink whiskey and brandy, a practice she had picked up in New York and Paris. 
But when my father returned home, Frida switched to drinking tequila. DEAD

PLEASE DON'T SQUEEZE THE POMEGRANATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN T. BARRETT, Barrett writes about food and wine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When my husband and I bought our house in the Hollywood Hills, its tiny yard 
was dotted with a sorry collection of unkempt trees -- trees that shed dark, 
purple berries that stuck to our shoes and stained our rugs; trees that spewed 
white, fuzzy seeds that carpeted the surface of our pool; misshapen pines that 
dropped needles onto our patio. One stunted specimen inclined alarmingly to one 
side -- the leaning tree of Pisa. 
</P>
<P>
 That fall, the stunted, leaning tree produced three pomegranates, and we 
decided to keep it. In the spring, we had the pomegranate tree replanted and 
properly pruned. Now it grew straight up, with a graceful, well-proportioned 
air. The following autumn, it doubled production -- six pomegranates -- and we 
felt very smug indeed. A year later, the six-foot tree went ballistic: 39 
pomegranates. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first one split open in November, revealing its honeycomb of 
glistening magenta seeds, I knew I had to take appropriate action. "I will make 
pomegranate jelly," I declared. 
</P>
<P>
 I got out all my canning books and cookbooks and perused the indices. No 
pomegranate jelly. "Joy of Cooking" advised that pomegranates make good jelly 
and warned not to bruise the seeds ("for an unpleasant flavor develops"), but 
offered no recipe.  
</P>
<P>
 I was on my own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First, I had to figure out how to separate the pomegranate juice from the 
seeds in a relatively efficient manner. I did a little experiment, opening up a 
couple of pomegranates. I peeled the white pith away from the seeds, 
transferred the seeds into a saucepan, added a little water and brought the 
mixture to a simmer. When the mixture had liquefied, I poured the juice through 
a sieve and pressed out the last drops.  
</P>
<P>
 I placed the seeds from the other pomegranate into a potato ricer and crushed 
them, as gently as possible, over a bowl. (Crushing them in a sieve would 
probably have worked as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 Results: The cooked juice had a far better flavor than the fresh-crushed 
juice, which was bitter and had an earthy taste. "Joy of Cooking" was right. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of advice. Don't try seeding 37 pomegranates if you have any near-term 
bookings as a hand model. One full week after the ordeal, after much scrubbing, 
my fingers still bore a slight yellow-brown stain from the pomegranate pith. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was kind of fun. Some swollen-ripe pomegranates almost burst apart 
when you score them with a knife; it's a phenomenon not unlike that of a matron 
unzipping her girdle. My travail yielded 13 cups of pomegranate seeds, which I 
deemed worth the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step was to determine whether the juice contained enough natural 
pectin to jell. One does this by combining a spoonful of cooked, cooled juice 
with two spoonfuls of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol. If the mixture contains 
natural pectin, after a minute flakes of jelled material will form in the 
juice. (Note: Isopropyl alcohol is poisonous; do not taste this mixture. 
Discard it safely.) The pomegranate juice showed no evidence of jelling, 
meaning that it would require pectin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To begin the jelly-making process, I simmered the pomegranate seeds with a bit 
of water until the mixture had liquefied. Then I poured the mixture through 
cheesecloth, leaving it to drain overnight. The next day, I followed the 
directions on the pectin package and cooked the juice in two batches with 
pectin and sugar, poured it into sterilized jars, sealed them, put them in a 
boiling water bath for five minutes and began the gloating process, an integral 
last step in home canning. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomegranate jelly is ruby-colored and crystalline. It explodes with tart 
flavor and is just about the favorite preserve I make. Since early November is 
the peak season for pomegranates in my neck of the woods, the timing is perfect 
for holiday entertaining and gift-giving. 
</P>
<P>
 And you don't need to have a tree. When pomegranates are in peak season (late 
October through early November), they cost about 59 cents apiece, but you can 
often find them for less. So, the fruit cost runs about $1 per jar -- not 
exorbitant when compared to the price of gourmet preserves and jellies. 
POMEGRANATE JELLY 
</P>
<P>
 15 to 17 pomegranates, depending on size, yielding about 6 to 7 cups seeds 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1 3/4-ounce) package powdered pectin 
</P>
<P>
 6 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Working over bowl to catch juice, separate pomegranate seeds from pith by 
scoring each fruit with knife and breaking shell apart, then separating seeds 
with your fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer seeds and juice to saucepan and add about 1 cup water to keep seeds 
from scorching. Bring to boil and simmer 20 to 25 minutes, or until membrane 
around individual seeds has broken down and mixture has liquefied.  
</P>
<P>
 Using either jelly bag or sieve lined with double thickness of cheesecloth, 
pour hot liquid into bag and let juice drip through into bowl or saucepan. Let 
juice drain 12 hours or overnight. You can press mixture gently with back of 
spoon to extract more juice, but only very gently; do not squeeze, or jelly 
will be cloudy. When juice has finished draining, discard pulp and measure 
juice. There should be about 4 cups. Add up to 1/2 cup water to make exactly 4 
1/2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterilize 7 (1/2-pint) jars by boiling in large canning kettle with rack 10 
minutes. Leave in canner until ready to use. Place new lids and screw-bands in 
saucepan full of water. Bring to boil and remove from heat, leaving pan 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour pomegranate juice into large saucepan and stir in pectin. Bring mixture 
to full rolling boil over high heat, stirring constantly. Quickly add sugar. 
Return mixture to full rolling boil and boil 1 minute, stirring constantly. 
Remove from heat and skim off any foam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladle jelly into sterilized jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of rim. Wipe rims 
clean and seal with lids and screw-bands. Place jars in boiling water bath 
canner and boil 5 minutes. Remove jars from canner, set on clean towel and let 
cool, undisturbed, 24 hours. Makes 7 (1/2-pint) jars.

GOOD COOKING: PUT UP AND CHILL OUT

 In fall, we still have an old-fashioned urge to "put up" some of the harvest's 
bounty. Fortunately, home pickling and preserving need not be as complicated as 
you might think, thanks to the refrigerator. Refrigerator-held preserves may 
have a limited shelf life, but they still give us a chance to "put things by." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following recipes that use the stalwarts of the fall harvest all 
loading the farm stands right now -- pickling cucumbers, tart fall apples and 
young sweet beets. Freshness is the key to successful pickling and preserving. 
Once you've bought the ingredients, make the recipes as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These easy recipes yield small quantities, but they can also be doubled or 
tripled according to needs. In order for flavors to fully develop, keep these 
condiments at least a day or two before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These homemade crisps are bright-green and very fresh-tasting, quite unlike 
those you can buy.  
</P>
<P>
 SWEET DILL CUCUMBER CRISPS 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups thinly sliced unpeeled pickling cucumbers, about 1 pound cucumbers 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup thinly sliced, quartered green peppers 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup thinly sliced, quartered red onions 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup white vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons dried dill 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon mustard seeds 
</P>
<P>
 Put cucumbers, green peppers, red onions and salt in 2-quart bowl. Cover with 
cold water. Soak 2 hours. Drain in colander. Return to bowl. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile combine sugar, vinegar, dill and mustard seeds in 1-quart 
non-aluminum pan. Bring to boil. Cook until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat. 
Cool to room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour cool mixture over cucumbers. Toss to combine. Refrigerate at least 2 days 
to allow flavors to meld together. Can be kept up to 1 month, refrigerated. 
Makes 4 cups.

 Beets elicit a strong response -- positive or negative! Here, they're mixed 
with thinly sliced shallots in a spicy orange juice mixture. They're great in a 
composed salad paired with portions of celery root remoulade and shredded 
carrots or as a component in a Cobb salad. They are also a flavorful condiment 
relish with a wide variety of meals.

 Cool weather puts us in the mood for more substantial fare such as spaghetti 
with a hearty tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 But while most versions tend to be loaded with meat and oil, in our low-fat 
version plum tomatoes and whole cloves of garlic are grilled on a heavy iron 
stove-top grill for a slightly charred flavor.They're then combined with a 
good, hearty red wine for a sauce that not only has great flavor, but is rich 
in color. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 15 minutes you'll have a very flavorful low-fat pasta sauce that 
tastes like it has cooked much longer. Stir in the fresh herbs and you're ready 
to serve. SPAGHETTI WITH CHARRED TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds plum tomatoes

MACARONI AS A MELLOW MIDWEEK MEAL

<TEXT>

 Although weeknight cooking is about as popular as grocery shopping at 9 a.m. 
on a Saturday morning, it's sometimes unavoidable. But with a little planning, 
a weeknight meal can be a delightful, healthy and relaxing alternative to 
either eating out or dialing for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta, which every cook should have by the cupboardful, is the base for an 
effortless meal. The simplest pasta dinners are spaghetti with a little olive 
oil and seasonings. Crushed red pepper flakes, garlic and cheese all enhance 
the basics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the following recipe, bucatini , a sort of thick macaroni, is tossed with 
cheese, bacon and crushed red pepper flakes. The pasta must be tossed quickly 
and vigorously, or the cheese will clump into a hard, unappetizing mass. If 
this happens, add a little milk or cream to the pan and cook over low heat 
until the cheese blends in.

 Look for fresh spinach, available triple-rinsed and packed in plastic food 
bags so it doesn't require additional rinsing. It makes a quick salad. Add oil 
and vinegar, or be extravagant and flavor spinach with walnuts, soy sauce and 
sugar as well. SPINACH-WALNUT SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 2 packed cups torn spinach, stems removed 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped walnuts 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons soy sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 teaspoons rice wine vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 teaspoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Combine spinach and walnuts in salad bowl. Toss to mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Stir together soy sauce, sugar, 2 teaspoons vinegar and 2 teaspoons oil in 
cup. Season to taste with salt and pepper.  
</P>
<P>
 Pour over spinach mixture and toss gently but well. If more dressing is 
desired, add remaining 1 teaspoon vinegar and oil. Makes 2 servings. BUCATINI 
WITH BACON, CHEESE AND PEPPER 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound bucatini or spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound bacon 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Cook bucatini in large pan of boiling, salted water according to package 
directions until tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile cook bacon in large skillet until crisp. Remove bacon and drain on 
paper-towel-lined plate. Drain off all but 1 tablespoon fat. 
</P>
<P>
 When pasta is done, spoon 1 to 2 tablespoons cooking liquid into skillet with 
fat. Drain pasta well and add to skillet. Add cheese, red pepper flakes and 
crumbled bacon. Toss well and fast so cheese doesn't clump up. Season 
generously to taste with pepper and lightly with salt. Serve immediately. Makes 
2 servings.
