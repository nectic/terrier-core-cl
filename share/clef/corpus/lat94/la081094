O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; KING SUNNY MINISTERS TO THE JOYS OF JUJU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King Sunny Ade will tell you that he didn't invent the Nigerian-bred pop music 
known as juju . Instead, he'll give credit to such musicians as his mentor, 
Tunde Nightengale, with whom he played in the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ade can take credit not only for introducing a generation of Americans to 
juju but for stirring up U.S. interest in African popular music as a whole. 
When the Island label released Ade's "Juju Music" in the early '80s, it 
attracted wide interest among the college/alternative set and others just tired 
of the same old, same old pop dribble. 
</P>
<P>
 The hit from the album "Ja Fun Mi" typified the genre: multilayered 
percussion, embellished with steel and electric guitar and floating, often 
rhythmically counter-pointed vocal harmonies. The elements came together in a 
groove so seductive that even die-hard punk fans couldn't help but get up and 
move.  
</P>
<P>
 Ade still has that groove, as he proved during his two-hour-plus show at the 
Coach House Monday night. But while the style and instrumentation of his 
ensemble has stayed the same, tunes such as "Ja Fun Mi" have evolved with 
variations that keep the familiar number fresh. The Stones may get away with 
playing "Brown Sugar" much as they did 20 years ago, but Ade and company have 
chosen to add vastly different wrinkles. Isn't that what being an artist is all 
about? 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-piece band assembled piecemeal before our eyes. Two hand drummers came 
out and established a beat, followed by the rattling buzz of the bead-covered 
shekere and a pair of talking drums. Soon, maracas and congas were in place, 
creating an intense percussive fabric. Then came the bass, keyboard, guitars 
and, finally, Ade.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group maintained an insistent, up-tempo drive through the first three 
numbers while Ade and his four-man vocal section circled the stage in roughly 
choreographed steps. A cooler pace then was established, leading into the 
strains of a "Ja Fun Mi" that moved dreamily, with spontaneous vocal-breaks 
popping up during the chorus and appropriately moody solos from Jonah Williams' 
keyboard, Fatoke Abiodun's steel guitar and Ade's own snappy electric guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it was back to more heated grooves speckled with more unexpected 
vocal breaks and flashing patter from the talking drums. Though one of the best 
things about the band is the salty twang it derives from slightly off-key 
guitars, the ensemble work was executed with tight precision as the vocal and 
instrumental sections stopped and started as one. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other rhythmic breather came when Ade dedicated a number as a prayer 
to his homeland, "to keep it cool." With only the slightest embellishment from 
a single talking drum, four harmonizing reverent voices took on gospel flavors 
as they melded into a honey-colored whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert ended as it began: The ensemble deconstructed as it exited from 
the stage, leaving only the barest percussive threads hanging. This revealed 
the various parts of Ade's infectious formula and was itself a lesson in 
counterpoint and polyrhythm. As our own pop music evolves into more basic 
rhythmic and harmonic forms, it's refreshing to hear what contrasting detail 
can do. It's no wonder that in his homeland, Ade is known as "Minister of 
Enjoyment."

MOVIE REVIEW; QUEENS OF THE ROAD; THREE DRAG PERFORMERS TAKE A BAWDY, MUSICAL 
JOURNEY IN 'PRISCILLA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Drag is the Drug," the posters at Cannes promoting "The Adventures of 
Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" announced, not without reason. The comic pizazz 
and bawdy dazzle of this film's vision of gaudy drag performers trekking across 
the Australian outback certainly has a boisterous, addictive way about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But like any self-respecting drug, "Priscilla" comes with its own built-in 
hangover. Sharing screen space with the film's raunchy humor and outrageous 
musical numbers is a strain of conventional sentimentality that would not be 
inappropriate on the Disney Channel. It doesn't ruin the fun, but it certainly 
takes the edge off it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons writer-director Stephan Elliott has given for making 
"Priscilla" was a desire to bring back the vintage Hollywood musical, and, like 
the old MGM classics, this film is definitely at its best when its trio of 
performers are out there with a lip-synced song in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's Mitzi (Hugo Weaving) opening the movie with a torchy rendition of 
"I've Been to Paradise but I've Never Been to Me" or Felicia (Guy Pearce) 
belting out a Verdi aria in a silver lame gown on top of a moving bus, or the 
two of them plus Bernadette (Terence Stamp) going into synchronized versions of 
"I Will Survive," "Shake Your Groove Thing" and almost anything by ABBA, all in 
outfits that beggar description, the musical numbers are sure-fire and 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mitzi and Felicia are more conventional (if that is the right word) drag 
queens who also answer to the names Tick and Adam, respectively, Bernadette is 
a hormone-ingesting transsexual who goes ballistic whenever her former given 
name of Ralph crosses anyone's lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having made a career out of being what Elliott calls "a heterosexual 
icon," Stamp is the movie's major surprise, gracefully convincing as 
Bernadette, a woman no longer trapped in a man's body. Elegant and dignified 
with enough hauteur for an entire royal family, the resilient Bernadette is a 
creature of haunted and exquisite gestures, and Stamp doesn't allow you to feel 
that even the smallest of them is false. 
</P>
<P>
 Though this performance is "Priscilla's" most fully realized, the other two 
leads are also expertly done, partly because Elliott has written them with a 
well-adjusted liveliness and specificity that gives the actors a good deal to 
work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Tick is the most solid and stable of the three, an established performer and 
the catalyst for the trip as well. (Weaving, incidentally, was memorable in a 
completely different role as the angry blind photographer in Jocelyn 
Moorehouse's "Proof.") 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to his pals, Tick was married before he became a fixture of Sydney's 
gay scene, and out of nowhere he gets a phone call from his ex, who manages a 
resort in middle-of-nowhere Alice Springs and is desperate for entertainers. 
Can he make the trip and, more important, dare he tell his friends who asked 
him to perform? 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadette, grieving for a recently dead husband, is persuaded to come along 
for a change of scene. Adam, an amusingly malicious party animal, is always up 
for something new and even produces the money for the group's bus, christened 
Priscilla. Besides, he confesses, he's always wanted to travel to the outback 
and "climb Kings Canyon as a queen," decked out in a Gautier gown, heels and a 
tiara. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio's alcohol-drenched trip through the desert (which caused French 
critics to call the film "Florence d'Arabie") takes up most of "Priscilla." The 
best part of that is the ribald interaction among the three performers, all of 
whom, especially "cesspool mouth" Adam, have rude and dangerous tongues that 
can flay the flesh off the unwary. 
</P>
<P>
 Less unsettling, in fact regrettably predictable, are most of the adventures 
that these three run into on their pilgrimage. Not surprisingly, their 
appearance completely flummoxes the uncomprehending and often angry straight 
people at each of their stops, and the homophobic scrapes that result have a 
tendency to feel contrived. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the exception of auto mechanic Bob (veteran all-purpose Australian 
actor Bill Hunter), those met on the road who are not hostile, like Tick's 
wife, are as unconvincingly cheerful and saccharine as Adam is blistering. 
Their glibness and compassion make an odd contrast with the bitchy talk on the 
bus, but, to its credit, whenever things get too treacly, "Priscilla" knows 
enough to break out those frocks and get the show in gear. That is 
entertainment for sure. 
</P>

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEWS; BREA 'OLIVER!' MAKES THE ORPHAN BUSINESS LOOK EASY; 
THE MUSICAL LOSES SOME OF ITS PUNCH WITH ITS LIGHTHEARTED INTERPRETATION AND 
EQUAL-OPPORTUNITY CASTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At last Saturday night's performance of "Oliver!" in Brea, just after Oliver 
makes his plea for more gruel to a thunderstruck Mr. Bumble, a young girl in 
the audience turned toward her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's gruel?" she whispered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like soup," replied the mother, "only kind of bland." 
</P>
<P>
 This "Oliver!" is a little like that, too. It starts with some fine 
ingredients: chiefly the central characters and basic story line borrowed from 
Charles Dickens' "Oliver Twist," and some memorable tunes by its adapter, 
Lionel Bart. But problems including an over-large cast and the three directors' 
apparent fondness for laughs over substance causes the show to lose some of its 
savor. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the orphans' gruel, it's warming as it goes down and it leaves you 
feeling good for the moment, but you can't help wishing for a bit of meat 
besides. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed and choreographed by Tim Kashani, Sarah Ramsey-Duke and Joshua Eklund 
and featuring more than 130 local children and adults (most roles are double 
cast), "Oliver!" continues through Aug. 14 at the Curtis Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 To be fair, Kashani, Ramsey-Duke and Eklund face hurdles that a professional 
production wouldn't present. This show is co-produced by the city of Brea and 
the nonprofit Stagelight Family Productions, and the powers that be want to 
give as many children as possible an opportunity to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 The intent is admirable, but the production suffers for it. For example, where 
20 or 30 boys would suffice in the workhouse or in Fagin's gang, this show has 
70 or 80, and the mechanics of moving such a group around on stage can't help 
but take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The female-to-male ratio in the cast poses another dilemma. Not only were most 
of the workhouse "boys" girls, but the directors chose to alternate two girls 
in the role of Dodger and a young woman in the part of the undertaker, Mr. 
Sowerberry. Luckily, those in the cast at Saturday's performance were well up 
to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dodger, Jessica Schlenz had a gutsy singing voice and the proper rascally 
outlook. And Ann Holub's take on Sowerberry was alternately ghoulish and 
goofball. Her "Beetlejuice"-ish mannerisms and some devilish sight gags thrown 
into "That's Your Funeral" probably had Mr. Dickens spinning in his grave, but 
the kids seemed to get a laugh from them. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the only time the directors sacrificed the original story for the 
sake of a lighter touch. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the scene leading up to the favorite "Where Is Love? -- Who Will 
Buy?" was so truncated that audiences unfamiliar with the story had no idea why 
Oliver was suddenly so grateful, nor a clue as to what the heck he was doing in 
Mr. Brownlow's house in the first place. (Brownlow makes quick mention of it 
later on.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Arehart had an appealing vulnerability as Oliver, though he wasn't up to 
the musical demands of the role. Louis Lippitt's Mr. Bumble and Michelle 
Darrah's Widow Courney were well matched in their blustery self-righteousness, 
but again, the characters that Dickens created as piteously laughable are 
played way over the top here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The anchors in this cast are Darrell Baker as Fagin, Glen Seibert as Bill 
Sykes and Ramsey-Duke as Nancy (only Baker alternates in his role; the other 
two appear in all shows.) 
</P>
<P>
 A journeyman character actor, Baker gives us a Fagin that is a nice mix of 
geniality, deviousness and cowardice, and he adds a needed spark to the musical 
numbers with his boys. Seibert's Sykes is nastiness personified (what does 
Nancy see in this guy, anyway?), and his rumbling rendition of "My Name" packs 
menace aplenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey-Duke obviously has had musical-theater training, and her moments on 
stage, particularly in numbers such as "It's a Fine Life" and "As Long as He 
Needs Me" are among the show's high points. 
</P>
<P>
 Clowes and Associates' two-level set, comprising several movable stairways 
ascending to a U-shaped catwalk, provides a nice way around the overcrowding 
problem on stage: When things get too cramped on the first level, the directors 
just line the stairs with bodies. 
</P>
<P>

7:30 p.m.; Saturday-Sunday matinees, 2 p.m. Ends Sunday. $7.50 to $9.50. (714)

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MATTEA WALKS AWAY A WINNER -- BUT SHE COULD SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the new songs Kathy Mattea played Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House 
was "The Cape," a bouncy ditty by Guy Clark about a seemingly wacko guy who 
spends his whole life jumping off garages attempting to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing it, Mattea said she considers the protagonist a role model for her 
as she grows old -- not a strange wish considering the tune's happy ending: "He 
did not know he could not fly . . . so he did." 
</P>
<P>
 But of the many things Mattea has going for her to date, a crazy streak isn't 
one of them. She's the person who coolly and logically talks the guy down from 
the roof, not joins him. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, while her music often charms, comforts and uplifts, it rarely 
soars. That may be the reason that despite nearly a decade-long string of hits, 
her attractive dusky alto, her commendable refusal to pander for success with 
lowest-common-denominator material and her brightly engaging stage persona, she 
remains a notch removed from the bona fide queens of country music. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patsy Clines, Loretta Lynns and Emmylou Harrises have dared take the leaps 
of faith required to reach the entrance to musical Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest Mattea came was when she closed the show with "Who's Gonna Know," 
another one from her new "Walking Away a Winner" album. Written by her husband, 
Jon Vezner, the song is the lament of an only child who realizes that once his 
parents die, there'll be no one left with whom to share and validate his 
earliest memories. 
</P>
<P>
 It risks coming off as self-pitying, and, in singing it, Mattea walked the 
fine line between bathos and sorrow. Ultimately, her unflagging good taste kept 
her on the right side of that line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most everything else in her 68-minute early show was precisely where it 
belonged: pristine two-, three- and four-part harmonies, compact instrumental 
solos and colorful song arrangements closely replicating the recorded versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the 16 songs were from the new album, which, like its 
predecessors, is a case study in good taste. The one real stylistic leap of the 
evening was an a cappella gospel number on which Mattea took the lead while 
earthy background vocals were supplied by harmony singer Christie Westmoreland, 
guitarist Jonathan Yudkin, bassist Gerry Gillespie and steel guitarist Paul 
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 But even on that number, when she reached the line "I heard the hellhounds 
barking," she couldn't conjure the visceral sense of evil that gives the great 
gospel singers their springboard to salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 That requires complete freedom from self-consciousness, something she 
addressed in "Come From the Heart," a No. 1 country hit for her in 1989. It's a 
study in lessons on life passed down by a wise elder (one of her favorite types 
of song, judging by the frequency with which she records them). 
</P>
<P>
 She punctuated its lyric -- "You've got to dance like nobody's watching" -- 
with a goofy little dance step, which she tossed off and then coyly curtsied, 
almost apologetically. It was a warmly human moment, but one that proved she 
has yet fully to take her own good advice to heart.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEWS; IN CHARLOTTE'S WORDS, 'WEB' IS SOME WRITING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there was one story nearly every kid in my neighborhood seemed to know, it 
was E.B. White's "Charlotte's Web." A little girl down the block named her dog 
Wilbur, after the farmyard pig saved from the farmer's butcher knife by 
Charlotte the spider. The story had that kind of pull. 
</P>
<P>
 So it wasn't surprising to learn that the Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse 
Children's Theatre put out a general call for all interested local kids when 
casting for its new production of "Charlotte's Web." Unlike other kids' theater 
shows at the playhouse, the auditions were open to anyone. The story still has 
that kind of pull. 
</P>
<P>
 With that production background, it's also not surprising that the cast under 
Ian Downs' direction is not an array of kids obviously auditioning for show-biz 
careers. Nearly every one of them is having fun, even if a few of them look a 
bit scared performing in front of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have forgotten the story, Charlotte (Tammy Donahue) takes pity 
on Wilbur (Ashley Brown) when the Zuckerman farm clan led by Homer (Stephen 
Boyer) decides that their pig is due to be turned into pork chops. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte begins to write words in her web praising Wilbur (i.e. "SOME PIG," 
"RADIANT"). Charlotte's web not only saves Wilbur; it turns him into the star 
of the county fair. 
</P>
<P>
 White's overt message was that few things in life matter as much as one true 
friend, but his underlying one is usually lost -- that words aren't just words, 
and that writing is a powerful gift. (White's other perennial classic is every 
writer's essential guide, "The Elements of Style.") 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the continuing popularity of "Charlotte's Web" is a cheering fact 
amid a welter of news that kids today are in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Robinette's adaptation is appropriately faithful but in no way 
substitutes for reading the book. Downs, with Lewie Stier (set), Matt Nelson 
(lights) and Larry Blake and Nelson (sound), fashions some charming stage 
touches like a glowing moon and exploding fireworks at the fair. It's poetic, 
on a budget, but not like White's own prose poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You have to hope, then, that this show will succeed in its best act, which is 
to make the kids in the audience search out the book after the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's well-spoken, charming Charlotte would be enough to do that, and 
though Brown appeared a bit bothered Saturday by her snout makeup, she made you 
feel for Wilbur. Porcelain-featured Amy Abbascia is quiet-voiced but touching 
as Fern, the little girl who cheers on both Charlotte and Wilbur. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the human and animal supporting characters, Emily Rosen's Templeton the 
Rat (with terrific help from costumer Pat Tompkins) and Kaitlin Parrovechio's 
double-turn as a fair announcer and Wilbur's arrogant porcine competition 
display some real charm and comedy.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PHIL COLLINS: EVER THE EVERYGUY OF POP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the last 25 years, Phil Collins has undergone one of the odder 
transformations in pop music. He began his music career drumming with Genesis, 
when that band was led by Peter Gabriel and was considered one of the headier 
British art-rock outfits. He's become a mega-successful mainstream crooner. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 35 million records sold and a half-dozen Grammys collected for 
his solo work, Collins doesn't have many pop summits left to conquer. He does, 
however, have plenty of fans to entertain, and on Monday at the Forum, 
dependable entertainment value is what the affable singer offered them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been four years since his last solo tour, but in a pair of sets that 
added up to nearly three hours of sturdily constructed, energetically delivered 
pop tunes, Collins demonstrated that he's still a consummate crowd-pleaser. 
</P>
<P>
 On a stage resembling a kind of quaint urban wasteland -- complete with 
blazing trash can, changeable billboard and sparking elevated train -- Collins 
ambled about and led his four-piece band through all the hits and a good deal 
of new material. Though his muse has long been anchored in the mainstream, and 
predictable showmanship has superseded any spontaneity in the music, Collins' 
cheerful stage presence kept the show rolling forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer played a couple of songs on the piano, and sat down at an extra set 
of drums just in time to play the thundering, signature fill during "In the Air 
Tonight." He belted out heartfelt confessionals such as "Take a Look at Me Now" 
with straightforward intensity, but between songs he was like a cheeky 
music-hall comedian, winning the crowd over with slightly risque monologues. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' band was perfectly polished, entirely competent and almost completely 
without soul. The singer alone gave the music some heart. His voice is not 
commanding, but he pulled emotional nuances out of his tales of fractured 
romance and unrequited love, and added pep to the upbeat numbers in the second 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins is the pop star as Everyguy. His guileless approach to his craft, his 
willingness to poke fun at himself and his non-matinee idol looks combine to 
make him one of the more likable and less lordly of pop luminaries. His 
down-to-earth manner prevails when his material nears mawkishness, and even his 
clunky version of "You Can't Hurry Love" becomes easier to take when you see 
what a good time he has singing it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Collins plays Thursday at the Forum, 3900 W. Manchester Blvd., Inglewood, 8 
p.m. $30 . (310) 419-3100 . Also Friday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 
Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, 8 p.m. $26-$53.50. (714) 855-4515.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; KING SUNNY ADE MAINTAINS FRESH, FAMILIAR GROOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 King Sunny Ade can take credit not only for introducing a generation of 
Americans to the Nigerian-bred pop music known as juju , but also for stirring 
up U.S. interest in African popular music as a whole. In the early '80s, his 
multilayered percussion, embellished with steel and electric guitar and 
floating vocal harmonies, came together in a groove so seductive that even punk 
fans couldn't help but get up and move to its beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ade still has that groove, as his two-hour-plus show on Monday at the Coach 
House here proved. But while the style and instrumentation of his ensemble have 
stayed unchanged, his music has evolved with variations that have kept the 
familiar numbers fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ade's 16-piece backing ensemble kept the insistent, up-tempo drive going 
through the first three numbers, while Ade and the four-man vocal section 
circled the stage in a roughly choreographed dance. Then a cooler pace was 
established, one that eventually led into the familiar strains of "Ja Fun Mi." 
But unlike the original version, this one moved dreamily, with spontaneous 
vocal breaks popping up during the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it was back to more heated grooves speckled with unexpected vocal 
breaks and flashing patter from talking drums. Though one of the band's 
attractions is the salty twang derived from slightly off-key guitars, the 
ensemble work was executed with tight precision, as both vocal and instrumental 
sections stopped and started as one. 
</P>
<P>
 * King Sunny Ade plays Tuesday at House of Blues, 8430 Sunset Blvd., 9 p.m. 
$17.50. (213) 650-1451. BILL KOHLHAASE

MUSIC REVIEW; EROICA TRIO: COMPELLING PRESENCE AT FORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the '90s, man -- image is everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, image wasn't everything Monday night with the Eroica Trio, which 
nevertheless wasn't beyond making the most of appearances.Lots of sequins. Lots 
of skin. Well, it was a warm evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three young women who make up the Eroica Trio -- Erika Nickrenz, 
piano; Adela Pena, violin, and Sara Sant'Ambrogio, cello -- quickly forced one 
to forget about looks. In closing the seventh season of Chamber Music Under the 
Stars at John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, the Eroica turned out to be a highly 
accomplished, serious and compelling presence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beethoven's jolly Trio in B-flat, Opus 11, the trio revealed muscle and 
grace in equal parts, finely honed ensemble skills and individual playing of 
polished character. Interpretive niceties didn't fall by the wayside either, as 
when the group showed just how stodgy the finale's theme (by Joseph Weigl) is, 
and thereby pointed up just how inspired Beethoven's variations are. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelssohn's D-minor Trio, Opus 49, became an opportunity for virtuosic 
display, and though there was never a lack of emotional weight, swift tempos 
did the job. Unlike the Mendelssohn, however, the Brahms Hungarian Dance played 
in encore seemed merely display, with its too-fast tempos and showy shifts of 
gear impressively negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The fierce reading of Shostakovich's E-minor Trio, Opus 67, was prefaced by 
cellist Sant'Ambrogio's spoken interpretation of its meaning, which contained a 
few stretchers. The performance had it all though -- vigor, restraint, 
monumental effects, whispered nuances, sinister darkness and comedy. It 
revealed the work to be its usual unequivocally enigmatic self. TIMOTHY MANGAN

SCREENING ROOM: JOAN OF ARC STORY OPENS 'FRENCH FILMS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Cinematheque's formidable but richly rewarding "Cahiers du Cinema 
Selects Recent French Films" opens Friday at 7 p.m. at the Directors Guild with 
the first part of New Wave pioneer Jacques Rivette's utterly compelling, nearly 
six-hour "Jeanne La Pucelle," which combines a terse tone with a you-are-there 
immediacy in its telling of the life of Joan of Arc (Sandrine Bonnaire, 
implacably heroic), suggesting, with feminist implications, that Joan lost 
control of her destiny the moment her dream of getting her king crowned at 
Reims was fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Part 1 of "Jeanne La Pucelle" will be followed at 10:15 p.m with Philippe 
Garrel's "The Birth of Love," unavailable for review, which stars '60s icons 
Lou Castel and Jean-Pierre Leaud as men who've reached middle age but who are 
still growing up emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of Jacques Doillon's spare, rigorous and absorbing 95-minute "Le 
Jeune Werther" (screening Saturday at 4 p.m.) refers to Goethe's "The Sorrows 
of Young Werther," which its key figure, a Paris adolescent (Ismael 
Jole-Menebhi) reads, discovering a sense of recognition as he and his school 
friends try to make sense of the suicide of a brilliant, rebellious and 
secretive classmate. 
</P>
<P>
 We are able to feel fully the stinging impact of sudden, hard-to-fathom death 
upon a group of likable kids, none of whom is likely to have reached his or her 
16th birthday. Part 2 of "Jeanne la Pucelle" screens at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arnaud Desplechin's brisk, succinct 52-minute "The Life of the Dead," 
screening Saturday at 9:30 p.m., a large family converges on a country estate 
to await word about the fate of one its young men, Patrick, a 20-year-old 
athlete who has attempted suicide. Desplechin spends more time with Patrick's 
many cousins than with their parents, and, as his restless camera moves back 
and forth between informal gatherings, we are made painfully aware of how 
little these relatives know or genuinely care about him, with the exception of 
one young woman (Marianne Denicourt), who quietly struggles to come to terms 
with Patrick's almost certain death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed by Leos Carax's drenchingly romantic, dazzlingly 
elliptical 105-minute "Bad Blood," in which a young man's (Denis Lavant) grand 
passion for the beautiful lover (Juliette Binoche) of a veteran gangster 
(Michel Piccoli) matters far more than the gang's attempt to snatch an 
AIDS-like virus culture. This complex, boldly venturesome film announces the 
arrival of a major new filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Marker's 116-minute "The Last Bolshevik" (Sunday at 1 p.m.) is a 
flat-out great documentary by one of the masters of the form. Structured as if 
it were a series of letters to a friend, "The Last Bolshevik" surveys the 
tumultuous events of 20th-Century Russia through the life of a neglected but 
major director, Alexander Medvedkin, who conveniently was born in 1900 and 
lived long enough to experience the beginning of perestroika , dying in 1984.  
</P>
<P>
 Medvedkin, whose fate is described by a friend as "the tragedy of a pure 
communist in a world of would-be communits," was an inspired avant-garde 
satirist whose films, notably "Happiness" and "New Moscow," were so innovative 
and critical that they were inevitably banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally tantalizing as clips from those two films are clips from a series of 
films -- also banned -- he made on his '30s film-studio train coach, 
documenting life all over the Soviet Union, allowing workers to speak frankly 
about conditions under the collectivist system.  
</P>
<P>
 At 165 minutes, Herve Le Roux's "The Great Happiness" (Sunday at 3:15 p.m.) 
actually requires a greater commitment than "Jeanne La Pucelle." Its jaunty 
take on the lives of some Parisian film and theater students, who spend most of 
their time hanging out, becomes wearying after the first hour.  
</P>
<P>
 It will be followed at 6:30 by Claude Chabrol's 116-minute documentary "The 
Eye of Vichy," which offers an over-long, repetitive but fascinating view of 
Occupied France via newsreels and other propaganda footage. The films will be 
introduced by a Cahiers editor, Thierry Jousse.

TV RATINGS; CBS BEACHES SOME OF THE LAUGHS AT ABC AND NBC

<P>
 The five top-rated shows on TV last week were ABC and NBC sitcoms, but CBS won 
the week overall, thanks in part to a couple of summer dramas set on the 
beaches of Waikiki and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's "Grace Under Fire," the first-year series starring Brett Butler as a 
divorced mother of three, was the No. 1 show, according to the figures released 
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.It was seen in about 14.1 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' highest-rated program was the Sunday movie, "Jane's House," which ranked 
seventhamong the week's 97 prime-time network programs. But the best news for 
the network was on Thursday, where the premieres of "One West Waikiki" and 
"Hotel Malibu" gave CBS its best rating for a Thursday in summer since Aug. 13, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramas didn't beat NBC's "Seinfeld," "Frasier" and "Dateline NBC," but 
they ran a strong second. "One West Waikiki," with Cheryl Ladd, ranked 14th 
overall, while "Hotel Malibu," with Joanna Cassidy, was 21st. Southland Ratings

 SAYING NO: Learning about the perils of drugs and the power of a wicked fast 
pitch are very different lessons. . . . But retired major-league baseball 
players hope to combine anti-drug messages with baseball pointers when they 
visit Simi Valley's Boys & Girls Club under the Baseballers Against Drugs 
program. Officials hope big-name athletes will impress young minds. "I don't 
think the President of the United States could have the same effect on these 
kids," said Councilman Bill Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE TAKE: Tennis-playing twins Bob and Mike Bryan of Camarillo have 
competed together for years, becoming one of the best doubles teams in the U.S. 
Tennis Assn.'s juniors program (C8). . . . Now the 16-year-olds, seeded third 
and fourth in the USTA's 16-and-under championships, may face each other across 
the net. . . . If their practices at Cabrillo Racquet Club in Somis are any 
indication, such a game could be fierce. "We've had some matches at the club 
where I've wanted to call out the National Guard," said their father -- and 
coach -- Wayne Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
 MOVIE TIME: Fillmore officials are warning looky-loos to stay out of the 
landmark Towne Theater, which has been red-tagged since sustaining heavy damage 
in the Jan. 17 quake. . . . Trespassers took two vintage posters from the walls 
of the movie house, but for reasons unknown left them leaning against the 
chain-link fence that protects the property, Fire Chief Pat Askren said. 
Authorities have removed other items of value from the structure. Tonight, 
residents will discuss using a $475,000 state grant to restore the building 
(B1). 
</P>
<P>
 TALKING NAFTA: It's off to the border for Ventura County Supervisor John K. 
Flynn -- the Nevada border, that is. . . . Flynn's in Lake Tahoe to talk about 
the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement at a meeting of the 
Western Council of Governments. Flynn has locked horns with NAFTA opponents 
since debate over the accord was at its height.

ANGELS THINK OF BETTER DAYS; BASEBALL: LEAVING IS ON THEIR MINDS AFTER FALLING 
TO ROYALS, 5-3, IN 11 INNINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Angel outfielder Bo Jackson has purchased his plane tickets, and the itinerary 
is planned. He's scheduled to depart at 8:30 a.m. Friday for Atlanta, drive to 
Bessemer, Ala., and by nightfall, he'll be sitting at his favorite fishing 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "They better hope the strike lasts at least a week," Jackson laughed, "because 
it will take that long for them to find me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have myself a good ol' time, and who knows, maybe I won't be 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who loves nothing more than tormenting his former teammates, proved 
once again Tuesday to be a pain for the Kansas City Royals, but once again, it 
made little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals shook off Jackson's dramatic 450-foot home run in the eighth 
inning, and simply waited until they got deep into the Angels' relief corps, 
winning 5-3 in 11 innings in front of 17,876 fans at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (44-68) were left with their 14th loss in the last 18 games, and 
their third extra-inning loss in the last four games. Considering the way this 
season has gone, who can blame the Angels for not being sentimental tonight 
when they say what could be their final goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a last-minute agreement that averts a strike, starter Brian Anderson 
and outfielder Jim Edmonds will head to Parker, Ariz., for a weekend of 
jet-skiing. Reliever Joe Grahe will be fishing in Florida. Reliever Russ 
Springer will go hunting in Louisiana. Everyone, it seems, will be going their 
separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone wants our season to end," Edmonds said, "but the way our 
season has been going, it's going to be nice to get out of here and forget all 
of this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds became the latest player to bear the brunt of Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann's wrath when he was yanked out of the game in the seventh inning. 
Edmonds made a two-base error when he dropped Bob Hamelin's fly ball near the 
left-field line, and Lachemann pulled him in place of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're looking for time off," Lachemann said, "then they're liable to get 
a hell of a lot more than just a break. I will not put up with anything less 
than maximum effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play the game hard, and you play the game right. It's got absolutely 
nothing to do with talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edmonds: "It was my fault. I missed the ball. We're not winning, and I'm 
not playing well. He's got to do something to try to shake up the club." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who certainly can't remember the last time he entered the game as a 
defensive replacement, came up in the eighth inning with the Angels trailing, 
3-1, and hit Kevin Appier's pitch off the concrete center-field wall beyond the 
fence for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble was that it merely tied the game, and the Angels still had to use 
their relievers, who failed again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter (4-7) was greeted in the 11th by Royal catcher Mike Macfarlane's 
leadoff homer. Felix Jose followed with a double, and scored one out later on a 
double by Gary Gaetti, whom the Angels still are paying $2.9 million. 
Incredibly, of the 12 hits produced by the Royals, 10 were for extra bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, no extra-base hit was more spectacular than the one hit by Jackson, who 
fully realized that if the season never resumes after Friday, it could be the 
last time baseball ever sees him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels privately have decided that they won't bring him back next season, 
and if the truth be known, Jackson doesn't even know if he wants to be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think about that a lot," Jackson said. "My life doesn't depend on whether I 
play baseball or not. Baseball is just a means of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I can't wait until that day comes. That will mean I get to spend a 
whole lot more time with my family. I'm looking forward to watching my kids 
grow up, and teaching them everything I wasn't able to do when I was a kid 
because of finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I'm not going to miss this game one bit."

CANDIOTTI SPINS INTO LOSS, LEAVES WITH AILING BACK; BASEBALL: PITCHER SENT HOME 
FOR TREATMENT AFTER PAINFUL OUTING IN DODGERS' 5-3 LOSS TO REDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Candiotti said he wasn't tired, that the rigorous stretch he pitched in 
recently hadn't affected him. Instead, he pointed to one knuckleball, the one 
that spinned instead of fluttered to Reggie Sanders in the fourth inning -- one 
that Sanders promptly hit over the left-center field wall at Riverfront Stadium 
in the Dodgers' 5-3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the game, just minutes after reporters left Candiotti in the Dodger 
clubhouse, it was announced that his back had stiffened on the mound. He is 
scheduled to fly back to Los Angeles today to have the left side of his upper 
back looked at, a move that denotes concern, since the Dodgers were returning 
home anyway on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti faltered for his second consecutive start, this time giving up five 
runs in the fourth inning, the only inning in which the Reds scored. Sanders' 
two-run homer -- his 17th -- put the Reds ahead, 5-1, and the final insult came 
when rookie pitcher Kevin Jarvis (1-1) knocked in the Reds' fifth run with his 
first major league hit, a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have good stuff," Candiotti (7-7) said. "I felt in the groove 
early, but if I can get one ball back it would be the one Reggie hit out. When 
it came out of my hand I felt it spinning a lot. . . . When the ball spins, 
that's about as bad as you can throw the knuckleball." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, who was two for four in the game with two stolen bases, scored 
in the first inning after he singled, stole second and was brought home on a 
single to center by Henry Rodriguez. Butler scored again in the Dodgers' 
two-run sixth inning on a single, a stolen base, an error and a wild pitch. 
Delino DeShields, who had walked, scored on a double by Tim Wallach, his 77th 
run batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers managed only five hits in the game, all against Jarvis and none 
against the Reds' bullpen, who were sent in during the sixth inning and retired 
the final 10 Dodgers. The Dodger bullpen wasn't as perfect, but almost. Having 
bailed out Candiotti in the fourth inning, Omar Daal, Roger McDowell and Rudy 
Seanez combined to hold the Reds to one hit the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the opportunity arises I have to take it and hope, like tonight, that I 
can keep us in the game," said McDowell, who has given up one hit and no runs 
in his last two outings, a total of 4 2/3 innings.  
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how well the bullpen does, though, McDowell knows the perception 
will be difficult to change. Relievers have blown 21 of 40 save opportunities 
this season, converting just 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The perception) won't change this year, no matter what happens," McDowell 
said. "Our percentage is not good and saves are what matter. We will still be 
the bad bullpen. We can go the next 100 innings and not give up a run and save 
20 games and still it won't change anything this year. People will still say, 
what happened the first five months? That's what we have to go out there and 
pitch with." 
</P>
<P>
 That perception was reality on Monday, when the Dodgers came back against the 
Colorado Rockies in the eighth inning and then lost after Todd Worrell blew a 
three-run lead in the ninth. A tough loss, yes, but Wallach said the team 
didn't carry it into Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we would have gone out and made mistakes and this and that, but we got 
beat tonight with another guy (Jarvis) we haven't seen before," said Wallach, 
who is batting .421 with eight RBI in his last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gave the Reds a 1 1/2-game lead over Houston in the NL Central 
division with two games to play before Friday, the day players are expected to 
strike. What that means, Johnson said, nobody knows for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, though, clinched the top spot Sunday in the NL West going into 
Friday, and Wallach said he does know what that means to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of that, it's important to win, " Wallach said, when asked if the 
Dodgers are letting down. "I don't care about Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Candiotti slumped for a couple games in late May, but turned things around on 
June 12, when he pitched a much-needed complete-game victory at Chicago. In his 
next eight appearances, which included seven innings of relief, Candiotti 
allowed only three earned runs or less and averaged seven innings each outing, 
an earned-run average of 2.10. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his last two starts, Candiotti hasn't had it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes his knuckleball goes in circles," said Carlos Hernandez, who 
started while Mike Piazza was rested. "But this time it didn't."

A GIANT RALLY IN THE 9TH; BASEBALL: DARREN LEWIS GETS TWO-OUT, TWO-RUN SINGLE 
OFF MYERS TO BEAT CUBS, 3-2. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Lewis made sure he savored his game-winning hit Tuesday. It might have 
been his final one of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "After tomorrow we don't know what will happen. We could be out until next 
spring training. That's the worst case," said Lewis, whose two-out, two-run, 
bases-loaded single in the ninth off Randy Myers lifted the San Francisco 
Giants to a 3-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants and the Cubs meet again Wednesday but are off Thursday, the day 
before the players association's strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little strange. As a player you set goals for what you want to do. 
There might be nothing to reach for if it's over tomorrow. It's strange in that 
sense," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants entered the day four games behind the Dodgers in the NL West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying not to think about it. I'm just glad we pulled this one out," 
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a strike we could possibly go to 1 1/2. That's not that much room 
to make up if we do go out." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers relieved in the ninth after starter Steve Trachsel allowed only five 
hits and one run over eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Benzinger singled with one out for his third hit. After John Patterson 
flied to right, Myers (1-5) walked pinch-hitters Darryl Strawberry and Steve 
Scarsone to load the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who had struck out looking with the bases loaded in the seventh, 
singled to center, scoring pinch-runners Mike Benjamin and Bill Swift. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking about anything that's going on, I'm thinking about what is 
happening in the game," said Myers, the Cubs' union representative. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't walk two people and give up two hits with a one-run lead in 
the ninth," Cubs manager Tom Trebelhorn said. "He just didn't pitch well." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis felt he'd been called out on a wide pitch in the seventh, so he welcomed 
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really mad because I felt I wasn't given a chance. I just tried to stay 
calm and not get caught up in the situation. The next situation I knew I had to 
be aggressive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Burba (3-6) pitched two innings of hitless relief for the victory. The 
Cubs loaded the bases in the ninth off Rod Beck, but he retired Steve Buechele 
on a fielder's choice for his 27th save. 
</P>
<P>
 The big play came when Barry Bonds was able to cut off Glenallen Hill's double 
to left and keep Sammy Sosa at third. Baker then decided to intentionally walk 
pinch-hitter Rick Wilkins before Buechele rolled out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs, who had only five hits, scored in the first on Mark Grace's two-out 
double and Sosa's triple. 
</P>
<P>
 They made it 2-0 in the fourth off Bud Black when Grace and Sosa singled, with 
Grace reaching third on a fly ball. Sosa broke for second and was caught in a 
rundown, but was able to stay away from a tag long enough for Grace to score 
from third. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco threatened in the seventh after loading the bases on one-out 
singles by Benzinger and Patterson, and a two-out walk to pinch-hitter Mark 
Leonard. But Trachsel struck out Lewis on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams, who leads the majors with 42 homers, flied out three times and 
grounded to second.

U.S. IS TALKING, WINNING; BASKETBALL: AUSTRALIA GETS AN EARFUL OF THE NBA GAME 
IN 130-74 ROUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Nelson said he wanted to show the world the way Americans play basketball, 
and Tuesday night they treated Australia to the complete experience: 
</P>
<P>
 The running, the jumping, the shooting, the dunking. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The trash-talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rediscovering their game and, unfortunately, their high spirits, the Americans 
put Australia to the torch, 130-74, but if their game was impressive, it 
couldn't begin to compete with their playground macho. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Johnson barked an unprintable insult at Australia's Andrew Vlahov that 
turned ears up and down the baseline red. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning took a bump in the back from Aussie center Mark Bradtke, 
wheeled around, put a finger in his face and said: "Let me tell you something. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Derrick Coleman was so amused by a Dan Majerle bomb, he fell down on his back 
and wriggled on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they certainly did have a lot to say," said Australia's Andrew Gaze, 
grinning. "I guess it's an aspect of the NBA game which they carry with them. I 
suppose it's part and parcel of their game. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us out there, we're just trying to share the experience with them, and 
perhaps we were taken a little bit off guard by the way they were perhaps 
treating us. But I don't think they were making an exception for us. I just 
think that's part and parcel of their normal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, I'll leave that to your judgment, 
but you know, some of it's quite humorous. Some of it, you wouldn't want to 
repeat. But more or less, pretty much everyone had something to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Trash-talking is, indeed, part and parcel of the NBA game, although it is in 
danger of legislative sanction. For Nelson, who wants the world to admire the 
U.S. game, it was nothing but an embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson first claimed ignorance -- "You have better ears than I do," he said -- 
but upon reflection said he wouldn't stand for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would prefer not to have my team trash talk and do the antics, the 
baiting," Nelson said. "We talked about that before. If that's true, then we'll 
address that issue in a meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aussies, a never-say-die bunch of weightlifters, approached this game with 
their usual go-for-it fervor and, surprise, were rewarded for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Shane Neal hit a couple of three-pointers, and they jumped into a 
6-2 lead. The United States caught up. The Aussies spurted again, going ahead, 
17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took 'em a little off guard, I think it was," said Gaze, who played one 
season at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we got some photos of the score when it was 17-10." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson had started another of his keep-them-happy lineups: Coleman, Johnson 
and, as usual, three guards, including Steve Smith, who started the tournament 
at the end of the bench. However, when Shaquille O'Neal replaced Coleman at 
center, the Aussies discovered they weren't as keen on going down the lane. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, the Americans were up, 62-48, and just warming up. They won the 
second half, 68-26. 
</P>
<P>
 The American players, criticized for their inability to run up scores the way 
the Dream Team did, whooped it up on the bench as the lead climbed into the 50s 
toward the final 56-point margin. In the closing seconds, three of them yelled 
at an awkward center named Paul Rees who was taking an open 10-footer. Rees 
clanked the shot off the front rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not here to trash talk," Reggie Miller said later. "We know we're the 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was one of the Americans yelling at Rees. When you've been in the NBA 
long enough, you don't even realize you're doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 World Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday night's other quarterfinal game, Russia beat Puerto Rico, 101-85, 
as Sergei Bazarevich scored 27 points. Russia broke the game open late with a 
15-4 run keyed by strong offensive rebounding. . . . The other quarterfinal 
pool resumes play tonight with Croatia playing Canada and Greece facing China.

MORNING BRIEFING: '81, '94 YANKEES BOTH WINNERS BUT WORLDS APART IN PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Those who followed the 1981 New York Yankees, the last Yankee World Series 
team (they lost to the Dodgers), can't help but notice potential similarities 
with this year's first-place Yankee club. 
</P>
<P>
 First, writes the New York Times' Jack Curry, Gene Michael was the manager at 
the beginning of the 1981 season, and he is the general manager now. And 
second, the 1981 Yankees won the pennant in a season shortened by a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 But current Minnesota Twin and famous ex-Yankee Dave Winfield, pointing to the 
huge characters of the old squad -- Reggie Jackson, Lou Piniella, Rich Gossage 
and plenty of others -- sees little comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personality-wise, it's not even close," Winfield told Curry. "You shouldn't 
even try to draw a comparison to what there was in '81 and now. But if you're 
talking about winning, there it is. Other than that, you can't compare things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bullpen? Forget about it. Media attraction as a team? No comparison." 
</P>

 Trivia time: Former Dallas Cowboy running back Tony Dorsett gained 12,739 
yards in his 12-year career and was recently inducted into the Pro Football 
Hall of Fame. How many times did Dorsett win the league rushing title? 
</P>

 Bobbing for answers: Since ESPN began featuring bobbing-head dolls in 
commercials for baseball telecasts this year, sales of the nine-inch statues 
have risen dramatically, according to a report in USA Today Baseball Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercials definitely had an impact on demand and we haven't been able 
to meet it," said Eddie Miller, vice president of Twins Enterprise Inc., 
manufacturer of the dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Widen & Kennedy, the agency that filmed the commercials, said the smiling 
dolls wearing team uniforms are perfect selling points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobbing-head dolls represent an instant symbol that baseball fans can 
identify with," said Larry Frye, a creative director at Widen & Kennedy. 
"Besides, we were looking for actors who wouldn't talk back." 
</P>

<P>
 Running with the Pack: Steve McMichael, longtime star defensive tackle with 
the hated Chicago Bears, has had little trouble adjusting to life with the 
Green Bay Packers in his first training camp there. 
</P>
<P>
 McMichael checked out the Packer Hall of Fame when he got to Green Bay and 
bought a special piece of Packer gear, which he is saving to wear for the 
Packers' Oct. 31 game at Soldier Field against the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got my Packer-style foam cheesehead in the truck," McMichael said. "And 
if the defense is introduced Halloween night, I might wear it out." 
</P>

 Strike update: This home run-record note from Boston Globe columnist Peter 
Gammons: "If the strike lasts until Aug. 26, Matt Williams will still be ahead 
of Babe Ruth's 1927 pace (when he hit 60 home runs in 154 games)."

 Quotebook: Chicago White Sox shortstop Ozzie Guillen on what he plans to do 
during the strike: "If I go home to Venezuela, I'll be on my boat. I'll 
probably read the papers one day and see the strike is over and the Sox have 
been playing for three days." TIM KAWAKAMI

ROYALS HAVE ANGELS FOLDING TENTS IN 11TH, 5-3; BASEBALL: YET ANOTHER 
EXTRA-INNING LOSS HAS PLAYERS LOOKING AHEAD TO THEIR STRIKE PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Angel outfielder Bo Jackson already has bought his plane tickets, and planned 
his itinerary. He is scheduled to depart at 8:30 Friday morning for Atlanta, 
then drive to Bessemer, Ala., and by nightfall, will be sitting at his favorite 
fishing hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "They better hope the strike lasts at least a week," Jackson laughed, "because 
it will take that long for them to find me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have myself a good ol' time, and who knows, maybe I won't be 
coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who loves nothing more than tormenting his former teammates, proved 
once again Tuesday to be a pain for the Kansas City Royals, but once again, it 
made little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals shook off Jackson's 450-foot home run in the eighth inning and 
simply waited until they got deep into the Angels' bullpen, winning 5-3 in 11 
innings before 17,876 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It left the Angels (44-68) with their 14th defeat in 18 games, and their third 
extra-inning defeat in the last four games. Considering the way this season has 
gone, who can blame the Angels for not being sentimental tonight when they say 
what could be their final goodbys of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a last-minute settlement that averts a Friday strike, starter Brian 
Anderson and outfielder Jim Edmonds are heading out to Parker, Ariz., for a 
weekend of jet-skiing. Reliever Joe Grahe is going fishing in Florida. Reliever 
Russ Springer is going hunting in Louisiana. Everyone, it seems, will be going 
their separate ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone wants our season to end," Edmonds said, "but the way our 
season has been going, it's going to be nice to get out of here and forget all 
of this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds became the latest player to bear the brunt of Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann's wrath when he was yanked out of the game in the seventh inning. 
Edmonds made a two-base error when he dropped Bob Hamelin's fly ball near the 
left field line, and Lachemann pulled him in place of Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who certainly can't remember the last time he entered the game as a 
defensive replacement, stepped to the plate in the eighth inning with the 
Angels trailing, 3-1. Five pitches later, he hit Kevin Appier's pitch off the 
concrete center field wall beyond the fence for a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble, of course, was that it merely tied the score, and the Angels 
still had to use their bullpen, which failed once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter (4-7) was greeted in the 11th by catcher Mike Macfarlane's leadoff 
homer. Felix Jose followed with a double, and scored one out later on a double 
by Gary Gaetti, who still is being paid $2.9 million by the Angels. Of the 12 
hits produced by the Royals, 10 were for extra bases.

TENNIS / WOMEN AT MANHATTAN BEACH; MARTINEZ SHUTS THE DOOR ON UPSTART RAYMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The word on the hard court a year ago was good if you were Lisa Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of young up-and-comers, Raymond was at the top of the list. She was 
the two-time defending NCAA singles champion at Florida before turning 
professional last year. She had a serve over 95 m.p.h., could send you deep, 
then rush the net to finish you. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 21 and you didn't want to be in her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the words aren't quite so kind. 
</P>
<P>
 If you had not heard of Lisa Raymond, well that's not too surprising -- she's 
ranked 53rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in that first year, Raymond was re-defined as the resident 
tournament sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 She went to the fourth round of Wimbledon, and routinely takes the top players 
on the tour to three sets. 
</P>
<P>
 She just hasn't finished them. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened Tuesday in a second-round Virginia Slims of Los Angeles 
match against top-seeded and third-ranked Conchita Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was perfect in the first set, dropped the second and then won the 
third easily for a 6-0, 3-6, 6-1 victory over Raymond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I have one foot in the door and I know I can do it, it's just the 
mental part," Raymond said of both her day and her still young professional 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 That would explain those unsightly losses to players she should beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, you could play at only 70%," Raymond said. "Here, you have to be 
100% every time -- you really can't even compare the two, it's so different." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's defeat couldn't be called unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez just won Wimbledon a few weeks ago, and her confidence has soared 
with her game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you win a Grand Slam (event), it's natural that it gives you 
confidence," Martinez said. "But I've gained confidence because I know that I 
can play on grass and hard surfaces." 
</P>
<P>
 And oh, did she play hard ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 6-0 (in the first set) surprised me," Martinez said. "I knew it was going 
to be tough because I know she is a good player, but I think that first set was 
just about perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez admitted that she knew it couldn't last, and when she lost the first 
game of the second set, that opened up the door for Raymond's foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to be more aggressive," Raymond said. "But I wasn't confident in 
my serve and because she was passing real well, and I got gun-shy in the 
third." 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly the same Raymond who came out of college and teamed with Lindsay 
Davenport to reach the doubles final of the 1994 French Open. Davenport and 
Raymond looked to be the ones to replace Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Davenport had risen to No. 7 before this tournament at the Manhattan 
Country Club in Manhattan Beach, Raymond struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's had a few more difficulties adjusting to the tour than me," Davenport 
said. "We're best friends on the tour. My problems might have been a little 
different because I didn't go to college. We've disagreed about how much 
college helps before, but maybe that was just because I didn't want to play in 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond said it was simple: She'd read too many stories about how good she was 
and she started to believe them. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport announced that she has withdrawn from the tournament because 
of a pulled calf muscle in her left leg sustained last week. Davenport was 
seeded third. . . . In other matches, sixth-seeded Anke Huber defeated 
Stephanie Rottier, 6-2, 6-1, and seventh-seeded Julie Halard beat Anne Mall, 
6-4, 7-5. . . . Fifth-seeded Zina Garrison-Jackson avoided an upset by unseeded 
Debbie Graham of Fountain Valley. Garrison-Jackson won, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. Graham, 
who attended Stanford, slipped to No. 121 in the WTA rankings after breaking 
her foot last April. . . . Fourth-seeded Jana Novotna defeated unseeded Karin 
Kschwendt, 6-3, 6-2.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The blame should be spread around for the bullpen woes that have plagued the 
Dodgers much of the season and kept their most exciting team in years down at 
about the .500 level. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire hasn't put together a formidable relief staff. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda hasn't handled the personnel well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Todd Worrell hasn't handled adversity well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Claire hadn't made a couple of trades, he could have one of the best 
bullpens in the National League, featuring setup man Pedro Martinez and closer 
John Wetteland. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Delino DeShields' disappointing year has made the Martinez deal 
with Montreal appear worse than it actually was or will turn out to be. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 However, Claire's biggest mistake was including Wetteland in the trade that 
sent Tim Belcher to Cincinnati for Eric Davis and Kip Gross on Nov. 27, 1991. 
Wetteland had not allowed an earned run in nine innings of relief at the end of 
the previous season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Reds repeated the Dodgers' mistake two weeks later, sending Wetteland to 
the Expos for Dave Martinez, Willie Greene and Scott Ruskin on Dec. 11, 1991. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda often has either overworked or underworked the talent available in his 
bullpen. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Calling upon Worrell to try to protect a 6-3 lead over Colorado in the ninth 
inning on Monday after he had appeared in the two previous games was debatable, 
but leaving him in after he had served up beach balls to the first three 
batters wasn't. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Worrell complained earlier about the uncertainty of his role, decided not to 
talk to sportswriters anymore, and then lashed out at them after Monday's 
debacle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The way he has performed this year and for the amount of money he is making, 
he ought to be big enough to take his share of the blame. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Re-signing Orel Hershiser would be a luxury, but re-signing Brett Butler is a 
necessity for the Dodgers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Expos, who have also used Manager Felipe Alou's nephew, Mel Rojas, as a 
closer, might be willing to trade Wetteland.If I'm Claire, I'm more interested 
in Wetteland, 28, than Randy Myers, 31, or John Franco, 33. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 At last glance, the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the Class A California League 
were averaging 5,763 fans per home game and outdrawing 18 of the 28 Class AAA 
teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Tigers have the highest average attendance on the road in the 
American League, but the lowest at home. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 San Diego Padre first baseman Eddie Williams attended San Diego Hoover High, 
the alma mater of Ted Williams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-a-likes: Rodney Peete and Denzel Washington. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova's last appearance in a Southern California tennis 
tournament makes the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles something special. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It came as no surprise that Oregon football Coach Rich Brooks stepped down as 
athletic director. It's impossible for the same person to do justice to both 
jobs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the top 10 finishers in the Buick Open were from UCLA. Corey Pavin 
was second, Steve Pate tied for third, and Duffy Waldorf tied for eighth. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Former Bruins Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes have won 50 of their last 61 
tournaments on the Miller Lite Pro Beach Volleyball Tour, but will be trying 
for their first Seal Beach victory this weekend. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the world's best female billiards players, among them Ewa Mataya and 
Vivian Villareal, will compete in the Gordon's 9-Ball Championship Friday and 
Saturday at the Gotham Hall Billiards Club on the Third Street Promenade in 
Santa Monica. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: Michael Jordan wears No. 45 for the Birmingham Barons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Playing spots are still open for the third annual Bobby Hatfield celebrity 
golf tournament, a benefit for the Lupus Foundation, Aug. 22 at Los Coyotes 
Country Club. . . .

 Trainer Angel Cordero told Andy Beyer of the Washington Post: "The preparation 
for getting a horse to one race is like preparing for a wedding. You can go two 
months of training getting a horse ready for a race that lasts a minute and 
nine seconds." . . .

 Meldrick Taylor has gone back to the Riviera Hotel in Palm Springs, where he 
trained for his first bout against Julio Cesar Chavez four years ago, to 
prepare for the rematch Sept. 17 in Las Vegas. . . .

 A Lennox Lewis-Riddick Bowe heavyweight title bout has been proposed for 
December or March. . . .

HOLMES WINS, MAY FIGHT ONCE MORE -- POSSIBLY AGAINST FOREMAN

<P>
 Former world heavyweight champion Larry Holmes says he might have one more 
fight in him, possibly against George Foreman, and then he plans to hang up his 
gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have too much in this game left -- I realize that," Holmes said 
Tuesday night after winning a unanimous 10-round decision over Jesse 
Ferguson."If I fight again, great. If I don't, so be it. I don't need boxing. 
I've already made my place in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes, 44, who held the title in 1978-85, improved to 61-4, and is 13-1 in 
the second comeback he began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, 37, best known for beating Ray Mercer in 1993 after Mercer 
supposedly asked him to take a dive, is 20-13. Many in the crowd of 2,574 booed 
when it was announced that all three judges favored Holmes, 97-94, 96-94, 
99-92.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox continues to praise wide receiver Flipper Anderson, who had a 
disappointing 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes more outstanding catches every day," Knox said. "He's going down and 
digging balls out of the ground and going up and making great catches." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson caught only one touchdown pass in the final 10 games last season as 
quarterback Jim Everett struggled. But Anderson has shown promise as a deep 
threat again with the acquisition of free-agent quarterback Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Miller has more of a feel for the deep ball," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and tailback Jerome Bettis, who sat out last Saturday's exhibition 
opener, will start Saturday night's game against the New England Patriots at 
Anaheim Stadium, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller sat out the 14-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers because of sore stomach 
muscles but returned to practice Monday. Knox simply held Bettis out of the 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't decided how much work they will get," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Vitt, who coaches the safeties, said he is pleased with the progress of 
rookie Toby Wright. Wright had been projected as a starter but is playing 
behind second-year Deral Boykin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a rap on Toby coming out of (Nebraska) that maybe he wasn't a quick 
learner and couldn't learn the defense," Vitt said. "Toby has made no mental 
errors in the game and he makes very few errors in practice. He's an aware, 
intelligent player, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a top run stopper at Nebraska, was a second-round draft pick in April. 
Michael Stewart, last year's starter at strong safety, signed with Miami as a 
free agent in the off-season and backup Pat Terrell signed with the Jets.

 The Rams waived defensive tackle Jeff Esters, a second-year player from 
Pittsburgh. . . . Defensive end Robert Young, who sat out last week's game 
because of a groin injury, returned to practice Monday and is scheduled to 
start on Saturday. . . . Tailback David Lang is expected to play Saturday after 
sitting out the opener because of a knee problem. . . . Reports from San 
Francisco said the 49ers are expected to invite former Ram tailback Russell 
White to a tryout next week. White, a third-round pick by the Rams last season, 
was cut at the start of training camp. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL SEES GREAT POTENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one will ever confuse Art Shell with the NFL's headline-grabbing, 
chest-thumping coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell doesn't make bold predictions or performance guarantees. The Raider 
coach prefers to keep a low profile, or at least as low a profile as a coach in 
Los Angeles can maintain, and let his team do its talking on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Shell has finally acknowledged, grudgingly, that this Raider team has 
the potential to be great. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't go as far as those who are projecting a Super Bowl berth, but 
asked if this might be the best of the six Raider teams he has coached, Shell 
said, "It has a chance. At the end of the year, we'll sit down and talk about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell's best were the 1990 team, which got as far as the AFC championship game 
in Buffalo before being eliminated, and last year's, which also made it to 
Buffalo and the second round of the playoffs before losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're better," Shell said of this year's squad compared to last year's at 
this stage. "More seasoned. We have new people who have raised the level. 
There's no doubt we're a better team than we were last year at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a big concession for the conservative Shell, but he is hardly ordering 
Super Bowl rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be done on the football field, not by reading it in the 
newspapers," he said. "We all have to beat Buffalo. I don't care what anybody 
says, they are the defending AFC champions. And first and foremost, we have to 
win in this division." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Warren Powers, who suffered a finger injury at the start of 
training camp, has retired. . . . The Raiders have re-signed linebacker Keith 
Franklin, cut earlier. . . . Defensive lineman Chester McGlockton sat out 
practice because of the bruised leg he suffered Sunday night against the Dallas 
Cowboys, but Shell expects McGlockton to be practicing again before the end of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Alexander Wright, who has sat out two games because of a pulled 
calf muscle, probably won't play Saturday against the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
according to Shell. . . . Offensive tackle Greg Skrepenak was excused from 
practice for personal reasons but will be back today. STEVE SPRINGER

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; AZINGER, PALMER HEIGHTEN INTRIGUE AT THE 76TH PGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 76th PGA Championship will begin Thursday in the summer heat at Southern 
Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla., complete with better-than-usual plot lines. 
</P>
<P>
 They center on, in no particular order, how will Paul Azinger play in his 
return, how will Arnold Palmer say farewell and how long will it take for the 
Oklahoma sun to melt a seven-iron? 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, the defending champion, will be playing in his second tournament 
since being treated for the cancer in his shoulder diagnosed more than eight 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger made his comeback last week in the Buick Open, a strategy that let him 
get in some golf before defending his title and also remove some of the media 
attention from him this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Buick Open, Azinger saved energy by limiting his practice. He hit 
enough balls to warm up and then iced his shoulder afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer is playing in his last PGA. Although it may not be as fond a goodby as 
his experience at the Open, Palmer lists the PGA as one of his favorite events, 
even though he has never won it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 36 years, Palmer's best results in the PGA have been ties for second in 
1964, '68 and '70. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 76th PGA Championship hasn't begun, preparations for the 77th are 
well under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's tournament will be held Aug. 10-13 at Riviera, which last staged 
the event in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 To get ready, Riviera has spent more than $1.2 million on rebuilding the 
greens, planting new bent grass, recontouring the greenside bunkers and 
rebuilding tees. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Crenshaw supervised the major greens work that not only included the new 
grass, but basically returned the greens to their original size of 1926, when 
architect George C. Thomas' work was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's back: At a news conference Tuesday at Southern Hills, Azinger admitted he 
wasn't being totally honest about something he said when things weren't going 
so well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was diagnosed and after a few treatments, you know, I talked about not 
really caring too much about the game of golf, but deep down inside, my goal 
was to be healthy enough to be able to come back and play in this tournament," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deadline U.S.A.: A Spaniard won the Masters, South Africans won the U.S. Open 
and the British Open . . . notice a trend here? 
</P>
<P>
 American golfers are down to their last shot at the PGA -- win it or get shut 
out of this year's major titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the advent of the Masters in 1934, there never has been a year in which 
an American golfer has failed to win at least one major. 
</P>
<P>
 Said U.S. Open champion Ernie Els: "It will be quite a deal for you if an 
American doesn't win a major this year." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New old friend: Nick Faldo will take a new putter to the PGA Championship. 
Better make that a new, old putter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Buick Open, he re-debuted a putter he last used in 1990. It sounds like 
a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo has two top-10 finishes in eight PGA Tour events this year, and his 
record in the majors is sort of minor -- he finished 32nd at the Masters, 
missed the cut at the U.S. Open, tied for eighth at the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pick 'em: For what it's worth, Golf Digest has established Nick Price as the 
favorite to win the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What do Palmer, Bob Hope and Gerald Ford have in common? They are all winners 
of the PGA Distinguished Service Award, which Palmer officially will receive 
today at Southern Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also Arnold Palmer Day today in Oklahoma, according to a proclamation 
issued by Gov. David Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good team, man: Greg Norman and Price will play as a team in the sixth 
Franklin Funds Shark Shootout Nov. 15-20 at Sherwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.1-million event also includes Curtis Strange in a field of 20. It 
benefits children's charities, including the National Childhood Cancer 
Foundation and Casa Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Details: (805) 379-2664. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling Senior: Lee Trevino has won nearly $1.1 million in seven months on the 
Senior PGA Tour. In more than 26 years on the regular PGA Tour, Trevino has won 
$3.47 million. Obviously, it pays to get old in golf.  
</P>

LOS ALAMITOS; REFRIGERATOR IS READY TO RUN IN THE GO MAN GO HANDICAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Refrigerator is on the grounds," went the refrain when the bay gelding 
returned to the Los Alamitos barn area a month ago. Now he is ready to run and 
will start in Friday's Go Man Go Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly $2 million in earnings, he will make only his second start of the 
year. His first, in the Remington Park Championship at Oklahoma City, proved a 
disappointment as Sound Dash beat the heavily favored Refrigerator by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too far with too tough of horses for his first time out," owner 
Jim Helzer said. "I knew it was a high-risk deal, but I thought I owed it to 
the Oklahoma people to take him there." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Refrigerator was perfect in five starts. He finished the year by 
winning his second Champion of Champions, quarter horse racing's most 
prestigious event for older horses. He was voted world champion older horse for 
the second time before heading back to Helzer's 34-acre ranch in Arlington, 
Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Helzer sent Refrigerator back into training at Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico on 
April 1, then to Remington Park for the July 3 race. 
</P>
<P>
 Helzer bought Refrigerator as a 2-year-old for $150,000 and after correcting 
his bleeding and other problems, watched the gelding reel off victory after 
victory. In 28 starts, Refrigerator has 20 victories, seven seconds and a 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He puts a lot of pressure on us when he runs," Helzer said. "We hate to see 
him get beat. I want to make sure he goes out a champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Blane Schvaneveldt, who trains Refrigerator, also nominated the Helzer-owned 
Hopkins, a 4-year-old by Streakin Six, and multiple-stakes winner Make Mine Bud 
for the Go Man Go. He entered Refrigerator and Make Mine Bud but wasn't sure if 
Make Mine Bud would start. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Bloomquist nominated Down With Debt, who won the July 30 Las Damas 
Handicap by 1 1/2 lengths in her second start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In six races last fall, Refrigerator won the two races Down With Debt lost. In 
the Champion of Champions, she came closest to him, running second by 
three-quarters of a length. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Jaime Gomez nominated his champion for the Go Man Go, too. Four Forty 
Blast, top 3-year-old of 1993, will be making only his second start of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Avison, a Connie Hall-trained 4-year-old who has the fastest 350- and 400-yard 
races of the meeting; Shawnes Diamond, who defeated Refrigerator in the 1992 Go 
Man Go, and the Charles Treece-trained Brotherly fill out the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Hart, who leads all active jockeys with 2,196 Los Alamitos victories, 
plans to return to the track after Labor Day. Currently riding at Ruidoso 
Downs, Hart rode Meter Me Gone for trainer Danny Cardoza in the Malibu 
Overnight Handicap two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart was the leading rider 10 times between 1975 and 1983 -- the track had 
winter and summer meetings in those days -- and Cardoza, who retired his tack 
at the end of last year, led nine meets. Cardoza, however, topped the victory 
count with 2,528. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought I'd outlast him," Cardoza said of his longtime friend and 
former rival. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos received approval from the California Horse Racing Board to 
change first post time on Sundays to 4 p.m. and to conduct a special Labor Day 
race program on Monday, Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday twilight racing began Aug. 5, and will continue through the end of 
the meeting on Dec. 18. The track tested Sunday afternoons in 1990, and again 
on two Sundays this summer, and found the schedule popular among fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Day program will include a simulcast of the Grade I, $2-million 
All-American Futurity from Ruidoso Downs. The race is scheduled to run at 2:30 
and might include local runners. The track is giving up it's Thursday, Sept. 8, 
program in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jungle Raised might join the local contingent of All-American Futurity 
hopefuls when trials are held at Ruidoso Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daryn Charlton-trained runner won the Grade I Governor's Futurity Cup, 
earning $65,250 for her owner, Spencer Childers, and disrupting the expected 
showdown between Ah Sigh and Dicey Secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah Sigh, favored off her convincing performance in the Miss Kindergarten, saw 
horses pass her for the first time as she finished third by a neck. Dicey 
Secret, continued her routine of running second after winning her trial heat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Docs Keepin Time, who left the track for Hollywood, will be back for a brief 
appearance at Los Alamitos Friday. The 7-year-old stallion, who stars in the 
newly released "Black Beauty," will perform all his tricks from the movie -- 
bowing, lying down, rearing, sitting down and playing ball, with guidance from 
his trainer, Rex Peterson.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; ANDERSON CALLED THREAT AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox continues to rave about the play of wide receiver Flipper 
Anderson, who's coming off a disappointing 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes more outstanding catches every day," Knox said. "He's going down and 
digging balls out of the ground and going up and making great catches." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson caught only one touchdown pass in the final 10 games last season as 
quarterback Jim Everett struggled. But Anderson has shown promise as a deep 
threat again with the acquisition of free-agent quarterback Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Miller has more of a feel for the deep ball," Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and tailback Jerome Bettis, absent from last Saturday's exhibition 
opener, will start Saturday night's game against the New England Patriots at 
Anaheim Stadium, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller missed last Saturday's 14-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers because of a 
sore abdomen but returned to practice Monday. Knox held Bettis out of the 
opener, saving him for the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't decided how much work they will get," Knox said. 
</P>

 Reports from San Francisco said the 49ers are expected to bring in former Ram 
tailback Russell White for a tryout next week. White, a third-round pick by the 
Rams last season, was cut at the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who had three 1,000-yard rushing seasons at California, carried the 
ball only two times for 10 yards last season with the Rams and spent the final 
10 games on the inactive list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams waived defensive tackle Jeff Esters, a second-year player from 
Pittsburgh. . . . Defensive end Robert Young, who missed last week's game 
because of a groin injury, returned to practice Monday and is scheduled start 
on Saturday. . . . Tailback David Lang (knee) is expected to play Saturday 
after missing the opener and practicing only once a day. . . . Maa Tanuvasa, 
who started at defensive end Saturday in place of Young, suffered what Knox 
called a minor knee injury in Tuesday's practice. MIKE REILLEY

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: CLIMBER SCORES RECORD SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Huston has had more than his share of ups and downs, especially in the 
last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Newport Beach climber has finally found paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 He is resting in Hawaii after conquering the 13,796-foot Mauna Kea on Sunday 
and shattering the record for climbing the highest peak in each of the 50 
states.  
</P>
<P>
 Huston did it in 68 days -- with only one leg, and a custom-made prosthesis 
that in a way acted as a sort of pogo stick or shock absorber to help him along 
the bumpy way. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feelings are kind of ambivalent right now," the 33-year-old said. "There 
is some sadness because there are no more mountains left to climb, but I'm 
ecstatic because I beat the world record (101 days) and accomplished the goal I 
set out to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the reading program, Hooked on Phonics, Huston began his 
adventure on June 1 by climbing Alaska's 20,320-foot Mt. McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," Huston said. "The weather was uncooperative and we 
had high winds. As we were hiking up, people were coming down. They couldn't 
make it (to the summit) because they were just getting nuked up near the top. 
At 14,000 feet we passed a body bag of a dead Korean (one of two who froze to 
death on the mountain). But the good weather followed us and we made it to the 
summit." 
</P>
<P>
 Huston, climbing with Whit Rambach, had less trouble with Florida's Britton 
Hill -- it's only 345 feet high. But he almost wasn't able to climb Oregon's 
11,239-foot Mt. Hood. Climbers have been dying because of loose rocks and the 
guides, fearing bad publicity as much as anything else, closed their operations 
and refused to lead Huston and Rambach to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston called a friend in the area who happened to be an expert mountaineer 
and the friend led them up, incident free. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston said the prettiest view was from Wyoming's 13,804-foot Gannett Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the neatest time was up at 12,000 feet on (Montana's) Granite Peak when 
we had a bunch of mountain goats come in and visit our camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Huston lost his leg when he was 21, after battling for years against 
complications of an injury from a water ski accident when he was 14. He said he 
decided to make the world-record assault on the 50 peaks "to inspire people to 
overcome their challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will continue to climb and might even try to become the first 
one-legged man to conquer Mt. Everest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can do it. I know I can do it," he said. "Besides, I can only lose 
half of my toes to frostbite." 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL FISHING -- White sea bass struck again Monday off the back of Santa 
Catalina Island, with Redondo Sportfishing's Blackjack picking up 37 fish of 
15-30 pounds, and L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's First String taking 22 more. 
Closer to the coast, the yellowtail that roam the pilings of the offshore oil 
rigs off Huntington Beach finally decided to bite. Rick Shaw, owner of the 
Angela out of Long Beach Sportfishing, reported "a wide-open bruiser yellowtail 
frenzy" for an hour on Saturday, with his passengers boating 23 fish in the 
15-25-pound range before the bite ended. L.A. Harbor's Dreamer reported 
catching 22 fish the same day. There have been scattered catches since. 
</P>
<P>
 MEXICO FISHING -- August is too hot for many at Cabo San Lucas, but residents 
consider it one of the the best months for fishing and the last week's results 
back their claims. Blue marlin flags are flying daily and huge tuna and dorado 
are showing at the scales. The private yacht Rhapsody traveled 20 miles off 
Palmilla and two anglers spent the day catching tuna from 160-200 pounds. 
Closer to port, the fish were smaller, but several pushed 100 pounds. Dorado 
are averaging 10-30 pounds and wahoo of 40-80 pounds are beginning to show. 
East Cape fishermen are enjoying light-tackle battles with sailfish and 
heavy-duty fights with blue marlin. Mark Hollingsworth of Cypress, fishing out 
of Palmas De Cortez, fought a marlin for eight hours before losing it.  
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIEGO LONG-RANGE: Tuna fishing remains outstanding for those on three- and 
four-day trips -- with giant bluefin and football-size yellowfin cooperating 
daily -- and miserable for those on overnight trips, as the fish have yet to 
move to within the 100-mile range necessary for the smaller boats.  
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- The popular Zone A deer hunt begins Saturday and despite the 
dryness, experts are predicting moderate success in the southern section, which 
includes much of Southern and Central California. Conditions are favorable for 
a good hunt in most of the usual areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A new hot spot might be the area north of the Santa Ynez Valley around 
Figueroa Mountain, which has recovered from last year's wildfires, leaving deer 
with plenty of food and hunters with plenty of access. Weather will be a factor 
and hunters should check with the U.S. Forest Service to see what areas require 
permits for access and what areas might be closed because of fire danger. The 
best hunting is expected early mornings and late afternoons as deer will be in 
thick cover during the heat of day. The DFG says ample numbers of the 65,000 
tags remain for the 44-day hunt. Last year, 41,251 tags were sold, with hunters 
posting a 32% success rate. 
</P>
<P>
 POACHING -- Monterey Peninsula golf courses are not part of Zone A. Yet some 
apparently figured fairway deer were fair pickings. Six men were recently 
sentenced for their roles in poaching deer from golf courses and dumping the 
carcasses into the ocean. The arrests resulted from a six-week investigation by 
DFG officials seeking to shut down a ring of venison poachers who ran a 
processing center at one of the poacher's homes. Edward Albert got the stiffest 
sentence after being found guilty of trespassing and deer-tag violations of 100 
days in jail, a $2,700 fine and three years' probation, during which he cannot 
hunt or be in the company of hunters, cannot possess firearms and must permit 
search and seizure of his home or person. Albert forfeited his rifle and 
hundreds of pounds of venison.  
</P>
<P>
 GRUNION -- A grunion run along dark, sandy beaches is in progress, with the 
slippery little fish expected to show for two-hour periods beginning tonight at 
about midnight and about an hour later each night through Friday. Grabbing is 
usually best in the second hour, experts say. The last grunion run of the year 
is expected Aug. 23-26. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTEWORTHY -- Volunteers from United Anglers of California will build a reef 
off Huntington Beach on Friday, using 1,000 tons of concrete rubble. The reef 
will be three miles west of Huntington Beach Pier in 90 feet of water.

 Lance Whitaker knows where he stands.

<P>
 The amateur boxer from San Fernando is well aware of his limitations and is 
certain to face that foible again, toe to toe. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, he'll be better prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time in as many meetings, Whitaker, the top-ranked amateur super 
heavyweight in the United States, lost to Russia's Aleksei Lezin. The most 
recent setback came in the gold-medal bout of the Goodwill Games in St. 
Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the same old thing," said Whitaker, whose goal is to make the 1996 
Olympic team. "The only thing he's got over me is that he's a lefty -- and that 
gives me problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many boxers have troubled the 6-foot-8, 235-pound Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The former San Fernando High football and basketball player has been boxing 
for two years. He has won 29 of 33 bouts, but three of his four losses are to 
Lezin, the three-time Russian national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in my place, he's holding me back," Whitaker said. "He has my gold 
medal. I should be No. 1 in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 There's work to be done before he can accomplish the latter. In a 17-0 loss to 
Lezin over three three-minute rounds in Russia, the soft-spoken Whitaker never 
landed a punch -- or so the judges ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the guy plenty of times, but they didn't count it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Whitaker claims he was a bundle of nerves before the bout because of 
the Russian crowd of 2,500 and the media interviews that preceded the fight, he 
respects his opponent's skills. Whitaker was never hurt in the bout, but Lezin 
repeatedly beat him to the punch -- and in amateur bouts, landing a punch is 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker intended to stay outside Lezin's reach, but the 6-foot-5, 222-pound 
Russian picked off Whitaker's jab with his right hand and banged him repeatedly 
with his left. Despite his height and weight advantage, Whitaker was no match 
for Lezin's quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all changed when I got inside the ring," said Whitaker, 23. "I couldn't 
get my punches off like I wanted to. After the first and second round, it was 
pretty much over." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle was over, but not the war. Whitaker and Lezin will fight at the Pan 
American Games in January, so it's no surprise Whitaker is looking for a good 
sparring partner -- with one requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm looking for a left-hander," Whitaker said with a chuckle.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; CLUB APOLOGIZES FOR BOMB SCARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manager Tom Lasorda and pitcher Rudy Seanez were surprised when told that a 
toy paperweight, which happens to resemble a bomb, caused a scare at Dodger 
Stadium on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 When a stadium security guard discovered the device in Lasorda's empty office, 
a bomb squad was sent to the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a toy with a clock on it," Lasorda said before Tuesday night's 
loss at Cincinnati. "Somebody put it in my office last week, and I put it under 
my desk and forgot about it. It was a toy, more like a paperweight, but it 
looks like a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Seanez said he had bought the paperweight and put it in his locker at Dodger 
Stadium, but that it had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to take it home and keep it in my house," Seanez said. "It's just 
a digital clock, with some wires leading to seven sticks that look like 
dynamite. I don't know if anyone put any batteries in it after it was taken 
from my locker. With batteries, when someone lifts it, it sets off a couple of 
blinking lights." 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Hawkins, vice president of communications, said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dodgers apologize for any inconvenience and problems that the Tuesday 
morning incident may have caused. We understand the seriousness of the incident 
and have concluded after further investigation that the original intent was 
that of a clubhouse prank. The Dodgers do not condone such actions and have 
conveyed the message to all those concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: A quote attributed to a reporter in Tuesday's report on 
Monday's game was reported incorrectly in some editions of The Times. In 
response to Todd Worrell's telling reporters, "You guys don't know . . . about 
the game and how it's played," the reporter replied, "Obviously, you don't know 
anything about journalism." MARYANN HUDSON

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; STRIKE COMING AT WRONG TIME FOR EXPOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marquis Grissom stopped a slump by going four for five with two runs batted in 
as the Montreal Expos streaked to their 19th victory in 21 games, defeating the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, 4-3, on Tuesday night at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos (73-39) have lost only twice in three weeks and are 34 games over 
.500 for the first time in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 "With everything so uncertain because of the strike, at least that's 
something," Expo Manager Felipe Alou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kirk Rueter, who combined with Mel Rojas and John Wetteland on a 
five-hitter: "I feel like I'm getting in a groove. Unfortunately, I think the 
strike is going to take care of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Grissom, fighting through a two-for-25 slump, singled and scored on Walker's 
groundout in the first before singling in runs in the fifth and seventh against 
Jon Lieber (6-7). Lieber lasted seven innings, giving up nine hits and four 
runs, three earned. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 3, Chicago 2 -- Darren Lewis hit a two-run, bases-loaded single 
against Randy Myers with two out in the top of the ninth at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers relieved in the ninth after Steve Trachsel gave up five hits over eight 
innings. Todd Benzinger singled with one out for his third hit. One out later, 
Myers (1-5) walked pinch-hitters Darryl Strawberry and Steve Scarsone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who struck out with the bases loaded in the seventh, singled to center 
to score pinch-runners Mike Benjamin and Bill Swift. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 7, Colorado 4 -- Fred McGriff hit a two-run homer and had three RBIs 
for the Braves at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff's third two-run homer in the last two games helped the Braves improve 
to 11-0 against the Rockies at Mile High Stadium. Overall, Atlanta has lost 
only once in 21 games against the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, New York 1 -- Curt Schilling won at Philadelphia for the first 
time since last year's World Series, pitching a five-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano Duncan hit a two-run homer as the Phillies ended a five-game losing 
streak. Lenny Dykstra, four for his last 28, went three for four. 
</P>
<P>
 Schilling (2-8) struck out five, walked one and retired 19 of the last 20 
batters. It was his first complete game since he shut out Toronto in Game 5 of 
the World Series last October. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 4, Houston 3 -- Andy Ashby pitched a strong game and scored the 
go-ahead run in the eighth inning at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby (6-11) gave up six hits while striking out seven and walking one in 
eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashby singled to start the eighth against Shane Reynolds (8-5), who then left 
the game after hitting Bip Roberts with a pitch. Derek's Bell's infield hit 
against Mike Hampton later in the inning scored Ashby from third. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, St. Louis 3 -- Chuck Carr's two-run home run with one out in the 
bottom of the ninth inning at Miami was the first game-ending homer for the 
second-year Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Abbott led off the inning with a double against Vicente Palacios (3-8). 
After a sacrifice bunt, Carr homered to right field.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; A FALSE ALARM FOR PITCHER JAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reliever Mike James breathlessly telephoned all of his family and friends back 
home in Florida. He was spending all of his savings on long-distance calls, but 
who cared, he was in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending seven years in the minor leagues, pitching as low as Class-A 
Vero Beach last season with the Dodgers, he finally had made the show with the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived Tuesday morning, reported early to the clubhouse, only to hear the 
bad news: "Sorry, we made a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not going to be in the big leagues. He was not going to receive a raise 
of $4,500 a month in the minors to $4,169.41 a week in the majors. He was not 
even going to be in the Baseball Encyclopedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything was off, except that James still was allowed to keep his $328.50 
per diem check, and Andrew Lorraine still was optioned to triple-A Vancouver, 
with the promise of returning by Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just another page in the book," James said, shaking his head and 
laughing. "I have no idea what's going on. All I know is that they sent for me, 
and now I got to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, it turns out, were unaware that James already had used his three 
options when they announced his promotion. Because the Angels were going to use 
him only for two days, and send him back before the tentative Friday strike, he 
now would have to be passed through waivers to send him back to triple-A 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, who had to break the news, simply said: "We 
screwed up. What can I say, I whiffed it. I don't feel good about . . . I feel 
bad for the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 James now is expected to take a flight back to Tacoma to join the Vancouver 
team, and if a strike is averted, will fly out again Friday and join the Angels 
in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann, upon reading that Detroit Tiger Manager Sparky 
Anderson might be in danger of losing his job: 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I talked to him, he planned on managing a while. . . . Sparky's 
going to manage as long as he wants. You have those kinds of numbers, and those 
kinds of credentials, you know what you're doing." BOB NIGHTENGALE

SUMMER'S STAR SHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Researched by SHEILA DANIEL / Los Angeles Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Perseid meteor shower may be unusually intense this year. A meteor 
storm could occur Thursday night and Friday morning, climaxing about 3 a.m. 
Friday, Pacific time. Astronomers are predicting that viewers in dark locations 
with a good view of the sky could see at least one meteor per minute -- or up 
to several hundred per hour. The Makings of Meteors 
</P>
<P>
 * Often called "shooting stars," meteors are particles of dust shed by comets. 
Streaks of light are produced as the particles fall through the atmosphere and 
are burned up by friction when they collide with air molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meteors fall every night, but when the Earth passes through the orbit of an 
active comet, meteors fall in a shower of up to a few dozen meteors per hour. 
The Comet Swift-Tuttle 
</P>
<P>
 * Every August the Earth passes near the orbit of the comet Swift-Tuttle and 
we see the so-called Perseid meteors, which radiate from the direction of the 
constellation Perseus. 
</P>
<P>
 * This comet reached its closest point to Earth in 1992, as it does once every 
130 years. For several years before and after its return, showers can be 
intense because the Earth is passing through the part of the comet's orbit 
where a lot of dust was recently shed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The August shower was especially brilliant in 1991 and 1992, and less so in 
1993 because it peaked before dark on the West Coast. For the next two years 
there are still chances for bright August fireworks. Tips for Sky-Watchers 
</P>
<P>
 * The best time for viewing will be late Thursday night until 3 a.m. Friday. 
Meteors will also fall tonight and Friday, but with less intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, get away from city lights. Griffith Observatory is too close to 
Downtown Los Angeles' bright lights for good visibility and will not be open 
late for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * For more information on celestial events, call the observatory's Sky Report 
at (213) 663-8171. For program information, call (213) 664-1191.

WHEN STUDENTS BRING FIREARMS TO SCHOOL; WHY ZERO TOLERANCE, INTELLIGENTLY 
APPLIED, IS NECESSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renee Benson would like her teen-age daughter to have a second chance. The 
13-year-old student admits she brought a BB gun that looked like a revolver to 
Lawrence Middle School in Woodland Hills. A "stupid mistake," says her mother, 
"but sometimes children of 13 make stupid mistakes." Benson's daughter has 
since been expelled from the Los Angeles Unified School District; her mother is 
asking the district to reconsider its action. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickie Yates' 14-year-old son admits he knew there was a 9-millimeter handgun 
in his locker at Wright Middle School in Westchester, but contends that the gun 
belongs to his best friend. The district is still considering whether to expel 
him. Yates' mother wants her son to remain in school and is challenging the 
district's zero-tolerance policy for guns as unnecessarily harsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The mothers of Michael Ensley and Demetrius Rice would probably like their 
sons to have a second chance as well. At life. But because of guns on school 
campuses, neither will get one. Ensley, 17, was shot dead by a classmate during 
a snack break at Reseda High School in February, 1993. Rice, a 16-year-old 
student at Fairfax High, was slain a month earlier when a classmate 
accidentally fired a .357 magnum during an English class.  
</P>
<P>
 Ensley and Rice are just two reasons why the LAUSD must hold firm to the 
policy it adopted 15 months ago of zero tolerance for guns. Now, students found 
in possession of firearms are in most cases expelled. They are out for the 
remainder of the semester and the following semester. Then they can reapply. 
Previously such students were reassigned to other district schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the district policy is harsh. But it has to be because schools have 
become deadly places. During the 1993-94 school year, since the policy has been 
in effect, Los Angeles school officials recovered 127 guns on school grounds 
and expelled or transferred 166 students for bringing guns to school. Horrific 
as these figures are, they represent an improvement over 1992-93 when 168 guns 
were recovered and 256 students were expelled or transferred for gun 
possession.  
</P>
<P>
 Other state school districts, including some in Orange County, have adopted a 
similar zero-tolerance policy for weapons on campus. In one, Fountain Valley, 
15 students were expelled in the most recent school year, although in one case 
an elementary student who brought a Swiss army knife to school was allowed to 
transfer to another school in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law governing expulsions is less severe than district policies in 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. As in many other states, California law allows 
districts either to expel or transfer students. But the mandatory expulsion 
policies in effect locally, rather than the more lenient state law, should 
become the norm in California and elsewhere. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) 
has sponsored legislation that would deny federal assistance to schools that do 
not require expulsion of students found with firearms on campus. Her bill now 
allows some flexibility on expulsion on a case-by-case basis. This provision is 
currently part of the larger Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which 
awaits Senate action.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Feinstein's bill and the L.A. district's zero-tolerance policies allow 
school officials enough latitude to protect innocent students. For example, 
students who discover that classmates have, as a prank, planted a gun in their 
backpack or locker will not warrant expulsion. But when due process has been 
served, the needs of students to be safe in school must continue to take 
precedence.

SUPER-SCOOP THE HORRIBLE FIRE NEXT TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After every fire season, local, state and federal officials have an 
opportunity to assess their response, learn from mistakes and take needed steps 
toward bolstering preparedness for the fires next time. 
</P>
<P>
 And then everybody forgets about it and moves on to the next crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, perhaps the fast-moving walls of flame that devoured more than 500 homes 
and charred tens of thousands of acres in the Southern California communities 
of Laguna Beach, Altadena and Malibu last year have receded in memory. But 
surely the wildfires that now burn in at least nine Western states underscore 
the need for government to take all steps necessary to upgrade and better 
coordinate firefighting capabilities as another fire season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, following last autumn's infernos, The Times recommended some 
specific policy prescriptions for California. One was to create a commission to 
oversee the adoption and implementation of a state-of-the-art fire preparedness 
plan for the state. Another was for Congress and the Legislature to spend the 
money needed to speed up the reaction, so that wildfires can be stamped out 
before they rage out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sacramento, that means completing work on Assembly Bill 2802. Introduced 
by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), the bill would appropriate $1.8 
million to lease two gigantic CL-415 water-scooping aircraft to be used in the 
state's hot spots on a test basis during the 1994/95 fire season. Known as 
"Super Scoopers," these amphibious planes swoop down over an ocean or lake and 
quickly load up with 1,600 gallons of water, enough to slow almost any fire in 
its early stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics are skeptical of the purchase price -- $17 million per-plane -- 
which admittedly isn't cheap. But that amount is a far cry from the more than 
$1 billion in costs attributed to last year's inferno. Moreover, California 
could take the lead and propose to a half-dozen other fire-prone Western states 
that they invest in a few Super Scoopers that would be on call and available to 
all. That would increase readiness while holding down each state's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, meanwhile, Congress should reconsider its decision to put off 
hearings on a bill by Reps. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) and David Dreier 
(R-San Dimas) to modify outdated rules prohibiting the federal deployment of 
Air National Guard tankers to fight wildfires. Right now the obsolete 1932 
federal law is an almost Marx Brothers-like obstacle course: It requires state 
officials to first use all available commercial air tankers before calling up 
military C-130s for firefighting. That law can't be changed soon enough for 
those who reside in the West, where fire season is an inevitable part of life.

2 SLAYINGS AT ABORTION CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As you stated in your editorial ("When Extremism Becomes Terrorism," July 
30), "Nothing can justify the outrage that occurred in Pensacola." As a 
pro-lifer, I could not agree more. If the alleged perpetrator of this crime 
against humanity is found guilty, then the death penalty is a just punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders of those two people, and the wounding of another, are bad news for 
the pro-life movement because, first and foremost, two lives were lost. That is 
not what the pro-life movement is about. Secondly, it is bad news because the 
liberal Establishment and the liberal media, of which The Times is a glaring 
example, are all too willing to condemn everyone in the pro-life movement for 
the actions of three nuts. Let's be clear about this. Regardless of the 
unjustifiable murders of three people in Florida, the big picture has not 
changed. Killing unborn children is still immoral, monstrous and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFREY C. AYER 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 * At least The Times does admit that the vast majority of anti-abortion 
Americans, myself included, do not support the killing of abortionists. There 
is enough killing done at abortion clinics already. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-abortion activists who are contemplating violence must remember that they 
have no more right to kill an abortionist than an abortionist has to kill an 
unborn child. But pro-abortion advocates like The Times should realize that, 
like slavery, the abortion issue will no go away until abortion itself has gone 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 MLISSA SIMPSON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The incident of a second murder of a physician performing abortions (and of 
his volunteer companion) is appalling (July 30). Yet, it is not so incredible 
because the killer had been given publicity for advocating this kind of murder. 
In fact, this man, a former minister (dismissed from his church), was given 
legitimacy in the public eye by being invited to appear on several radio and TV 
talk shows.  
</P>
<P>
 People with off-the-wall moral beliefs (e.g., it's not only OK but morally 
justifiable to kill doctors who perform abortions) are at least psychologically 
unstable. Inviting such a person as a guest on popular talk shows feeds the 
fires of his passion and further encourages him to justify to his "audience" 
and to himself that his moral stand is acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it indefensible that the media should have as a guest a man who "has 
traveled the country over encouraging anti-abortion violence," saying that 
"murdering abortion providers was tantamount to 'justifiable homicide' " (July 
30). 
</P>
<P>
 Those who honor "the morality of violence against doctors" as a legitimate 
topic for debate in the media and invite speakers who advocate murder bear some 
responsibility for violence leading to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 ROSE M. BROMWICH 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 * As a strong supporter of the pro-choice movement I, as most other citizens 
of all beliefs, am appalled and angered by the wanton murder of doctors who 
perform abortions. I am frightened by the cheapening of the value of life as 
shown by drive-by shootings, freeway shootings, carjack shootings, bombings and 
all the other terrorism and violence in our daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 I read that Paul Hill, the accused murderer of Dr. John Britton, believes that 
abortion is murder and thus considers his act to be "righteous retribution." I 
can't believe that I am the only one who finds it hard to reconcile that it is 
all right for the state to take a life by capital punishment and consider it 
"righteous retribution." Where is the distinction? 
</P>
<P>
 GLORIA DREXLER 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 * So once again anti-abortion-rights activism results in coldblooded murder. 
And once again the leadership of the anti-choice movement scrambles to distance 
itself from the crimes of its followers. But to succeed, they must persuade the 
people that there is no connection whatsoever between their messages of hate 
and intolerance and the actions of hate and intolerance splashing across the 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly, they do not advocate murder or the oppression of the rights of others, 
not in so many words. But when they exhort their minions to assert their rights 
to free expression at the clear expense of the rights of others to obtain 
legally offered services, is it not logical that the followers will view the 
rights of those who disagree with them as devalued, and therefore not worthy of 
consideration?  
</P>
<P>
 When the leaders proclaim abortion to be a crime against Almighty God, does it 
not follow that some zealous "Soldiers of Christ" will take up arms to avenge 
their Lord's honor? When the leaders denounce abortion as murder most heinous, 
does it not follow that some will seek to assert justice through execution? 
</P>
<P>
 They who sow the seeds of hatred will reap the harvest of violence and 
bloodshed, and let no person think that a hasty statement of denial can sever 
the clear connection between the self-righteous cause and the tragic effect.

CELEBRATION AT CAPITOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I participated in the Americans With Disabilities Act celebration at the 
White House ("Clinton Appeals for Bipartisan Health Bill," July 28), and I 
rolled in my wheelchair from the White House event to Capitol Hill. Our group, 
Real Health Care for All, which consisted mainly of disabled people, was denied 
entrance to the Capitol. In fact we were surrounded by about 60 federal police, 
who instructed us to leave the accessible entrance to the Capitol at once or we 
would be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Since many disabled people have experienced discrimination by insurance 
companies firsthand and know perhaps more than anyone where the troubles in the 
current system are, we have become very vocal for reform. We know that 
government legitimization of insurance company practices (waivers that exclude 
certain conditions or treatments, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, 
exclusions for durable medical equipment like power wheelchairs and 
respirators, lack of personal attendant services and the ability of insurance 
companies to terminate policyholders at will upon disability or increased 
premiums to prohibitive cost), has contributed to the 66% unemployment rate 
among disabled people.  
</P>
<P>
 As long as the only way for many disabled people to get health care remains 
through Social Security programs like Medicaid and Medicare, we will be forced 
out of the work force and into poverty-based programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the events unfolded, I was reminded that the interests of big insurance 
companies were at the heart of the exclusion of this denial of entrance to a 
public building containing representatives who make policy for the people. The 
article reports that Sen. Bob Dole's office was the target of the protest. It 
is ironic that Dole, a man who has done much for the disabled community in the 
past, is siding so squarely with insurance companies and is thwarting reforms 
that would help disabled people gain employment.

WHY U.S. SHOULD LIFT BOSNIAN EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The time has come for a unilateral U.S. lifting of the arms embargo on 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Clinton Administration has preserved the Serbs' arms 
advantage for two years, deferring to the wishes of the British and French and 
ignoring the stated preference of Congress. The result has been a sorry 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bosnian Serbs defied a July 20 ultimatum for the acceptance of a 
peace plan, the five powers that had issued the ultimatum responded with only a 
minor tightening of economic sanctions on Serbia proper. Several other threats 
the five had made turned out to be empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Even leaky sanctions (Russia has ignored them) hurt in the long run, however, 
and Serbia has sought an end to the sanctions by suddenly stopping traffic with 
Serbian Bosnia and denouncing its recalcitrance. But in the Stalinist manner of 
old, President Slobodan Milosevic controls both policy and media. Yesterday's 
dogma is today's heresy and may be dogma again tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian action that matters is the action being taken in Bosnia. Momcilo 
Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly, has declared that the Serbs 
will not settle for less than 64% of Bosnian territory -- as against the 49% 
assigned them in the five-power plan. Consistent with this view, the Bosnian 
Serbs are continuing their notorious ethnic cleansing. Within the past few 
days, according to reports confirmed by the Red Cross, the Serbs have sent 100 
Muslim men to a labor camp in the Bosnian northeast and expelled more than 300 
Muslim women and children from a town in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the NATO heavy-weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Gorazde, the 
Serbs, undeterred by a pinprick NATO air attack, have escalated their attacks 
with virtual impunity. The U.N. commander, British Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, 
declined to call for NATO retaliation in Gorazde on Monday even after Serb 
forces fired anti-aircraft rounds in the exclusion zone and repeatedly attacked 
his forces there. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo is the soul and the symbol of ethnically mixed Bosnia. The lifting of 
the arms embargo should not mean an end to the NATO exclusion zone there. That 
zone should be enforced by vigorous retaliation against, among other targets, 
the Bosnian Serb capital, Pale. But given Rose's refusal to enforce the zone, 
his call for a broader demilitarization of Sarajevo rings hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the country, in any event, only the Bosnians themselves can deter 
further aggression; and they can only do so if they bring their forces into 
parity with those of the Serbs. The lifting of the arms embargo will take 
months to have any effect and can be reimposed if needed, but the moment for 
the change is now. Given the isolation of the Bosnian Serbs, the risk to the 
U.N. troops will never be smaller. And even that risk cannot be overwhelming in 
view of the reluctance of the United Nations to avail itself even of the NATO 
protection already available.

RUBE GOLDBERG WON'T YOU PLEASE GO HOME; HEALTH REFORM: THE PATCHED TOGETHER 
BILLS WILL HAVE TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS, WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE PAYING THE HIGHEST 
PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among other things, the Democratic health-care plans contain a large -- and 
unjustified -- multibillion-dollar tax on younger workers. You wonder whether 
most members of Congress know this or even care. The whole health-care debate 
is now completely out of control. The desperate effort to craft something that 
can be advertised as "universal coverage" means that Congress literally no 
longer knows what it's doing. Anything resembling the Democrats' bills, if 
enacted, would produce tremendous unintended side effects.  
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, most Americans grasp this. In a Newsweek poll last week, 
respondents were asked whether Congress ought to "pass reform this year" or 
"start over next year." By a 2-1 margin, they said start over. They sense that 
the versions of health reform crafted by House and Senate leaders are 
hodgepodges of conflicting provisions whose only purpose is to win passage. But 
what is clear to ordinary Americans is denied in Washington. In the capital, 
the fiction is that legislators know what they're doing and are debating 
rational alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt's plan, for instance, would create a 
Medicare Part C program for the unemployed, workers in small companies and many 
existing Medicaid recipients. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 
the program might enroll 90 million people. But the projection could easily err 
by millions in either direction. More important, Medicare Part C emphasizes 
"fee for service" medicine (patients selecting individual doctors), while the 
rest of the bill emphasizes "managed competition" (reliance on health 
maintenance organizations and similar plans).  
</P>
<P>
 The bill would separate the under-65 population into two groups, mainly based 
on income and size of employer. Each group would be crudely steered toward a 
different type of medicine. In practice, this division may not be politically 
acceptable or economically workable. Gephardt doesn't know; no one does.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, consider the tax on young workers. It arises from "community rating." As 
people age, their health costs and insurance premiums rise. But community 
rating requires that everyone pay the same rate. This provision is included in 
the House bill and, in a modified version, in the Senate bill. The effect would 
be to raise insurance for younger workers (say, those below 45). If employers 
have to pay higher insurance, they will pay lower salaries. The invisible tax 
on young workers might total $25 billion annually.  
</P>
<P>
 Questions swirl around both Gephardt's plan and Senate majority leader George 
Mitchell's. It is hard even to describe Mitchell's plan. He says it's voluntary 
and lacks a "mandate." Wrong. True, it doesn't mandate companies to buy 
insurance for workers. But it does mandate a standard benefits package for 
firms -- the vast majority -- that offer insurance. Because the mandated 
benefits are above average, this would probably raise health spending. 
Companies below the new standard would increase benefits; those above would 
have trouble lowering them.  
</P>
<P>
 Next, Mitchell hopes to achieve 95% insurance coverage by offering subsidies 
for low-income workers to buy it. But there's a "fail-safe" mechanism to limit 
subsidies if the budget costs exceed projected costs. However, if 95% coverage 
doesn't occur by 2000, Congress could require employers to pay 50% of their 
workers' insurance. But this would apply only to firms with more than 25 
workers. Got it? No one knows whether this would reach 95% coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 These plans are confusing because the health debate evaded the basic tension 
between expanding health services (universal coverage, etc.) and controlling 
health spending. It's hard to do both at the same time. The plans' complexities 
-- as with the original Clinton plan -- aim to disguise this conflict. 
Republicans haven't been especially constructive in this debate, because they 
haven't faced up to it either. But they are now correct that a bad bill would 
be worse than none.  
</P>
<P>
 Chaos is now the most important reality about the health-care debate. Dozens 
of provisions in these bills would have huge unappreciated consequences. John 
Sheils of Lewin-VHI, a health consulting firm, says premiums for small 
businesses in the Mitchell bill could be 25% higher than for big companies. The 
budget office puts the gap lower. Who's right? Do most members of Congress 
understand the gap? Probably not. Still, the pretense is that Congress is 
making conscious choices.  
</P>
<P>
 The pretense is sustained because in Washington politics is sport. All 
attention fixes on who wins and loses -- and the deals that enliven the game. 
Rhetorical blasts are taken for reality; political reporters know little of how 
legislation would work and care less. This often leads to bad laws, and in 
health care, the potential for blunders is huge because Congress is tinkering 
with one-seventh of the economy and most aspects of medicine.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, Robert Reischauer, head of the budget office, warned that trying to 
find a compromise by combining provisions from different bills might make the 
health system worse. He compared it to building an auto engine with 
incompatible parts: "You can't say I want a piston from Ford, a fuel pump from 
Toyota . . . and expect the engine to run." Well, that's what's happened. The 
contraption is part car, part tractor and part rollerblades. Most Americans 
seem to understand this. Will Congress?

PERSPECTIVES ON IMMIGRATION; THE ISSUE IS OVERPOPULATION; AT PRESENT GROWTH 
RATES, INCLUDING FERTILITY, THE U.S. POPULATION WILL DOUBLE IN THE NEXT 
CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDSEY GRANT and LEON F. BOUVIER, Lindsey Grant and Leon F. Bouvier are the 
co-authors of How Many Americans? Population, Immigration and the Environment 
(Sierra Club Books, 1994). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given recent budgetary problems, it may be difficult to convince Californians 
that the drain on public services is not the principal issue in determining how 
much immigration we can afford. In the long run, the impact on population 
growth will be the most lasting legacy of our current immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely as a result of immigration, the United States now has the 
fastest-growing population in the developed world, while immigration-driven 
population growth in California rivals that of some Third World countries. 
Population growth comes at great cost that cannot always be measured in dollars 
and cents. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we must realize that the human race is a part of the natural ecosystem 
of the Earth, not a privileged super-species that can transcend the laws of 
nature. The United States, because of its size and consumption habits, is the 
most destabilizing entity within Earth's fragile ecosystem. Population growth 
here has a far more profound impact on that ecosystem than growth elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The disturbances caused by human activities have accelerated dramatically in 
the past half a century. Driven by population growth and the technological 
explosion, these disturbances threaten not only the perpetuation of a way of 
life we have come to take for granted, but even the continuation of life 
systems as we understand them. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the means for controlling and reversing these terrible 
forces are within our power. What we require, as a society, is the wisdom and 
understanding to employ them. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States grew from a nation of 76 million in 1900 to 249 million in 
1990 (and to an estimated 260 million in 1994). Forty-three percent of that 
growth consisted of post-1900 immigrants and their descendants. Present 
immigration and fertility patterns place us on the path to a population of 397 
million by 2050 and 492 million in 2100. More than 90% of that growth will be a 
direct result of post-2000 immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, our immigration policies place us in a league with the ruinous 
population growth patterns of countries like India and Bangladesh. Moreover, 
our growth is far more destructive because of our style of living. Continued 
high levels of consumption combined with Third World-like population growth is 
a prescription for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 We find the idea of another doubling of U.S. population thoroughly 
frightening. Consider the impact on many of the nation's current problems: 
urban decay and unemployment; energy dependence, nuclear waste and sewage 
disposal; loss of biodiversity and resistance of agricultural pests and 
diseases to pesticides and medicines; acid rain, climate change, depletion of 
water resources, topsoil erosion, loss of agricultural lands and destruction of 
forests, wetlands and fisheries, to name just some. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there is the possibility of light at the end of the tunnel. We 
could bring population growth to a halt in the next century and even turn it 
around. First, fertility would have to fall gradually from current levels of 2 
children per woman to an average of 1.5. But even that would not be enough to 
achieve population stabilization in the United States. Without substantial 
reductions in immigration, to perhaps 200,000 annually, our population still 
would reach 337 million by 2050. 
</P>
<P>
 A return of immigration to the levels that prevailed through the middle of 
this century will not happen by itself. We must persuade our national leaders 
that, while the problems of Haitian boat people and other would-be immigrants 
are heart-rending and real, they cannot be solved by sacrificing our own 
future. The United States has an obligation to its own people and descendants, 
one that cannot be served by allowing the population to swell to half a 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A commitment to our own future does not mean ignoring the problems of the rest 
of the world. Many developing countries are caught in a population explosion, 
and the United States should make family-planning assistance the first priority 
in foreign aid. No amount of aid will have much significance unless population 
growth is curbed as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Our primary obligation is to our own future and our primary responsibility is 
to control our own consumption and population growth. Our national policy goal 
should be to avoid adding to the annual load of pollution and environmental 
damage, and then to reduce it. That can happen only if we lower our fertility 
rate and our immigration level.

UNITY AND DIVERSITY -- TO A POINT; WHILE NEWSROOMS REFLECT OUR MULTICOLORED 
SOCIETY, EXECUTIVE SUITES DON'T, WHICH CAN TRANSLATE INTO OPERATIONAL 
CLUELESSNESS.

 Several years ago, a friend of mine who once worked for a major magazine was 
sent out in the field with a list of names and asked to photograph families for 
a huge story on welfare reform. He obliged and sent his film to the main office 
in New York and received, in fairly short order, a stiff rebuke: 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you trying to say here?" a senior editor barked." Are you trying to 
make some sort of snide observation?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," my friend replied. "I merely did what I was asked." 
</P>
<P>
 "You were asked to take photos of welfare recipients," the editor snapped. 
"All these people are white!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they are," my friend agreed. "they are white and on welfare -- and you 
guys sent me the list. I had no idea what race any of the subjects were." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a true story, and it illustrates what journalists at the Unity 
conference in Atlanta last month have been trying to point out for years. Unity 
was the convergence of four groups of minority journalists, (many of them from 
major newspapers, magazines, television and radio stations) who happen to be 
African American, Asian American, Latino and Native American. 
</P>
<P>
 The Unity conference brought them together, and while the consensus seemed to 
be that there has been some heartening progress in the way newsrooms look, 
there has been very little advancement on the way they operate. The reason is 
simple: The editorial suites where decisions are made still pretty much look 
like newsrooms did 20 years ago, before they began to be integrated. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of integration at the highest levels leads to an operational 
cluelessness that results in such suppositions that all, or even most, welfare 
recipients are black. (Wrong. Statistically speaking, there are more white than 
black recipients, although within their own populations, blacks may have a 
slightly higher percentage than whites.) It results in editors being caught by 
surprise at the offense taken by persons of many races when the graphically 
darkened, sinister photo of O.J. Simpson appeared on the cover of Time 
magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 And that editorial cluelessness allows media stereotypes to percolate through 
the general populace, where they ossify into "truth," bolstered by "I read it 
somewhere" or "I heard it on the news." The end products are things like Ronald 
Reagan's ridiculous anecdote about "young bucks" (wonder what ethnic group he's 
referring to there) buying vodka with food stamps. (You can't even buy toilet 
paper with food stamps! Vodka?) Or the assumption that most Latinos are illegal 
immigrants. (According to the Urban Institute, about 15% of all foreign-born 
persons in America are undocumented; almost two-thirds come from places other 
than Mexico.) Or the "certainty" that all Asians are meek, model minorities 
(not a negative stereotype, but one that possesses its own curse nonetheless). 
Or that all Native Americans are illiterate alcoholics. (Then who's running 
those businesses, like casinos, crafts co-ops, fishing and farming 
enterprises?) 
</P>
<P>
 Those are crude assumptions, to which most civilized people would not see 
themselves subscribing. But the acid drip of stereotyping eats away at the rock 
of everyone's good intentions, and it badly compromises the common structure we 
share as Americans. We can ill afford that, given our increasing 
interconnectedness. It hurts us not only in California where (like it or not) 
we are multicultural, but also in states like Utah and Idaho, that are, for the 
moment, more monochromatic. 
</P>
<P>
 So if editors and executive producers are as smart as they're purported to be, 
they will make their editorial suites look more like the America outside their 
polished doors -- before those ethnic Americans lose patience and pass up their 
product. Because if, as demographics seem to indicate, the United States is 
running out of white folks, it would behoove the white folks who are left -- 
the future minorities -- to truly diversify their product so that there will be 
room and a need for it in the 21st Century.

FATHER DENIS MEEHAN; BENEDICTINE MONK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Denis (Molaise) Meehan, a Benedictine monk who joined St. Andrew's 
Abbey at Valyermo in 1963 and spent numerous years as a guest lecturer in 
classic literature at several Southland colleges, has died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan died Saturday of cardiac arrest at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical 
Center after a lengthy battle with prostate cancer, Abbot Francis Benedict 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1963, Meehan joined the monastery at St. Andrew's, which he called 
home for the rest of his life. During his monastic years, Meehan frequently 
left the abbey to teach as a visiting lecturer at the Claremont Graduate 
School, Scripps College, Pomona College and UCLA. From 1970 to 1973, he taught 
at Marymount College in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan also published several religious texts and wrote articles for many 
journals in England and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lover of nature, an avid bicyclist, walker and sun worshiper," the 
abbot said in a statement. "Cloudy days were not his cup of tea." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Sept. 26, 1914, in Castlebar, Mayo, Ireland, Meehan received bachelor's 
and master's degrees from National University in his native country. He was 
educated for the priesthood at National's Maynooth College and ordained a 
priest in the Irish Diocese of Elphin on June 23, 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1940s and '50s, Meehan studied in England, France, Greece and Rome 
while teaching classic literature at Maynooth. He came to the United States in 
1958 and taught for five years at Los Angeles' Immaculate Heart College before 
deciding to become a monk. 
</P>
<P>
 Meehan is survived by a brother, Charles Meehan, and a sister, Bridget 
Bullock, both of Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 A vigil will be held at 8:30 p.m. Thursday and the funeral Mass will be 
celebrated at 11 a.m. Friday at the abbey, 31001 N. Valyermo Road. Burial will 
follow at the abbey's cemetery. Halley-Olsen Funeral Chapel in Palmdale is 
handling the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made in Meehan's name to the 
abbey, 31001 N. Valyermo Road, Valyermo 93563.

PERSPECTIVES ON IMMIGRATION; CUT LEGAL ADMISSIONS BY TWO-THIRDS; IMMIGRATION: A 
SENATOR OFFERS A 'STABILIZATION' BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Reid, Harry Reid is a Democratic U.S. senator from Nevada. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government has been grossly irresponsible in its neglect of 
mounting immigration problems, even as these problems place unbearable burdens 
on states like California. It is regrettable that states have reached a point 
where the only avenue they have for justice is the courts. It is even more 
regrettable that this Administration and this Congress stand by and allow the 
federal courts to decide the nation's immigration policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers simply cannot continue to sustain new populations the size of San 
Diego or the state of Nevada every year. California is sending up the red flag 
tat Washington should heed.Unprecedented demands are being placed on job 
markets, schools, hospitals, police, social safety nets, infrastructure and 
natural resources. Unlimited new arrivals pressuring these systems threaten to 
overwhelm them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West, we have a real appreciation for dwindling natural resources. We 
fight for water from the Colorado River, the Truckee River and other scarce 
sources. We endlessly debate policies governing public lands, mining and 
livestock grazing. But rarely do we consider the burdens that millions of new 
people place every year on our water supplies air quality, parks, lakes, 
recreation areas and public land. 
</P>
<P>
 Our doors should remain open, but only wide enough to admit those to whom we 
can realistically offer opportunity and security. To leave the door unguarded 
is to create an environment in which no one can live securely and peacefully. 
And so I am sponsoring a bill in the Senate to reduce immigration-legal and 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Most politicians agree that illegal immigration should end. My legislation 
would double border patrols and accelerate the deportation process for 
criminals and illegal entrants. But many lawmakers feel that lowering legal 
immigration is too dicey. This is a cop-out. 
</P>
<P>
 My legislation calls for a reduction of legal immigrants from the current 
level of about 1 million admissions a year to approximately 325,000. Even that 
more realistic level means 25,000 newcomers entering every month, looking for 
jobs, housing and education. 
</P>
<P>
 When I sat down with Rev. Jesse Jackson not long ago to discuss immigration, 
he advised me to look at the moral implications of what I proposed. I did, and 
found the moral imperative on Congress and the President to enact change, 
quickly. Americans have sat freely around a bountiful dinner table. Now, the 
table is becoming overcrowded. People are squeezing in and elbowing each other 
to get what they want. Unless changes are made, our dinner table eventually 
will collapse, and no one will have security and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of immigration reform cry racism or point toward our historic role 
as a nation of immigrants. Charges of racial bias are unfounded. Unlike 
anything proposed before, my Immigration Stabilization Act explicity prohibits 
discrimination in refugee admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The real injustice to future Americans would be to do nothing. America is 
proud of its immigrant tradition. This tradition should be reconciled with our 
responsibility to create a better country in which to live. If we do not take 
responsible steps today, we will be forced to take radical and sadly 
preventable action only a decade from now.

OBITUARY ; JUNIUS M. MCINTIRE; MANAGER OF RESEARCH FOR CARNATION CO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Junius M. McIntire, longtime head of research for Carnation Co. for which he 
developed instant milk and other innovative products, has died. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 The biochemist died in Van Nuys on July 26, his sons, John and Paul, said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Carnation in 1955, McIntire was named general manager of research in 
1967. Under his direction, the laboratories in Van Nuys expanded from 35 to 
more than 200 researchers. He was elevated to vice president of technical 
services for the company's international division a year before his retirement 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntire's lifelong research emphasis was the chemistry of milk and instant 
products that could be made from it. In addition to powdered milk that could be 
reconstituted by adding water, McIntire developed Carnation Instant Breakfast, 
and powdered or instant hot chocolate and coffee creamer. 
</P>
<P>
 The instant products contributed strongly to Carnation's growth from a 
$500-million-a-year company to one with sales of $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Price, Utah, McIntire earned his bachelor's degree in chemistry 
from Brigham Young University and his master's and doctorate in biochemistry 
from the University of Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his research with milk as a scientist at Western Condensing Co. in 
Appleton, Wis., and later worked for the U.S. Army quartermaster in Chicago, 
developing milk and oil products into field rations. 
</P>
<P>
 A devout Mormon, McIntire served as executive secretary and high councilman of 
his Van Nuys division of the church as well as Sunday school superintendent, 
Boy Scout and Explorer Scout leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his sons, McIntire is survived by his wife, Vivian, and seven 
grandchildren.

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; BRITISH EVENT NO WALK IN THE PARK FOR LADIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Ladin of Westlake Village has an admission to make. 
</P>
<P>
 It probably won't startle many folks. It's been said before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are soft," he said. "Most of us are out of shape." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a somber voice of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, 61, said poor conditioning might have cost him the title at the British 
Senior Amateur Championship last week in suburban Manchester, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin walked the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 So he can talk the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, who won the 1993 State Senior Amateur Championship, was leading the 
54-hole event with one round to play, but fell apart as he stumbled through the 
final 18 holes at Formby Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 He shot an eight-over 80 in the final round and finished fourth, five shots 
behind the winner. As the saying goes, Ladin's wheels fell off. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, it felt like they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like an elephant stepped on my feet and ankles," he said. "I just 
wasn't ready for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Players weren't allowed to use electric carts. Most senior events in this 
country, including those on the Senior PGA Tour, allow players to ride if they 
so choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin has been spoiled by the U.S. country club lifestyle. The British frown 
on the use of carts, it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they use goats," Ladin cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin walked the course each day, on rock-hard fairways that felt more like 
runways. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, there was no practice range available to players. At least the 
British were consistent: no driving carts, no driving range. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin said players were allowed to hit their own golf balls into a nearby 
field to warm up, then had to retrieve the balls themselves. By the third day 
of the 54-hole tournament, Ladin was too pooped to pop. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament unraveled for him in the final round when he lost a ball on the 
front nine. Well, he lost it temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 A split second after Ladin decided to play his provisional ball, somebody 
found the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, too late. He made a triple bogey and never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "My swing just went," he said. "I was tired, no doubt about it. If I shoot 75, 
I win the thing. I ran out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
 He has plenty of time to refuel before the U.S. Senior Amateur qualifier Aug. 
29 at Wilshire Country Club. The Senior Amateur begins Sept. 19 at The 
Champions Golf Club in Nicholasville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reload: Three out of four wasn't good enough. It wasn't even close. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks finished nine shots behind winner Mark Johnson of 
Helendale in the 28th Pacific Coast Amateur at Bear Creek Golf Club in 
Murrieta, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no mystery pinpointing precisely when Turner lost the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner shot 81 in the third round of the prestigious invitational. He played 
the first eight holes in eight-over-par 44. In one stretch, he made bogey, 
double bogey, triple bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have just taken my average on the front nine from the other 
rounds," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 No kidding. Turner averaged 34 on the front side over the three other rounds, 
a fourth of which would have given him a one-shot victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Different strokes: You wanna play on the PGA Tour, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there is hard enough. Staying there is even harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the performances this season by a pair of area rookies, former Cal 
State Northridge standout Bob Burns and Hueneme High graduate Paul Stankowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have played well sporadically, which on the tour means paychecks are, 
well, sporadic. Through last weekend's Buick Open, Burns ranks 98th in tour 
earnings with $139,241 and Stankowski is 122nd with $107,809. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns started fast in January, placing in the top 15 in two of his first three 
events. Overall, however, he has missed the cut 11 times in 20 events. 
</P>
<P>
 Stankowski finished sixth at the Bob Hope Classic in February and eighth at 
the St. Jude Classic last month, but has only made the cut six times in 21 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 Stankowski missed the cut in six consecutive tournaments before he finished 
eighth in the St. Jude Classic for his best payday, $37,500. 
</P>
<P>
 That sounds like a lucrative sum, yet Stankowski and Burns might need a few 
more fat checks to stay on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 To retain a tour card, a player must finish in the top 125 in earnings for the 
year, which officially ends Oct. 27-30 at The Tour Championship at the Olympic 
Club in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 If the player doesn't cut the mustard, it's back to the grueling qualifying 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 850 players apply annually to PGA qualifying school. Earning a 
tour card is a three-step process, with the top finishers at each tournament 
moving on to the next plateau. 
</P>
<P>
 At the final stage, only the low 40 players plus ties earn a card for the 
following year. The qualifying process for 1995 begins in October.

PIGSKIN'S FUTURE IS UP IN AIR; FOOTBALL: AUG. 29 GAME MAY BE LAST IN ANAHEIM IF 
DISNEY DOESN'T RENEW SPONSORSHIP.

<P>
 The Disneyland Pigskin Classic football game, which has been marked by 
appealing matchups but lackluster crowds, might be making its final appearance 
in Anaheim Stadium Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's five-year contract to sponsor the event expires after this year's 
game between Fresno State and Ohio State, and "it's just very unlikely they'll 
renew it," said Orange County Sports Assn. Executive Director Don Andersen, 
whose group promotes the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Disneyland President Jack Lindquist, who has been the driving force 
behind the game and is still highly active as a company consultant, said he's 
"not real optimistic" that Disneyland will extend the deal. He said an 
announcement would be made after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall the game hasn't lived up to our expectations," Lindquist said. "We 
think we've put some outstanding games together with some of the top teams in 
the country . . . but maybe the timing of the game isn't good. Maybe it's too 
early (in the season) for people to be thinking about college football. We're 
taking a long look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The late August game has featured highly ranked teams such as Florida State, 
Colorado and Tennessee, but has attracted an average of 39,093 fans in 
69,000-seat Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 USC-North Carolina matchup, John Robinson's debut in his second stint 
as Trojan coach, drew the largest crowd (49,309) of the four games, and the 
upcoming Fresno State-Ohio State game is expected to do well at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a major title sponsor to replace Disneyland's $1 million annual 
commitment, Andersen said Anaheim would not be able to play host to the game. 
But that wouldn't preclude another city or sponsor continuing the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the National Assn. of College Directors of Athletics, which 
owns the rights to the game, and the American Football Coaches Assn. Retirement 
Trust, which receives some proceeds from the game, have been discussing 
contingency plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (Disneyland) pulls out, we'll have the game at another place and site," 
said Mike Cleary, executive director of Cleveland-based NACDA. "We've had 
feelers from other cities and sponsors, but we can't talk to them because it's 
not official." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen stressed that the Freedom Bowl, a post-season college football game 
played in Anaheim Stadium in December, would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the NCAA in July vetoed the Walt Disney Co.'s proposal to make Orange 
County the permanent site for an NCAA Division I-A national championship 
football game, Lindquist and Andersen said the company will continue to pursue 
that event, which would include a week-long tribute to artists, musicians and 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NCAA said a national championship game is probably three or four years 
away, but they also said they love Disney's whole idea," Andersen said. "We've 
had ongoing discussions with ABC, and they've told us they want to be a partner 
in such an event." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a network television contract may have hurt the Pigskin game. 
Raycom pays about $600,000 annually for television rights, but networks 
normally pay in excess of $1 million, and sometimes substantially more, for 
college bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen also has had problems recently attracting top-notch teams. Some 
highly rated schools don't want to risk a possible national championship by 
playing a difficult opponent in the first game. Notre Dame has turned down 
several invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big-name schools don't want to risk losing to a school that doesn't have 
a great national reputation but is capable of an upset. Andersen had an oral 
agreement from Nebraska officials to play Fresno State this year, but the 
Cornhuskers pulled out after the team voted not to accept the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we've had difficulty getting the top teams, but I still think 
we've had quality teams in each game," Andersen said. "The eight teams who have 
played went on to win 85% of their games during that season, and all eight went 
to post-season bowl games." 
</P>
<P>
 But the game hasn't been the box-office success that Disneyland hoped it would 
be. The first game in 1990, pitting eventual national co-champion Colorado 
against Tennessee, which was eighth in the final Associated Press poll, may 
have served as a warning when it drew only 33,458. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a high-powered Florida State team, which finished fourth in the final 
poll, and Brigham Young with Ty Detmer drew only 38,363. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd think games like that would sell out," Andersen said. "The game, while 
successful, has not been a rousing success. Perhaps the time and market isn't 
right for a preseason college football game here." Not a Top Draw 
</P>
<P>
 The Disneyland Pigskin Classic college football game has never drawn more than 
71.5% of capacity in Anaheim Stadium, which seats about 69,000 for football: 
03,06,36,12 Year Result Attendance 1990 Colorado 31, Tennessee 31 33,458 1991 
Florida State 44, Brigham Young 28 38,363 1992 Texas A&M 10, Stanford 7 35,240 
1993 North Carolina 31, USC 9 49,309

MIKE DOWNEY: RAMS RIGHT TO STAND BY THEIR MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now, on defense for the Rams, me. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular football player has been charged with a crime. A serious crime -- a 
felony. The athlete maintains his innocence. Others say they have very strong 
evidence pointing to his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 No, no O.J. today. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit du jour is Darryl Henley, a defensive back who is back playing 
ball with the Rams, even though he is under indictment for masterminding a 
major cocaine-selling ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been bashed once or twice this summer, simply because they stood 
by an employee. Despite the charges against him, they believe Henley deserves 
due process. So does the National Football League, which cleared Henley to 
continue playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility of reassessing Darryl's status was with the league," John 
Shaw, executive vice president of the Rams, said Tuesday. "The 'integrity of 
the game' question has been addressed. And our organization supports the view 
of the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will obviously monitor the other situation as it goes along. But Darryl 
has been a valued member of this football team. As long as he has been cleared 
to play, he is still a part of this team." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the former UCLA athlete became a free agent, he could have signed with 
any NFL team. As one Ram official rhetorically asked, "What happens if we let 
someone else sign Henley, then he's judged totally innocent?" 
</P>
<P>
 Good extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called waiting for justice to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of those "presumed innocence things," to use a phrase from a recent 
Doonesbury comic strip about O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 It should happen to you. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are acting responsibly regarding Darryl Henley's rights. Should he be 
found guilty, then they can scratch his name from the roster. Should he be 
found not guilty, then they can continue to play him as his talent warrants. 
This isn't complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't automatically dismiss people for being arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the general public is not always satisfied unless the accused is forced 
into exile. Arrested means guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 It definitely looks bad for Darryl Henley, true. He is one of eight defendants 
charged in joint cases of extortion and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. The 
drug ring allegedly was headquartered in Henley's house. A former Ram 
cheerleader was implicated, as was Henley's uncle. The cheerleader has pleaded 
guilty; the Henleys are free on bail money totaling $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And Darryl is in the NFL, not in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 The player's attorney, Roger Cossack, pointed out, "Darryl Henley has never 
been in trouble in all his life." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Rams are supporting a man they know. They do not deny Henley his 
inalienable right to continue working. Lest we forget, there are a number of 
NFL players still playing who have been convicted of crimes. It is hardly 
idyllic, but it's a fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 So, one thing at a time. Let's wait for Henley to stand trial, then judge him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram coaches are not mind-readers. They don't know what Henley has done. They 
do know he can help their team. 
</P>
<P>
 But his is a sticky predicament. Until his situation changes, it is possible 
that Henley will be available only for home games, a condition of his bail 
being that he not travel outside a specified area of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He will cross that bridge when -- rather, if -- he comes to it. 
</P>
<P>
 What somewhat complicates matters for the Rams is that no team in football 
more emphatically clamored in recent years against drug abuse. Anti-drug 
messages have been slapped all over the Rams' uniforms and field. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a drug dealer on the payroll would hardly sit well with the 
active-in-the-community Georgia Frontiere, nor with a Ram advisory board that 
includes a U.S. congresswoman, the Orange County sheriff, a member of England's 
House of Lords, Ronald Reagan's daughter and Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 But until that person is a convicted drug dealer, he is a citizen and should 
be treated as such. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, that presumed innocence thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, 27, is facing the prospect of 10 years in prison or more. Federal 
prosecutors have branded him a menace to society and a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams line up 10 against 11 some Sunday, you'll know they were right. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if he should become a Ram on the lam, the team is not responsible. 
This isn't some work-release program. This is a football franchise, not a 
halfway house. Better to give a job to a friend than turn your back. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley has been a Ram since 1989. If convicted, he may never be one again. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that sorry day, though, it is good of the Rams to stand behind their 
man. Not every company would.

RING OF GOLD; A LOOK AT THE 1984 U.S. OLYMPIC BOXING TEAM; THE COUNT REACHES 
10; SOME ARE OUT, BUT AT LEAST TWO OF NINE GOLD MEDALISTS ARE STILL GOING 
STRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago Thursday, American boxing's class of '84 jump-started the 
playing of the national anthem nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxers cried a bit on the medal platform, hugged each other, then embarked 
on pro careers that a decade later continue in prosperous fashion for two -- 
Pernell Whitaker and Virgil Hill -- but have gone off the tracks for all the 
rest.  
</P>
<P>
 They fought to a record nine gold medals in the Sports Arena, barely missing a 
10th when a future heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield, was disqualified in 
a light-heavyweight semifinal bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine. A big number. In two Olympics since then, U.S. boxing gold medals total 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 True, boxing powerhouse Cuba and most East Bloc countries boycotted the L.A. 
Olympics, making the going much easier for the the U.S. team.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, about half the members of that team earned more than a million dollars 
as pros, with Holyfield and lightweight Whitaker becoming the richest.  
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield has grossed roughly $100 million since then, including boxing and 
endorsement income. Whitaker would rank a distant second. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield was responsible for one of the most dramatic, unforgettable moments 
of the L.A. Olympics. Before 11,729, in a semifinal match, he flattened New 
Zealander Kevin Barry with a left hook that landed a split second after the 
referee's "Stop!" command.  
</P>
<P>
 Instantly, Yugoslav referee Anton Josipovic gave the signal that he had 
disqualified the American. Holyfield, who had appeared to be not only on his 
way to a gold medal but the tournament's outstanding-boxer award as well -- 
seemed stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, U.S. Coach Pat Nappi tried to charge into the ring after Josipovic 
but was restrained by assistant Roosevelt Sanders. The crowd was near-riotous. 
A two-syllable expletive was chanted, and trash sailed into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disqualification stuck, and Holyfield received the loudest ovation of 
all on gold-medal awards night when he was given the bronze, and Barry, who had 
won the gold, hauled him up onto the top spot of the platform so the crowd 
could salute him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten summers ago, the biggest winner seemed to be Mark Breland, the skinny New 
York welterweight who, though booed repeatedly during the tournament, finished 
his amateur career with the best mark in the history of amateur boxing, 110-1. 
</P>
<P>
 He then signed a pro deal that remains the richest ever for an amateur turning 
pro. But his pro career (30-3-1), when measured against expectations in 1984, 
was something of a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest surprise of the class of '84?  
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, middleweight silver medalist Hill, who a decade later as a 
light-heavyweight champion has lost only once in his pro career and still 
regularly commands six-digit paydays. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year update, on the class of '84: PAUL GONZALES: Gold Medalist (106 
pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales remembers a flash of anger when he stepped onto the medal platform to 
receive his gold medal.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to bring my mother up on the platform for the ceremony, but they 
wouldn't let me," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But still, I'll never forget that moment -- holding American and Mexican 
flags in my hands, listening to the national anthem, and feeling so proud of 
who I was." It fell to Gonzales, through the luck of the draw, to set the tone 
for the U.S. sweep through the tournament. On day one, Gonzales drew South 
Korean Kim Kwang-Sun. He and Gonzales were ranked 1-2 in the world at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales dominated Kim, knocking him down early, showing off all his 
considerable boxing skills and winning an easy decision. STEVE McCRORY: Gold 
Medalist (112 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 To hear his manager tell it, McCrory was done in by two human flaws, 
impatience and jealousy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit boxer, younger brother of former welterweight champion Milton 
McCrory, wasn't offered much to turn pro. He wound up with his brother in the 
Kronk Gym stable operated by Manny Steward. 
</P>
<P>
 "By 1985, Steve had become unhappy that the other Olympic kids were making 
much more money than he was," Steward said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was undefeated and wanted to take a fight in Australia with Jeff Fenech 
for his bantamweight title, and I advised against it. I felt Fenech was too 
strong for him, that Steve just wasn't ready. But he insisted -- he demanded -- 
I make the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve just ran out of gas in the late rounds, and Fenech beat him. And his 
career never really bounced back. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he'd taken more of the fights I wanted him to take early on, he'd have 
been much tougher later." ROBERT SHANNON: (119 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon is the answer to the boxing trivia question: "Which '84 U.S. Olympic 
boxer did not win a medal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Left-handed, possessing a solid left hook and little defensive prowess, 
Shannon's fights, amateur and pro, tended to be quick and exciting. In fact, 
his Olympic defeat went down in the minds of many as the most memorable of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nonstop, multiple-knockdown brawl with a South Korean, Moon Sung-Kil, 
Shannon was stopped in the third round of the preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon was the team barber. He charged teammates $2 for a trim, $5 for a 
style cut. Today, at 31, he's a professional barber in Lynnwood, Wash. And it's 
$9 per trim. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, there was no big contract. He earned $1,500 for his first pro bout 
in 1984 and in a career that ended in 1990 with an 18-6-2 record, his biggest 
purse was $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His most vivid Olympic memory: "Just walking around in L.A. with my USA sweats 
on, and having so many people come up to me -- not even knowing what sport I 
was involved in -- and wishing me luck. It was a great experience, all of it." 
MELDRICK TAYLOR: Gold Medalist (125 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 It's commonly believed in boxing circles that Taylor's pro career flamed out 
on a 1990 spring night in Las Vegas when he lost in the final seconds to Julio 
Cesar Chavez, and wound up in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The conventional wisdom: He was never the same. Maybe so, but Taylor 
throughout his career had a nemesis more formidable than Chavez, the scales. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when he was 17, on a night before a U.S. team was to box the Cubans, 
Nappi made bed checks and found Taylor tucked in with a pizza, hours before he 
had to make 125 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was always like that for the extravagantly talented Philadelphia 
featherweight -- the hard-hitting kid who couldn't make weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, Taylor came within seconds of beating perhaps the greatest 
fighter of his time, Chavez. Despite Chavez's great rally in the late rounds of 
a memorable battle of 140-pounders, two judges had Taylor comfortably ahead 
when disaster struck him with seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, bleeding from the nose and mouth and with his left eye closing, was 
felled by a right. He arose at the six-count, and when referee Richard Steele 
asked, "Are you OK?" he got no response. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele stopped it, igniting a controversy that still fuels arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 He signaled the fight's end with two seconds to go, and raised Chavez's hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor never seemed the same fighter after that. More worrisome, he didn't 
sound the same. His speech was slurred. Friends begged him to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't. In fact, he will fight Chavez again on Sept. 17. PERNELL WHITAKER: 
Gold Medalist (132 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 "Sweet Pea," his teammates of '84 called him. He might have been the best of 
all, even then, as now. 
</P>
<P>
 Breland was the team's headliner in Los Angeles, but Whitaker, the left-hander 
from Norfolk, was also world-class. When he defeated Cuba's Angel Herrera in 
that USA-Cuba dual meet early that year, it was the third consecutive time he 
had beaten Herrera, one of amateur boxing's great champions at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitaker and Breland were pals then, as now, and he never seemed 
uncomfortable in Breland's shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm the best (amateur) fighter in the world, but if people want to say 
Mark is, well, he's my friend, so that's OK," he said, when the team arrived in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His adviser since 1984, Shelly Finkel, said Whitaker as a pro "lived up to 
every bit of potential we saw in him then, and went beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 Finkel talked of two pro fights Whitaker won with broken hands as examples of 
his professionalism and courage. But the eye-opener occurred on Aug. 20, 1989, 
in Norfolk, Va., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the day he beat Jose Luis Ramirez so decisively, after he'd had a 
decision over Ramirez stolen from him in Paris the year before," Finkel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His attitude that day, his will -- that showed me there was no limit to what 
he could achieve." JERRY PAGE: Gold Medalist (139 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 Page won an Olympic gold medal, had a cup of coffee in pro boxing, retiring 
with an 11-4 record, and now says he's happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Page, 33, and his wife, Christy, live in Page's hometown of Columbus, Ohio, 
and have five children. The gold medal is in a desk drawer, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Page works for the Columbus Police Athletic League, coaching youth boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 His most enduring '84 memory: "Walking out of that tunnel during the opening 
ceremonies, seeing all those people, hearing the music -- it hit me like, bam! 
There was a feeling of reality to it that I'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 Page's gold medal was achieved with some controversy. When he was given a 5-0 
decision over Thawee Umpormaha of Thailand, the Thais screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Page, who retired in 1990, said he passed up chances to make more money than 
he did professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was offered as much as $60,000 to sign with people, but everyone wanted me 
to move someplace," he said. "I wanted to box in Columbus. And I had a bad knee 
then and I wasn't confident about how it'd hold up. I didn't want to take money 
under false pretenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it turned out, my biggest purse was $12,500. I have no complaints. Boxing 
was good to me." MARK BRELAND: Gold Medalist (147 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, Breland remains the king of boxing's bonus babies. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after he won gold in L.A., he was earning $100,000 for his first 
bout, had signed a $3-million dollar ABC deal, was driving a luxury car and 
lived on Park Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, when he and seven Olympic teammates turned pro in Madison 
Square Garden on Nov. 15, 1984, Breland had "Goldbusters" T-shirts printed up 
for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a good career. He was even a welterweight champion for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 But considering the huge buildup, he was something of a bust as a pro. New 
Yorkers turned on the Brooklyn fighter quickly when his soft chin was exposed 
by Marlon Starling in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, at 30-3-1, he retired. He says he's not disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed my boxing career. A lot of people were saying I was going to be a 
(Sugar Ray) Leonard or a (Thomas) Hearns. Then when things didn't work out like 
that, they said, 'Well, he's sure no Leonard or Hearns.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I never said that. It never bothered me that I didn't live up to what other 
people expected." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, at 30, an annuity established in 1984 by his adviser, Finkel, kicks 
in. From it, Breland will receive $100,000 a year for life. FRANK TATE: Gold 
Medalist (156 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 As was Taylor's, Tate's early pro career might have been a weight class too 
low. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the light-middleweight limit of 156 was a daily grind for Tate at the 
L.A. Olympics, and so was 160 when he turned pro. It all caught up to him when 
he faded in the late rounds and lost his piece of the world middleweight title 
to Michael Nunn in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate had perhaps the easiest journey of all to '84 gold. In fact, he had a 
harder time in the Olympic trials final against U.S. rival Ron Essett than 
against any of five foes in the Games. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, he started with two 5-0 decisions, stopped another opponent in 
one round, got a medical walkover in the semifinals and then won a 5-0 decision 
over Canadian Shawn O'Sullivan for the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate's pro career was temporarily in limbo after Nunn stopped him in the ninth 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate, still active at 31-4, moved up to light-heavyweight in 1990. His old 
L.A. teammate, Hill, has twice lured him to Bismarck, N.D., and beaten him on 
decisions. VIRGIL HILL: Silver Medalist (165 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 In strictly a boxing sense, Hill has been one of the most successful of the 
class of '84. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield, Whitaker and Taylor have made more money, but none of the 12 can 
match his record of 38-1, including 17-1 in championship fights. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the exception of taking a fight with Hearns in 1991 -- his only loss 
-- he has made the best decisions of any of his teammates and been the best 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Hill has concentrated on being a big-time star in his home 
state, North Dakota. He's the biggest sports name there since Roger Maris. His 
portrait hangs in the state capitol in Bismarck. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill could book a fight in Bismarck with Roseanne Arnold, put 8,000 in the 
Civic Center -- with the governor at ringside -- and make $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxer thought by some to have been the weak link on the '84 Olympic team 
has grossed about $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He trains virtually year-around, watches his diet between fights, and is still 
fighting at the same weight, 175, as when he turned pro in 1984. No other '84 
Olympian can make that claim. EVANDER HOLYFIELD: Bronze Medalist (178 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 Early in 1984, Ricky Womack of Detroit was thought to be a cinch for the 
Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 A natural light-heavyweight, Womack was fearless, a hard hitter and had beaten 
every contender in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then along came Holyfield, a skinny kid who earned pocket money by gassing up 
small planes at a suburban Atlanta airport. 
</P>
<P>
 He came on with a rush in the team selection process, before losing a 3-2 
decision to Womack in the semifinals of the Olympic trials. But in the box-off 
three weeks later, he beat Womack twice in two days to make the team, both on 
4-1 decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the Olympic tournament, Holyfield looked to be on his way to a gold 
medal and the outstanding-boxer award -- won by Gonzales, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw a kid improve in six months like this kid has," said Nappi, who 
was coaching his third Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all the commotion and controversy of his unjust disqualification, 
Holyfield maintained a quiet dignity that remains with him today. Not once did 
he curse the referee, punch a wall or throw furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 A pro turning point? His one-punch, second-round knockout of Adilson Rodrigues 
at Lake Tahoe in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That showed me and everyone else he was a legitimate heavyweight, that his 
punch would have to be respected by anyone," Finkel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holyfield's career is at least on hold. A congenital heart problem was 
discovered after he lost his heavyweight championship to Michael Moorer last 
April, and Holyfield continues to undergo medical tests.  
</P>
<P>
 And Womack? His old amateur rival is serving a 12- to 25-year prison sentence 
in Michigan for armed robbery. HENRY TILLMAN: Gold Medalist (201 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 It was perhaps the most improbable story of them all, that Henry Tillman, two 
years after trying on a pair of boxing gloves for the first time, won an 
Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman didn't have much of a pro career (25-6), but his Olympic story remains 
one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, he signed up for a boxing class at the California Youth Authority 
facility at Chino, where he was serving a year on an armed-robbery conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman's career will forever be linked with Mike Tyson's. It was Tillman who 
prevented the 17-year-old New York slugger from making the '84 team, beating 
him twice in the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1989, Tillman was selected as Tyson's first opponent after his shocking 
knockout loss to Buster Douglas in Japan. Tyson knocked out Tillman in one 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson, an Olympic team alternate, wound up being Nappi's go-fer at the 
Olympics. Four years later, Tyson grossed $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Tillman, 34, lives in the Diamond Bar home he bought with the $350,000 
earned in the Tyson fight. He is married to Gina Hemphill Tillman, whom he met 
during the '84 Games. Hemphill, a granddaughter of Jesse Owens, carried the 
Olympic torch during the opening ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman has studied real estate and frequently does public speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be the world heavyweight champion when I turned pro," he said. 
"But I'm not sorry it never happened. It was time to move on. I did all right." 
TYRELL BIGGS: Gold Medalist (201+ pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs, more than anyone else on the '84 team, benefited from Cuba's boycott of 
the L.A. Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's triple Olympic champion, Teofilo Stevenson, was 33 then, but still on 
top of his game and 2-0 against Biggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs won a decision from a ponderous Italian, Francesco Damiani, for the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro trainers were intrigued by Biggs, who was 6 feet 5 and 220 pounds, had 
graceful ring movement and a workmanlike left jab. It was apparent he lacked 
knockout power, but many believed that through athleticism and boxing ability, 
he could become a prime-time heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely unknown at the outset of his pro career, however, was that Biggs had a 
drug problem dating to his Philadelphia high school days. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Biggs was always a much better interview than boxer. Great fighters all 
have, somewhere, a nasty streak. Biggs didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 33, he lives in Costa Mesa on some of the $1.25 million he earned from his 
1987 Mike Tyson fight, the money having been put in trust for him. And he says 
he has been clean of drugs for nearly 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 With his pro career (27-9) over, he would like to train young boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had a trainer who could develop the skills I had," he said. 
"Most pro trainers are big-punch oriented and tried to make me a puncher, when 
I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Biggs' career was never the same after Tyson defeated him in 1987. Biggs was 
15-0 at the time, but lost his next three bouts was 24-5 by 1991. 
</P>

RING OF GOLD; A LOOK AT THE 1984 U.S. OLYMPIC BOXING TEAM; HIS TORCH BURNS OUT; 
WHILE DE LA HOYA GETS RICH, GONZALES GIVES HIM A PARTING SHOT -- AND WONDERS 
WHERE THE TIME WENT

<P>
 Paul Gonzales throws verbal combinations at the latest Grim Reaper, making 
believe it is 1984 again and he is the one and only Kid Barrio. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement? No way. Never. 
</P>
<P>
 "What, you crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stick and move. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a Thursday afternoon at the Hollenbeck Youth Center in East Los Angeles 
and, if one is willing to ignore the obvious, turning back the clock is not 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Same musty gym. Same crusty trainer, Al Stankie. Same fighter, Paul Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cop and the Kid. They were going to make a movie. As boxer skips rope and 
trainer tends to paperwork, you half expect the phone to ring and a fight card 
to break out. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon closer inspection, Stankie's hair, pulled back into a ponytail to make a 
53-year-old man look hipper, is streaked with gray. 
</P>
<P>
 And gravity has at last chased down a now full-faced Gonzales, 30 pounds 
heavier than the flyweight who 10 years ago Thursday, a few blocks away at the 
Sports Arena, became the first Latino to win an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did the time go?" Stankie wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 Time, in fact, has come calling for Gonzales' gloves. It isn't that simple, 
though, so the fighter continues to box his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room, Stankie acknowledges that he doesn't know how to break the 
news to Kid. They've been Mutt and Jeff going on 20 years, ever since Stankie, 
then an LAPD officer, rescued the 9-year-old street punk from the barrio, 
taught him to box, took him into his home, then turned him into an Olympic 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When do you give up the ghost?" Stankie asks. "When does a ballplayer hang up 
his gloves, a hockey player his skates? When is it time?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Gonzales, the time is now. After a four-year rupture in the relationship, 
reportedly the result of Stankie showing up drunk at one of Gonzales' fights in 
1989, the trainer, who has since undergone alcohol rehabilitation, has returned 
to the corner, if only to tie up loose ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales still calls Stankie "Pop." And Stankie still calls Gonzales "Son." 
</P>
<P>
 During a professional decade strewn with confounding injuries, bad luck and 
questionable business decisions, Gonzales fought only 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old Gonzales scored his 18th -- and probably last -- victory in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that Stankie has returned for purposes of preservation, not 
resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could give him a fight with a phone call," Stankie says. "He's not a bum. 
He's still an Olympic champion." 
</P>
<P>
 But . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Stankie, father protector, is not about to allow some up-and-comer to stomp on 
Gonzales' good name for promotional purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 History will reflect that Gonzales' dream fell several punches short. He never 
became a millionaire, or wore a world championship belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, after blazing the Latino trail out of the barrio, Gonzales has watched 
Oscar De La Hoya steal his poor-East-L.A.-boy-makes-good script and run off 
with the riches. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashing in on his Olympic fame, De La Hoya recently landed a $7.5-million 
contract with HBO. Gonzales never made six figures for a bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Envy? 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be, whether he admits it or not," says Don Chargin, who promoted 
more than half of Gonzales' fights. "Paul had all the bad breaks, while De La 
Hoya has had it really easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales insists he is not jealous of De La Hoya. But don't rule out 
contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Do you know Oscar?' and I say 'Yeah, he's my shadow,' " Gonzales 
says. "That's what he is, my shadow. Paul Gonzales paved the road for a lot of 
Hispanics. Now, a lot of them are getting what I should have gotten. But it's 
not too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the first, I'll always be the first. They'll always be the second, or 
third, or fourth. Paul Gonzales will be the prince of the barrio." 
</P>
<P>
 Their stories are virtual parallels, to the degree that De La Hoya built a 
home for his family in Montebello only a few blocks from the home Gonzales had 
built for his mother, Anna, 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The rift between Gonzales and De La Hoya stems from a magazine story last year 
in which De La Hoya criticized Gonzales for saying in so many words that he 
considered himself an American first, then a Mexican. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales has been counterpunching ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to crack him on the chin," Gonzales says. "He's got a big mouth, 
and I'd like to shut it. The guy's a punk, a snake." 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, though, only Gonzales spews venom. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya claims to harbor no ill feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lots of respect for Paul Gonzales," De La Hoya said when informed of 
Gonzales' comments. "I remember how we were close buddies not too long ago. But 
I guess there was a bad interview in a magazine or something, and he saw it and 
didn't like it. But I still respect him. I look at him as the first one who did 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 You suspect it is De La Hoya's success that keeps Gonzales sparring in dank 
gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy has nothing to do with it," Gonzales snaps. "He doesn't motivate me, 
because I'm never going to fight him. If they would fight me, then I would say, 
'Let's do it.' I'd love to fight him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, once a wisp of a fighter, has fattened up to 135 pounds. De La Hoya 
tipped the scales at 135 for his impressive victory over Jorge Paez in Las 
Vegas on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd fight him," Gonzales says. "It would be one last fight. Him. The guy 
hasn't proven anything to me. I'd just like to shut his mouth. He's a joke. 
He's a paper champion." 
</P>
<P>
 As he dresses down De La Hoya, Gonzales is 20 again. His eyes are saucers, his 
smile wide. He is the prince. 
</P>
<P>
 How does one retire from such exhilaration? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the thrill of the fight," Gonzales says with almost religious fervor. 
"That's what it is. When you're in there, going blow to blow, it just feels so 
wonderful. When you're making the guy do what you want him to do, you're 
slapping him around, hitting him with combinations. You stand back and look at 
your work of art." 
</P>
<P>
 As De La Hoya's entourage swells, Gonzales cannot help but see himself in the 
picture. On good days, in his mind's recesses, he still imagines it can happen 
for him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where did the time go? 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales walked away from the 1984 L.A. Games with star potential nearly 
matching De La Hoya's after Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were differences. The money for lighter weight fighters 10 years ago 
was paltry. Gonzales thinks he helped to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the year Gonzales won gold, eight other American boxers were also 
Olympic champions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, De La Hoya was the only American gold medalist in boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can the American public even remember who those nine gold-medal winners were 
from '84?" Stankie says. "But you ask that same group in 10 years, 'Who won the 
gold in '92?' and everyone is going to say Oscar De La Hoya. Yeah, that's got 
to bug Paul." 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Gonzales was a million-dollar boxer trapped in a two-bit 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best way to explain Paul Gonzales is that he's got a lion's heart in a 
sparrow's body," Stankie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales started breaking down during the L.A. Games. In his opening light 
flyweight bout against Kim Kwang-Sun of South Korea, he suffered three broken 
bones in his right hand. In his second bout, against Uganda's William Boganzo, 
Gonzales suffered a dislocated right elbow and shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his third-round victory over Great Britain's Jim Lyon, Gonzales 
suffered a broken toe jogging. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing could detour him from the gold. It was this relentlessness Stankie 
saw in the 9-year-old PeeWee fighter who would continue to throw haymakers even 
after getting knocked down. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Olympic title fight, Gonzales dragged assorted parts into the ring and 
took the gold by default when Salvatore Todisco of Italy appeared with a cast 
on his hand, the result of a broken thumb suffered in his semifinal bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales' pro career was derailed for nearly a year by post-Olympic hand 
surgery. And after that, there were more doctor than fight bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Some boxers have hands of stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul's are more like a piano player's," Chargin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales suffered a broken left hand in 1986. In 1987, he suffered a knee 
injury after somehow running his Corvette over his own leg. In 1988, he 
suffered a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ring, he scored modest successes, winning the North American Boxing 
Federation's flyweight title in his third fight. In 1988, as a bantamweight, he 
won the World Boxing Assn.'s Intercontinental championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales remains the only man ever to have beaten Orlando Canizales. He 
defeated him in a 1986 non-title bout, then Canizales, the reigning 
International Boxing Federation bantamweight champion, avenged the loss in a 
1990 rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales' career has mostly been disappointments and postponements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've cried myself to sleep asking God why," Gonzales says. "What did I do 
that was so wrong that every time I hit somebody, I break something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales took calcium pills and other concoctions in vain attempts to 
strengthen his bones. He still holds out hope that he will be able to continue 
without hearing something snap. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the course of an interview ostensibly about his future, Gonzales starts 
slipping into the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in that ring, uh, I mean when I'm in that ring, I'm poetry in 
motion," he says. "I don't care who you are, I'll beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 Because expectations were so high, the Gonzales story often loses context. 
Once, he was a kid headed nowhere fast. The oldest of eight children, his 
father out of the picture, Gonzales followed a familiar path to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 There could have been worse endings. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gonzales needs reminding, he makes the short trip to the Coliseum to 
literally feel his name, chiseled in stone for posterity along with those of 
other Olympic champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, he goes to the bank and gets his gold medal from a safe-deposit box. In 
his post-Olympic delirium, the gold medal never left Gonzales' neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a shower with it," he recalls. "Went swimming with it, went to bed 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he visits it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gold belongs in a bank, right?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hollenbeck Youth Center, children still stand in line for his 
autograph, as though he had won the gold medal last week. None care that 
Gonzales did not "live up to expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales takes his time with signature seekers, personalizing each request 
with a special message of inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 In moments of self-pity, Gonzales fingers the back of his head and remembers 
how it might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got these little knots, scars," he says. "From the buckshot." 
</P>
<P>
 He was riding in a car, a young gangster, when a shotgun blast nearly killed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit the window and ricocheted," he says, explaining his good fortune. "Or 
else I'd be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Because he is not, Gonzales can devote his days to motivational speaking and 
drug-prevention campaigns. His words ring true in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales lived to answer the knock at his door not long ago. Before him stood 
a teen-ager he had never met, who asked only that he might hug the boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here,' " Gonzales says. "He 
said he had been in and out of prison, involved in gangs, that he had been 
shot, but got away (from the gangs). He said, 'If Paul Gonzales can do it, I 
can do it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It choked me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales never wore a world championship belt, but can still be found most 
days working out at the youth center where he was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't forget where I come from," Gonzales says. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings the subject back to De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people who live around him and they tell me, 'He's forgotten who he 
is,' " Gonzales says. " 'He comes around the neighborhood flashing his money, 
or comes in a limo. What was he trying to do, show us that he's better than us? 
He's no better than us.' They tell me, and it makes me feel good, they say, 
'Paul, you never forgot where you came from.' " 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, sensing perhaps he has little to gain in this sparring match, 
refuses to enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the gold-medal winner and that inspired me," De La Hoya says of 
Gonzales. "It does bother me and I'm a bit frustrated, because I have nothing 
against him. He's a nice guy and everything, and hopefully one day we can get 
along. It could be jealousy. It could be a lot of things. I don't know what 
he's feeling. I just hope we can be friends again. Because I don't like having 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gonzales is not going to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of an adjective-packed interview -- peppered with the usual 
boxing bravado and bombast -- Gonzales at last lowers his head in a Hollenbeck 
Youth Center office and concedes that he is, indeed, finished. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans, in fact, to announce his retirement Thursday at the Amateur Athletic 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won the gold medal on Aug. 11," he says softly. "I started my professional 
career on Aug. 11. And I'm definitely going to make my retirement announcement 
Aug. 11." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cop and the Kid gave it their best shot. Aimed high and fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will say of Paul, 'Well, he never really made it,' " Stankie says. 
"But that's kind of relative, isn't it? Look at the other kids in the project 
who are in jail, or dead. Or working in shops. Well, did he make it or didn't 
he make it?" 
</P>
<P>
 The talk about comebacks has been boxing bluster. And denial. Like a balloon 
with a slow leak, Gonzales bounded about the room for a spell but eventually 
ran out of air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to fight, that's why I'm procrastinating," Gonzales explains. "Aug. 11 
is just around the corner. I've still got time." 
</P>
<P>
 After that? 
</P>
<P>
 "It will definitely be permanent, that's why I'm procrastinating," he says of 
his retirement plans. "But once I make the announcement, it's over. Ten years. 
Full circle. Closed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales has one request for his farewell at the AAF. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a torch there. What I want to do is have it lighted when I go 
there. Then, I want to turn it off. Just for that day."

PLAYERS VOW READINESS FOR A LONG STRIKE; BASEBALL: PANIC DISMISSED AS TALKS 
RESUME TODAY WITH A COMPROMISE UNLIKELY.

<P>
 The offices of the owners' Player Relations Committee and those of the Major 
League Baseball Players Assn. are only a few blocks apart in midtown Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 The distance separating the two groups in the stalemated collective bargaining 
negotiations, however, is as large as the island itself. There also are sizable 
differences in the groups' perceptions of whether the owners or players would 
experience the most economic pressure in a long strike by the players, who are 
virtually certain to go out after Thursday's games, observing their Friday 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anyone thinks the players will panic after a week or two (on strike), I've 
got some bridges I'll sell them," Don Fehr, the union's executive director, 
said Tuesday when a negotiating session on non-economic issues was canceled by 
the PRC. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, attorneys for the groups met to discuss the mechanics of a shutdown, 
underscoring the likelihood that today's resumption of talks on the owners' 
pivotal salary cap proposal will fail to yield an 11th-hour compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The union remains ideologically opposed to a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll fight it for as long as it takes," Fehr said again. 
</P>
<P>
 The players also remain unconvinced that the industry is experiencing economic 
problems that would necessitate a compensation system the union contends would 
destroy free agency and transfer millions of dollars from players to owners, 
leaving the players to pay back the big-market clubs for agreeing to share 
revenue with the smaller-market teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Insisting again that the owners are merely looking for "cost certainty" and 
should not have to prove poverty to get it, chief negotiator Richard Ravitch 
said that not one owner has called "to suggest a modification in our proposal. 
No one is panicking about the cost of funding a strike. Everyone has a plan. 
Everyone has credit available. There's enough (credit left in a $260-million 
line the clubs opened with a bank consortium in 1992) so that any club having a 
cash-flow problem could acquire short-term relief." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, however, would take a big hit from the loss of attendance revenue 
down the stretch. They also have about $140 million in postseason TV revenue at 
stake. Nevertheless, Ravitch said the long-term pressure is on the 600-plus 
players who would be unsigned for 1995, uncertain where they would live and 
play in 1995 and, it could be added, almost certain to face a new system, 
unilaterally implemented by the owners if there is no agreement by October. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, however, appear well prepared for a battle. With an average 
salary of $1.2 million, they can't be compared to a blue-collar union. They 
have an undefeated labor history and the resources to withstand a long 
stoppage, including a $175-million strike fund built on licensing revenue over 
the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The first checks, Fehr said Tuesday, will be mailed Sept. 15, the date the 
players would otherwise be receiving their salary checks, if a strike starts 
Friday. Obviously, the union didn't pick that date out of the blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he has never given the players reason to believe a strike would end 
quickly and that if some owners believe it would end quickly, "they are being 
pressured by other owners into believing it."  
</P>
<P>
 Ravitch said Tuesday that it would be "a Kafkaesque act of self-immolation" if 
baseball went through the off-season without an agreement, but Fehr said that 
to accept a salary cap would be peace at any price, comparing it to Neville 
Chamberlain's giving away the Sudetenland to Hitler in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
 The rhetoric seemed appropriate. Baseball, too, appears on the verge of 
another war, this one between the billionaires and millionaires.

FORTNER WANTS TO REACH AN ELUSIVE FINISH LINE; CYCLING: AN ESTABLISHED ROAD 
RACER, HE CONSIDERS ANOTHER SHOT AT COMPLETING THE RACE ACROSS AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Scott Fortner sees a map of the United States, his eyes invariably turn 
to West Virginia, his mind drifts to a foggy night on the Blue Ridge Parkway 
and the haunting question: Why on earth did I stop? 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner, a 28-year-old Laguna Niguel resident, had spent 10 days cycling 2,800 
miles in the 1985 Race Across America and was about 450 miles away from 
Atlantic City, N.J., and the finish of a grueling event. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he reached West Virginia's rolling mountains, Fortner's emotions 
began to fluctuate with the terrain. He was physically exhausted, mentally 
drained, and the limited visibility made the ride even more daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't tell whether I was going uphill or downhill," Fortner recalled. "I 
was just miserable. The crew suggested I sleep for a few hours and then 
continue, but I didn't care how close to the finish I was. I just wanted to 
stop riding." 
</P>
<P>
 So he did. Fortner returned to Southern California and successfully switched 
gears from ultra-marathon cycling to the road-racing circuit, joining the few 
elite American riders who earn a living in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Fortner was flying home from a road race July 31, he read an article 
about the start of Race Across America in Irvine that weekend. It reminded him 
of some unfinished business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, when I look at a map and see how close West Virginia is to Atlantic 
City, I realize that I should have just finished that race," Fortner said. 
"That's one reason I'd like to go back and do it. It's a scary thing, but it's 
such a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner, who grew up in El Monte, is strongly considering entering this fall's 
John Marino Open, an 800-mile race through the deserts and mountains of Arizona 
that serves as a Race Across America qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 He first competed in the Marino Open in 1984 and won the race as a 19-year-old 
in 1985. The 1994 road-racing season ends in early October, so it wouldn't be 
much of a conflict to ride in this year's Marino Open, but Fortner would have 
to leave the Saturn Cycling Team -- and his regular paycheck -- to compete in 
the 1995 Race Across America. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to do it again, but it's such a financial strain," Fortner said. 
"Ten years ago I needed $10,000 to do the race, and you probably need a lot 
more now. Plus, you have to find your own sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner hasn't had to worry much about financial details the last five years. 
He was a member of Paris-based Team Bonnat in 1990 and '91, competing in 
Europe, Asia, South America and Central America. In 1992, the 5-foot-10, 
155-pound Fortner joined the Michigan-based Saturn Cycling team, which now has 
10 male and three female riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner, an alternate on the 1992 U.S. Olympic road-racing team, rides 15,000 
to 18,000 miles and competes in 80 to 90 races a year throughout the country. 
His expenses are paid for, he receives a salary and Saturn team members share 
the prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 The top U.S. Cycling Federation riders earn between $50,000 and $100,000 a 
year, but only 40 to 50 are believed to be in that bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make what baseball players make," Fortner said, "but it's a pretty 
good living." 
</P>
<P>
 While competing overseas, Fortner won races in France, Belgium, Italy, Spain, 
England, and Japan. But his career was nearly cut short when he was sideswiped 
by a car on a country road south of Paris in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner's left elbow was shattered and he lost feeling in two fingers of his 
left hand for several weeks. A three-inch pin was placed in the elbow, and 
Fortner could not ride for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived (in Southern California) all my life and never got hit by a car on 
these busy roads," Fortner said. "Then I'm out in the middle of nowhere in 
France, I don't see a car for at least an hour, and that's the one that hits 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner recovered, returned to the United States and had his best professional 
season in 1992, winning 15 races. He has won only three races this season but 
has been concentrating on different goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more of a team rider, someone who sacrifices his chances and times for 
the benefit of the team," Fortner said. "For a criterium race, where you go 
around a small circuit a number of times, it's my job to break away and win or 
set up our sprinter. I would stay in front of him, let him follow my draft and 
then slingshot by me in the last 300 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a longer race, I might try to bring a lead pack closer to the rest of the 
group by going to the front, riding hard and letting everyone sit in my draft." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fortner has showed he can ride with the best by placing fifth at the 
U.S. Pro Nationals, the premier road race in this country, June 5 at 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortner, who hopes to compete in the 1996 Olympics, was the second American to 
finish at the U.S. Pro, behind San Diego's Steve Hegg, who was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an individual sport but it's also a team sport," Fortner said. "If you 
have the strength you can change the outcome of a race, but it's also tactical. 
You can be the strongest rider but that won't guarantee you the win." 
</P>
<P>
 Those cut-throat tactics weren't a part of Race Across America. Fortner 
remembers the camaraderie of that event -- riders giving others water or food, 
helping with equipment or passing advice -- and longs to experience it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was because I was a teen-ager at the time, but the other 
riders seemed to look after me and give me encouragement," Fortner said. "Now 
that I'm older, I think I should go back." 
</P>
<P>
 And finish.

RAMS' WRIGHT EAGER TO LEARN, GROW INTO A STARTER; FOOTBALL: SAFETY IS PROJECTED 
TO BE A KEY PLAYER, BUT A FEW THINGS NEED POLISHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox describes rookie Toby Wright as a "human missile," a 
search-and-destroy strong safety who's projected to be a key defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Wright is second-string behind Deral Boykin -- a sixth-round pick 
last season who has yet to start a regular-season game -- as he tries to learn 
the Rams' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't expect to come in here and be handed the job without understanding 
what the team does," Wright said. "I just got here, so I'm not expecting the 
whole kitchen right away." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams invested a second-round draft pick in Wright in April. They projected 
him as their starter this season after allowing starting strong safety Michael 
Stewart to escape via free-agency to Miami and backup Pat Terrell to sign with 
the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was coming into a good position, and it still looks good now," 
Wright said. "When I was drafted here, I knew Stewart had left and Terrell was 
about to leave, so I had to come in and learn my stuff as quick as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 But learning the defense has been a slow, tedious and sometimes frustrating 
process for the former Nebraska defensive back. Coming from the run-oriented 
Big Eight Conference, Wright is getting a crash course in pass coverage in his 
first training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, learning the defense has been my toughest adjustment," Wright said. "So 
has learning technique and other people's responsibilities within the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has been the biggest step for me -- understanding that my talent alone 
isn't going to take me anywhere. Everybody at this level is an all-star. So you 
have to have that extra know-how, technique and understanding your 
responsibilities just to compete. You have to be accountable for your 
position." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have had to show patience with rookies before. Last season, rookie 
tight end Troy Drayton struggled to learn Ernie Zampese's offense, sulked when 
the ball didn't come his way and grew frustrated as the season progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But assistant head coach Joe Vitt, who's in charge of the safeties, has been 
pleased with Wright's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a rap on Tony coming out of college that maybe he wasn't a quick 
learner and couldn't learn our defense," Vitt said. "Toby made no mental errors 
last week and makes very few mistakes in practice. He's an aware, intelligent 
football player, period." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing holding him back, except for what holds any new guy back -- 
learning the system, understanding the personnel in the league and getting 
grooved in." 
</P>
<P>
 So when will Wright be ready to start? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows?" Vitt said. "I just can't look in a crystal ball and tell you. 
Every day we're evaluating and putting in new things. As long as he works hard 
on improving his technique and skills, he'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright came off the bench and played the second quarter of the Rams' 14-6 
exhibition loss to Green Bay on Saturday. He didn't have a tackle on defense, 
but had one on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got some time," Wright said. "But there just wasn't any big action coming 
my way. I got one pretty good hit on special teams, though. I know I can 
contribute there." 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, Wright is the most impressive safety in the Rams' camp. He is 5 
feet 11, 203 pounds, and has an upper body that looks like it was carved from a 
block of marble. 
</P>
<P>
 After transferring from Phoenix Junior College to Nebraska in 1992, Wright 
earned a reputation as the Big Eight's most feared run-stopper, finishing 
second on the team in tackles with 79 (43 solo). 
</P>
<P>
 With Wright's versatility in the backfield and defensive end Trev Alberts' 
speed up front, Nebraska switched from its 5-2 defensive formation to a 4-3 
version, similar to what the Rams run, for the first time in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put me at rover in that scheme because I could blitz, play like a 
linebacker and cover like a safety," he said. "That's the first time they had 
tried anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' light-hitting practices haven't exactly given Wright a chance to 
show what he does best -- plow over people. Twice coaches have warned Wright 
for popping a running back in light-contact or no-contact drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's killing me," he said. "I got yelled at about it a couple times but I 
understand that. We have valuable players and we don't want to lose them 
because of any crazy collisions."

BRYANS MEET THEIR MATCH; SINCE BEING ALLOWED TO PLAY EACH OTHER AFTER TURNING 
16, IDENTICAL TWINS ARE NEARLY EVEN IN FIRST SEVEN MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The idea makes Wayne Bryan's stomach churn. But the possibility looms that his 
sons, Bob and Mike Bryan, will face each other Sunday in the most significant 
tennis match of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Mike, 16-year-old identical twins, are seeded third and fourth in the 
United States Tennis Assn. Boys' 16-and-under National Championships in 
Kalamazoo, Mich., and have advanced to today's fourth round. The boys from 
Camarillo are on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectators at Kalamazoo College's Stowe Stadium might delight at such a 
sight. But Wayne Bryan recoils when his sons battle for such high stakes, 
knowing how competitive they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in practice it gets a little rough between them," said Wayne, a teaching 
pro at Cabrillo Racquet Club in Somis. "We've had some matches at the club 
where I've wanted to call out the National Guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, the father/coach never allowed his sons -- long considered 
one of the best junior doubles teams in the country in their age group -- to 
play each other in singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's intent was to develop Bob and Mike equally and not let one boy eclipse 
the other, psychologically or emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I was competitive with my own brother -- we fought like cats and 
dogs," Wayne said. "And twins, I have found, are incredibly competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Family policy prohibited the twins from clashing until age 16. The only 
exception was practice, where the two often sparred in private and were told 
never to discuss the outcome at the dinner table. But Wayne knew his sons went 
at each other like tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were younger, we always used to get in fights when we played," Bob 
said. "It's not a normal match. Sometimes there's a little tension. But now we 
get along better on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Off the court, Wayne and wife Kathy have kept the twins busy as musicians. 
Mike (drums), Bob (keyboards) and Wayne (guitar and vocals) form an oldies rock 
'n' roll group. "The Bryan Bros.," as they call themselves, sometimes entertain 
at tournament dinners. The Bryan credo has always been let's play together . 
</P>
<P>
 From the time the two started playing in junior tournaments at 8, Mike and Bob 
would alternate defaulting when their names met on a tournament draw sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big tournaments don't like us to do that," Bob said. "There's a lot of 
fans here and they want to see us play." 
</P>
<P>
 In battle, Mike sometimes finds the striking resemblance of his twin 
unnerving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's like I'm out there playing myself, we know each other's games 
so well," he said. "It's like playing a backboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike has won four of the seven matches the two have played this year, and his 
feelings afterward are always mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt good (when I've won), but I kind of felt bad for him losing," Mike 
said. "I always want Bob to win and he always wants me to win. (But when I 
lost), I felt bad . . . really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point had come for the Bryans -- and the timing is probably right. 
</P>
<P>
 Together and individually, the Bryans have won 11 national tournaments and 
four Southern California titles. The twins are seeded No. 1 in doubles in this 
week's nationals and are considered the best 16-and-under doubles team in the 
USTA juniors program. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 8, they won the Southern California boys' 10 doubles championship and 
were ranked No. 2 in the nation. They have repeated as section champions three 
times since and have never fallen from the top 10. They recently captured their 
third national clay court doubles championship, the USTA Boys' 16s. 
</P>
<P>
 Few challenges have eluded the Bryans, particularly in doubles. In singles, 
each has won tournaments on the junior national circuit. But neither has won 
the Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kalamazoo is definitely the most important tournament," Mike said. "All the 
college coaches will be watching." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bryans, who will be juniors at Rio Mesa High next fall, won't have to deal 
with college recruiters for another year. But many believe they could win in 
the college ranks right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Smith, the former USC standout who won singles championships at the U.S. 
Open and Wimbledon, won't argue. He thinks the Bryans have a professional 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that would prevent that is if they lose their enthusiasm for 
the game or if they aren't able to develop some real weapons," said Smith, 
associate director of player development for the USTA. "But I really believe 
they've got a great future." 
</P>
<P>
 The only attribute lacking at this point, Smith said, is physical maturity. 
The Bryans are still skinny boys. Mike, a right-hander, is 5-feet-9 1/2 and 115 
pounds. Bob, left-handed, is 5-8 3/4, 110 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have the offensive skills that they will when they get stronger," 
Smith said. "But they've got good hands, good instincts and they've been able 
to compete against the big guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Saviano, director of coaching of men's tennis in the USTA Player 
Development program, saw enough potential in the Bryans to send them in June on 
a four-week tour of European tournaments with other top U.S. juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely have the potential to play professional tennis," Saviano 
said. "They're awfully good in every respect of the game: Knowledge, mechanics, 
competitiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Three International Tennis Federation junior tournaments in Italy and one in 
France provided another turning point for the Bryans. Not only did the tour 
expose them to the world's best age-group competition, it marked the first time 
the twins had been separated from their parents for more than 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys returned to the U.S. improved players and more mature people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how to get around now," Bob said. "I ate on my own. I usually have my 
mom and dad telling me, 'You have to eat now. You have to have pasta.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, they took their lumps. Neither player advanced past the 
quarterfinals in singles. A first-round, 7-5, 7-6 (8-6) loss to Poland's 
Phillip Aniola in Torino, Italy, still sticks in Bob's craw. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have beaten him easily on a hard court," Bob said. "That kind of woke 
me up. You definitely have to get tough back there, because these guys are 
nasty. They're big, they're strong, they try to intimidate you. The Europeans 
are born on that red clay. There's no clay in California." 
</P>
<P>
 But the experience quickly paid off. Two weeks after returning home, the 
Bryans won the USTA National Clay Court tournament in Nashville, Tenn. In the 
July 24 doubles final, they defeated Alex Kim of Potomac, Md., and Nick Crowell 
of Amarillo, Tex., 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bryans, for the sake of change, occasionally will play with different 
doubles partners. They played separately in Europe, Mike playing with Kevin Kim 
of Fullerton and Bob teaming with Keith Brill of Columbia, S.C. The Bryan-Kim 
tandem reached the semifinals in two of the four tournaments. Wayne Bryan said 
the temporary split was nothing more than a breath of fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a change of pace," he said. "There's a lot of pressure playing with 
your brother. Everybody's out to beat the Bryans. But what Mike realized is Bob 
is the best partner for him in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 But now a great singles rivalry between the two is developing -- a situation 
Wayne stalled for as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing everyone asks Mike and Bob is, 'Which one are you?' and 
'Which one's the best?' " Wayne said. "We didn't want one to get labeled the 
better one and one to get labeled the lesser one ." 
</P>
<P>
 With the old policy outdated, Wayne has set down new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if they meet in a tournament final, once it's over we do not discuss it 
one way or the other," Wayne said. "We try to de-emphasize that match. The big 
thing was getting to the final -- not winning the final over your brother." 
</P>
<P>
 The result so far has been a best-case scenario. Neither Mike nor Bob has 
established dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four and three, to me, is they're dead even," Wayne said. "But it's tough. 
(You feel) there's no excuse if you lose to your twin."

TUIMOLOAU'S COLLEGE WILL BE CLOSER TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dolores Tuimoloau, state shotput champion last season at Channel Islands High, 
expects to attend Ventura College in the fall because she failed to satisfy 
NCAA academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau said in June that she wanted to attend USC, which had offered a 
scholarship. But she scored 680 on her only attempt at the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test, 20 points under the standard required for freshman athletic eligibility 
at the Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sort of saw that I wasn't ready to go to a big university so I wasn't 
heartbroken or anything," Tuimoloau said. "A two-year college might be the best 
place for me to mature for now." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Allice, USC's newly appointed director of men's and women's track, said 
the Trojan program would have benefited from Tuimoloau's talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any freshman who comes in with a best of 49 feet in the shot is a big-time 
talent," Allice said. "With those credentials, she probably would have had a 
good chance at placing in the NCAA (championships) as a freshman." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, whose personal best of 49 feet 2 inches ties her for seventh on the 
all-time state list, is looking forward to working with Ventura assistant Dave 
Laut. 
</P>
<P>
 Laut was the bronze medalist in the shotput in the 1984 Olympic Games and 
ranks fourth on the all-time United States list with a best of 72-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a coach who not only knew a lot about the technical aspects of 
throwing, but about the mental aspects of competing as well," Tuimoloau said. 
"Obviously, he does." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Laut's first tasks will be to put Tuimoloau on a rigorous 
weight-lifting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her accomplishments in high school career, which also includes a 
Ventura County record of 145 feet in the discus, Tuimoloau has done very little 
weight training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lifted some during basketball season, but not at all during track," she 
said. "I just worked on my technique."

 SPACE ON BOARD: Metrolink is losing passengers, but not patience. Although 
ridership in August on the Santa Clarita line has fallen to a daily average of 
2,900, compared to 3,600 in July, board member Jan Heidt says it's too early to 
blame solely on last month's reopening of the Golden State-Antelope Valley 
freeway interchange. . . . "All the other lines are down, too," she said. 
"People go on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 BAILING OUT: If the show, indeed, must go on at Glendale's Alex Theatre, 
someone else will have to raise the curtains. The Theatre Corp. of America says 
it can't afford to produce two future musicals (F10). . . . The Alex, which 
opened in 1925, is no stranger to making drama off stage, either. It survived a 
fire in 1948, and there was talk of demolition in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 HANDICAP: Golfers, of course, aren't known as fashion models, but the latest 
addition to their wardrobe is a little strange, even by their standards. It's a 
white hood (above), which many buy at Griffith Park courses to fight off the 
gnats that seem to come from everywhere (B1). . . . Golfers are usually pretty 
obsessed, but business at Griffith Park is down 10% to 15% recently. 
</P>
<P>
 HANDY LADY: Mayling Wu deserves a hand. After all, she did so well with the 
last one she got. Actually, it was a human cadaver's hand, which the Studio 
City teen-ager dissected at the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia 
(B2). . . . Although worried that it might be a "nerd camp," she said, it 
turned out to be a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK IN THE BAY: Russell White, a standout tailback at Crespi High and Cal, 
went right to the pros as a Rams' third-round pick last season. But he gained 
only 10 yards in two carries and was inactive the last 10 games of the season. 
This year, he was cut the day he reported to camp (C6). . . . . Now he may be 
back on track: Reports from San Francisco indicate the 49ers may invite him to 
a tryout next week. Michael Arkush

STEPSON CONVICTED IN MURDER-FOR-HIRE OF 'LOBSTER BOY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury convicted the so-called Lobster Boy's stepson Tuesday of hiring a hit 
man to kill the claw-handed carnival performer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Glenn Newman, 20, himself a "Human Blockhead" who hammered nails into 
his nostrils on the sideshow circuit, quietly sobbed as he heard the 
verdicts.The jury rejected his arguments that killing Grady Stiles Jr., 55, was 
a last resort to protect his mother, Mary Stiles, from abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman was found guilty of first-degree murder and murder conspiracy, which 
carries a mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole for 25 years. 
Circuit Judge Donald C. Evans set sentencing for Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 In her trial last month, Mary Stiles, 56, claimed she was a battered wife and 
was convicted on the lesser charge of manslaughter. Triggerman Christopher 
Wyant, 19, was convicted last year of second-degree murder and is serving 27 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Stiles and Newman paid Wyant $1,500 to shoot Stiles twice in the back of 
the head two years ago in his trailer.

DANA PARSONS: STUCK IN NEUTRAL WHILE A COUPLE OF FRIENDS HIT THE SKIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend Mary had a problem, seemingly without a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 She liked Dave and Dave liked her, but she couldn't be seen walking with him 
in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "How come?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taller than he is," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed she was, by a couple inches or so, but that's what she got for being 14 
when he was only 13 and coming from a long line of short Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 I put on my Tom Sawyer thinking cap and came up with an idea. "When you're 
walking with him, why don't you let him walk on the sidewalk and you step off 
the curb and walk in the street?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mary lit up like a Christmas tree at the unbridled genius of the idea and 
added her own wrinkle of always going barefoot when they were together. I don't 
think Dave was ever the wiser, although he thought it was strange that Mary 
"always walks in the gutter." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm recalling Dave and Mary (they never lasted, by the way) with much 
fondness, only because their problem in that summer of 1963 now resounds with 
such sweet simplicity. Why didn't we realize what a grand life it was when our 
greatest problem was how to resolve height differentials? 
</P>
<P>
 I say that after recent go-rounds with grown-up friends caught in a 
post-divorce squall that has left me spent, despondent and questioning my 
skills as a problem-solver. It was a talent I once took for granted, but as 
Bonnie Raitt asks in a song, "When did the choices get so hard?" 
</P>
<P>
 Late-night phone calls with them. Mid-day phone calls, morning phone calls. 
Wall Street arbitragers don't spend this much time on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't divulge the details of their ongoing arguing, but you all know the 
general story line: Boy meets girl . . . they laugh constantly . . . they fall 
in love . . . they fall out of love . . . they stop laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut to final scene: Take no prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 I talk to him for an hour or so and he tells me how unreasonable she is. 
"She'll sound perfectly sane to you on the phone, but trust me, she's crazy," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 I talk to her on the phone and she talks, sounding alternately mournful and 
defiant, about how he's gone "off the deep end." 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's exactly what he says about you," I say, exasperatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 She brings up an incident that occurred a few months ago, just to give me an 
idea of how troubled he is. She describes a situation that makes him sound 
awful. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time I talk to him, I ask him about it and he describes it totally 
differently. "You've known me for a long time," he says. "You just have to 
believe I'm telling you the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 When I talk to her, she says, "You've known us both for a long time. Whose 
story sounds more believable?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That exactly what he said," I tell her. "The exact same language." 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever known him to lie?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, no," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," she says, sounding as if she's genuinely pained by my ignorance, "he 
lies. He lies." 
</P>
<P>
 "You see the problem," I tell her, "when two people I've known for this long 
give me different stories about the same situation?" 
</P>
<P>
 "One of us is lying," she says. "You'll just have to figure out which one it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 He tells me over and over that she's getting advice from a "man-hating woman 
lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 She says he needs counseling but refuses to get it. When I say she was the one 
who dropped out of joint counseling, she says, "That's because the therapist 
came out of the men's movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Beautiful. She has a man-hating lawyer and he had a woman-hating therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 I tell the two of them that they're not giving me much to go on. In my 
naivete, however, I think I see room for compromise. This must be how Arafat 
and Rabin do business, I'm thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 I run my compromise idea past them in separate conversations. If you'll do 
this, maybe she'll do that, I say to him. And vice-versa to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not feeling too generous," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 I mention it to her and she says, "I'm not feeling very charitable, given the 
way he's acted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once upon a time, these people could talk to each other. Once upon a time, I 
could mediate little disputes between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the line, the animosity either overwhelmed them, or I've lost 
all my negotiating skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling very impotent," I say to him as we wrap up our last conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, I'm still on speaking terms with both of them after these 
conversations. They both thank me for trying to help. 
</P>
<P>
 They're missing the point. I don't want to get paid for trying. I want to get 
paid for results. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Dave and Mary, where are you? 
</P>
<P>
 Please, Mary, come find me and tell me how brilliant I was at solving your 
problem. If only for a moment, I want to feel useful again. 
</P>

OXNARD WILL ATTEMPT TO ANNEX AREA OF HARBOR; POLITICS: CRITICS CONTEND THE MOVE 
IS PART OF A CITY PLOT TO ACQUIRE THE BEACH AREAS SURROUNDING THE MARINA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard has decided to move forward with a plan to annex the water area of the 
Channel Islands Harbor, dismissing charges that the city's true motive is to 
eventually acquire Silver Strand and other beach areas surrounding the marina. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council decided Tuesday to seek approval to annex the water area of 
the Channel Islands Harbor -- currently an unincorporated part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard leaders said the plan is intended to reduce confusion over who provides 
fire, police and other services to the county-owned and operated harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Ventura County officials have charged that money is the true motive. 
The proposal would also bring the city an extra $100,000 annually -- or about 
20% of the $500,000 in property tax revenue collected from docks and boats at 
the popular marina. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John K. Flynn, whose district includes the harbor, said the 
plan may be the beginning of an aggressive power play by cash-starved Oxnard -- 
one he vows to block. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city may be interested in annexing all of the beach areas," said 
Flynn, who was upset that he had not been contacted by Oxnard about the 
proposal. "It's hard for me to believe that they would only go after the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the Channel Islands Beach Community Services District, comprised of 
Silver Strand, Hollywood by-the-Sea and Hollywood beaches, voiced similar 
concerns after Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the community likes the separation (from Oxnard)," said Marcia 
Marcus, one of the district's five directors. "What I'm concerned about is that 
this is a move to take us over." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard J. Maggio, Oxnard's community development director, strongly rejected 
those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interest is only in the water, period," Maggio said. "We're not 
interested in anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said the city would have been much more tactful if annexing 
the beaches was its true goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were planning on annexing Silver Strand and Hollywood beaches, this 
would be a horrible way to do it," Lopez said. "If you want to annex an area, 
you have to make sure that an area wants to be annexed." 
</P>
<P>
 The water area of the harbor -- along with the beach areas -- is included in 
Oxnard's sphere of influence as approved by the Ventura County Local Agency 
Formation Commission, a state agency that deals with jurisdictional matters, 
Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation still has to be approved by LAFCO now that Oxnard has moved 
forward with the plan, however -- and that may not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who is chairman of the five-member LAFCO board, said the city simply 
does not have the votes on the board to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk and city council members from Thousand Oaks and 
Ventura are also on the commission, along with a fifth member who holds no 
elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard has hired Bob Braitman, a former executive director of LAFCO, to write 
the city's annexation proposal and guide it through. 
</P>
<P>
 If Braitman is successful, he will receive 10% of the city's first-year 
revenues from the harbor, or about $10,000. But he will not be paid anything if 
the plan is rejected, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braitman dismissed charges that Oxnard intends to annex the beach area as 
"conspiracy theories." 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands Harbor covers more than 300 acres of land and water. The 
county spent $1 million to dig the harbor and borrowed another $7 million over 
the years to pay for improvements since the marina opened in 1965. The county 
leases most of the surrounding land to developers, who have built restaurants, 
condominiums, and about 3,600 boat slips.

COACH SUSPENDED OVER SEXUAL ALLEGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura High School football coach has been suspended on allegations that he 
had sex with students, the third coach from that school and the fourth teacher 
in the district to face such accusations over the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bret Taylor, a history teacher at Balboa Middle School and assistant football 
and junior varsity baseball coach at Ventura High, was suspended without pay 
July 26 for allegedly having sex with two students and kissing and dating 
others over a three-year period ending in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said no criminal charges have been filed against Taylor, but Ventura 
Unified School District officials said they are taking steps to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, school officials said Tuesday that they have launched an 
investigation of another male high school teacher, who is suspected of engaging 
in improper sexual behavior with students. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations against that teacher -- who has not yet faced disciplinary 
action -- arose when students recently volunteered information about him to 
district officials, Supt. Joseph Spirito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of the 28-year-old Taylor stemmed from student interviews 
last fall and early this year about another Ventura High coach, Dale Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn, a swim coach and chemistry teacher, was suspended last fall on suspicion 
of having sex with students. He was never charged criminally. But he resigned 
in June under an agreement with the school district that he would forfeit his 
state teaching credential in exchange for a year's salary. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Ventura High head football Coach Harvey Kochel was forced to resign 
and later was convicted of having sex with a 15-year-old student. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bryan Bowman, a special education teacher at E.P. Foster School in 
Ventura, was suspended last fall on allegations that he fondled and engaged in 
other improper behavior with his students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school board President Diane Harriman said Tuesday that students are 
sometimes vulnerable to sexual advances by teachers because they tend to 
idolize them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Particularly coaches are put in this kind of idolized role," Harriman said. 
"I can't blame the girls. My biggest concern is inappropriate actions by people 
in a position of trust. It's too bad our kids are so naive, but it's too bad 
there are people that take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor began working in the Ventura district in 1989 and was a substitute 
teacher until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hired in fall 1991 to teach world civilization and boys' physical 
education at Cabrillo Middle School. In fall 1992, he moved to Balboa where he 
taught U.S. history, English and developmental reading. 
</P>
<P>
 While teaching at Balboa, Taylor also coached football and baseball at Ventura 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 In charges officials filed against Taylor last month with a Los Angeles 
administrative law judge, the district claims Taylor admitted that while he was 
a substitute teacher he kissed a Ventura High student on at least two 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor also admitted kissing another Ventura High student during the 1990-91 
school year while she was at his home working on a history report, according to 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also alleges that students have told school officials two girls 
confided to classmates that they had sex with Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police Sgt. Bob Anderson said Tuesday that detectives interviewed one 
of the girls named by the other students, and she refused to cooperate with 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't want to be involved," Anderson said. "She wanted this issue to go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's administrative hearing is set for Sept. 12 -- five days after the 
start of the fall semester -- at the school district headquarters in Ventura.

CITY MAPS RESTORATION OF ITS HISTORIC THEATER; FILLMORE: FILM COMMISSION WEIGHS 
RENOVATION PLAN TO RECOMMEND TO THE CITY FOR BRINGING LIFE BACK TO THE 
QUAKE-DAMAGED BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like so many landmarks in downtown Fillmore, the Towne Theater stands cracked 
and broken, a crumbling, boarded-up victim of the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Many neighboring buildings have been razed. Others are abandoned and decaying. 
</P>
<P>
 But with help from the Fillmore City Council and a $475,000 state historical 
preservation grant, a group of volunteers is working to renovate the 1916 
vaudeville house that later became a movie theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we can re-create some of that old magic, with silent films and 
the piano backstage," Councilman Scott Lee said. "It hasn't been done anywhere 
that I know of." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore Film Commission, which is overseeing the restoration effort, will 
meet tonight to decide on a renovation plan to recommend to the City Council. 
The city purchased the building for about $75,000 in May, fearing that the 
owner would otherwise demolish it because the damage was so extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The back wall of the theater collapsed during the quake and part of the roof 
fell in. The facade is cracked and needs major repairs. Officials believe that 
the grant money will cover structural repairs, and they plan a series of 
fund-raisers to finance the interior improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members hope to select an architect soon to draw up blueprints for 
the restoration, which is expected to take about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, they want to preserve the structure's historical integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are also considering the addition of modern-day improvements such as 
digital sound and an editing room, which would allow filmmakers who work in 
Fillmore to review what they shoot without leaving town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make it varied so it can do many things," Lee said, "like showing 
movies, live stage and other things complementing the movie industry here in 
town. . . . It has to be a diverse type of facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner John McKinnon said the theater restoration will lure even more 
producers and directors to the town of 12,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that attracts the film people is that it looks like 
Anytown, USA," said McKinnon, who heads the volunteer panel. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they earned more than $30,000 in permit fees last year, 
when films such as "Bitter Harvest" and television shows such as "Unsolved 
Mysteries" were shot in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructing a multiuse venue at the Towne Theater will only help the city's 
image as a movie-making center, Assistant City Manager Allan Coates said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's envisioned to be a working theater as well as a movie house, playhouse 
and for concerts," he said. "Using it as a place where directors can review 
their daily shoots will help too." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members have much to do before they reach their goal of dedicating 
the restored building. In addition to the structural repairs, the interior 
needs a major cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater kiosk still offers $4 adult seats for the evening showing of 
Beethoven's 2nd, the movie playing Jan. 16 -- the night before the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Reels of trailers for films such as "Schindler's List" and "Falling Down" are 
boxed in the lobby, where the aging projection equipment was moved after the 
quake. Hundreds of feet of unraveled celluloid lie tangled nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Months-old popcorn remains in the popper atop the 1930s-style snack bar, next 
to an unopened plastic bottle of root beer concentrate and three tall stacks of 
empty soda cups. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Lee's favorite proposals calls for a mix of motifs in the restored 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors might stroll in front of a 1940s-style marquee before entering a 
1930s-era lobby. Sections of seating inside the auditorium would run from 
1990s-type upholstery to the original World War I-era front rows. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Pat Askren toured the broken theater shell Tuesday, reminiscing 
about the 25-cent movies he watched as a boy growing up in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a main attraction for our town," said Askren, rummaging through piles of 
bricks behind the original stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it; there's not a lot to do here," he said. "If you don't want to 
go to a bar on Saturday nights, there's always a movie." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Although a $475,000 state historical preservation grant has been approved for 
structural renovations to the Towne Theater, the Fillmore Film Commission is 
seeking contributions to restore the building's interior. More than $14,000 has 
been received so far, and a series of fund-raisers is being planned. For 
information, call 524-0410.

FAMILY OF MAN KILLED BY POLICE SUES FOR $25 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a man shot to death by Oxnard police last year is seeking $25 
million in damages from the city of Oxnard and the officers involved, alleging 
in a federal lawsuit that he was illegally gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamon and Barbara Partee, the parents of Nicholas Partee, allege that four 
Oxnard police officers acted recklessly and had no legal grounds to kill their 
son Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is named as a co-defendant because police officials failed in their 
duty to properly train and supervise the officers, resulting in Partee's death, 
the suit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Partee's estranged wife, Lisa Marie Partee, and the couple's two 
children are also plaintiffs in the action, filed recently in U.S. District 
Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Police Chief Harold Hurtt declined comment on the suit and said that 
other members of his department could not discuss the pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities maintained last year that Nicholas Partee, a 35-year-old 
Oxnard construction worker, was shot several times by officers when he pointed 
a gun at them after a high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department conducted an investigation of the 
shooting because it occurred in the sheriff's jurisdiction. The findings were 
turned over to the district attorney's office, said Sgt. Mike Barnes of the 
major crimes division. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10 months after the shooting, however, county prosecutors have yet 
to report on whether the shooting was justified. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the agency took less than three months to investigate and issue a 
report on a fatal shooting in April by Oxnard police. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Barnes and Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin McGee declined to comment on 
findings in the Partee investigation, including whether Partee fired a 
.22-caliber handgun recovered from his car. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is taking no longer than usual in a complex case, McGee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor declined further comment until the district attorney's findings 
are made public in about two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see the report, it will be fairly evident why it took longer to 
complete," McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police shot and killed Nicholas Partee following a late-evening chase 
that began in southeast Oxnard and ended on a quiet Camarillo street. Before 
the chase, Partee's wife had called officers to her home in Oxnard because her 
husband had arrived, violating a court restraining order, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 When police approached Partee at a nearby convenience store, he fled and four 
Oxnard patrol cars chased him to Camarillo, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Partee then lost control of his vehicle and it spun 
to a stop on Oak Street. 
</P>
<P>
 There the officers fired their pistols more than 15 times, killing Partee, the 
complaint says. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not say how many times he was struck or which officers fired the fatal 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas Partee posed no threat to the officers, the complaint alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 But police last year said that Partee pointed a gun at officers and they shot 
him in self defense. Authorities would not say whether Partee fired his gun at 
the officers or whether he ever left his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt said Tuesday that the four officers were placed on paid leave after the 
shooting, but are all back on active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers are Terry Burr, Chris Orsini, Roger Sonsini and James Stallings.

PSYCHIATRIC EXAM ORDERED FOR THORNTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Scott Thornton, the Thousand Oaks man charged with murdering Westlake 
nurse Kellie O'Sullivan, must submit to an exam by a prosecution psychiatrist, 
a Ventura County judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath issued the ruling after prosecutors 
argued that they need the examination to be prepared if the defense makes an 
issue out of the 19-year-old defendant's psychological state during the trial, 
set to begin Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys, however, noted that they have not claimed that Thornton was 
not in his right mind when he allegedly killed O'Sullivan, the mother of a 
young son. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan Olson added that the prosecutors' request should 
only be granted if the defendant first brings up the subject of his mental 
condition, such as by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very surprised," Olson said outside court. "I don't think there is any 
precedent for granting such a motion at this stage in the proceeding." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said she did not expect McGrath to grant the motion, but refused to say 
whether she would order her client to refuse to cooperate with the doctor, who 
has not been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not put Mr. Thornton's mental status in issue at this time," she 
said. "So any order to have him tested by a prosecution psychiatric expert is 
premature." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors said the judge made the right call by granting their request. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said it is better to have Thornton 
undergo the psychiatric examination at this point in the case instead of later, 
at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a certainty that the defense is going to have a psychiatric examination 
so they can use it, and we need one to respond," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton is charged with murder, kidnaping and a special circumstance that 
could send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan, who disappeared Sept. 14, was shot three times by someone who 
dumped her body in the Santa Monica Mountains, where it was found 12 days 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was arrested Sept. 19 in Reno.  
</P>
<P>
 He was in possession of O'Sullivan's Ford Explorer truck and a handgun, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has admitted taking the nurse's truck, they said, but denied ever seeing 
O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 He told detectives he found the truck outside a Thousand Oaks pet shop and 
took it because the keys were inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers normally have their clients tested by psychologists and 
psychiatrists in capital-punishment cases to mitigate any conviction they might 
receive during the guilt phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors testify about their findings during the penalty phase -- the 
hearing in which a jury decides whether the defendant either should be put to 
death or placed behind bars forever. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Thornton case, defense attorneys have already said their client is a 
special-education student who suffers from a learning disability and that he 
comes from a broken family. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Olson said it is too early for public speculation on possible defenses 
that Thornton may employ. 
</P>
<P>
 And while she wouldn't say if he would refuse to speak with the prosecution 
psychiatrist, she said he is aware of his constitutional right to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we haven't even gone through the guilt phase, and obviously a 
person has a right against self-incrimination," she said.

 Now, this REALLY would be a New Nixon: More than three months after Richard 
Nixon died, a T-shirt proclaiming him a "rested" 1996 candidate is a hot seller 
at the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he (Nixon) wouldn't want us to stop our normal operation," said Eva 
Hedger, a library administrator, when asked why it was still on sale. "And it 
is very popular," she said of the shirt, which went on sale before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedger said the library would probably let the current stock run out, then 
"redesign" the item, keeping the same photo with a new caption. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular piece of clothing at the library, by the way, is a T-shirt 
showing Nixon shaking hands with a second never-say-die luminary -- Elvis.

latter weren't needed because the swimmer turned around and headed for shore 
after less than 10 minutes.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOSPITAL REPORTS 4TH 'FLESH-EATING' 
CASE 
</P>

 Infected cat scratches turned into a case of "flesh-eating bacteria" for a 
Thousand Oaks man, the fourth case of the virulent strep infection reported in 
Ventura County in the past few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The man checked himself into Los Robles Regional Medical Center last weekend 
with an infected arm, said J.B. Wilmeth, the internist treating the infection 
cases.Within a 24-hour period, the infection spread up to the patient's armpit 
and down his chest to his groin. 
</P>
<P>
 Doses of pure oxygen, administered in a pressurized chamber, have stopped the 
bacteria's spread and reduced the size of the infection, Wilmeth said. In 
addition, three other patients admitted in July are recovering from their bouts 
with the infection that kills skin and tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth resisted any suggestion that incidents of the condition doctors call 
"necrotizing fasciitis" represent any kind of epidemic. The patients all show 
different mixes of streptococcus and other germs causing the infection. And the 
Thousand Oaks man, like the first three patients, suffered circulatory problems 
making him prone to such disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria, which might produce a sore throat in one case, can create a 
gaping sore in others. Patients with circulatory problems, which limit oxygen's 
flow to all parts of the body, are particularly susceptible. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygen -- used in large doses to treat the infections -- kills the bacteria 
and strengthens the healthy cells around the sore. 
</P>
<P>
 All four patients have undergone several rounds of treatment in Los Robles' 
hyperbaric chamber, a pressurized cylinder that allows doctors to administer 
doses of pure oxygen. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CALABASAS; JUDGE RULES CITY MUST OK ROAD EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas must allow a 1/4-mile portion of Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
to be widened to accommodate traffic for the proposed Ahmanson Ranch housing 
development, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The city refused to approve the road expansion, citing environmental concerns, 
but Judge Diane Wayne ruled Monday that it must issue the permit needed to 
expand a two-lane segment of Thousand Oaks Boulevard to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city believes that the expansion of this portion of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard . . . would clearly disrupt the community in that it would add 
thousands of cars to the existing roadway," Deputy City Atty. Steven 
Quintanilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Boulevard will be one of two entrances to the giant Ahmanson 
development, which calls for 3,050 houses, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space in the hills southeast of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the project is in Ventura County, the only road access is through Los 
Angeles County, including the city of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Craig, the city's environmental coordinator, said: "It is reasonable to 
presume the city will appeal this decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson representatives said the court ruling was an important step forward 
for the project, which has been stalled by lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahmanson needs this to provide the necessary traffic flow for its project," 
said Steven Weston, an attorney for Ahmanson Land Co. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard 1,000 feet to the Ventura County 
line was approved in May by a Los Angeles County hearing officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1/4-mile section to be widened has already been graded, Weston said, but 
further construction will not begin until the transfer of open space is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors approved the Ahmanson Ranch 
development in 1992 on condition that the developer acquire and turn over 
10,000 acres of mountain land to state and federal park agencies. But the 
development deal has been stalled because of a legal battle between Ahmanson 
Land and the cities of Los Angeles, Calabasas and others. TRACY WILSON

 A Rocketdyne employee was released Tuesday from the Sherman Oaks Burn Center, 
after treatment for burns he suffered in a July 26 explosion that killed two of 
his co-workers at the aerospace contractor's plant near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel in pretty good shape, for the shape I'm in," said Lee Wells, 62, of 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said doctors grafted skin from his thighs onto his arms and an ear that 
were badly burned when 10 pounds of rocket propellant ingredients exploded on a 
test stand at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Laboratory two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast killed Larry A. Pugh, 51, a Thousand Oaks engineer, and Otto K. 
Heiney, a Canoga Park engineer who had been standing closer to chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said Tuesday his memories of the explosion are "pretty doggone foggy. 
All I could remember was I was over at the sidelines and then I felt the impact 
and I was on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said he still suffers a little pain on his thighs, from which healthy 
skin was taken to replace the burned skin on his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocketdyne officials are investigating the explosion and said they expect to 
announce findings next week. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; HEARING TO ADDRESS RV RESORT POSTPONED

<P>
 A hearing initially scheduled today on a controversial proposal to develop a 
recreational vehicle resort at Port Hueneme has been postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission hearing has been tentatively rescheduled for 
Sept. 13 in Eureka.The commission, however, may delay the hearing until Oct. 
11, when the panel meets in Los Angeles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more time to perform our analysis, and we are still in the process of 
gathering information," said Christopher Price, a Coastal Commission program 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials, who must approve the project, said they are waiting for 
information from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service about the environmental 
impact that the RV resort would have. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not required, Price said information provided by Fish and 
Wildlife would help the Coastal Commission decide whether the RV resort is 
environmentally safe. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the city submitted an environmental impact report to the Coastal 
Commission for approval to build a 144-space RV resort on a 10-acre beachfront 
site at the end of Ocean View Drive at Port Hueneme Beach Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the resort claim that the project would block their ocean views 
and harm a nearby wetland habitat where the endangered California least tern 
and the tidewater goby have been spotted. CHRISTINA LIMA

 A group of 60 Saticoy-based health-care providers took time out Tuesday to 
watch construction workers break ground for a new medical clinic being built 
there to serve low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The new two-story clinic, which will replace an existing facility run by 
Clinicas Del Camino Real, will offer physical therapy, dental, and vision care, 
as well as traditional health-care services. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit health-care provider decided to replace its office at 1280 S. 
Wells Road because the realignment of California 118 left the building too 
close to high-speed traffic, said Al Limon, a program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building, which will be at 250 S. Wells Road will house 18 exam rooms 
and the corporate offices of Clinicas Del Camino Real, which runs three other 
clinics in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic officials said they hope to relocate to the new building by September, 
1995. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CATHOLIC CHARITIES TO GET A NEW BUILDING

 The Ventura branch of Catholic Charities will move early this winter from its 
storefront on Thompson Boulevard and Ash Street to a building nearly four times 
the size on Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit, social services agency has rented its facilities for years.But 
in January, St. Mary Magdalen Church in Camarillo gave the organization an 
8,100-square-foot building a few blocks north of Main Street, said Diane 
Martell, Catholic Charities' regional director. 
</P>
<P>
 Martell said she and her co-workers are thrilled at the New Year's gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very, very crowded here," she said of the 2,100-square-foot office into 
which Catholic Charities now squeezes its storefront, county headquarters, a 
computer room, a food pantry, a kitchenette and two bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Martell said the money the organization saves in rent will go toward the poor 
people it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities will have to wait awhile before moving into the building. 
The structure needs some work, and construction crews from the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles will not be available until November. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, work on the project will take six to eight weeks, Martell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, it will be ready for Christmas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Charities provides food, clothing, and money to low-income residents, 
as well as counseling services, an after-school program for children, and 
various programs for the elderly and the disabled. CONSTANCE SOMMER

BROKEN PIPE SPILLS WATER INTO BEACH-AREA STREETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pipe into a Silver Strand Beach water purification tank ruptured Tuesday 
evening, spilling 40,000 to 60,000 gallons of rust-colored water into streets 
but apparently causing no environmental damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipe at the bottom of a 45,000-gallon holding tank in which the Channel 
Islands Beach Community Service District chlorinates water broke about 6 p.m. 
and leaked for more than one hour, said a spokesman for the county Fire 
Department's hazardous materials team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't appear to be real hazardous," battalion Chief Mark Sanchez said. 
"It looks like it's nothing more than rusty water." 
</P>
<P>
 The hazardous materials team was at the scene in the Oxnard-area beach 
community by 7 p.m., and state Department of Fish and Game investigators 
arrived within another hour. 
</P>
<P>
 By 8:30 tests of the spilled water, which stood in large puddles on Panama 
Street near Santa Monica Drive, showed that the liquid was pure to drinkable 
levels, Sanchez said. MATTHEW MOSK

 Police will conduct a motorist safety checkpoint at Westminster Boulevard and 
University Street today with the help of members in a local DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight students from the Westminster School District will help pass out safety 
and literature on drunk driving in memory of a fellow student who was killed by 
a drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Stacey Intermediate School student Jeff Martinez was struck and killed 
at the Westminster and University intersection last year. He had been heading 
home from school on his skateboard, district spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the checkpoint's operation, about 3,000 cars traveling west on 
Westminster Boulevard are expected to be stopped between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., 
she said. JON NALICK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ARSON SUSPECTED IN GARAGE BREAK-IN, FIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters in Ventura suspect a blaze that gutted a wooden garage early 
Tuesday was deliberately set after someone broke into the structure and stole 
several large items, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Glenn True said that when he arrived at 263 S. Pacific Ave. the door of 
the detached garage was open and "flames were bellowing out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 After extinguishing the 4:30 a.m. blaze, firefighters found that a padlock on 
the garage door had been broken. The resident of the house, Daniel Holycross, 
also discovered that some of his property inside the garage was missing, but 
police would not disclose what exactly was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have ruled out accidental causes, True said, and believe the 
blaze was an arson. Authorities have no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 It appeared that flammable liquids burned during the fire, but investigators 
do not know whether they were used to start the blaze or ignited after it had 
already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire caused an estimated $10,000 damage to the interior of the garage and 
destroyed about $2,000 worth of property, fire officials said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SATICOY; MAN DENIES GUILT IN MARKET ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An 18-year-old Los Angeles man pleaded not guilty to armed robbery Tuesday, 
denying that he stole $600 in cash and about $20,000 worth of gold jewelry 
during a holdup of a Saticoy market, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III set bail for Felipe Canizal at $100,000 
after a prosecutor described Canizal as a flight risk because of his alleged 
membership in an East Los Angeles gang and because his brother lives in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Canizal is one of four people, all alleged to be gang members from East Los 
Angeles, suspected in the Aug. 2 robbery at the Cabrillo Cooperative Store at 
1515 S. Saticoy Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's deputies, the suspects burst into the store, shouted 
their gang name and held a gun and knife to the chest of the lone store clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the cash and jewelry, they escaped in a van. Witnesses outside 
the store gave deputies the van's license plate, which was registered to a man 
living in the city of Commerce in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, sheriff's deputies from Los Angeles and Ventura counties searched 
three homes in Los Angeles County and recovered about half the jewelry stolen. 
They also arrested a 17-year-old male and Canizal, who was wearing some of the 
stolen jewelry at the time, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old is scheduled to appear for a hearing in Juvenile Court today, 
and prosecutors said they plan to ask that he be tried as an adult. Canizal's 
preliminary hearing was set for Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives are still searching for the other two suspects. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; WOMAN CONVICTED AS ACCESSORY IN SLAYING

<P>
 A Ventura County jury Tuesday convicted a 19-year-old Port Hueneme woman of 
accessory to murder related to a fatal shooting in December at a Ventura motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Naomi Honohan is the second of five defendants convicted in the death of Paul 
Martinez, a 21-year-old Los Angeles man who was gunned down on the second-floor 
balcony of the Motel 6 on Johnson Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Honohan could receive three years in state prison or the California Youth 
Authority, Deputy Dist. Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was attending a party at the motel when he became embroiled in an 
argument with his attackers, authorities said. Three men have been charged with 
shooting him as they drove away. Another man has been charged with accessory to 
murder along with Honohan. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the defendants -- Shaun Bolo, 20, and Willard Bolo, 23 -- fired shots 
from a car owned by Honohan, authorities said. But when questioned about the 
whereabouts of her car that night, Honohan told authorities that it was not at 
the shooting scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Bolo is her boyfriend, according to court testimony. The Bolos, of 
Oxnard, are to face trial in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The third defendant charged with murder, 20-year-old Steven Hidalgo of Port 
Hueneme, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and has been sentenced to 18 
years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Cortez, the other accessory defendant, is to be arraigned Friday.

THOUSAND OAKS BOY PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO FATALLY SHOOTING GIRL; HEARING: COUNSEL 
SAYS 17-YEAR-OLD DEFENDANT SUFFERS FROM ATTENTION-DEFICIT DISORDER AND CANNOT 
CONTROL HIS IMPULSES. PROSECUTORS BELIEVE SHOOTING WAS ACCIDENTAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks teen-ager charged with fatally shooting his girlfriend while 
playing with a loaded handgun has an attention-deficit disorder and is unable 
to control his impulses, the boy's attorney said Tuesday as the youth pleaded 
not guilty to a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Juvenile Court hearing, defense lawyer Victor Furio asked a Ventura 
County Superior Court judge to appoint a psychologist to examine the 
17-year-old youth, who prosecutors say was brandishing the gun when it 
discharged July 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Reay, 16, was shot once in the eye and died at a hospital. 
Prosecutors have charged the boy with one count of murder and two counts of 
brandishing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they believe the shooting was accidental, prosecutors are not seeking 
to try the boy as an adult or to convict him of first-degree murder. Instead, 
they are asking that he be convicted as a juvenile of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's hearing, Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren set the youth's 
trial for Sept. 12. The judge also ordered the boy back in court Thursday so 
two other issues in the case can be decided. One motion is to have the 
psychologist appointed, and the other is to determine whether the boy will be 
released to the custody of his mother, a Postal Service employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth's mother and two sisters, ages 20 and 22, attended the hearing, with 
several other of his supporters. The victim's parents were not present. 
</P>
<P>
 A husky teen-ager with cropped brown hair, the boy seemed alert and in 
relatively good spirits throughout the brief hearing. After Furio waived the 
boy's right to a speedy trial to allow the defense more time to prepare for the 
case, the youth told the judge he was in agreement with his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Since first being arrested, the boy has adjusted somewhat to the confined and 
orderly environment of Juvenile Hall, Furio said outside court. On suicide 
watch when he was first brought to the county juvenile lockup, the boy is no 
longer distraught and a risk to harm himself, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the boy should remain in custody.  
</P>
<P>
 "He should be detained because he committed a murder," argued Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Donald C. Glynn. "He's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Furio listed several reasons the judge should release the defendant at 
Thursday's court appearance. "No. 1, he can complete high school," commented 
the lawyer from Woodland Hills. "He can see his attorney more frequently. He 
can see his psychologist more often." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point while talking to reporters, Furio seemed exasperated by questions 
about what caused his client to wave and point a gun at people. He said he 
would not discuss the evidence in the case, but said of the boy, "He's not a 
criminal. He's a kid involved in an accidental shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer did say the boy's alleged impulse-control problem leaves him unable 
to control his actions. With the attention-span deficit, the boy "can't keep 
his mind on one thing for very long," the lawyer contended. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, he said, those two behavioral factors contributed to the fateful 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very important evidence," Furio said. "If he isn't allowed to present 
it, . . . he won't be allowed his right to a fair trial."

ATHLETES GET ON A ROLL AT WHEELCHAIR SPORTS CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Updegraff can't run down a basketball court, dribble between her legs 
or make a jump shot. But when it comes to wheelchair basketball, Updegraff is a 
star. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For one week each summer, at a Junior Wheelchair Sports Camp in Simi Valley, 
Updegraff and a dozen other young people compete wheel-to-wheel in rigorous 
daily activities, including basketball, swimming, archery, tennis, Ping-Pong 
and floor hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 At week's end, all campers receive prizes: T-shirts, tennis rackets or 
specially designed wheelchair backpacks. The best could earn a chance to face 
off against the top wheelchair athletes in the world in the Paralympics, an 
international competition for wheelchair athletes that will next be held in 
Atlanta in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really love it," said Updegraff, 23, who has cerebral palsy. "I get out of 
the house and do something, meet people, feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 The camp draws youths and young adults from throughout Southern California, 
ranging in age from 8 to 25. It is on the east end of Simi Valley in the 
sprawling back yard of Ingrid Cleffi-Hayes, a physical therapist who helped 
found a similar camp at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleffi-Hayes launched the mini-camp last summer to supplement the Northridge 
program. Both are geared toward youths with muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, 
spina bifida and other spinal cord injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids with mental disabilities have the Special Olympics, but there just isn't 
as much around for kids who are physically disabled," Cleffi-Hayes said. "I 
want to give these kids as much of a chance as possible to challenge each other 
and compete. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times if somebody sees a kid sitting in a wheelchair drooling they 
automatically assume the kid is mentally retarded," Cleffi-Hayes said. "All you 
have to do is see these kids at camp and you know that's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, nearly 30,000 residents have a disability that limits their 
mobility, but no numbers are available for those in wheelchairs, said Terry 
Dryer, coordinator of the county's Americans With Disabilities Act program. And 
nationwide, more than 10 million people rely on wheelchairs to get around, 
according to the National Wheelchair Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Campers pay $150 for a week of camp that actually costs about $350 per 
participant, Cleffi-Hayes said. Funding from state and federal grants and 
corporate sponsors pays the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 A donation last summer paid for a $10,000 concrete basketball court in 
Cleffi-Hayes' back yard. Her goal is to expand the program -- now offered for 
two weeks each summer -- to have activities at her home year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the camp staff are volunteers, including Cleffi-Hayes. "Ideally, 
I'd like to pay everyone, but I just don't have the money," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Cleffi-Hayes pays gas expenses and coaxes wheelchair manufacturers to 
donate parts she can pass along to her staff. The camp counselors also are 
wheelchair-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Counselor Bobby Rohan said being in a wheelchair makes it easier for campers 
to relate to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at me and they know that I have been through what they are going 
through," said Rohan of Northridge. "I think they respect me more because of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, basketball was first on the camp agenda, and Updegraff 
quickly got the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 With a push from a counselor, Updegraff's chair squealed down the court, using 
bumper-car tactics to dodge a tangle of spinning, screeching opponents. Coaches 
hollered and fans cheered as Updegraff neared the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly a chair toppled in her wake, slamming its occupant onto the concrete 
court and momentarily halting the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As the action resumed, Updegraff slid up to the basket -- a large plastic 
trash barrel positioned beneath the hoop. With a determined grimace she stuffed 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 As onlookers, teammates and opponents cheered, Updegraff grinned from ear to 
ear. FYI 
</P>
<P>

Cleffi-Hayes at 581-2897.

PORT HUENEME MAN ARRESTED AFTER STANDOFF WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A despondent 34-year-old man was arrested early Tuesday in Port Hueneme after 
a six-hour standoff with police during which he shot at surrounding homes half 
a dozen times, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, police evacuated about 100 people living in the Surfside I 
condominium complex while members of the Oxnard police SWAT team negotiated 
with Barry Doyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle agreed to surrender about 1 a.m. and was taken into custody at gunpoint. 
He was booked into County Jail on suspicion of assaulting a peace officer, 
firing at an occupied dwelling and damaging jail property inside the Port 
Hueneme police station. He was being held in lieu of $5,000 bail.

<P>
 The incident began about 6:40 p.m. when Port Hueneme police responded to a 
call of a man threatening to kill himself in his home in the 200 block of East 
Surfside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 During the standoff, Doyle fired several shots that struck neighboring 
condominiums, police said. After his arrest, Doyle was taken to the Port 
Hueneme police station where he shredded a mattress in a holding cell before 
being subdued and transferred to County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme Police Sgt. Jerry Beck said Doyle was distraught over the state 
of his financial affairs and the fact that his children live on the East Coast.

SIMI VALLEY OKS UP TO $50,000 IN FUNDS FOR QUAKE AID COORDINATOR; RECOVERY: 
MONEY FROM A FEDERAL GRANT WILL BE USED TO ASSIST DAMAGED BUSINESSES AND BOOST 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY.

<P>
 Hoping to help businesses still struggling to recover for the Jan. 17 
earthquake, the Simi Valley City Council has earmarked up to $50,000 in relief 
funds to hire an earthquake assistance coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest problems now is we don't know who still needs help," Mayor 
Greg Stratton said. "A lot of people are grinding through the system, and some 
are gonna fall out the other end and not be able to get their businesses going 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 One such person may be Razmik Ayrassian. For more than five years, Ayrassian 
has operated a dry-cleaning business on the city's east end. He estimates that 
his business suffered more than $20,000 in damage from the January quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But after months of tussling with state and federal assistance agencies, 
Ayrassian said he has not received one penny of financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear a lot of talk, talk, talk," he said. "If the city is going to do 
something to help, great. I'm fed up." 
</P>
<P>
 The funding is Simi Valley's share of a $760,000 earthquake assistance grant 
to Ventura County from the U. S. Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore and Santa Paula received the rest of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Under provisions of the funding, the Simi Valley quake coordinator will assess 
and document quake impact on the business community, bolster post-quake 
economic development and provide technical assistance, including help with 
applications for grants and other financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several weeks, city officials will meet with members of the Simi 
Valley Chamber of Commerce to figure out how to meet those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could hire a contractor or a temporary city employee, or we could split 
the work among several people," Deputy City Manager Jim Hansen said. "That's 
something we're hoping to decide with the help of the chamber." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said the city hopes to make a decision on how to spend the funds within 
a month. Under provisions of the grant, the city must spend the money by 
September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 By helping businesses, the city hopes to encourage them to continue operating 
in Simi Valley, Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to help as much as possible and encourage the businesses to stay 
in Simi Valley," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent estimates compiled by the city put quake damage to commercial and 
industrial buildings at $268 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Bender, executive director of the chamber, said businesses will welcome 
any assistance they can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is a good one because we still have a lot of people struggling to 
make repairs and replace lost inventory," Bender said. "There are many, many 
businesses who still haven't figured out how to get the loans they need to 
recover." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Davis agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are businesses out there that really don't know how to file all these 
claims," Davis said. "It really is to the city's benefit to help them out." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 For information on earthquake assistance for Simi Valley businesses, call 
Nancy Bender at the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce, 526-3900.

BASEBALL STRIKE AND THE FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three cheers for your editorial "Doesn't Anyone Care About the Fans?" (July 
30). It's time the fans' interest got recognized. However, our grievance goes 
beyond the closing of the ballparks while the millionaires (owners and players) 
slice up an ever-expanding pie. The fans deserve something more than the 
continuity of the 1994 season. Most economists say the players deserve more 
because collectively they produce the increasing revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Most products, free of monopoly, become less expensive as they are mass 
produced. Not baseball, however, which became mass produced through television. 
Why not a decrease in the admission price, free parking, decrease in the hot 
dog prices (the owners can subsidize the concessionaires) and free day games 
for kids? 
</P>
<P>
 And why not decrease the advertising time on TV? Perhaps the fans can see an 
uninterrupted inning of baseball, i.e., the infielders warming up, the 
groundskeeper dragging the infield and, of course, the seventh-inning stretch. 
These are things that create the charm of the game. Also, some contribution to 
a home for old-time players who may be down on their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is done, the owners and the players will be sharing their prosperity 
with the third member of the partnership -- the ever-loyal fan. 
</P>

 * Your editorial places the blame for the impending baseball strike on the 
wrong parties. It is the American sports public that has willingly supplied 
"their hard-earned cash for the revenue streams of the game." The owners and 
players have just done what is perfectly natural for them -- they've taken the 
fans' steady supply of money and run. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the sports-crazy public that is the problem. And, the only way fans' 
interest will ever be taken seriously is when they do the impossible -- boycott 
the game, its sponsors and TV long enough to create a serious obstacle to the 
flow of ticket money, concessions and big TV bucks.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; REDS' SANDERS ARRESTED FOR EXIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Reds' Deion Sanders was arrested on misdemeanor charges after Monday 
night's game at Riverfront Stadium when a security guard alleged that Sanders 
tried to leave on his motor scooter through a pedestrian gate and dragged the 
police officer on the ground for about 15 feet. The guard suffered minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who posted bail and started in center field Tuesday night, claimed 
the guard instigated the incident, which resulted in charges of resisting 
arrest and failing to provide a driver's license. Each charge carries a maximum 
sentence of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. A pretrial hearing was set 
for Sept. 13. Police have not decided whether to add an assault charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said he was trying to leave from a different exit to avoid the fans 
who were waiting for him after the game and have recently began to grab at him 
as he leaves on his motor scooter. Sanders claims the guard never told him he 
was under arrest and that he drove off because the guard was trying to pull him 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I told him was that you should not talk to people in that way, we should 
respect each other," Sanders said. MARYANN HUDSON

 Two Computer Firms to Merge: Storage Technology Corp. and Network Systems 
Corp., suppliers of computer storage and data communication systems, said they 
have agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at about $300 million.Storage 
Technology said the merger is believed to be the first of a major computer 
storage provider and a leader in high-performance computer networking products. 
The goal is for users of workstations or personal computers to have access to 
massive amounts of data stored in mainframe computers. The technology to 
facilitate moving data among different systems is Network Systems' enterprise 
routing switch, being developed jointly with Northern Telecom.

PAINKILLER MARKET A REAL HEADACHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bayer works wonders. More doctors use Tylenol. Advil stops the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims, counterclaims and dizzying displays of tablets, capsules, caplets 
and gel caps are enough to bring on a slam-bang head-thumper that would make 
even Robert Urich groan. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans' preoccupation with their throbbing heads has encouraged a vigorous 
advertising battle in which the purveyors of painkillers fight almost hourly 
over which works fast! faster! fastest! 
</P>
<P>
 You choose: Regular strength, extra strength? Doctor-recommended, 
hospital-used? Regular containers or easy-open bottles? Easy-to-swallow or the 
old choke-'em-down-with-water? (That's a choice?) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, this barrage helped Tylenol bump Bayer as the top-selling 
painkiller. Now Advil is en route to toppling Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
 New on the scene is Aleve, which says its pain relief lasts two to three times 
longer than the competition, a claim that threatens to consign the other guys 
to a list of headache has-beens. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason the makers of Advil sued Aleve this week, claiming Aleve 
deceives customers with false advertising. At stake is the preeminent position 
in a $2.5-billion business with more than 140 brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All day strong -- all day long," boast Aleve's TV commercials, part of a 
$100-million campaign undertaken by Procter & Gamble Co., which sells the drug 
in partnership with drug maker Syntex Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 One or two Aleve pills last eight to 12 hours, the ads say, while 
official-looking bar graphs show the competition pooping out at four to eight 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not only wrong, it's dangerous, asserts Karen Brown, spokeswoman for 
American Home Products Corp., maker of Advil. 
</P>
<P>
 The painkilling power of Aleve and Advil is "virtually the same," but Procter 
& Gamble has distorted test results to claim otherwise, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, P&G never planned to tout the longer-lasting dosage. The factor it 
seems to be boasting about -- the recommendation to take Aleve only every eight 
hours -- was actually required by the Food and Drug Administration because 
doctors were worried about side effects of indigestion, constipation and 
sleeplessness that could result if the pills were taken more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have a disadvantage in terms of safety and it's being twisted to look 
like an advantage," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Newark, N.J., demands that 
Procter & Gamble halt the advertising campaign, run correction ads and pay 
unspecified dollar penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, Procter & Gamble issued a statement saying that all its claims 
for Aleve are true and were cleared by the FDA before the product was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly didn't expect our competitors to sit idly by, though we're 
disappointed by the misleading statements American Home Products is making 
today about Aleve," said P&G Chairman and Chief Executive Edwin Artzt. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is real enough but is highly unlikely to produce tense courtroom 
scenes with batteries of medical experts debating headache remedies or actor 
Urich on the stand to punch out pain with Bayer aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, marketers see it as a strategic weapon fired by Advil to alleviate 
Aleve's ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is using the legal system in its pure form, which is to harass and 
intimidate your competitors," said Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries, a market 
consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn. "There is absolutely no intent on the part 
of American Home Products to win a lawsuit. What they're trying to win is the 
minds of the analgesic customer." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on Aleve's response, the lawsuit could have far-reaching 
implications for U.S. painkilling habits. A lesson of history shows why -- a 
lesson Bayer's makers will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, when Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol took on the venerated 
and formidable Bayer, the newcomer assaulted aspirin on what appeared to be 
purely medical grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the millions who should not take aspirin . . . " read the first Tylenol 
ads. Next appeared a scary list of warnings about a pain reliever trusted by 
millions since the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aspirin can irritate the stomach lining, trigger asthmatic or allergic 
reactions, cause small amounts of hidden gastrointestinal bleeding," said the 
ad. "Fortunately, there is Tylenol." 
</P>
<P>
 Bayer tried to ignore the campaign and never filed a lawsuit. Now Tylenol is 
by far the largest-selling painkiller in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless who wins this brawl, pain experts urge headache suffers to ignore 
the hype. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got asthma or stomach problems, your best choice is probably 
acetaminophen, the generic name of Tylenol, said Dr. Joel Saper, head of the 
Michigan Head-Pain and Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Advil, Nuprin, Motrin and other drugs that contain the active ingredient 
ibuprofen all work fine, said Saper, but they're probably no better or worse 
than Aleve. Its active ingredient is the chemically similar naproxen sodium. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, Aleve is going to be a lot better than ibuprofen, and for 
others ibuprofen will be better than Aleve," Saper said. "A doctor couldn't 
begin to give you guidance on which way to go. You almost have to try each 
one."

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; PRINTED MATTER CAN HAVE A PROFESSIONAL LOOK

 Nothing taints a small business with a sense of failure faster than 
poor-quality printed materials. If the letterheads and business cards and 
brochures look amateurish, customers are likely to have doubts about the 
quality of the goods or services being offered. 
</P>
<P>
 With a personal computer and an inexpensive program or two, any business can 
project a professional-looking image to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 My Brochures ($60) from MySoftware Co. of Menlo Park, Calif., makes it easy to 
make your own brochures and mailers. And it works well with a large selection 
of patterned papers available from several sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Communique InstantImage Software Templates ($25) from Avery Dennison Office 
Products of Diamond Bar offers a broad, consistent approach to business 
printing needs, though it lacks some of the brochure features of My Brochures. 
Communique has templates for a family of patterned forms for matching 
letterheads, brochures, business cards, envelopes and labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another way to impress your customers, or merely make your own life a 
little easier, is offered by ClickBook ($70) from BookMaker Inc. of Palo Alto. 
Available for both PCs and Macintoshes, it lets you turn word-processing files, 
spreadsheet tables and even database lists into any of 20 different sizes and 
styles of booklets. 
</P>
<P>
 My Brochures is a Windows program that combines pre-designed brochure formats 
with built-in simulations of pre-printed brochure papers from several 
manufacturers, including Paper Direct, plus a library of graphics images to 
give you everything you need. There's even a spelling checker. 
</P>
<P>
 Brochures seem simple enough. Typically, they are printed on both sides of a 
letter-size sheet turned on its side and then folded into thirds. You'll even 
find some helpful brochure templates in the full-featured word-processing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a lot easier to make a brochure in My Brochures than with a 
traditional word-processing program, because all of the hard formatting work is 
already done for you. That includes the ability to print mailing addresses 
sideways on the middle panel to turn a brochure into a mailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing text files can be poured into the three vertical columns of a 
brochure, or you can type in original material directly on the screen. You can 
also add graphic images either by drawing them with the program's simple 
drawing tools or using images from the clip art collection included in the 
program. You can also add photographs or other images from scanned art or 
CD-ROM collections obtained separately. 
</P>
<P>
 The program comes with an excellent, well-illustrated manual that takes you 
through all the steps and explains them in enough detail so you can learn how 
to create your own original designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Avery Dennison's Communique InstantImage templates offer more modest 
capabilities, but they cover a much broader range of business printing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 As the name implies, this is not a program, but a set of templates to be used 
with your existing word processing software. The package includes templates for 
Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 2.0 and 6.0 (there were no versions 
between those two), WordPerfect for Windows versions 5.2 and 6.0 and 
WordPerfect for DOS version 5.1. 
</P>

 I tested the Word for Windows 6.0 templates. The installation program on the 
diskette placed 110 templates into my Word for Windows program so they were 
available to use every time I opened a new document. You wouldn't want to use 
all of them, however. Really what you have are 18 choices: three styles each 
for six different patterns of Avery Dennison stationery, brochure stock, 
envelopes, business cards and labels. 
</P>
<P>
 The intention is that you pick one of the 18 design combinations and then 
customize it to your needs. The instructions are skimpy and assume that you 
already know how to use your word-processing program and understand how a 
template works. 
</P>
<P>
 I found several features in several templates that didn't work as they should 
have. One of the "bullet list" formats usually produced odd results. Text 
frames that were meant to contain the address and telephone number of a 
business were superimposed on each other in one template, making it appear as 
if they didn't work. These kinds of flaws are easily corrected by a proficient 
user who understands templates, but they would baffle a novice. 
</P>

 ClickBook can take almost any file you can print from a Windows program and 
convert it into several styles of booklets, ranging from pocket-size to 5.5 
inches by 8 inches, or into a tri-fold brochure such as those described above. 
</P>
<P>
 It does this by creating a new printer driver file for your Windows programs. 
Then you can choose the ClickBook printer instead of your regular printer when 
you want to make a booklet. It is ideal for producing professional-looking 
instruction manuals for your products, or even a small catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Converting your own customer list or personal phone list into a handy 
pocket-size booklet for traveling would be another good application. 
</P>
<P>
 Using it well takes some experimentation, especially with spreadsheet and 
database files, because you have to manually format a file into the appropriate 
pages beforehand. That may mean converting normal-size type into a larger size 
if you want it to be legible after ClickBook shrinks it down for a small 
booklet. It will probably take a while to print, too, while Windows churns away 
re-scaling the type to fit the ClickBook printer requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Installation is easy but not foolproof. The program indicated it was 
automatically creating the proper printer driver for my Hewlett-Packard 
LaserJet 4M, but it didn't, and pages were printed atop one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The fix was easy, though. I just had to run ClickBook's printer driver 
creation routine so that it could decipher how the printer really fed the 
paper.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; IN DEVELOPMENT; 
HARNESSING ENERGY ON SOLAR FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Converting sunlight into electricity may someday be as simple as buying a roll 
of what looks like plastic wrap at the local hardware store, stretching it over 
a frame and plugging in a couple of wires. 
</P>
<P>
 A joint research effort to develop such a "solar cell on a roll" has been 
announced by Advanced Research Development Inc. of Athol, Mass. and the 
Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory. The three-year, 
$1.8-million project aims to develop solar energy technology that uses a film 
instead of layers of semiconductors to convert light into electric power. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would incorporate light-activated molecules developed by Argonne 
into an electrically conductive film developed by ARDI. Argonne's molecules are 
based on perylene dyes, which are used in photocopying and liquid crystal 
displays. While these molecules convert solar energy into electrical energy 
with greater than 99% efficiency, it is not clear yet how much efficiency will 
be lost when the molecules are coupled to the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Mama-San, Phone Home: In the United States, cellular telephones and pagers are 
generally wielded by the young and the restless -- business people who need to 
stay in constant touch with home and office. In Japan, however, portable 
telephone technology may soon be deployed to help the old and the lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a rapidly aging population -- forecasts are that by 2024, one in 
every four Japanese will be 65 or older -- the Ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications is concerned about the problem of how to locate elderly 
people who may wander off and become lost. One proposal is to equip elderly 
relatives with a personal handy phone. 
</P>
<P>
 PHP technology would allow cordless telephones to be used outside like 
portable cellular phones. In the search system envisioned, a worried relative 
would call the handy phone carried by a lost elderly person. Even if the person 
did not respond, the phone would send an automatic signal to a nearby land 
station equipped for PHP services and searchers would be sent out. Land 
stations are expected to be situated at intervals covering a radius of 100 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry is also testing a pager system that would flash a light when it 
received calls and send a message four times, asking passers-by to telephone 
the caller's number. In tests in Tokyo, however, passers-by had trouble hearing 
the pager.. 
</P>
<P>
 Haste Makes Better Aluminum: Aluminum car parts have been something of a Holy 
Grail for the auto industry because they are very light and thus can cut the 
weight of a car and improve gasoline usage. But the components have 
traditionally been very difficult and costly to fashion, limiting their use to 
only the most expensive cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at the Center for Materials Research at Ohio State University in 
Columbus have now resurrected technology from the 1950s and '60s that holds the 
promise of forming aluminum parts much more easily and cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "high-rate forming," the technique slams metal into a die at velocities 
of about 200 m.p.h., which makes it possible to take advantage of the effects 
of inertia. At high speeds, inertia -- the tendency for matter in motion to 
move at a constant velocity -- coaxes the metal to stretch gradually rather 
than tear. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the momentum makes the metal act like a piece of clay thrown against a 
wall, causing it to spread easily without fracturing. Thus metals can be 
stretched two to five times farther than sheet metal formed using standard 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-Emitting Plastic: Materials that turn light into electrical signals and 
vice versa show up almost everywhere in daily life. Fax machines, copiers, 
computer monitors, fluorescent lighting, solar cells -- even the human eye -- 
are based on these so-called opto-electronic materials, such as gallium 
arsenide. 
</P>
<P>
 Opto-electronic polymers, inexpensive and versatile plastics, have long 
existed as low-cost and convenient alternatives to conventional materials, but 
they have always had serious drawbacks. For one, engineers have not been very 
successful at controlling the amount and color of light they emit. And the 
polymers are inefficient, wasting a lot of energy by converting only a small 
fraction of one form of energy into the other. 
</P>
<P>
 But now engineers at the University of Rochester have discovered that by 
blending a second type of polymer with the original, they can prevent the 
formation of pairs of molecules, or eximers, that do not emit light 
efficiently, and instead create a material that emits light very efficiently.

RELATIONSHIPS: GROWING UP WITH THEIR CHILDREN; YOUNG PARENTS FACE SOME VERY 
ADULT CHALLENGES; FAMILY SUPPORT CAN BE CRUCIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Margaret and Tony Nava are out, people often ask if 6-year-old Tony is 
Margaret's little brother, and the boy quickly replies, "No, she's my mom!" 
</P>
<P>
 As a young mother, Margaret, 23, is used to that question. She's also used to 
playing soccer with Tony and his friends and dodging her son's water balloons 
outside their Orange apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find myself having a good time with Tony," she says. "My parents were 
older, and they didn't play with me like I play with Tony. Because I 
participate in a lot of activities with him, he and his friends think I'm cool. 
I think if I were older, I wouldn't understand half the things he does or why 
he does them." 
</P>
<P>
 Having the energy to play with your children is definitely a benefit of being 
a young parent, says Tustin individual and family psychologist Amy Stark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young parents tend to have a sense of playfulness that sometimes disappears 
when you get older," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting a family early also means that you've completed your most intensive 
parenting responsibilities by the time you reach 40. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, young parenting can also be very stressful and challenging, 
says Stark. "Girls who have babies young find it difficult to raise a child and 
form this other identity when they don't yet know who they are. In terms of 
life stages, the years from 18 to 22 represent a time when you learn about who 
you are and what you want out of life." 
</P>
<P>
 A baby completely changes the lives of young parents, Stark says. And, "It's 
even hard to find peers who are in the same boat and can relate." 
</P>
<P>
 For young couples who have a baby then get married, statistics show that the 
marriage often doesn't survive, Stark says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge of supporting a family is hard enough for adults. It puts 
unusual strains on young people who have never had that kind of 
responsibility," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics also make it very difficult to properly care for children at a young 
age. "Depending on how much work experience or schooling a young parent has 
had, it can be very difficult to raise a child," Stark says. "Many young people 
don't yet have careers and find it impossible to survive on low-paying jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Those young parents who have the financial and emotional support of their 
family often have an easier time of adjusting to parenting, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Nava has her family to thank for making raising Tony as a single 
parent much easier. Although she was originally living with her son's father, 
who was 20 when the baby was born, he became overwhelmed by the responsibility 
of raising a child and left when Tony was 10 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family lives close by and has been very supportive," says Margaret. "If it 
wasn't for the family support I've had, raising Tony would have been much more 
difficult. I would have missed out on a lot more things, like my senior prom." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret had Tony at 17, when she was in her senior year of high school. She 
and her son lived in her mother's house and then with her father. Margaret and 
Tony moved out on their own when she was 20. 
</P>
<P>
 While Margaret is at work, her mother cares for Tony and Margaret pays her. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret's older brothers, Danny and Richard Serrano, also help immensely by 
serving as male role models for Tony. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brothers are there for Tony every step of the way," Margaret says. "If he 
gets in trouble and I'm having a hard time dealing with him, they'll talk to 
him. He really looks up to them. They also attend his soccer games when I 
can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Though she wouldn't trade her situation, Margaret admits that it's been a 
long, tough road all by herself. She finished high school the first year of 
Tony's life doing homework in between feedings. After school she worked part 
time to earn enough money for such necessities as baby formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Once she graduated from high school, Margaret realized that she needed to 
learn a trade to support herself and her son, so she attended school to become 
a medical assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Her schedule was grueling. 
</P>
<P>
 From 7 a.m. to noon she worked as an phone operator. Afterward, she would 
return home, eat lunch and go to school from 2:30 to 7 p.m. After school she 
would have dinner and play with her son for a few minutes before putting him to 
bed. Then she would tackle her homework until about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the hardest part of the early years for Margaret was not having any 
time for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself getting upset, stressed and impatient, because I'd see my 
friends going out on the weekends and buying new clothes, and there I was doing 
laundry and using my money for baby stuff. I do feel there are certain things I 
missed during that period of my life, such as going on my senior trip and 
traveling," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Tony is older and Margaret has a full-time job as a medical assistant 
in Orange, her schedule is easier, and she does find a little time for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the struggles Margaret has been through, she feels that she is better 
off today with her son than she would be if she had not had him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Tony, I think I'd be off partying, and I wouldn't be as serious as I 
am now about life," she says. "I probably wouldn't have a career and I'd still 
be living at home. Tony and I live really comfortably, and we're happy." 
</P>
<P>

 Linda Dougherty had always planned on having kids young, so she was delighted 
to get pregnant when she was 20 and equally as thrilled to be expecting again 
when her first daughter was just 3 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to have my kids before I was 25, so that I could be a young parent," 
says Dougherty, now 40 and living in Tustin. "I wanted to have fun with them, 
versus there being a big generation gap." 
</P>
<P>
 When she got pregnant the first time, Dougherty had just gotten out of nursing 
school and was prepared to raise children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like my youth was interrupted," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Dougherty forgot to check on was how her 21-year-old husband felt 
about being a father. As it turned out, her husband, Walter, was not as pleased 
with having children that early. He had a much harder time adjusting to the 
rigors of parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter was your typical 21-year-old guy," says Linda. "He had no idea what to 
do with babies; they frightened him." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Dougherty, now 41, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, I didn't take as much responsibility for the kids as I should 
have, but Linda was very responsible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For Walter, the task of making enough money to support his family was 
challenging and somewhat overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Linda had been to nursing school, I hadn't gotten any training and 
had no career to speak of," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really had an opportunity to attend school, because I felt that I 
need a job to provide for the family. Financially, being a younger parent is 
probably harder than being an older parent," says Walter, who is in sales and 
marketing, as is Linda now. 
</P>
<P>
 In Linda's view, children of young parents tend to grow up more quickly 
because they are less sheltered and protected than kids born to older parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Older parents tend to focus on the child's welfare and look at the long-term 
picture and the potentials for disaster. When (parents are) young, a certain 
percentage of ignorance and lack of maturity makes (them) do things -- like 
bring a 6-week-old to the beach -- that you wouldn't do if you were more 
mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail Dougherty, 18, who is a senior at Tustin High School, agrees that kids 
with younger parents tend to grow up more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, younger parents make their kids more street-smart than older 
parents," she says. "If I fell down when I was younger and hurt my knee, my mom 
would say, 'It's going to happen.' But if one of my friends who had an older 
parent scraped her knee, her mom would rush for a Band-Aid. Older parents tend 
to baby their children more." 
</P>
<P>
 Abigail also feels that older parents seem to protect their children from 
unpleasant truths such as financial problems. "In my family we know everything 
-- good or bad," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But knowing everything can take its toll at times, says Abigail. "My parents 
have gone through tough times, like all parents do, and it's kind of hard 
sometimes when one of them asks me for advice about the other one," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking to me, they'll expect me to go on as if nothing has happened, 
but it's very confusing for me. I wonder, is my mom or dad a mom or dad, or a 
friend? Sometimes I don't want a buddy; I need a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 For Abigail's older sister, Breeanne, 19, having young parents has meant that 
she's been able to get on-target advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents know what I'm going through because it wasn't so long ago that 
they were going through the same things," she says. Breeanne says the advice 
her parents give her is accurate for this day and age because they are more in 
tune with the times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can be totally honest with my parents and tell them what I'll be doing when 
I go out," she says. "Even my friends confide in my mom and dad. For my 18th 
birthday my family threw a big party for me. It was probably the best time of 
my life, and I got to spend it with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some young parents unknowingly grow up with their children, Isidro, now 
28, made a conscious decision to mature with his son, who is now 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted a kid to grow up with," says Isidro, who asked that his last 
name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Isidro, who is divorced and has custody of his son, feels growing up with his 
son has been everything he imagined. "I've spent a lot of time with my son," he 
says. "I changed his diapers when he was small and bathed him." 
</P>
<P>
 When he planned to have a child at a young age, Isidro, who lives in Anaheim, 
says he considered the responsibility and now realizes that he has grown up a 
lot more quickly than he probably would have without children. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is happy with his decision to be a young parent, he does not 
recommend it to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing to do is have a kid when you're ready," he says. "You don't 
want to have a baby before then, because you might resent your child. You want 
to be able to give your child all the attention he or she needs."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: JUST ANOTHER HAREBRAINED TRADITION AT THE CITADEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the battle is over and the Citadel's ranks of students finally include 
women -- as they must -- the skirmish over Shannon Faulkner's hair will be only 
a footnote in her admirable struggle for equality. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been harassed, abused and even threatened with death, but Faulkner, 
19, has finally won the right to attend the 152-year old, all-male (but hardly 
exclusive) South Carolina military academy. Although the school is appealing, 
it is likely that five days from now -- per a federal judge's orders -- 
Faulkner will be able to don a uniform, live on campus and participate in 
Citadel life as fully as its neo-Neanderthal student body will let her. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that happens, however, U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck is slated to 
rule today on whether Faulkner must submit to the hallowed "10-second" haircut 
-- the instant shearing away of identity and individuality that signifies both 
the gruntlike status of the new cadet and the greater glory of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Houck said he could find nothing in the law to prevent the Citadel 
from shaving Faulkner's head. But after the Justice Department filed a motion 
asking Houck to reverse or stay his decision pending an appeal to a higher 
court, the judge agreed to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner, whose strength of character should inspire her classmates, has said 
she will shave her head if she has to. 
</P>
<P>
 I say go for it, Shannon. Let 'em buzz ya. 
</P>
<P>
 They can take away your hair, but they take away your dignity only if you let 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By fighting to keep women out, it's difficult to imagine exactly what the 
Citadel is trying to preserve, except the dubious tautological ideal of 
tradition for tradition's sake. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories about Faulkner's legal battle against the all-male bastion generally 
contain emotional quotes from cadets that go like this: "The Citadel is an 
incredible brotherhood, and you just can't have a sister in a brotherhood." Or: 
"Having girls here would lower our standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Lower our standards? 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel freshmen had average GPAs of 2.5 and SAT scores of 967 (out of 1600). 
Faulkner graduated with a 3.7 grade-point average and earned 1,040 on her SAT. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely the Citadel makes no claim to exclusivity -- last year, after all, it 
accepted 1,236 of the 1,472 who applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the school swell the nation's armed services with Citadel-trained 
officers. These days, most graduates -- soon an estimated 80% -- eschew 
military service and plunge directly into the job market . . . as highly 
disciplined junior executives, one imagines. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are the stakes? In this age of women in combat, what does an all-male 
Citadel exist for? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Citadel exists to give young men a good, publicly subsidized 
education at a reasonable price -- in-state freshman pay about $10,000 for 
room, board and tuition; seniors pay $7,755. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the Citadel is a way to transform the bumpy road of life into the 
superhighway of success: It's a guaranteed admission into a particular kind of 
old boys' network. 
</P>
<P>
 A tradition any old boy-in-training worth his class ring would fight to 
maintain, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cynical view is that the Citadel's insistence on shaving Faulkner's head 
is another angry assault on her dignity by an institution bent on making her 
pay in all sorts of ways for daring to change it. The charitable view is that 
Citadel officials simply can't help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably, it's both: a terminal case of lack of imagination, combined with a 
virulent strain of retribution. The Citadel is a place that doesn't just revere 
tradition; it is held hostage by it. So just as cadets and administrators seem 
unable to conceive of a woman in their midst, neither do they seem able to 
conceive of a freshman with hair in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year, after all, is called "knob year" in honor of freshmen's 
hair-free heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Head shaving is among the rituals (hazing being another) that pass for deep 
emotional bonding in the context of a military academy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the attorney representing the Citadel put it: "Many cadets describe it as 
the most humiliating moment of their lives. For us to say to Faulkner that she 
be treated differently would hurt her chances for assimilation into the corps." 
</P>
<P>
 The doublespeak is stunning. First, the Citadel argues that men and women are 
too different to be able to attend the school together. Now they say Faulkner 
has got to be one of the boys. These people would not recognize a shade of gray 
if it stuck them where it hurts with a flaming harpoon. 
</P>
<P>
 So do it for assimilation, Shannon. Do it because the Citadel imagines this as 
the ultimate humiliation and it's only hair. Show them again your courage and 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it could be downright heavenly not to worry about your coif every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 No good hair days, no bad hair days. Just no hair days. 
</P>
<P>
 There's got to be a certain liberation in that. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just what the Citadel needs.

 In the news: Two Delta Airlines ground employees, believed to be intoxicated,

 Returning to the city after two weeks on the road passing bad paper, the

a large batch of $18 bills. 
</P>

 Undaunted, the clever counterfeiter decided to see if he could get rid of the

 "Wonder if you could give me change for this?" he asked, handing the clerk an

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; REFILLING THE EMPTY NEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Compiled from Times staff and news services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An increasing number of grandparents are being forced to cope with the fact 
that their empty nests are being filled by grandchildren for whom they must 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3.3 million children live with grandparents who are their primary 
caregivers or legal guardians, a 41% increase over 1980, according to Census 
Bureau figures reported in Good Housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 While many older people provide day care for their grandchildren to assist 
working parents, growing numbers of grandparents seek custody of the children 
because the parents neglect them, suffer from mental or emotional problems, 
abuse drugs or alcohol, or -- in the case of teen-age pregnancies -- are too 
young to assume child-care responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising grandchildren can mean delaying or giving up long-awaited retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, they've remodeled their house or purchased a motor home -- the next 
day they're child-proofing cabinets or planning a child's birthday party," said 
Margaret Platt Jendrek, a Miami University professor studying the issue for the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons. Preventive Education 
</P>
<P>
 Early learning experiences, which for many children can determine school 
success or failure, are the focus of the new Task Force on Learning in the 
Primary Grades, formed by the Carnegie Corp. of New York. The task force, made 
up of leaders in education, business, government services and the media, will 
study the education of children 3 to 10. Conclusions and recommendations will 
be reported within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our premise is that the causes of educational failure for most children are 
largely preventable," said Dr. David A. Hamburg, the corporation's president. 
"Given high-quality, developmentally appropriate activities at school or at 
home and in the larger community, most children will succeed up to their 
ability. The question is how to create the conditions for educational success 
on a large-enough scale to reach virtually all children." Gay Men Rate Love 
Over Sex 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men are more interested in romance and long-term relationships than in 
sex, according to a survey by a gay-oriented magazine. The results from the 
survey by the Advocate came from 13,000 responses received from its readers. 
The survey found that 80% of gay and bisexual men would rather live without sex 
than without love. Seventy-one percent also said they prefer long-term 
monogamous relationships to other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Popular images of gay men emphasize the quest for sexual gratification and 
underplay the quest for romance and companionship, but the results of this 
survey contradict that image," said Janet Lever, associate professor of 
sociology at Cal State University, Los Angeles, who analyzed the results. 
Picking Names Instead of Burdens 
</P>
<P>
 In Child magazine, Albert Mehrabian of Los Angeles, author of "The Name Game," 
and Dr. H. David Stein, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at 
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, offer new parents these 
pointers for choosing a winning name: 
</P>
<P>
 * Steer clear of names with ugly or sexual connotations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try not to choose names that rhyme. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be wary of names with strange or difficult spellings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Test each name by saying it aloud or using different permutations to make 
sure it's not problematic, such as Kristal Chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you must use a name because it is a family tradition but it seems a bit 
outdated or burdensome, allow your child to choose a middle name or a nickname 
to use every day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seek names that can be a source of pride or that sound friendly, outgoing, 
savvy or intelligent.

 The Scene: Monday's benefit premiere of New Line Cinema's "Corrina, Corrina" 
at the Mann National theater. A party followed at the Armand Hammer Museum. 
With the galleries open, it was like attending the most well-catered museum 
show in history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's stars, Whoopi Goldberg and Ray Liotta; co-stars 
Jenifer Lewis and Larry Miller; director Jessie Nelson, and producers Steve 
Tisch and Paula Mazur. Among the 1,000 guests were Liza Minnelli, Christine 
Lahti, Peter Falk, Leonard Nimoy, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, Mark Johnson, Barry 
Krost, Victoria Lund, David Colden, Verna Harrah, co-chairs Sid and Lorraine 
Sheinberg, and New Line execs Bob Shaye and Michael Lynne. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "People have been bitchin' at me for playing maids three times in 
movies," Goldberg said. "There's a reason why people are writing movies about 
them. These women gave a lot of people their first light of love. Then when 
they went off to be writers, they wrote homages to these women." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: Tickets were $250; more than $250,000 was netted for the 
Westside Children's Center. "This benefit provides a major part of our annual 
budget," said co-chair Lezlie Johnson. "All this money goes directly to caring 
for abused children." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Squeeze for Cash: In a constantly changing array of voices that included 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Groucho Marx, a television evangelist and President 
Clinton, Robin Williams ran through the theater's aisles auctioning a 
Mercedes-Benz S320 sedan. It went to Haim Saban, producer of the "Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers," for $65,000. When Saban asked if he had to pay cash, 
Williams said, "This is not a Colombian car dealership, man." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also Quoted: Paula Poundstone on why she's a foster parent with the Center: 
"For one thing, there's no way on this Earth I'm going to birth my own 
children. The government has actually requested that my family's genes be 
ceased." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: The enduring interweaving of casual, after-work and many things 
black. "I want a six-month moratorium on black Lycra," one woman said. "This 
town needs it for its own sanity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Buffets from Ambrosia with a 1950s fear-no-fat selection of comfort 
food. "It's worth the price of admission to see all these model/starlet types 
eating macaroni and cheese, and fried chicken," said a guest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Tattoo: Midway up the backs of her thighs, Ray Liotta's girlfriend, 
Michelle Grace, had a thumbnail-size heart on the left leg and four small stars 
on the right. They appeared and disappeared as her hemline rose and fell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Logic: "It's a beautiful, heartfelt movie that's impossible to 
sell," said an industry savant. "It needs to get the critics on board, get good 
word of mouth, have a decent opening weekend -- then it's got a chance."

ANOTHER HAZARD ON LINKS; INSECTS: GOLFERS AT GRIFFITH PARK ARE DONNING MOSQUITO 
NETTING TO KEEP PESKY GNATS OUT OF THEIR FACES. THE BUGS' APPEARANCE IS 
ATTRIBUTED TO A CLEANER LOS ANGELES RIVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Few golfers have pushed the fashion envelope beyond plaid pants. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 At the two Griffith Park golf courses, jungle wear has become de rigeur , with 
many morning duffers donning mosquito-net hoods before teeing off. The latest 
accessory has little to do with looks and everything to do with golf. And 
gnats. Which don't seem to mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you imagine trying to make a nice shot with 20 flies going up your 
nose?" asked Kevin Regan, pest-control adviser for the city Recreation and 
Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the infestation of so-called buffalo gnats in Los Angeles -- 
believed caused, ironically, by a cleaner Los Angeles River -- serious golfers 
have come up with the novel remedy. And at $3.99 apiece, the Griffith Park Golf 
Shop has done decent business, moving 500 of the white headdresses in three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course supervisors know of only one other way to combat the buzzing black 
clouds. "Smoking a cigar," said Ralph Hyde, a course supervisor. "Cigarettes 
don't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny insects, also known as black flies, are rising out of a 20-mile 
stretch of the Los Angeles River, from about Studio City to Elysian Park, in 
numbers never before seen -- or swatted or swallowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about anyone within a mile or so of the river who has cause to leave the 
house in the morning or evening is suffering -- even Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 An enterprising baseball fan and cosmetics saleswoman turned a few miserable 
Dodger players on to a skin conditioner known as an exceptional insect 
repellent with a lovely scent. 
</P>
<P>
 Several joggers and cyclists circling Griffith Park one recent evening 
employed the swatting-and-spitting method. Others strapped on surgical masks to 
avoid an unintentional after-dinner snack. 
</P>
<P>
 And as though a mouthful of insects weren't bad enough, the insects bite back. 
</P>
<P>
 Male flies spend their two or three days of life harmlessly, if obnoxiously, 
hunting for and eating pollen, according to Regan, but the females prefer 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The females have to feed on blood before they can return to the river and 
deposit their eggs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Known to scientists as Simuliidae simulius, the insects appear to be hatching 
in the greatest numbers along a stretch of the river that has a natural rock 
bottom, rather than concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The larvae attach themselves to river rocks before floating to the surface via 
air bubbles, drying themselves off and venturing off in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory scientists are working with to explain the extreme outbreak is an 
ironic one: More than a decade spent cleaning up reclaimed water from treatment 
plants may be aiding the hatch. The insects thrive in well-aerated, clean and 
fast-moving water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making a black fly habitat," said Mike Mullin, a water biologist for 
the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The insects love it. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted in part by irate golfers demanding their greens fees back, officials 
are formulating a battle plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District is planning a program where a 
naturally occurring bacteria that kills the insects in the larval stage would 
be injected into the stream. The district is working with the mayor's office to 
secure about $50,000 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria could be introduced as soon as Friday, according to abatement 
district spokeswoman LuAnn Munns, but it would probably be two weeks or so 
before the air begins to clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, those living, working or playing near the river will have to 
rely on personal ingenuity to repel the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfer John Michael -- not the jungle-net type -- took to pulling his black 
T-shirt over his face and making semi-blind chip shots at a Griffith Park 
course.

9 ARRESTED IN SLAYINGS AT PARTY IN SAN MARINO; CRIME: AUTHORITIES SAY SUSPECTS 
ARE GANG MEMBERS. POLICE CHIEF FEARS THAT WITNESSES MAY BE AFRAID TO TESTIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 More than 120 sheriff's deputies and police fanned out through the San Gabriel 
Valley on Tuesday to arrest nine alleged gang members in the June 5 slayings of 
two teen-agers at a high school graduation party in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered at being asked to leave the party on Lombardy Place after a dispute, 
gang members returned with semiautomatic weapons and sprayed 30 party-goers 
with bullets, authorities said. Dennis Buan, 18, of South Pasadena and David 
Hang, 15, of San Marino were killed and seven others were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as sheriff's detectives discussed how they overcame the initial 
reluctance of witnesses to identify the suspects, San Marino Police Chief Frank 
Wills said he fears that the witnesses may be unwilling to testify in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the witnesses are absolutely terrified," Wills said. "But they have 
strong hearts and souls and they might come around. We're hoping for a change 
of heart to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Wills added that police hope that other witnesses may yet come forward with 
information about the seven men and two women. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested Tuesday were identified by the Sheriff's Department as Cuong 
Chanh Phan, 18, of Monterey Park; Hu Tac Chan, 18, of South El Monte; Phuong 
Tung Nguyen, 19, of Canoga Park; Son That Ton, 19, of El Monte; Thuan Quang, 
25, of Garden Grove; Vi Quoc Cha, 18, and Long Huynh, 24, both of Rosemead; 
Tami Thi Tran, 19, of Westminster, and a 17-year-old Rosemead girl whose name 
was being withheld because she is a juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
 All were charged with two counts of murder and seven counts of attempted 
murder, said a Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A source involved in the investigation said that those arrested are mainly 
ethnic Chinese from Vietnam and belong to a well-established, multiethnic 
Vietnamese gang. The gang, begun 19 years ago, is believed to be responsible 
for two slayings earlier this year in the San Gabriel Valley. So far police 
have not gathered enough evidence to make arrests in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies, who were assisted by Monterey Park and San Marino police, served 
search warrants beginning at 7:30 a.m. Tuesday at 11 homes in Pasadena, 
Rosemead, El Monte, San Gabriel, Monterey Park, South Pasadena, Westminster and 
Stockton, said Sheriff's Department Chief of Detectives William Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities recovered five weapons: a 9-millimeter handgun, an AK-47 rifle, 
two shotguns and a .380-caliber handgun with an interchangeable barrel capable 
of firing different-caliber ammunition, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 A white Honda sedan, believed to be a getaway vehicle, was also seized. A 1990 
or 1991 Honda Civic was broadsided by a party-goer fleeing the shooting. Baker 
said the car that deputies recovered Tuesday has body damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings shocked the upscale and generally peaceful city, which has a 
population of 13,000. For the first time in its history, city officials offered 
a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the 
assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino police said they found themselves grappling with cultural 
differences in dealing with residents of Asian heritage who make up nearly a 
third of the city's population. 
</P>
<P>
 Although as many as 15 party-goers witnessed the shooting, few came forward 
initially with information, Wills said. Detectives said Asian youths told them 
that they feared reprisals and did not want to be disgraced through association 
with police or the shooting, even as innocent victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were stymied for more than two months. San Marino police 
consulted Asian task forces in other cities to help bridge the communication 
gap. 
</P>
<P>
 A break in the case came when sheriff's detectives from the auto theft task 
force, who were investigating an unrelated carjacking that occurred before the 
shootings, discovered information that led to Tuesday's arrests, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, given at a posh San Marino house, attracted more than 100 youths, 
many from out of town, drawn by a flyer that advertised an "End of the Year 
Jam." The shootings were sparked by a dispute between the party's disc jockey 
and late-arriving gang members, police said.

EX-JUDGE GIVEN JAIL TERM IN FATAL CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Compton Municipal Court judge convicted in a drunk driving accident 
that left his female companion dead was sentenced Tuesday to a year in county 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys had argued for a unique sentence -- one without jail time -- 
for Albert Garcia, 46. Garcia surrendered to police four hours after leaving 
the scene of the Feb. 21 crash in Eagle Rock in which Josie Smith, a 
35-year-old mother of three, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, who under state law could have received a sentence ranging from 
probation to five years in prison, spoke in a trembling voice to Smith's 
family, bringing some in the Downtown courtroom to tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask for forgiveness from Josie's family," Garcia said. "I beg their 
forgiveness, but even as I ask for it, I ask for too much. I ask for something 
that may be humanly impossible to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Albert Matthews noted that Garcia has no prior 
convictions, "has lived up to this point an exemplary life -- been a role model 
for those who live in the barrios and ghettos of Los Angeles . . . has already 
suffered the loss of a loved one and the loss of his own judicial position." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, appointed to his judgeship seven years ago, pleaded no contest to 
drunk driving, hit-and-run and vehicular manslaughter charges July 6 and 
resigned from his judgeship that day. His attorneys, many colleagues and even 
some members of Smith's family asked Matthews not to sentence Garcia to jail, 
in light of his remorse and years of community service. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's suffered internally, and will suffer for the rest of his life," said 
Armando Montes, Smith's brother, who urged the judge not to "treat him (Garcia) 
like a criminal, but like a human being who had a tragic flaw." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcia remains married, he had hoped to spend the rest of his life 
with Smith, his attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some members of Smith's family thought Garcia got off easy. "The guy left 
her there with her body exposed . . . ," said Angie Montes, Smith's sister, 
"and he gets just one year jail time?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He should get the max," said Smith's 13-year-old son, Gus Pelez, who said he 
thought Garcia was treated lightly because he had been a judge. "He's a 
criminal. He broke the law, and he knew the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys had argued that Garcia was in shock when he wandered into 
traffic after his Mercedes-Benz crashed after getting off the Ventura Freeway. 
Smith's body was hurled onto Colorado Boulevard in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia refused to comment on his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was also given a three-year suspended sentence and three years 
probation. He will avoid state prison if he complies with the terms of his 
probation, which requires him to remain in alcohol counseling for three years. 
In addition, he must pay $7,000 in reparations to Smith's children. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia will not enter jail until Oct. 4, while his attorneys attempt to make 
sure he will be safe in county detention. "If any inmates find out who he is, 
he's dead," said attorney Robin J. Yanes. Garcia was released on his own 
recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcia's attorneys argued that he already is suffering for what he 
did, Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Latin told the judge that "we all expect that 
justice will be fairly administered without regard to people's position in 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who better knows the dangers of driving under the influence than someone who 
has heard dozens of these cases and seen the sort of destruction it causes?" 
asked Latin, who later said he was satisfied with the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Garcia's colleagues, including several prosecutors and judges, gave 
brief statements lauding Garcia's professional and personal conduct. The East 
Los Angeles native was raised by a single mother and worked his way through 
college and law school, witnesses attested. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garcia made it clear Tuesday that he knew his judicial career was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been addressed (today) as Judge Garcia, but I'm not a judge," Garcia 
said in court. "I don't have the right to be referred to as a judge anymore."

 One of the more obscure, if high-paying, jobs in local public education was 
filled Tuesday when a divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors named a 
former Kentucky official and noted reformer to be superintendent of the county 
Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald W. Ingwerson was awarded a three-year contract during a closed-door 
session on a 3-2 vote. Supervisors Deane Dana and Ed Edelman voted no, an 
indication of the controversy surrounding the appointment to what historically 
has been a low-profile but increasingly powerful post. 
</P>
<P>
 The new superintendent's salary will be set by the appointed county Board of 
Education. His predecessor, Stuart Gothold, who is retiring at the end of the 
month, earns $118,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingwerson, 60, who holds a doctorate in school administration from the 
University of Wyoming, was superintendent of Jefferson County Schools in 
Louisville for 12 years before leaving in 1993 to head the Galef Institute, a 
private school-reform organization in Santa Monica. He previously worked as a 
teacher and counselor, then administrator in several Southern California school 
districts, including Temple City, Glendora and Orange Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Jefferson County, Ingwerson implemented Kentucky's highly touted 
reform effort -- which overhauled financing of schools and demanded higher 
results -- and became a figure in the national drive to improve public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was named Kentucky Superintendent of the Year in 1992, the Louisville 
Courier-Journal published articles disputing academic improvement claims. The 
paper also ran stories about Ingwerson's hiring of school district employees to 
perform work on his real estate properties. In the stories, Ingwerson denied 
doing anything improper. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman said his vote against Ingwerson was prompted by his strong belief that 
"there were much better candidates." Supervisors had interviewed four other 
finalists: two local superintendents, Robert Aguilar of the Norwalk-La Mirada 
district and Ronald Hockwalt of the Walnut Valley schools, and two 
administrators from the county Office of Education, Gilberto Anzaldua and 
Jennifer Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman said he and the other supervisors knew about the Louisville 
controversies, but he declined to say whether they played a role in his vote 
against Ingwerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, one of those voting 
for the new superintendent, said she was impressed by Ingwerson's national 
stature, his support in the business community and his tremendous record, 
especially in improving achievement among minority students. Burke added that 
supervisors looked at the Kentucky controversies but felt that they were a very 
small part of Ingwerson's overall track record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingwerson is taking a job that is little known outside local education 
leadership circles. The superintendent runs the county Office of Education, 
which advises and provides support to 94 school districts and operates a 
variety of specialized schools and programs. The agency has 3,400 employees and 
a $339-million budget. In recent years, as increasing numbers of financially 
strapped California districts began heading into the red, the Legislature gave 
county superintendents greater power to intervene to keep the districts 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothold, a respected educator who held the county post for 14 years before 
accepting a teaching post with USC's School of Education, told colleagues that 
he preferred the change to let him work behind the scenes in a style where he 
felt most effective.

GETTING TEED OFF BY GNATS; GRIFFITH PARK: THE CLEANER RIVER IS BLAMED FOR 
INFESTATION OF FLIES THAT'S TAKING FUN OUT OF GOLF, CYCLING, JOGGING, BASEBALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Few golfers have pushed the fashion envelope beyond plaid pants. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 At the two Griffith Park golf courses, jungle wear has become de rigueur , 
with many morning duffers donning mosquito-net hoods before teeing off. The 
latest accessory has little to do with looks -- obviously -- and everything to 
do with golf. And gnats. Which don't seem to mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you imagine trying to make a nice shot with 20 flies going up your 
nose?" asked Kevin Regan, pest-control adviser for the city Recreation and 
Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the most massive infestation of so-called buffalo gnats in Los 
Angeles -- believed caused by a cleaner Los Angeles River -- serious golfers 
have come up with the novel remedy. And at $3.99 apiece, the Griffith Park Golf 
Shop has done decent business, moving 500 of the white headdresses in three 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course supervisors know of only one other way to combat the buzzing black 
clouds. "Smoking a cigar," said Ralph Hyde, a course supervisor. "Cigarettes 
don't work." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny insects, also known as black flies, are rising out of a 20-mile 
stretch of the L.A. River, from about Studio City to Elysian Park, in numbers 
never before seen -- or swatted at or swallowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about anyone within a mile or so of the river who has cause to leave the 
house in the morning or evening is suffering -- even Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 An enterprising baseball fan and Avon saleswoman turned a few miserable Dodger 
players on to a skin conditioner called Skin So Soft, known for years in 
outdoor circles as an exceptional insect repellent with a lovely scent. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was reportedly so impressed that trainers bought the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Several joggers and cyclists circling Griffith Park one recent evening used 
the swatting-and-spitting method. Others strapped on surgical masks to avoid an 
unintentional after-dinner snack. 
</P>
<P>
 And as though a mouthful of insects wasn't bad enough, the insects bite back. 
</P>
<P>
 Male flies spend their two or three days of life harmlessly, if obnoxiously, 
hunting for and eating pollen, according to Regan, but the females prefer 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The females have to feed on blood before they can return to the river and 
deposit their eggs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Known to scientists as simuliidae simulius , the insects appear to be hatching 
in the greatest numbers along a stretch of the river that has a natural, 
rock-covered bottom, rather than concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 The larvae attach themselves to river rocks before floating to the surface via 
air bubbles, drying themselves off and venturing off in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory scientists are working with to explain the extreme outbreak is an 
ironic one: more than a decade spent cleaning up reclaimed water from treatment 
plants may be aiding the hatch. The insects thrive on well-aerated, clean and 
fast-moving water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making a black fly habitat," said Mike Mullin, a water biologist with 
the city Environmental Monitoring Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in many summers past, the river was dry this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 The insects love it now. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted in part by irate golfers demanding their greens fees back, officials 
are formulating a battle plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District is planning a program in which 
naturally occurring bacteria that kill the insects in the larval stage would be 
injected into the stream. The district is working with the mayor's office to 
secure about $50,000 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria could be introduced as soon as Friday, according to abatement 
district spokeswoman LuAnn Munns, but it would likely be two weeks or so before 
the air begins to clear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, riverside residents will have to rely on personal ingenuity 
to repel the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfer John Michael -- not the jungle-net hood type -- took to pulling his 
black T-shirt over his face and making semi-blind chip shots at the Griffith 
Park course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore a blue shirt the other day and could see right through," he said.

2 BOYS PLAYING WITH CIGARETTE LIGHTER ADMIT STARTING BLAZE; LEONA VALLEY: 
NEIGHBORS CREDIT FIREFIGHTERS AND EACH OTHER WITH LIMITING DAMAGE TO CLOSE-KNIT 
COMMUNITY. ABOUT 500 ACRES BURNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two boys playing with a cigarette lighter admitted that they accidentally 
touched off a Leona Valley brush fire that charred about 500 acres and caused 
an estimated $1 million in damage, investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire destroyed part of one house, 10 smaller buildings, 15 vehicles and an 
ostrich, but neighbors credit firefighters and each other with limiting the 
damage in this close-knit west Antelope Valley community, known for its horse 
ranches and cherry orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, ages 9 and 10, were released to their parents after telling 
sheriff's investigators that they had set the fire, which started near Leona 
Avenue and 107th Street West, Deputy George Ducoulombier said. The boys, whose 
names were withheld because of their ages, will likely not face prosecution but 
will be referred for counseling, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which ignited Monday afternoon, was still burning in an uninhabited 
hilly area Tuesday, but firefighters expected to have it fully contained by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 One person was reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryce Worthington, 56, suffered minor burns to his eyes, throat and lungs 
while using a garden hose to fend off flames that were eating away at his 
six-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, Worthington, a general contractor, said he was grateful 
that his wife and 11 children escaped injury and that generous neighbors had 
helped save many of the family's valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the blaze took a terrible toll, he said. Several of Worthington's 
children were badly shaken by the fire, and it consumed several precious 
keepsakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost some paintings that were priceless to us because they were painted by 
my mother," Worthington said. "She died in January, so they can't be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire also gutted five bedrooms and a glass-enclosed sun porch. The intense 
heat caused an aerosol can to explode and fly through a wooden door. 
Worthington estimated that damage to the structure and the furnishings would 
surpass $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, Landon Worthington, 26, the only one of his children who does not 
live in the house, said he rushed to the scene because he knew that his father 
would not evacuate the home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the type who would want to put the fire out himself," his son said. "It 
would take a fireman with a gun to get him out of the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Worthington himself shrugged off the danger. "If I hadn't stayed, the house 
would be gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance behind Worthington's house, David Garcia was tallying his 
losses. Garcia, along with his wife, Eleanor, and daughter, Kristina, moved 
from San Diego County a month ago into a mobile home on the Worthington 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 While his wife was registering their daughter for school Monday afternoon, 
Garcia was napping inside when one of the Worthington children knocked on the 
door and urged him to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I opened the door, I saw all the fire on the hillside," he said. "There 
were all these rabbits running away. I just grabbed a couple of jewelry boxes 
and a couple of Bibles, then I ran over to help Mr. Worthington." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire destroyed the mobile home and its contents. The Garcias, who were 
uninsured, said they lost their furniture, family pictures, birth certificates 
and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything of importance was in there," Eleanor Garcia said. "What we're 
wearing is all we have left." 
</P>
<P>
 A Leona Valley feed store owner allowed the family to stay in his trailer 
Monday night, and American Red Cross workers were trying to arrange other help 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters said far more dwellings would have been lost had Leona Valley 
residents not been diligent about clearing brush away from their houses. 
Several residents also credited neighbors with helping to evacuate farm animals 
and keeping the fire away from structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Crandall, 64, a retired aerospace engineer, said he was running an 
errand Monday afternoon when he spotted smoke coming from the direction of his 
house. By the time he arrived, Crandall said, his neighbors were evacuating his 
horses and a minister was hosing down Crandall's barn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a real good neighborhood system here," he said. "Everybody helps 
everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Crandall said sheriff's deputies drove through with a loudspeaker Monday 
afternoon, urging him and his neighbors to evacuate. "Nobody paid any 
attention," he said. "It's just a real strong sense of pride in our community. 
We're going to save ourselves if we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road from Crandall, Dick White, who owns the 120-acre Rancho Buena 
Vista with his wife, Valerie, was afraid that history would repeat itself. The 
Whites lost their previous house to a brush fire that raced through Leona 
Valley in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But except for a few scorched fences, White had no property damage.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LYNWOOD; MORE THAN A 
TON OF COCAINE DISCOVERED IN TRUCK-TRAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A truck-trailer that was longer on the outside than it was on the inside led 
U.S. Customs agents to seize more than a ton of cocaine that had been smuggled 
in from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The seemingly empty 40-foot truck-trailer had aroused suspicions last week at 
the Otay Mesa border crossing near San Diego when inspectors using a laser 
range-finder discovered a three-foot discrepancy between the inside and outside 
measurements of the trailer compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 A "density meter" and a drug-sniffing dog heightened the suspicion, and the 
truck and its driver were kept under surveillance en route to the Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents searched the trailer Saturday after its arrival at a truck yard in the 
3000 block of Martin Luther King Boulevard. They found 173 blocks of cocaine 
hidden in a three-foot deep compartment behind a false wall in the front of the 
trailer compartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,064 pounds of cocaine has an estimated street value of $62 million. 
Three men, including the driver, were arrested and could face up to life in 
federal prison for drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 Customs agents said it was the second cocaine seizure exceeding a ton in the 
Los Angeles area in the past three months. In May, customs agents found more 
than a ton of cocaine hidden in plastic tubing that had been shipped into Los 
Angeles International Airport from Mexico.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $25,000 
REWARD POSTED IN SLAYING OF PASTOR, 81 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council posted a $25,000 reward Tuesday for information 
leading to the arrest of suspects in the recent murder of an 81-year-old 
minister and grandmother at her Mid-City apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officials asked the council to offer the reward 
to aid their investigation into the death of Blanche Thomas, who was bound, 
gagged and sexually assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said they had run out of leads without identifying a suspect.  
</P>
<P>
 "They believe there is information out in the community that could corroborate 
some of their information and lead to a suspect," Deputy City Atty. Gail 
Weingart said. 
</P>
<P>
 As pastor of the small Mt. Zion Churches United parish in the Mid-City area, 
Thomas worked to comfort the elderly, ease the plight of the homeless and curb 
the spread of illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that someone entered Thomas' apartment in the 1700 block of South 
La Brea Avenue on July 25 between midnight and dawn. Some items were stolen, 
but police believe that the intruder was more intent on violence than on theft.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; COUNTY OFFERS 
COMMUNITY MEDIATOR TO CALM TENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to calm reaction to the videotaped beating in Compton of a 17-year-old 
Latino youth by a black policeman, Los Angeles County officials are offering 
the assistance of the county ombudsman and Human Relations Commission to serve 
as "nonpartisan" mediators. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to offer the services for 
90 days, to promote "community dialogue and understanding, neighborhood peace 
and racial harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 "The level of emotion being experienced in Compton and the questions being 
raised about the long-term impact of this incident should be addressed in a 
sensitive and forthright manner," said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who, 
with Supervisor Gloria Molina, sponsored the motion. "We do not need more 
divisiveness and ethnic tensions in L.A. County." 
</P>
<P>
 The July 29 incident focused attention on festering racial tensions in a city 
that is largely governed by black officials but whose population is 
increasingly Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino leaders have compared the incident to the videotaped beating of black 
motorist Rodney G. King by white police officers. Protesters have gathered 
outside Compton City Hall, demanding apologies from the mayor and the 
resignation of the police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 No Compton officials could be reached to comment on the county's offer. LOS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; SCIENCE CAMP GIVES LESSONS FOR FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Give this Studio City teen-ager a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 And she'll dissect it. 
</P>
<P>
 Human cadavers, contemplation of the fourth dimension and the exploration of 
the outdoors were among 18-year-old Mayling Wu's summer camp experiences last 
month at the National Youth Science Camp in Bartow, W. Va. Every year, two 
students from each of the 50 states are invited to participate in the 
all-expenses-paid honors camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at a photograph she took of the severed hand she studied this summer, 
Wu said, "I feel so sorry for the people who had to develop the film." 
</P>
<P>
 As a California delegate, Wu attended lectures given by noted scientists from 
NASA and the National Institutes of Health and participated in seminars on 
marine biology and organ transplantation. After the science classes, the 
campers took on outdoor activities like rock climbing and hiking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was really scared that we were going to a nerd camp," Wu recalled, 
but she said she was pleasantly surprised to find that her new friends were 
outgoing and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was egotistical. It was more of a social atmosphere," said Wu, who 
said she appreciated having no grades or competition at the science camp. She 
graduated with a 4.3 grade-point average from North Hollywood High School's 
highly gifted program. 
</P>
<P>
 With plans to be a premed student at UC Berkeley, which she will attend in the 
fall, Wu said the camp gave her a realistic look at her future career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to dissect a human hand, and I now know I'm not going to faint," 
Wu said. She also was among a group of students invited to watch open-heart 
surgery at a Charleston, W. Va., medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the intensive science education, Wu and her peers were taught 
kayaking, cave exploration and rock climbing, which she said was scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really have to trust them," Wu said of her fellow rock climbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at her camp experience, Wu said she liked being isolated as she 
studied and played in a remote region of West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no TVs. We didn't know who won the World Cup or what was going on 
with O.J. Simpson," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The science camp is funded by the state of West Virginia and through 
contributions from corporations such as Union Carbide and Bell Atlantic. MAKI

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; CLAMOR OVER FALSE 
ALARM CALLS CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With burglar alarms sending out alerts from thousands of buildings around the 
clock, all over town, the Los Angeles Police Department and the alarm industry 
are at odds over what happens next. 
</P>
<P>
 To police, the number of false alarms is alarming. 
</P>
<P>
 The time wasted responding to them takes officers away from dealing with real 
crimes, the LAPD complains. 
</P>
<P>
 So, hoping she had come up with a way to end months of debate over the issue, 
Los Angeles City Councilman Laura Chick on Tuesday proposed a measure that has 
the backing of the alarm industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal by Chick, who represents the southwestern San Fernando 
Valley, alarm companies would have to call the owners or managers of 
alarm-equipped buildings by telephone to verify the need for a police presence 
after an alarm is triggered. 
</P>
<P>
 If a building occupant confirmed that the alarm was triggered accidentally, 
the alarm company could tell police to ignore the call. But if the alarm 
company could not verify whether the call was genuine, police would be 
dispatched as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the most recent episode in a long and complex debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a complaint to the LAPD by an alarm company, which was not 
publicly identified, triggered an internal investigation into allegations that 
officers supplied the City Council with bogus information, exaggerating the 
number of false alarms to ensure the passage of a tough ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no word on whether the investigation uncovered any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick offered her measure as a compromise with an ordinance proposed several 
weeks ago by Councilman Marvin Braude which drew howls of protest from the 
alarm industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Braude's measure, police would not respond to alarm calls until a 
break-in was verified by a building occupant or the alarm company, either by a 
security guard or video surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Chick's measure attempts to withhold police response to alarm calls 
that are proven false, Braude's proposal would delay all police responses until 
alarm firms verified that the calls were authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Police backed Braude's proposal but alarm company representatives said the 
cost of adding security guards or surveillance cameras would make owning an 
alarm system too expensive for many residents and business owners. The average 
monthly fee for a residential system, they said, could jump from $25 to about 
$55. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Nigro, president of the Los Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn., 
commended Chick for her compromise attempt, saying it "serves as a very good 
starting point" and would not increase the cost of owning an alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the City Council voted to send it to the Public Safety Committee 
for further study -- which infuriated Chick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about public safety," she said. "This is supposed to be our No. 1 
declared priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's measure would also impose an $80 fine on the alarm system owner for 
each false alarm call after the third call within a 12-month period. Police 
currently impose fines after the fourth call. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, 95% of the 161,000 alarm calls made last year 
were false and accounted for 18% of all calls for police service, costing the 
city $2.8 million in lost police time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's proposal would also make it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up 
to $1,000 and one year in jail, to fail to register an alarm system with 
police. Currently, only about a third of the city's 300,000 commercial alarm 
systems have the proper permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick acknowledged that her measure may not reduce the number of false alarm 
calls as drastically as Braude's proposal. But she insisted that a compromise 
measure is better than none. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is a good beginning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some council members criticized Chick for bringing the idea to the council 
before the Public Safety Committee had a chance to study it. The committee is 
scheduled to hear the proposal on Aug. 29.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WILMINGTON; TEXACO 
FINED $550,000 FOR POLLUTION VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc. will pay a $550,000 penalty to the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District in a settlement stemming from a 1992 oil 
refinery explosion and 28 other violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The district uncovered the violations of state and district rules during 
periodic inspections at Texaco's Wilmington refinery between August, 1991, and 
January, 1994, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant violations grew out of the Oct. 8, 1992, refinery 
explosion and fire that shook a wide area of the South Bay, injuring 16 people 
and forcing evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Texaco was specifically cited for creating a public nuisance as a result of 
significant air emissions caused by the explosion, said Kurt Wiese, an attorney 
with the district. A Texaco spokeswoman, Barbara Kornylo, said the oil company 
decided to settle to avoid costly litigation and is not admitting any 
wrongdoing.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
ENGINEERS SCALE BACK PLAN TO MOVE CONTAMINATED SILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with strong opposition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has scaled back 
a plan to haul tons of contaminated silt and sand from Marina del Rey to the 
Port of Los Angeles to use as fill for a new marina wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a concession aimed at winning approval for the controversial project, the 
Corps said it will seek permission to immediately remove only 130,000 cubic 
yards of the sediment, which threatens to choke off boating at the county-owned 
marina, instead of the 530,000 cubic yards it had proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Tuesday came as the Corps asked the state Coastal Commission, 
meeting in Long Beach, to delay until September its request to remove the 
sediment, place it in special plastic tubes and bury the tubes in a shallow 
area of the harbor at San Pedro as part of the port's $150-million expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have warned that the dredging could cause environmentally damaging 
materials to spread at the mouth of the marina. They also say that the 
containers, which have never been approved for such a project in California, 
may leak once they are placed in the harbor.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GROUP ASKS 
STATE TO PROBE POSSIBLE RIORDAN CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political watchdog group Common Cause asked for a state investigation into 
whether Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan violated conflict-of-interest laws by 
taking an action affecting a company in which he was an investor. 
</P>
<P>
 The request to the Fair Political Practices Commission was similar to one made 
earlier by state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) following a Times article in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an aide to Riordan said that on Tuesday the mayor sold 350,000 
shares of stock in the company, Tetra Tech Inc., leaving him with about a 2% 
stake in the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who serves as a board member of the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority, has said that he had no idea in August of last year that his 
championing of $97 million in funding for a Downtown Los Angeles-to-Pasadena 
rail project would activate a $1.05-million contract held by Tetra Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan at the time owned $9.75 million in stock in the Pasadena engineering 
services company, his largest holding. The mayor also has said that he sought 
funding for the rail line only to resolve a dispute among MTA board members.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LEONA VALLEY; 2 BOYS 
ADMIT ACCIDENTALLY STARTING FIRE, PROBERS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two boys admitted that by playing with a cigarette lighter they accidentally 
touched off a Leona Valley brush fire that charred about 500 acres and caused 
an estimated $1 million damage, investigators said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire destroyed part of one house, 10 smaller buildings, 15 vehicles and 
killed an ostrich in this close-knit West Antelope Valley community, known for 
its horse ranches and cherry orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys, ages 9 and 10, were released to their parents after telling 
sheriff's investigators they had set the fire, which started near Leona Avenue 
and 107th Street West, said Deputy George Ducoulombier. The boys, whose names 
were withheld because of their age, will probably not face prosecution but will 
be referred for counseling, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The brush fire, which ignited Monday afternoon, was still burning in an 
uninhabited hilly area on Tuesday, but firefighters expected to have it fully 
contained by today.  
</P>
<P>
 One person was reported injured. Bryce Worthington suffered minor burns to his 
eyes, throat and lungs while using a garden hose to fend off the flames that 
were eating away at his six-bedroom house. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Worthington, a 56-year-old general contractor, said he was 
grateful that his wife and 11 children escaped injury and that generous 
neighbors had helped save many of the family's valuables. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire gutted five bedrooms and a glass-enclosed sun porch. Worthington 
estimated that damage to the structure and the furnishings would exceed 
$200,000.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
OKS PLAN TO SET ASIDE $2 MILLION FOR KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least $2 million of the $3.8-million judgment in Rodney G. King's civil 
rights lawsuit will be set aside for him under a disbursement plan approved 
Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 At the request of King's lawyer, the plan guarantees that the beating victim 
will receive a steady income from two $1-million funds to be managed by two 
annuity companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sound and prudent way to apportion that money," Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky said. "It's got everybody's agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Lerman, King's lawyer, said he did not know yet if the payouts will be 
made over a set period or King's lifetime.  
</P>
<P>
 The remaining $1.8 million will be split among King, lawyers that represented 
him over the years, investigators who aided them and hospitals and clinics that 
treated him, Lerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies still must determine how much the city will 
pay in attorneys' fees for King.

GLENDALE BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BANK ROBBER SUSPECT REJECTS PLEA BARGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused in 30 armed robberies and known to police as the "Old Man 
Bandit" has refused a prosecutor's offer to forgo a trial and spend 40 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of up to 60 years for Edwin Loftus, 
60, of Glendale, who is believed to be responsible for a string of holdups 
outside banks in Glendale and the San Fernando Valley from 1989 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crimes, merchants en route to make large deposits said they were 
approached by a well-dressed, grandfatherly man who demanded cash. Police 
believe Loftus used a police scanner to avoid being caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Loftus is scheduled for an Aug. 18 pretrial conference in Los Angeles Superior 
Court, and another plea bargain may be offered at that time, prosecutors said. 
His trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Loftus was arrested by Glendale police in April, 1993 after a high-speed chase 
that ended in the Los Feliz area. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; STANDARDS WEIGHED FOR CABLE FRANCHISEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale City Council is expected to adopt a cable television ordinance 
that spells out various service standards to be met by Sammons Communications, 
the city's embattled cable franchisee. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope that the ordinance -- a basic skeleton for future 
agreements with any cable provider -- will give them leverage in their 
protracted contract-renewal negotiations with Sammons, which have been in the 
works for more than three years.  
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was introduced Tuesday and must be adopted by a second council 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most significant component of the ordinance is that it sets some very 
specific customer service criteria," said Steve Adams, an assistant in the city 
manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, minimum response times will be established for customer telephone 
calls, complaints and requests for repairs -- three concerns raised by viewers 
in past surveys conducted by the city, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, city officials admit that the proposed ordinance will do little to 
compel Sammons to make other improvements that residents sought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem is the quality of transmission, and I'd like to see some 
additional channels," said B. Ritchie Payne, 73, a Glendale resident and 
longtime Sammons subscriber. Payne said he doubts that the ordinance will help 
the city extract any changes from Sammons. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's 15-year pact with Sammons expired April 28. In early April, the 
council extended the franchise 90 days in hopes that a renewal agreement would 
be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the company has been given until Oct. 28 to submit its "final and 
best offer" to the city. If no agreement can be reached by then, a legal battle 
could ensue, although cable service would not likely be interrupted, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators for the city and Sammons have declined to comment on the details 
of their talks, although city officials have said they want Sammons to provide 
more channels and better service. STEVE RYFLE

SUMMER'S STAR SHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Perseid meteor shower may be unusually intense this year. A meteor 
storm could occur Thursday night and Friday morning, climaxing about 3 a.m. 
Friday, Pacific time. Astronomers are predicting that viewers in dark locations 
with a good view of the sky could see at least one meteor per minute -- or up 
to several hundred per hour. The Makings of Meteors 
</P>
<P>
 * Often called "shooting stars," meteors are particles of dust shed by comets. 
Streaks of light are produced as the particles fall through the atmosphere and 
are burned up by friction when they collide with air molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meteors fall every night, but when the Earth passes through the orbit of an 
active comet, meteors fall in a shower of up to a few dozen meteors per hour. 
The Comet Swift-Tuttle 
</P>
<P>
 * Every August the Earth passes near the orbit of the comet Swift-Tuttle and 
we see the so-called Perseid meteors, which radiate from the direction of the 
constellation Perseus. 
</P>
<P>
 * This comet reached its closest point to Earth in 1992, as it does once every 
130 years. For several years before and after its return, showers can be 
intense because the Earth is passing through the part of the comet's orbit 
where a lot of dust was recently shed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The August shower was especially brilliant in 1991 and 1992, and less so in 
1993 because it peaked before dark on the West Coast. For the next two years 
there are still chances for bright August fireworks. Tips for Sky-Watchers 
</P>
<P>
 * The best time for viewing will be late Thursday night until 3 a.m. Friday. 
Meteors will also fall tonight and Friday, but with less intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, get away from city lights. Griffith Observatory is too close to 
Downtown Los Angeles' bright lights for good visibility and will not be open 
late for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * For more information on celestial events, call the observatory's Sky Report 
at (213) 663-8171. For program information, call (213) 664-1191.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; PANEL SUPPORTS PLANS FOR LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles city panel has backed plans for the long-awaited construction of 
a branch library in Lake View Terrace and launched an effort to identify 
funding and a site for the proposed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Board of Library Commissioners on Monday said they wanted to 
move quickly to build the branch library that Lake View Terrace residents have 
been requesting for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to pursue it aggressively," said Bob Reagan, library spokesman. 
Reagan said Commission Vice President Roberta Weintraub will meet with other 
city officials to hasten construction of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 A library department report says a minimum of 27,000 square feet of land is 
needed to build a 10,500-square-foot library that proponents say should be a 
"state-of-the-art" facility that can also be used for community meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials estimate it could cost $3.7 million to buy the land and 
design and build the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the Lake View Terrace community, 
has already persuaded the City Council to set aside $1 million for the new 
library from a $5-million trust fund created to benefit the communities near 
the Lopez Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a private developer, American Housing Construction Inc., has 
offered to donate a 15,000-square-foot parcel on Foothill Boulevard near Terra 
Bella Street to build the library as part of an 88-unit condominium development 
called "Library Village." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan said the land offered by American Housing may be too small for the 
project and that the city is not going to limit its review of potential library 
sites to the donated parcel. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AARP HELPS WITH JOB-HUNT SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Burgess never thought he would end up here, at a job re-entry program 
run by the American Assn. of Retired Persons. After all, he is only 44. 
</P>
<P>
 But after he left his job as a program executive in charge of 39 television 
shows at ABC-TV in 1990 to pursue a writing career, the Reseda resident spent 
four years learning how hard it was to sell scripts from the other side of the 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 So, needing to support his wife and two children, Burgess decided to get back 
into the business again with a full-time job. But the doors have been closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like being a professional baseball player " Burgess said Tuesday 
at the orientation workshop at Los Angeles Valley College. "When you hit 40, 
you are over the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 From bank tellers to mosquito killers, the dozen people who attended the 
opening orientation of the AARP Works program had similar stories to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie Gardner of West Los Angeles was turned down for a bank teller job last 
month despite four years experience as a teller at a bank across the street in 
Brentwood. She is in her 50s. "They are looking for the energetic, young 
28-hip-year-old," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you fill out the application, you can feel them counting the years," 
said Howard Brown of Los Angeles, 55, who works six months a year for Los 
Angeles County as a mosquito abater. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they are asking themselves, 'Will he fit into our company at this 
age?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although age discrimination is illegal when hiring, volunteer consultant 
Rochelle Linick said many employers find ways to skirt the issue by saying 
applicants are "overqualified."  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the AARP provides the seminars to help middle-aged and senior 
workers re-enter the work force. On Tuesday, AARP volunteer trainer Stan 
Liebling, 77, of Woodland Hills, suggested not taking "overqualified" for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask the interviewer why you are overqualified," Liebling said. Then, he 
added, tell them about the advantages older workers bring to a job, such as 
stability and experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants are still being accepted for the six workshop sessions, which 
continue through Aug. 26. The program, whose only cost is a $20 materials fee, 
will teach self-assessment, job search skills, interview practice and 
networking to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Burgess has already learned that networking is not enough when times 
are tough.  
</P>

LOCAL ELECTIONS / SOUTH EL MONTE; VOTERS REJECT CARD CLUB BY WIDE MARGIN; 
GAMBLING: FOES SAY THE PLAN'S BACKERS FAILED TO PUT PROMISED BENEFITS FOR THE 
CITY, INCLUDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REVENUE, IN WRITING.

 Voters in South El Monte on Tuesday overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to 
become the first San Gabriel Valley city to allow a card club, brushing aside 
promoters' promises of millions in revenue for the cash-starved city. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in this 2.8-square-mile community -- like those last year in 
Bellflower, West Hollywood, Pico Rivera, Lynwood, Stanton and Cypress -- 
defeated the proposal to allow a card club after a bitter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, "no" votes outnumbered "yes" votes in all of the city's seven 
precincts. About 32% of the city's registered voters turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised at the result," said Elaine Trahan, leader of the 
anti-casino committee. "When a City Council tries to put something over on 
residents, they will only take so much. We said enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilant opponents said the referendum lost partially because the card club 
failed to deliver a written proposal on how the club would benefit the 
community. "They promised a crock of gold without any proof," Trahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiery campaign pitted San Gabriel Enterprises, which hoped to construct a 
$16-million club, and its local supporters, including two former mayors, 
against the residents' group and local Catholic priests, who said the club's 
150 gaming tables would spark crime, prostitution and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents criticized the planned location of the club at Santa Anita Avenue 
just south of the Pomona Freeway and about 200 yards from South El Monte's 
recently built high school. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Enterprises, which proposed a 22-acre, 60,000-square-foot card 
club, paid the city $34,000 to hold the election and invested about the same 
amount on a campaign committee only to see the proposition defeated by nearly a 
3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone calls to the campaign headquarters were not returned after Tuesday's 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, backed by two former mayors -- Raul Pardo and Jim Kelly -- 
persuaded the City Council in May to put the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the campaign literature opposing the club came from the Alliance for 
Safe Communities and Residents to Protect Our Neighborhoods, groups associated 
with existing card club owners that together spent $15,950 fighting the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other San Gabriel Valley cities are considering card clubs. In Pomona, two 
regal Las Vegas-style clubs could be built if the City Council overcomes legal 
challenges from surrounding cities. In Irwindale, the issue will be decided 
sometime after November. EDITION-TIME ELECTION RETURNS

NEW PLAN ON ALARMS INTRODUCED; SECURITY: COUNCILWOMAN'S PROPOSAL CALLS FOR 
FIRMS TO VERIFY NEED FOR POLICE. IT IS LATEST BID TO REDUCE FALSE ALERTS AND 
HAS INDUSTRY'S BACKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to end months of debate over how to reduce the number of false-alarm 
calls to police, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Laura Chick proposed a measure 
Tuesday that has the backing of the security alarm industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chick's proposal, alarm companies would try to call the owners of 
automated residential and commercial alarm systems by telephone to verify the 
need for a police response after an alarm is triggered. 
</P>
<P>
 If a building occupant confirmed that the alarm was triggered accidentally, 
the alarm company would tell police to ignore the call. But if the company 
could not verify whether the call was genuine, police would be dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the latest effort to cut down on the thousands of false-alarm calls that 
police say take valuable time away from real emergencies, and also the most 
recent episode in a long, sometimes complex debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a complaint by an alarm company, which was not identified, to the 
Los Angeles Police Department triggered an internal investigation into 
allegations that officers supplied the City Council with bogus information, 
exaggerating the number of false burglar alarms to ensure the passage of a 
tough ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no word yet on whether the investigation has uncovered any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick offered her measure as a compromise to an ordinance proposed several 
weeks ago by Councilman Marvin Braude, which drew howls of protest from alarm 
industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Braude's measure, police would not respond to any alarm calls until a 
break-in was verified by an occupant or the alarm company, either by a security 
guard or video surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Chick's measure would withhold police response to alarm calls proven 
to be false, Braude's proposal would halt all police responses until alarm 
firms verified that the calls were genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 Police backed Braude's proposal, but alarm company representatives said the 
cost of adding security guards or surveillance cameras would make owning an 
alarm system too expensive for many residents and business owners. The average 
monthly fee for a residential system, they said, could jump from $25 to about 
$55. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Nigro, president of the Los Angeles Burglar and Fire Alarm Assn., 
commended Chick's proposal as "a very good starting point" that would not 
increase the cost of owning an alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the City Council voted to send it to the council's Public Safety 
Committee for further study, which angered Chick. "This is about public 
safety," she said. "This is supposed to be our No. 1 declared priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chick's measure, alarm-system owners would be fined $80 for each false 
alarm after the third call within a 12-month period. Police currently impose 
the fine after the fourth call. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, 95% of the 161,000 alarm calls made last year 
were false, accounting for 18% of all calls for police service and costing the 
city $2.8 million in lost police time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick's proposal would also make it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up 
to $1,000 and one year in jail, to fail to register a residential or commercial 
burglar alarm with police. There are about 300,000 such systems in Los Angeles 
now, but only about 100,000 are registered.

WOMAN WHOSE CAR HIT FIVE CHILDREN CHARGED; CRIME: OFFICIALS FILE MISDEMEANOR 
COUNTS AFTER WITNESSES SAY ESTELA LOPEZ LEFT HER 2-YEAR-OLD ALONE IN THE AUTO, 
WHICH WAS RUNNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney filed child endangerment charges Tuesday against 
a North Hollywood woman whose 2-year-old son knocked her idling car into gear 
on July 30, causing it to run over five children playing in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputing the account given by Estela Lopez, 33, who said the boy climbed into 
the car on his own, city attorneys reported that they have two witnesses who 
will testify that Lopez left 2-year-old Osvaldo alone in the idling car. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a mother of three, was charged with two counts of child endangerment in 
a complaint the city attorney filed in Van Nuys Municipal Court. She was 
advised by letter to appear for arraignment on Aug. 30, Deputy City Atty. 
Richard Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined up to 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although four of the children, between 5 and 10 years old, were hospitalized 
in serious or critical condition after the accident, none suffered permanent 
injuries and all have since been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the incident in the 6800 block of Agnes Avenue in North 
Hollywood, police and the district attorney's office declined to seek charges, 
saying the incident was a terrible tragedy that did not merit criminal action. 
Officers said they accepted Lopez's explanation for the incident, that she had 
left the car running while she ran into the house to retrieve her purse and 
that the boy climbed into the car on his own and accidentally moved the shift 
lever into gear. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schmidt said it was later decided that charges should be filed because the 
children's injuries were serious and because several witnesses said Lopez had 
left the child unattended inside the car with the engine running. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 2-year-old was left alone in the car," Schmidt said. "There is no 
evidence the emergency brake was engaged. The child, based on what our 
witnesses say, was not strapped into a car seat or seat belt. Nothing was done 
to keep him from running around in the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said two witnesses, including a 9-year-old girl who was struck and 
suffered broken ribs, said they saw Lopez put her son in the idling car, close 
the door, then go inside her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-year-old, Schmidt said, told police that the toddler's head "seemed to 
disappear very quickly and the next thing she knew, the car was lurching 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who said she was unaware of the charges filed against her, reiterated 
in a telephone interview with The Times on Tuesday that she did not leave the 
boy in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of 10 seconds," Lopez said. "I started the car for my 
husband, remembered that I forgot my purse, ran inside, and returned to see the 
car moving toward the children. The car door was closed. I never knew he could 
open it by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the car, Lopez said, the boy tripped the automatic locks on the 
1984 Thunderbird. Unable to get inside the moving vehicle, Lopez said she 
pulled on the rear bumper in a futile attempt to slow it down, yelling a 
warning to the five unsuspecting children as it bore down on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The children -- four girls ages 5 through 10, and a boy, 7 -- were playing on 
a sofa in the apartment complex driveway, police said. The car pushed the sofa 
about 20 feet up the driveway and pinned it against the wall, trapping some of 
the children beneath the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and two of the girls are Lopez's nephew and nieces, Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who does not have a driver's license, said she was warming up the car 
engine for her husband, while the family prepared to go to McDonald's for 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the district attorney's office declined to file felony charges 
against Lopez, saying she left the boy alone very briefly, was remorseful and 
had no prior criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have been looking at six years in state prison, and we felt her 
actions were more appropriately prosecuted as misdemeanors," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
David Mintz said.

MAN, 80, IS ARRESTED, RELEASED AFTER 4-COUNTY FREEWAY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An elderly man led California Highway Patrol officers on a high-speed chase 
across four Southern California counties Tuesday, finally being seized only 
because southbound Interstate 5 near Oceanside was closed due to a potential 
suicide victim threatening to jump from an overpass, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After being arrested at the scene, the 80-year-old suspect, identified as K. 
Stanley Rutkowski of Oceanside, was given a misdemeanor speeding citation and 
driven home by CHP officers, said Ted Prola, the agency's public affairs 
officer in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 Prola said preliminary tests indicated that Rutkowski, whom he described as 
"very disoriented," was not driving under the influence. Rutkowski, he said, 
confided to one arresting officer that he had been a World War II fighter in 
his native Poland; when asked why he led officers on the freeway chase, he 
reportedly replied, "I just screwed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rutkowski drove as fast as 100 m.p.h. for much of the two-hour-plus 
chase, Prola said investigators felt a felony citation was, in the end, not 
warranted, because of "limited endangerment to others." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the chase began shortly after 1 p.m. in Ventura County, where 
CHP officers attempted to stop a white Ford Taurus said to be traveling more 
than 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning eastbound on U.S. 101 in Oxnard, the chase proceeded south on the 
San Diego Freeway through Los Angeles County, then into Orange County, and 
finally into San Diego County along Interstate 5, said CHP Officer Tito Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for the suicide attempt, which closed Interstate 5, the chase 
would have continued, said CHP Officer Phil Konstantin. Officers apprehended 
Rutkowski at 3:37 p.m., about half an hour after the would-be jumper appeared 
atop a freeway sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators finally talked the man down about 8:20 p.m., officials said. The 
incident, which had stranded Rutkowski in bumper-to-bumper traffic, had backed 
up motorists from Oceanside to the San Clemente Border Patrol checkpoint 15 
miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured.

COUNTY OKS $2-BILLION BOND DEAL TO PAY OFF PENSION DEBT; FINANCES: THE MOVE IS 
INTENDED TO STRENGTHEN A SHAKY BUDGET POSITION. IT HAS TENTATIVE APPROVAL OF 
RETIREMENT OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved a nearly $2-billion bond 
deal Tuesday that is expected to strengthen the county's huge pension system 
and produce immediate earnings that will be used to bolster this year's fragile 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for the county to sell $1.96 billion in bonds to pay off 
virtually all its debt to the Los Angeles County Employee Retirement Assn., or 
LACERA, through 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, county officials are betting it will be cheaper to pay off the 
bonds over the long term than to make yearly contributions to the retirement 
system, as has been its practice. The bond deal is expected to aid the pension 
fund in its ability to cover future retirement costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that the bond sale will generate about $265 million more 
than the county needs to meet its pension obligation this fiscal year. Much of 
those funds will be used to fund library, fire and flood control services and 
other programs that might otherwise face cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement association officials have tentatively approved the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is welcome news for the county because the county's delicately 
balanced $14.5-billion budget already includes about $150 million in pension 
fund monies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will stabilize the situation between the (county) and LACERA 
because they don't have to come back to us for contributions each year," said 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who has long pushed for an agreement between the 
association and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, retirement association officials rejected another proposal to use 
pension funds to help balance the county's budget when they determined that 
such a deal might harm their own finances. 
</P>
<P>
 This deal is more attractive because it will virtually eliminate the county's 
$2-billion pension debt. The agreement also calls for the two parties to split 
any higher-than-expected earnings from the bond sale over the next four years, 
with 75% going to the county and 25% to the retirement association. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to help maintain services for taxpayers -- it's a win-win 
situation," said Robert Hermann, head of the association's Board of Retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials say the bond sale is dependent on a fluctuating bond market 
that currently is not offering the most favorable rates. But rates are expected 
to improve, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to find a market," said Assistant Chief Administrative 
Officer Sandy Davis. "We will begin meeting immediately to talk about structure 
and we will move forward."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CAMPERS LEARN HUMANE CARE FOR WILDLIFE 
</P>

<P>
 This was no ordinary day at the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 There were lions, tigers and bears. But impressing a 5-year-old these days 
isn't as simple as volunteers at the Wildlife Waystation in Angeles National 
Forest would have thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the dragons?" asked 5-year-old Alex Tallen, who, accompanied by his 
70 camp mates from Camp Crossroads in Santa Monica, visited the 800 exotic 
animals cared for daily by Waystation volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way these animals are cared for is so much more humane and educational," 
said Lauren Bernard, art and science teacher who chaperoned the outing Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours, available weekly, give the volunteers a chance to educate the public 
about exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waystation takes in abandoned, orphaned and injured wild and exotic 
animals. The most recent adoption was last month when private owners could no 
longer care for two baby black bears. Six-month-old Cinnamon is from Oregon, 
and 5-month-old Kachina is from Michigan. Because the bears are close in age, 
they live in a cage together where they share a miniature swimming pool, 
stuffed animals and a red wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They became instant friends," said Jan Brown, Waystation public relations 
officer and tour volunteer. "They're cute now, but when they're full-grown and 
almost 600 pounds, you probably wouldn't want one in your living room." 
</P>
<P>
 Other exotic animals at the Waystation include timber wolves, binturong bear 
cats, panthers and Himalayan moon bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Masha, a European brown bear once scheduled for termination, was rescued by 
members of an animal rights group who brought the bear to the Waystation. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of animals taken in by the Waystation are those unwanted because 
of mutilation or deformity. "Zoos only want perfect animals," said volunteer 
Yolande Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waystation also takes in hybrid animals given up by private owners. A 
hybrid, for example, is a combination of wolf and dog. Breeders combine the two 
hoping to create a powerful dog, but the outcome is a dangerous and 
unpredictable animal, according to Michaels. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamer animals being housed at the Waystation include potbellied pigs, llamas 
and rabbits, which children are allowed to pet and feed. 
</P>
<P>
 But alas, no dragons. ALICIA DOYLE

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: $2.8 MILLION OKD TO SECURE 'GHOST TOWNS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Tuesday that it has approved 
$2.8 million to clean up and secure 12 clusters of vacant, crime-plagued 
apartments and condominiums known as "ghost towns" in the San Fernando Valley, 
Hollywood and Mid-City areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding, which was promised in June by FEMA Director James Lee Witt, would 
pay to clear away debris, board up openings, erect fences and hire private 
security guards at about 150 vacant, quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of a city task force on ghost towns, crews have already 
boarded up and fenced nearly 100 buildings, and private security guards have 
been hired to patrol the areas since July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important money to button down those buildings until we can complete 
the rehab," said Gary Squier, general manager of the city's housing department.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: INSIGHT OFFERED BY CONTEST WINNERS

<P>
 San Fernando Valley winners of a student essay contest say the way to ease 
racial tensions is to feature Latino heroes in the news more often and to give 
community members a better forum to voice their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a better connection between the public and the media," said Michael 
Suh of West Hills, who recently graduated from the Van Nuys Math/Science Magnet 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Suh is one of three San Fernando Valley students who won an American 
Honda/Mario J. Machado Scholarship of $1,000 each. Veteran broadcaster Machado 
started the scholarship three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The awards are given to 10 Los Angeles high school seniors each year. Other 
Valley winners are Josefina Lopez of Woodland Hills, a June graduate of El 
Camino Real High, and Joseph Salas of Panorama City, a graduate of Monroe High, 
in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The students competed with essays answering the question: 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we all get along as a multicultural society? The media has not covered 
the basic issues of racial tension as extensively as it might. If you were a 
newspaper editor or a television or radio news producer, how would you cover 
the issue so that it might reduce the tension?" 
</P>
<P>
 Suh answered that there should be more public forums, more space devoted to 
opinions and a better effort to get the opinions of high school students. He 
plans to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall, where he

MAN SHOOTS HIMSELF, NEIGHBOR BY MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-year-old man playing with a loaded gun accidentally shot himself and a 
wheelchair-bound woman in the Panorama City apartment directly below his, 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Serrano was watching TV in his living room in the 8400 block of Tobias 
Avenue on Monday night with a cocked and loaded .38-caliber revolver in his 
waistband, said Sgt. Brad Kubela of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van 
Nuys Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he found the gun in his yard, in the bushes," Kubela said. "Then he 
wants to play Wyatt Earp in the living room. He would cock it, point it, cock 
it, point it." 
</P>
<P>
 When he stood up too quickly, Kubela said, the gun discharged and a bullet hit 
Serrano in the thigh, went through the floor and struck his downstairs neighbor 
in the wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither was critically injured, Kubela said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A weapon is not a toy and he should not have been playing around with it, 
especially if it's loaded," Kubela said.

SHERMAN OAKS WANTS INTERIM COUNCIL MEMBER; POLITICS: ZEV YAROSLAVSKY LEAVES 
OFFICE IN DECEMBER. ACTIVISTS HOPE TO ENLIST WESTSIDE IN FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Community leaders say they hope Sherman Oaks and other communities will band 
together to persuade the City Council to appoint an interim council member for 
the 5th District when Zev Yaroslavsky leaves office in December. 
</P>
<P>
 These activists plan to take their fight south of the Santa Monica Mountains 
by asking the Westside communities in Yaroslavsky's district to join a Sherman 
Oaks' letter-writing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have the entire district standing up and saying, 'Hey' -- that's not 
something (City Councilman) Joel Wachs can ignore," said Barry Wegman, vice 
president of the Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs and City Council President John Ferraro say they are opposed to 
appointing an interim council member, an option the council last chose in 1966. 
But Yaroslavsky has urged the unusual step, saying that Sherman Oaks needs a 
strong advocate on the council during the next several months, as it struggles 
to recover from the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's seat will be vacant for seven months from Dec. 5, when he leaves 
to become a county supervisor, to July 1, 1995, the earliest date that the 
winner of an April special election could take office. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman's proposal has received a positive reaction throughout the 
district, according to Yaroslavsky aide Laurie Saffian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, most of the support has been from areas that were heavily damaged 
by the earthquake, but there have been calls from all over the district," 
Saffian said. "The intensity of the support has been surprising and 
gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro has said that the City Council's longtime practice of having the 
city's chief legislative analyst run vacant council offices has worked just 
fine. He noted that in 1991 the analyst ran two vacant council offices at the 
same time. The analyst would not have a vote on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the replacement-rep drive is the Sherman Oaks Town Council, a 
loose confederation of Sherman Oaks' community organizations. Members agreed at 
a meeting Monday night to write letters to City Council members urging them to 
"name that council member." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Gaines, a co-chairman of the town council, will head a committee that 
will oversee the letter-writing campaign. He said he will follow up on the 
letters by asking for meetings with City Council members to discuss the 
community's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first and foremost concern of the 15 members of the City Council is 
looking out for their constituents," Gaines said. "To not have someone looking 
out for the 5th District would be against the interests of the community."

CIVIL RIGHTS SUIT FILED OVER SHOOTING DEATH; COURTS: FAMILY OF BAKERSFIELD MAN 
WHO WAS KILLED BY OFF-DUTY IRS AGENT SEEKS $30 MILLION IN DAMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of a Bakersfield man who was shot and killed by an off-duty 
Internal Revenue Service agent following a freeway dispute in Arleta has filed 
a civil rights lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal action filed in U.S. District Court stems from the July 16, 1993, 
death of Mickey Jay Smith, 21, who was fatally shot by an IRS agent who was 
later identified by police as Paul Hamilton Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed last month on behalf of Brandi R. Griffith, Smith's girlfriend, and the 
couple's young daughter, Ashley Nicole Griffith, the civil lawsuit seeks $30 
million in general and punitive damages. It alleges deprivation of civil 
rights, negligence, battery and wrongful death. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that Davis was acting within the scope of his job as 
an IRS agent and that the IRS and the federal government, co-defendants in the 
suit, should have known that Davis had a propensity for violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely outrageous that a trained officer used deadly force on this 
young man," said James De Simone, an attorney representing Griffith and her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Asperger, an attorney representing Davis, said his client acted in 
self-defense and was protecting the public from a "clear danger." 
</P>
<P>
 An IRS spokesman in Washington could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case also is being reviewed by the Los Angeles district attorney's office. 
Still pending is a preliminary civil rights investigation launched by the U.S. 
Department of Justice in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident started shortly after 7:30 p.m. on the Golden State Freeway. 
Smith was riding in a rental truck driven by his friend, Chris Stayton, 
according to police and coroner reports. During a lane change, Stayton swerved 
in front of a car allegedly driven by Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stayton's account, contained in an LAPD preliminary homicide investigation 
report, is that Smith began taunting Davis, who followed Stayton and Smith off 
the Branford Avenue exit. Both vehicles stopped along the side of the road, 
near an industrial complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Stayton said Smith got out of the truck shouting obscenities and repeatedly 
shoved Davis, who subsequently shot and killed Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Stayton and other witnesses told police they did not realize Davis was a law 
enforcement officer until after the shooting, when police arrived and the 
agent, dressed in business attire, flashed his badge at officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was unarmed at the time of the shooting, according to police. A corner's 
toxicology report found that his blood alcohol level, at .18%, was more than 
twice the legal driving limit of .08%

VALLEY BRIEFING: SUMMER'S STAR SHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Perseid meteor shower may be unusually intense this year. A meteor 
storm could occur Thursday night and Friday morning, climaxing about 3 a.m. 
Friday, Pacific time. Astronomers are predicting that viewers in dark locations 
with a good view of the sky could see at least one meteor per minute -- or up 
to several hundred per hour. The Makings of Meteors 
</P>
<P>
 * Often called "shooting stars," meteors are particles of dust shed by comets. 
Streaks of light are produced as the particles fall through the atmosphere and 
are burned up by friction when they collide with air molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meteors fall every night, but when the Earth passes through the orbit of an 
active comet, meteors fall in a shower of up to a few dozen meteors per hour. 
The Comet Swift-Tuttle 
</P>
<P>
 * Every August the Earth passes near the orbit of the comet Swift-Tuttle and 
we see the so-called Perseid meteors, which radiate from the direction of the 
constellation Perseus. 
</P>
<P>
 * This comet reached its closest point to Earth in 1992, as it does once every 
130 years. For several years before and after its return, showers can be 
intense because the Earth is passing through the part of the comet's orbit 
where a lot of dust was recently shed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The August shower was especially brilliant in 1991 and 1992, and less so in 
1993 because it peaked before dark on the West Coast. For the next two years 
there are still chances for bright August fireworks. Tips for Sky-Watchers 
</P>
<P>
 * The best time for viewing will be late Thursday night until 3 a.m. Friday. 
Meteors will also fall tonight and Friday, but with less intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, get away from city lights. Griffith Observatory is too close to 
Downtown Los Angeles' bright lights for good visibility and will not be open 
late for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * For more information on celestial events, call the observatory's Sky Report 
at (213) 663-8171. For program information, call (213) 664-1191.

KATZ'S 'SAFE STREETS ACT' PASSES ONE ROADBLOCK; LEGISLATION: SENATE PANEL 
PASSES BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO SEIZE VEHICLES OF SOME UNLICENSED 
DRIVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hotly debated legislation allowing the state government to seize the cars of 
some unlicensed drivers won approval by a key Senate committee Tuesday night, 
despite heated protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently moved by dramatic arguments that the bill could save lives by 
removing dangerous drivers from the road, the state Senate Judiciary Committee 
passed the measure by a 7-4 vote. It would apply to those arrested for driving 
without a valid license after a previous conviction for such an offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics called the bill a Big Brother measure that would be overly severe in 
punishing people by taking away private property. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure's author, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), said that was a 
small price to pay to avoid loss of life in accidents caused by drivers with no 
business being behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlicensed drivers are killing children, destroying families and taking over 
our roads," Katz said. "People are dying because of a preventable crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, dubbed by Katz the Safe Streets Act of 1994, now goes to the Senate 
appropriations committee before heading to the full Senate for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's passage followed a public campaign by Katz to step up the pressure 
on the initially reluctant senators. Last week, Katz held a North Hills news 
conference, during which relatives of people killed by unlicensed drivers 
supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state Department of Motor Vehicles, about 1 million motorists 
who have never held a license drive the state's roadways. Another 720,000 are 
still driving although their licenses have been suspended or revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV statistics indicate that a driver with a suspended license is four times 
more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than one with a valid license. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Katz sought to have the vehicles of all unlicensed motorists seized, 
he agreed in the face of stiff opposition Tuesday to soften his bill so it 
would apply only to drivers with at least one previous conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the amended bill, motorists who had been convicted of driving without a 
valid license and who were unable to produce a valid license during traffic 
stops would have their cars impounded on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The scenario provoked warnings from opponents who said they viewed it as an 
infringement of the basic rights of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That bill is elitist," said Richard J. Quigley of Aptos, who said he lost his 
license because he couldn't afford insurance. "It tries to create driving as a 
wealth-based classification."  
</P>
<P>
 The bill boasted a long list of supporters, topped by more than 60 police 
departments. Among the backers were the city of Los Angeles, the League of 
California Cities, Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the Northeast Valley 
Residents Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents included the American Civil Liberties Union and an activist group 
called Forfeiture Endangers American Rights, or F.E.A.R.

GUNMAN GETS 6 YEARS FOR 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' SHOOTING; COURTS: JAMES KIRBY, 45, 
EXPLAINED THE CRIME IN A SAN DIEGO MOVIE THEATER BY TELLING LAW ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICIALS THAT HE WANTED TO 'TEST GOD' AND PROTECT JEWS.

<P>
 A man who shot a woman in the back during a showing of the Academy 
Award-winning movie "Schindler's List" was sentenced Tuesday to six years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the shooting in a San Diego movie theater in January, law 
enforcement officials quoted 45-year-old gunman James Kirby as saying he wanted 
to "test God" and protect Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby's lawyer previously said in court that his client was psychologically 
disturbed and asked that the part-time security guard be put on probation after 
he pleaded guilty in May to an assault charge stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hurt me that day very badly," the victim, Helen Campbell, 40, told 
Superior Court Judge John Thompson on Tuesday before the sentencing. Campbell, 
who was watching the film with her husband, an off-duty police officer, said 
Kirby never apologized for inflicting pain, which she expects to experience for 
the rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was seated in front of Kirby when one round from a .380-caliber 
automatic pistol went through the seat and into her back, damaging her liver 
and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby's gunshot coincided with a scene in the movie in which Nazis tracking 
down Jews in the ghetto of Krakow, Poland, opened fire on their victims.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALGAE DWINDLES AT CASTAIC LAKE RESERVOIR; 
WATER: THE IMPROVED SITUATION AVOIDS FURTHER CLOSURES TO THE POPULAR RECREATION 
AREA FOR CHEMICAL TREATMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Algae that bloomed in record levels at Castaic Lake's main reservoir this 
summer has dwindled dramatically, avoiding further closures to the popular 
recreation area for chemical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 State water officials shut down the lake for half a day last month and poured 
16,000 pounds of copper sulfate pellets into the reservoir by helicopter. The 
closure came during a heat wave and spoiled plans for the 2,500 people who use 
the upper lake area daily for fishing, boating, water-skiing and jet-skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Geosmin, an algae form that produces a musty taste and odor but is not harmful 
to drink, was discovered at 2,800 parts per trillion on July 5 -- an abnormally 
high level, according to Bill Taylor, principal microbiologist for the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures and abundant nutrients in the water are thought to have 
spurred the growth of the algae. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just kept watching it grow and grow and grow," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive palates will notice the bacteria at 20 p.p.t., so it was no surprise 
when dozens of customers complained daily about the odor and taste of the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Southern California residents receive a portion of their drinking 
water from Castaic Lake. The Metropolitan Water District draws water from the 
Castaic reservoir and the Colorado River, in turn providing it to 27 water 
agencies that include city, county and municipal water districts in Los Angeles 
and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The natural cycle of the geosmin combined with the copper sulfate has 
dramatically reduced its concentration since last month. Geosmin levels on the 
surface of the lake were measured Monday at 11 to 13 p.p.t., Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the algae's current low levels, water officials say they cannot 
guarantee future lake closures for treatment. Copper sulfate treatments were 
last used in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic Lake officials have, however, asked for more advance notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Water officials originally sought to close the area July 1 -- on the busiest 
weekend of the year -- with less than 24 hours' notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need a little more coordination and communication," said Brian Roney, 
acting superintendent of the Castaic Lake Recreation Area.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LOOKING FOR A MIRACLE; FUND LAUNCHED IN NAME 
OF BOY WHO HAS BRAIN CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Michael Hoefflin found himself the center of attention Tuesday 
as a cancer fund and support group was launched in his name, but he didn't seem 
concerned about his condition or impressed with the adults fussing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon Country boy has had an unusual form of brain cancer for the past 
two years, and his chances of living much longer are uncertain, at best. But he 
merely squirmed restlessly on his father's lap during an interview on a local 
radio station in which the fund was announced, more interested in returning to 
a computer game in the station's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hoefflin said his son has been acting like any other 8-year-old because 
he is just beginning to feel symptoms of the disease, believed to be in the 
advanced stages. The elder Hoefflin said he co-founded the Michael Hoefflin 
Chapter of The Neil Bogart Memorial Fund with the hope of providing his son and 
other Santa Clarita cancer, leukemia and AIDS patients with needed care and 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael needs a miracle at this point," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter will raise funds for researchers at Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles, and act as a support group for Santa Clarita families, Chris Hoefflin 
said. The Neil Bogart fund, named after a record company president who died of 
lymphoma in 1983, provides assistance to 114 hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund was launched with a $4,990.33 check from Taekwondo USA, where Michael 
enrolled as a student several weeks ago. Studio owner Ken Lewis said the money 
is the surplus from a $12,900 memorial fund for Veronica Estrada, a children's 
instructor at the studio who was strangled in December. Another instructor is 
on trial on a murder charge in the death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really dedicated our lives to the well-being of children and we think 
this is a great way to do that," Lewis told KBET-AM radio broadcaster Kate 
Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be made to The Michael Hoefflin Chapter, c/o KBET radio, 27565 
Sierra Highway, Santa Clarita, CA 91351. For more information call (805) 
250-4100.

 Defeated and bitter Rwandan army soldiers have begun killing some of their own 
people to stop them from returning home. And if that were not misery enough for 
the 900,000 refugees here, an outbreak of yet another killer disease has begun 
-- a mysterious fever that is suspected to be typhus. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. relief officials said Tuesday they have confirmed that a refugee was 
beaten to death at a nearby camp after urging his countrymen to return home to 
Rwanda. The killers were reported to be young men wearing the uniform of the 
Hutu-majority Rwandan army, which lost control of the country last month and is 
striving to maintain iron-handed rule over the Hutu refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "A very nasty incident . . . the first confirmed murder that we can link to 
this campaign of intimidation," Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the Office of the 
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of another refugee, who appeared to have been stoned to death, was 
found Monday; the same motive is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 This new violence against the timid refugee population is certain to 
complicate efforts by relief agencies and the United Nations to coax Rwandans 
out of their disease-infested camps and back to their own land. 
</P>
<P>
 In the incredibly bloody politics of Rwanda, Hutus are the largest ethnic 
group. Until their flight, they made up 80% of the 8 million people in Rwanda. 
When they lost their short but brutal civil war last month to an army 
controlled by Tutsis, fleeing Hutu soldiers and independent Hutu militias 
ordered all Hutu citizens to evacuate the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 4 million people, mostly Hutu, are now displaced at camps in Zaire, 
Tanzania, Burundi and in the southwest corner of Rwanda, where French troops 
are temporarily staffing a protective zone, largely for Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Tutsi-dominated government of the Rwandan Patriotic Front has urged 
the refugees to come home and has pledged to guarantee their safety. For weeks 
now, however, Hutu henchmen of the defeated government have told the refugees 
to stay put, warning that the Tutsis will kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least in this sector of Zaire, the 100,000 or so refugees who went home 
are starting to send back word that they have not been harmed. The Hutu 
henchmen have apparently taken the next step and begun to demonstrate that 
refugees risk being killed for leaving the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials say there is no evidence that the Rwandan Tutsis are harming 
returning Hutus but have stopped short of maing any firm promise of refugee 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The tug of war over the refugees represents a continuing tragedy in a long 
struggle over the political future of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 An untold number of the Hutu soldiers and militiamen who maintain discipline 
in these refugee camps will never be able to return to Rwanda. That's because 
when they controlled the country, they led the slaughter of an estimated 
500,000 Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 So here they sit in Zaire -- many of the leaders are lodged in hotels and 
houses while their people suffer in squalor. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the Hutus in camps and under control keeps the humanitarian crisis 
alive, and that holds the attention of the rest of the world, Hutu leaders say. 
They reason that perhaps the powerful nations of the West will finally sicken 
of the death and suffering and force the Tutsis to negotiate concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 As for disease in the camps, health officials said they have confirmed 30 
cases of the mysterious new fever; 19 victims have died. The symptoms include 
an extremely high fever and red eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 A laboratory analysis of the infection is now under way, but results are not 
expected for five days. Worried health officials suspect typhus. The disease is 
spread by lice and, they say, many of the refugees have lice. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in neighboring Burundi, strikes and clashes shut down the capital, 
Bujumbura, for a second day Tuesday and authorities stepped up security as 
diplomats feared the country would follow Rwanda down the path to conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 15 people have been killed in two days of clashes involving Tutsis 
protesting the arrest of their leader, the Reuters news agency reported. It 
quoted aid officials as warning that their operations to assist refugees in 
southwest Rwanda and eastern Zaire may be affected unless the security 
situation improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble was sparked by the arrest of opposition politician Mathias Hitimana, 
leader of the Tutsi-led Party for the Reconciliation of the People.

COLUMN ONE; CHILDREN LEFT BY THE WAYSIDE; EACH DAY, A U.N. TRUCK MAKES ITS

<P>
 Death we have seen, and by the numbing long ton. But imagine this other 
ordeal: being left alone in the world with nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sick, naked, wet in a pool of your own uncontrollable excrement, too weak to 
do anything except tremble. Not a possession, no family or friends, no country, 
perhaps not even a name you can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these are the lucky ones. There are thousands out here we haven't got to 
yet," says Christian Clark, a 33-year-old UNICEF worker who rolls another 
Rwandan child from the plastic sheeting of the Munigi camp cholera aid station 
onto a prickly blanket. He carries her to a rescue truck. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 9 a.m. and this is stop No. 1 in the daily round of the orphan express, 
the white U.N. Children's Emergency Fund truck that rumbles over the sad, 
teeming landscape of eastern Zaire, scooping up the children that Rwanda's war 
has abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 The frail girl, who might be 8 years old, is placed on the dirty steel floor 
of the truck. Medical attendants load three more babies in a single blanket. 
Perhaps 3 to 6 months old, they too are naked. But one has a thin gold chain 
around her waist -- the only thing she has to carry from this life into the 
great uncertainty of the next. That is, if someone doesn't steal it from her, 
which is likely in this cruel land. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only four orphans today at this stop, fewer than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a man emerges from the mass of refugees -- everywhere here people 
are compressed into epic throngs. He hands up a 25-pound girl in a soiled and 
shapeless blue smock. The last of her known family died and she has been 
sitting alone for two days, the man explains. 
</P>
<P>
 She comes into the truck without protest, standing perfectly still on her 
hard-bottom feet, eyes as wide with wonder as a child at the gate of 
Disneyland. She has been watching trucks rumble by on this road; finally she 
will see where one goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark hands her a biscuit, which she takes with her good hand. She holds the 
other as if it's hurt. Or maybe it's just rigid with tension. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl stares at you with questions you can never know. She is trembling. 
She is covered with lice and crusty with filth. A reporter puts an arm around 
her. "That's it," Clark says. "She'll warm up, you'll see. These kids are 
starved for affection." 
</P>
<P>
 Good God, you think, it's only 9 a.m. and the rounds are just starting. 
Wouldn't you be pathetic if you couldn't hold back these burning tears in front 
of this girl? 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the airport and the French army post. 
</P>
<P>
 Word has already spread among the refugees. Each day, lost and orphaned 
children who no longer can endure the camps on their own learn of the truck 
stops. Some parents also hear of the UNICEF rescue. They drop off a child to 
lighten their own load. Perhaps they say to themselves: Nothing could be worse 
than keeping children in the camps, even if that means sending them down the 
road alone. 
</P>
<P>
 So far 7,400 unaccompanied children have been collected here by relief 
workers. UNICEF estimates an additional 10,000 to 70,000 roam alone. Each day, 
the orphanages exceed their capacity and are expanded farther onto the lava 
rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never, never seen anything like this before. Maybe it's happened 
(before), but we haven't seen it," Clark says. 
</P>
<P>
 At these stops, the truck collects some older children. One, two and then 
another. They seem to appear from nowhere. You turn your back, and two have 
climbed up and taken a seat on the little school benches that ride unfettered 
under the canvas top of the truck. The children are quiet as they accept 
biscuits and water. Suddenly, two more have moved in. 
</P>
<P>
 We drive on, and Clark scrambles back and forth in the bouncing truck bed, 
smiling widely and trying to joke with the older children. There are no smiles 
back just yet, but a faint spark can be seen in their eyes -- perhaps 
gratitude. A truck ride, a cookie and a hug are more than these children have 
had in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a dirty jacket and shorts, Joseph Bavurnda says he is 13 -- although 
he is only half the size of a Western teen-ager, with bony feet and big, 
curious eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father died before in Kigali. My mother died with cholera after a one-week 
walk. I have two little brothers, but I don't know where they are. We became 
apart at the border." 
</P>
<P>
 On the roads, children, some of them very tiny, sit unattended in the dirt. In 
the teeming centers of the camps, who can know which of the thousands are 
attended to and which are not? Difficult as it is, the truck passes them all 
by. Surviving refugees are asked to help identify the lost, orphaned and 
abandoned and bring them to designated pickup sites. No one wants to 
accidentally take a child whose mother is off looking for food or water. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop is the public hospital in Goma, Zaire, which is considered 
adequate by African standards. There are two and three patients in each bed, 
with others lying in tents and on the ground. Flies and the sharp smells of 
urine and infection fill the wards. But there seems to be a large medical 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 A scene erupts. 
</P>
<P>
 A girl who is perhaps 3 has lost her mother to dysentery and adopted another 
female patient as a surrogate. But the woman explains that she has two children 
of her own and cannot support this child. The girl screams and will not let go. 
The surrogate mother's agony shows on her face. A crowd gathers, noisily. 
Someone yanks the wailing child away. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this morning, reporters here learned via shortwave broadcast that some 
Western pundits were criticizing coverage of the refugees as exploitative. The 
critics should have seen this: the wailing, half-naked child clawing the air 
furiously for something to hold. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the shoulder of Gloria Galloway, a reporter for the Canadian 
Press news service, herself a mother of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Her notebook in her pocket, Galloway carried the child back to the orphan 
express. Two other reporters lifted other children into the now-crowded vehicle 
and began the feeding chores. Somehow, counting the morning's total of orphans 
was forgotten. Was it 20, or 30? 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time people fled like this was when Moses parted the Red Sea," says 
Clark, a former scriptwriter for "Sesame Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's children are first taken to UNICEF headquarters in Goma, the town 
where relief efforts are coordinated. The children who are old enough to talk 
are registered here. Workers hope that if and when the outlying camps can be 
stabilized with food and medicine, at least some parents will come searching 
for missing children. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the truck drives to the final stop, the Carea Orphanage outside Goma. 
This is a tent city of tiny people, where the sick are separated by disease: 
cholera here, dysentery there, unknown over yonder. 
</P>
<P>
 The healthy move on to canvas tents with floors of plastic sheeting. Here, 
children care for other children. 
</P>
<P>
 And someone has done a good job of it already. A group of 6- or 7-year-old 
boys charges out of a tent to greet a visitor. With their arms folded, they bow 
in unison, smile and recite: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bonjour, papa!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Bonjour, boys." 
</P>
<P>
 None of them looks when a tiny body is carried through the orphanage in a 
blanket. It is placed along the shoulder of the road for a different collection 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days ago at this orphanage, a 5-year-old girl showed up at the gate with 
an infant she found along the roadside in the arms of a dead mother. Today, the 
5-year-old returned and inquired about the health of "her baby." The infant 
died, but an orphanage worker lied and said everything was fine. 
</P>
<P>
 There are happier stories too, like the listless infant who would not eat or 
stop crying. A nurse held the dying toddler and happened to feel a bump. A 
surgeon extracted a bullet that had killed the mother and lodged in the child. 
The youngster grew plump in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of these children a month from now when the rainy season turns the 
ground to mud? And a year from now when the eyes and hearts of the world have 
moved elsewhere? And 20 years after that, when they reach adulthood on this 
crowded and turbulent continent? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how these kids will survive emotionally," says Pat Sheppard, a 
New Jersey nurse with the relief group AmeriCares. "I can hardly think about 
that yet. I only know it's not going to get better for a long while."

MAYOR ASKS DELAY ON SMOG RULES; POLLUTION: PLAN WOULD PUT OFF SOME TOUGH 
MEASURES FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO REDUCE IMPACT ON AIRLINES AND SHIPPING. IT 
TRIGGERS FIERCE DEBATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jumping at the eleventh hour into the fray over cleaning up the Southland's 
smoggy skies, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is pressuring air quality 
officials to delay for several years stringent measures aimed at eliminating 
one of the region's most dangerous air pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 Released in detail this week, the mayor's proposal immediately triggered a 
fierce debate, pitted the city against its neighbors in the Inland Empire and 
prompted an outcry by environmentalists and top staff members at the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District, who called the plan flawed and 
potentially illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the opposition, the plan from the mayor's office -- which until 
now has been mute on most clean-air issues -- has spurred enough political 
friction that the AQMD board is expected to delay its vote, slated for Friday, 
on an updated 20-year smog plan. Under federal law, both the AQMD and the state 
Air Resources Board must approve a new plan by November or face a freeze on 
federal highway funds and other economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to soften the economic impact of a clean-air plan on the city, 
Riordan's alternative plan addresses most of the smog problem but delays many 
measures proposed by the AQMD to reduce particulates -- the fine pieces of 
diesel soot and dust that can lodge in lungs and trigger respiratory disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's goal is to ease the burden on airlines, ships, trains and diesel 
trucks in the four-county basin, which under the AQMD plan would have to cut 
the nitrogen oxides that contribute to both smog and particulate pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business and labor groups worry that the proposed rules by the AQMD -- 
which also are contained in a plan by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
-- would devastate the Southland's economy by putting its interstate commerce 
at a competitive disadvantage with other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, under Riordan's plan, the AQMD and EPA would have to come up with 
other solutions for particulates, including some that could shift the burden 
largely to the Inland Empire. Among the mayor's suggestions are tougher 
controls on dairy farms, where piles of manure emit ammonia, and on "fugitive 
dust," particles that blow off rural lots during windstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Deputy Executive Officer Barry Wallerstein called the Riordan plan 
"seriously flawed" because it fails to illustrate how particulates would be 
cleaned up enough to meet federal law and state requirements, could harm public 
health and kill the region's dairy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time we don't believe it is a viable option," Wallerstein 
said, adding that the mayor's office is ignoring a state law requiring the air 
pollution agency to clean up particulates as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Kun, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
said the mayor is trying to skirt responsibility in cleaning up pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the mayor's plan is irresponsible," Kun said. "It is kind of the 
manana strategy -- do it later and do it somewhere else. They want to shift the 
problem out to the cows and avoid doing anything in the city to control the 
emissions." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it the "most important single issue for the economy of California," 
Riordan said his office became involved because some proposals, if unchanged, 
would force airlines to reduce flights at Los Angeles International Airport by 
25% and shippers to turn away from the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports and 
head for Seattle, Oakland and others with no pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and his aides say their strategy still will meet federal clean air 
deadlines but has a better chance of being implemented because it would delay 
the cost of achieving clean air. The city estimates that initially it could 
reduce the $5.4-billion annual price tag on the agency's plan to $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the city wants a plan that reduces pollution just enough to meet 
1994 federal mandates for ozone, the main ingredient of smog -- but no other 
air pollutants. In contrast, the AQMD wants to satisfy all pollution 
requirements with its new plan, including proposals on particulates that are 
not due until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's staff is arguing that the AQMD wants to reduce nitrogen oxides by 
79% when only a 45% reduction is now required to meet health standards for 
ozone. The mayor's office says planning for further reductions can come later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no agenda here to 'just say no' to clean air," Deputy Mayor Michael 
Keeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD board Chairman Henry Wedaa and board member Marvin Braude said they will 
urge their colleagues on Friday to postpone a vote on the AQMD plan so that the 
mayor's proposal can be studied. The board's public hearing, set for 9:30 a.m., 
will continue as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Wedaa told Riordan's aides that he would not seek a delay in the 
vote but reconsidered after pressure from city officials. "We are in the 
process of giving it a fair and honest look," Wedaa, a Yorba Linda councilman, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned, however, that the vote should not be delayed past September 
because the AQMD has little time to produce a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal Clean Air Act deadlines, the AQMD and state Air Resources Board 
have until November to submit an updated air quality plan to the EPA that 
outlines how the region will achieve an ozone health standard by 2010. At the 
same time, the EPA is under a federal court order to come up with its own plan 
by Feb. 15 that would go into effect if local efforts fail. 
</P>
<P>
 David Howekamp, who heads the EPA's regional air and toxics division, said 
Tuesday the federal agency is reviewing the mayor's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan acknowledged that the city's idea comes late, but said his staff 
didn't fully understand the economic impact of the proposals until May. His 
office then hired a consultant to come up with an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate, but so much of what government does is when you're right on 
the brink of falling over a cliff," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan conceded that the AQMD and EPA could miss their November and February 
deadlines by a few months. But he said violating the deadlines is a better 
option than approving a plan that would severely harm Los Angeles' economy. He 
also said the Clinton Administration would be reluctant to penalize California 
with economic sanctions if the deadlines are not met. 
</P>
<P>
 But AQMD board member Norton Younglove, a Riverside County supervisor, called 
that a "spit-in-your-eye-and-stand-back approach. I don't think that's a sound 
tactic for government. Frankly, we have to remember what our objective is. To 
clean up the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Younglove said the mayor's plan could unfairly place the burden of controlling 
particulates on the region's inland valleys, when most pollution comes from Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I hear of their plan, Los Angeles in effect says, 'Let us pollute 
all we want upwind and make the reductions down there in the inland valleys.' 
Frankly, the opposite thing should be done because we in the inland valleys 
face the most health problems," Younglove said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the mayor should go move in the part of the city that is an inland 
valley and then he would understand why many of us are concerned about the 
quality of the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Younglove said a strategy similar to Riordan's piecemeal approach of reducing 
individual pollutants was proposed by the oil and utility industries almost a 
decade ago. The argument was rejected by the AQMD and state ARB in the late 
1980s because it failed to address particulate pollution.

ABORTION CLINIC SLAYINGS MAY KILL OPERATION RESCUE; MOVEMENT: VIOLENCE DRIVES A 
WEDGE BETWEEN MILITANTS AND THE CHRISTIAN CHURCHES THAT BACKED TERRY'S GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Operation Rescue, the militant anti-abortion group that mobilized a segment of 
Christian fundamentalists and brought the tactics of civil disobedience to the 
conservative cause, is on the verge of collapse as a significant political 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 With Operation Rescue's influence already in decline, the brutal slaying of an 
abortion doctor and his escort in Pensacola, Fla., on July 29 by the leader of 
an extremist anti-abortion splinter group may prove to be the movement's 
political death knell, according to leaders of the organization and others 
involved in the abortion debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while sporadic anti-abortion violence and fitful street protests 
undoubtedly will continue, the ability of Operation Rescue and related groups 
to tap elements of the Christian right in large numbers seems likely to be a 
thing of the past. Although the anti-abortion movement includes Catholics and 
others, the bulk of its supporters, especially Operation Rescue members, are 
Christian fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Operation Rescue's hold on the fundamentalist movement is slipping 
at a time when "born-again" Christians are more politically active than ever 
and are making well-documented inroads into the Republican Party's hierarchy. 
But the spreading anti-abortion violence has finally created a wedge between 
anti-abortion militants and their natural base in Christian churches, where 
Operation Rescue has always turned for money and recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the general feeling in the churches is that we don't care what 
Randall Terry (Operation Rescue's founder) has to say about abortion anymore," 
said Bob Jewitt, a spokesman for Operation Rescue. "They are tired of the 
debate." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sad, but even Christian radio station managers tell me they are tired 
of hearing about" the anti-abortion movement, Jewitt said. "A lot of people in 
the Christian community are burned out on this." 
</P>
<P>
 The murders, which included the third shooting of an abortion physician in 
less than 18 months, have been the most damaging of any because this time, a 
leader of the movement is accused of pulling the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill, a defrocked fundamentalist minister and leader of his self-styled 
Pensacola-based group, Defensive Action, was charged with the murders. That has 
made it quite awkward for anti-abortion groups to dismiss the crime as an 
isolated incident, as they have attempted to do with previous acts of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more than 20 other extremist leaders have signed petitions circulated 
and published by Hill in recent months endorsing the killing of abortion 
doctors as "justifiable homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has that severely damaged the movement within the fundamentalist 
community, but it also has prompted an intensive, nationwide federal 
investigation of the anti-abortion movement's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has deployed U.S. marshals to provide protection 
for abortion clinics in 12 cities, and the Justice Department has established a 
joint task force between the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms to investigate militant anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overnight, Operation Rescue has been effectively stripped of its 
political rank in Washington. It has gone from being perceived as a player on 
the fundamentalist Christian right to the untouchable status of a 
violence-prone cult. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's crime prompted Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and other congressional 
leaders who favor abortion rights to demand that the FBI begin undercover 
infiltration of anti-abortion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pensacola killings are "not a form of protest against abortion, it is 
murder by terrorists, no different from the murders resulting from the World 
Trade Center bombing, and it must be treated just as seriously as we treat 
other terrorist attacks," charged Schumer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are clearly on the ropes -- their former supporters are backing off 
because of the violence," said Dallas Blanchard, a sociologist at the 
University of West Florida and author of two books on anti-abortion violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a scattered few conservative Republican lawmakers -- notably Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Sen. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.) -- have rallied to 
the defense of anti-abortion militants this time. Most conservatives have 
remained silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Rescue officials cringe at each act of violence and have sought to 
distance themselves from militants like Hill. The group's new national 
director, Flip Benham, confronted Hill and others who are said to favor 
violence at a secret meeting of anti-abortion leaders in Chicago in April. That 
meeting followed an even more emotional leadership conference in Melbourne, 
Fla., last September, during which Keith Tucci, then head of Operation Rescue, 
decreed that the group would expel any members who advocated violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Operation Rescue, founded eight years ago in Upstate New York, has 
suffered from the violence and has been hit by dramatic reductions in 
membership and contributions. At fundamentalist churches where Operation Rescue 
rallies once could draw thousands, they now can generate crowds of only a few 
hundred. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's annual budget, which totaled $400,000 as recently as 1992, has 
been plunging since early last year, following the March, 1993, killing of Dr. 
David Gunn, another Pensacola abortion clinic physician. Donations slipped 
again after the August, 1993, shooting of Dr. George Tiller in Wichita, Kan. 
The organization fears another steep decline in the wake of last month's 
shotgun slayings of Dr. John Bayard Britton and his escort, abortion-rights 
advocate James H. Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a nightmare," said Patrick Mahoney, national spokesman for 
Operation Rescue. "In terms of the public perception of our movement, the 
impact from the violence has been extremely harsh. It makes people who might 
join us view us in a different light and to be afraid to go out in front of a 
clinic. And it has been devastating economically for the finances of the major 
anti-abortion groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Pensacola killings, Operation Rescue was reeling from a series 
of legislative and legal defeats in 1994. The group's ability to mount 
headline-grabbing street theater and abortion clinic blockades -- the key to 
its political influence -- has been sharply eroded through a series of Supreme 
Court rulings and new legislation imposing tough federal penalties for abortion 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the Supreme Court ruled that federal racketeering laws could be 
used to investigate and prosecute anti-abortion groups. Abortion-rights groups 
believe that ruling will prove a potent weapon against anti-abortion 
organizations that have learned how to change their legal names and hide their 
assets to skirt civil and criminal court injunctions. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the court ruled that "buffer zones" to prevent protest and loud 
chanting around abortion clinics do not violate the First Amendment rights of 
anti-abortion demonstrators. Such zones are rapidly being thrown up around 
clinics throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Overshadowing the court rulings, however, was the passage of the Freedom of 
Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Signed into law by President Clinton in May, 
the act makes it a federal crime, punishable by up to six months in prison, to 
blockade an abortion clinic or to engage in other forms of disruptive civil 
disobedience around clinics. Local anti-abortion leaders report that many 
volunteers are drifting away from Operation Rescue as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it went into effect, only small handfuls of demonstrators have been 
willing to challenge the law by blockading clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our free speech rights have been eliminated in front of abortion clinics by a 
politically correct Supreme Court and Congress," fumed Jay Sekulow, chief 
counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice, which represents 
anti-abortion demonstrators in court cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal divisions over the violence have also led to a breakup of the group's 
national leadership, leaving Operation Rescue with just four full-time staff 
members in its Dallas headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 At last September's leadership meeting, Tucci demanded that all Operation 
Rescue leaders sign a written pledge condemning violence, and his hard-line 
stance on the issue angered many other leaders, creating a rift that now 
divides the anti-abortion movement into a series of small, largely ineffective 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill and Michael Griffin, the anti-abortion extremist convicted of 
murdering Gunn, "have accomplished what (abortion-rights leaders) Patricia 
Ireland and Molly Yard failed to do -- and that is split up a very tight-knit 
group of pro-life leaders," Mahoney said.

LOW COUNT OF MINORITIES NOT JUSTIFIED, COURT SAYS; CENSUS: IF RULING STANDS, 
BIG CITIES WOULD BENEFIT. SOUTHLAND COULD GAIN MORE POLITICAL CLOUT AND U.S. 
MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a ruling that could mean more federal money for large cities -- perhaps 
more than $150 million for Los Angeles alone -- and more political muscle for 
Southern California, a federal appeals court has found that the Bush 
Administration failed to justify undercounting millions of minority citizens in 
the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion, handed down Monday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
New York, breathed new life into a politically charged, six-year battle by a 
group of cities, including Los Angeles, to adjust population counts to correct 
for the chronic difficulty that the Census Bureau has had in reaching and 
counting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said Tuesday that, if allowed to stand, the ruling could 
dramatically restructure the equation of political power both nationally and 
within the state. Census figures are used for drawing district lines for the 
U.S. House of Representatives, seats in state legislatures and even city 
councils, as well as distributing federal funds for everything from feeding the 
poor to running mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unclear what will actually happen if President Clinton chooses not 
to take up the Bush Administration position in the reinstated case. 
Theoretically, the new federal allocations could start flowing within a matter 
of months, but lawyers familiar with the case said it is also likely that any 
congressional redistricting will be challenged for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that Southern California and Arizona would gain one new 
congressional seat apiece under the new numbers, at the expense of Pennsylvania 
and Wisconsin, and that Los Angeles would be entitled to $150 million more a 
year in state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The census figures are a cornerstone of representative government," said 
Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz, who helped argue the case for Los Angeles. "We 
are really excited by this decision . . . it throws open a lot of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Robert S. Rifkind, a Manhattan lawyer who represented the city of 
New York, called the ruling "a milestone in the battle against racial 
discrimination in voting." 
</P>
<P>
 "What the court found is that blacks, Hispanics and other minorities have had 
their votes diluted by this statistical problem back to 1940 at least -- and 
there's no reason why we should put up with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Census Bureau has acknowledged that minorities have been undercounted 
for decades; members of minority and low-income families have traditionally 
been harder to reach because of misinformation and fears of government 
intrusion into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, in the 1980s, the bureau devised a formula to more accurately 
reflect the nation's diversity, but the increased minority numbers carried a 
potent political charge -- they are believed to be more favorable to Democrats 
than to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in that decade, as the 1990 census was being planned, mayors in Los 
Angeles, New York, Chicago and other big cities with large minority populations 
-- and heavily Democratic constituencies -- sued the Republican Bush 
Administration to compel an adjustment for what they expected would be an 
undercount. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the bureau conducted the Post Enumeration Survey, canvassing 
171,390 households nationwide. The sampling indicated that the nation's 
population had been undercounted by about 2.1%, or 5.4 million people. But the 
undercount, as suspected, was particularly glaring among minorities. The Census 
Bureau estimated that Hispanics had been undercounted by 5.2%, Native Americans 
by 5%, blacks by 4.8% and Asian and Pacific Islanders by 3.1%. Less than 2% of 
the white population was estimated to have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Los Angeles and California have such large minority populations, state 
and local estimates also got short shrift. The city of Los Angeles, the bureau 
estimated, was undercounted by nearly 200,000 people, or about 5%, while 
California as a whole was undercounted by 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the legal settlement that culminated the mayors' suit, the 
Bush Administration's Department of Commerce -- which oversees the census -- 
was required to consider using the adjusted figures. But in 1991, then-Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher declared the 1990 count "one of the two best 
censuses ever taken in this country," and refused to adjust the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosbacher said politics did not influence his decision; rather, he said, he 
simply did not want to "abandon a 200-year tradition of how we actually count 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision prompted a new legal challenge, this time not only from the 
cities but also from national minority organizations. But last year, a lower 
court threw out the case, ruling that although the adjustments would have made 
the census more accurate, Mosbacher was not technically required to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court said the only legal requirement was that the commerce 
secretary not be arbitrary and capricious in his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, the appeals court overturned that ruling on a 2-1 vote, saying 
that because the constitutional right of minorities to equal representation was 
at stake, the commerce secretary had to be held to a higher legal standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "While precise equality is a goal that at the national level may be illusory, 
there must be a good-faith effort to approach that goal as nearly as is 
practicable," the court ruled. If the official answer "is that it is preferable 
to undercount minorities," the opinion added, the Department of Commerce will 
have to prove that that decision serves a legitimate governmental objective 
that cannot be met any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkind, Heinz and other lawyers who argued the case said Monday that it is 
unclear what the ramifications will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new secretary of commerce, a new attorney general and a new 
President now," Heinz said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Monday that the Justice Department 
is reviewing the court's decision, and will eventually decide among three 
options -- to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, to let the matter be 
sent back to the lower court for reconsideration under the new appeals court 
standards, or to admit to the undercount and let California and Arizona gain 
their congressional seats -- in which case, she added, Pennsylvania and 
Wisconsin would probably sue. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Justice Department takes the third option, lawyers said, federal 
funding could be reallocated almost immediately; however, they added, the 
implications of that decision would be so prone to litigation that the next 
census could pass without a resolution of this case. 
</P>
<P>
 As lawyers grappled with the dramatic possibilities posed by the ruling, 
lobbying had already begun. On Tuesday, almost before the White House had 
received a copy of the opinion, Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) had written a letter 
to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno urging an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 California's elected officials predictably lauded the opinion. "All of 
California wins on this particular ruling," said Assemblyman Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles), chairman of the legislative Latino Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was not immediately available for comment, but his office 
noted that he had been in favor of an adjustment for several years, and cited a 
1991 letter that he wrote to Mosbacher calling the updated figures "crucial to 
California's fair representation in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, Wilson's press spokesman, said the governor's office would contact 
the administration "to see what steps they plan to take from here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly at the time of the census we were concerned that California's 
population was undercounted, and concerned about the effects that would have 
for the state both fiscally and politically," Walsh said. "We're anxious now to 
see what the outcome will be from the federal government."

PROP. 187 TURNS UP HEAT IN U.S. IMMIGRATION DEBATE; ELECTION: BACKERS SEEK 
REVOLUTION IN NATIONAL POLICY. FOES PREDICT ILL-EDUCATED, DISEASE-PRONE 
UNDERCLASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three months before Election Day, the ballot measure known as Proposition 187 
already seems destined to join the pantheon of California initiatives that 
periodically reshape national debate. Its backers have immodestly dubbed the 
proposal Save Our State, SOS for short, and its subject is illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are the posse," an initiative co-founder recently told a receptive 
gathering in Orange County, "and SOS is the rope." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, the proposition's looming presence cast a pall over the 20th 
anniversary ceremonies of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project, 
the Mexican American electoral rights organization. "Remember," a speaker 
urgently warned a disheartened crowd in a Pasadena ballroom, "there's only 90 
days left to save California's Latinos!" 
</P>
<P>
 After years of increasingly rancorous debate about immigration, Californians 
on Nov. 8 will get to vote directly on the issue, with likely repercussions for 
the governor's race and national immigration policies. Both sides view the 
ballot as a kind of plebiscite on California's future, although the issue at 
hand focuses on the narrower question of public benefits for illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the vote may influence immigration discourse much as Proposition 
13 forged a new consensus on taxes and other California initiatives have 
crystallized matters as varied as environmental policy and auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative backers acknowledge that what they really want is a revolution in 
national immigration policy, the exclusive domain of Congress and the executive 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 With limited influence over Washington, however, proponents have turned to the 
liberal California initiative process in an effort to involve state and local 
government in immigration matters to an unprecedented degree. 
</P>
<P>
 California -- destination of perhaps 40% of all new immigrants to the United 
States -- is unquestionably the battleground. Large-scale immigration, 
particularly from Latin America and Asia, has dramatically altered the state's 
demography in the last two decades, dismaying many longtime state residents, 
particularly non-Latino white suburbanites, whose discontent has fueled 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as polls show the measure gathering widespread support among voters, 
its very premise -- that public services and schools draw illegal immigrants -- 
remains a matter of fierce debate. The initiative doesn't directly address 
jobs, widely considered by scholars and other authorities to be the principal 
lure for immigrants. Nor does Proposition 187 do anything about the porous 
U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents acknowledge that jobs are a magnet, and they would like beefed-up 
border enforcement. But drafters say Proposition 187 is the most that they 
could wring out of California law. They want to deliver a message to Capitol 
Hill and the White House to spur more changes. 
</P>
<P>
 On a practical level, even if Proposition 187 passes in November, it could be 
years before its major provisions are enacted, if ever, because of conflict 
with state and federal laws, constitutional protections and court rulings. 
Implementation could largely depend on protracted legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187's best-known provisions would bar illegal immigrants from 
public schooling, non-emergency health care and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 To accomplish those bans, the proposition would create a new realm of official 
inquiry by police, school administrators, social workers and health providers. 
Officials would be required to quiz people about their citizenship or 
immigration status and then to report those "reasonably suspected" of being 
illegal immigrants to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and "any 
other government agency" that requests it. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most drastic move, school officials would be obligated to 
verify the status not only of students but of parents and guardians -- even if 
their children are U.S. citizens. By 1996, parents of all public school 
students statewide would be forced to prove citizenship or legal residence 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 These laws would test legal and ethical standards of confidentiality, 
particularly for doctors, nurses, social workers and others whose professions 
are steeped in privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Explicit in the measure's wording is that interrogators must rely on 
suspicion. With dozens of official immigration categories, only qualified U.S. 
authorities can determine status with certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad new reporting mechanisms, proponents believe, will prompt 
large-scale "self-deportations" and discourage others from sojourning here 
without papers. But there is no guarantee anyone will leave the country. State 
authorities have no standing to deport people. Nor can the state force the 
notoriously understaffed and inefficient INS to act. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson is expected to back the initiative, which is already endorsed 
by the California Republican Party and several GOP legislators. Co-authoring 
the measure are former INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson and Harold W. Ezell, 
former top-ranking Western administrator of the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an anti-immigrant initiative, it's an anti-illegal immigrant 
initiative," said Nelson, who headed the INS during the Bush Administration. 
"The people of California have simply had enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the initiative's grass-roots supporters, there is a barely concealed 
layer of antagonism toward illegal immigrants. The initiative, they say, is one 
of many steps necessary to drive them from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Illegal aliens are killing us in California," said Ronald Prince, a Tustin 
accountant who heads the Proposition 187 campaign. "Those who support illegal 
immigration are, in effect, anti-American." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics see proponents' efforts as Big Brotherism run amok, an invitation to 
official harassment of the "foreign-looking." They envision an ill-educated 
underclass of youngsters roaming the streets, prone to contagious diseases and 
drawn to crime, posing constant hazards for citizens and other legal residents. 
Lost in the fiery oratory, immigrant advocates say, are the many ways that 
illegal immigrants' low-wage labor and tax contributions have benefited 
Californians and propped up the regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Latino and immigrant activists opposing the measure is a broad 
coalition of health professionals, school officials, religious leaders, unions 
and law enforcement authorities. Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, the 
state's top-ranking Roman Catholic cleric, calls Proposition 187 "a devastating 
assault on human dignity," and has vowed to use the churches' resources and the 
power of the pulpit to battle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown also has pledged to campaign 
against the initiative. Most Democratic candidates will also probably oppose 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Latinos generally oppose illegal immigration at about the same rate 
as other voters, polls have shown that they dislike Proposition 187 much more 
than the general electorate. This reflects a widely held view among Latinos 
that an anti-Latino sentiment underlies the initiative, and that Latinos would 
bear the brunt of any new investigative and reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative's potential fiscal effects are another matter of great dispute, 
reflecting disagreements about how much illegal immigrants use public services. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office concluded that the 
proposals would probably save about $200 million annually in state and local 
funds, not including education spending. Excluding more than 300,000 illegal 
immigrant youngsters from public schools could save another $1.2 billion, but 
this ban would probably be stayed pending a lengthy court battle. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the state analysts also found that the proposal would cost tens of 
millions of dollars annually to implement, and potentially more than $100 
million during the first year. Much of the price tag involves training school 
personnel and others in the often-arcane intricacies of immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the analysis found that the proposal could put at risk billions -- 
perhaps as much as $15 billion -- in federal funds now provided to California 
for health, education and welfare programs. This is because of conflicts 
between the measure's provisions and federal privacy, non-discrimination and 
procedural requirements. U.S. Education Secretary Richard W. Riley has already 
indicated in writing that the proposal would endanger federal education money. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a breakdown of Proposition 187's major components: EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's most incendiary (and perhaps most legally problematic) 
provision would bar illegal immigrants from public elementary and secondary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students believed to be in the country illegally would be given 90 calendar 
days to produce legal documentation or "accomplish an orderly transition to a 
school in the child's country of origin." Verification for new pupils would 
begin Jan. 1. One year later, students already enrolled -- along with parents 
and guardians -- would have to prove their status. 
</P>
<P>
 New procedures would be required to verify the status of the more than 5 
million public school students in the state and at least as many parents -- 
some of whose whereabouts would undoubtedly be unknown or difficult to track. 
</P>
<P>
 If Proposition 187 is approved, the schools provisions will doubtless trigger 
a court challenge under federal or state law -- and possibly both. Drafters 
have said they would like to see the U.S. Supreme Court revisit its Plyler vs. 
Doe decision, the landmark 1982 ruling stating that illegal immigrant children 
are entitled to a public school education. The California Supreme Court, citing 
the state Constitution, ruled in 1992 that public schooling is a fundamental 
right -- an even broader interpretation than that of the federal justices. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the measure passes, youngsters who are undocumented would still be 
eligible for federally funded school meal and Head Start programs. HEALTH CARE 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would bar publicly funded clinics and hospitals from providing 
care to illegal immigrants, except in emergencies. Federal law requires that no 
one be refused emergency treatment, generally interpreted to include delivery 
of babies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure would deny prenatal and postnatal care to women lacking papers 
-- a proscription that physicians say would elevate public health expenses for 
their U.S.-born children, who would be citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A range of public health benefits is now accessible to illegal immigrants, 
young and old. Many programs have been kept open to everyone for a deliberate 
reason: to head off infectious diseases that inevitably cost less to prevent or 
treat at early stages than afterward, when the illnesses become acute and may 
spread to others, regardless of immigration status. Hundreds of thousands of 
illegal immigrant workers handle food in restaurants and fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who are undocumented could presumably no longer receive immunizations 
at hospitals and clinics that receive public money -- the vast majority of such 
facilities. Some fear the resulting spread of diseases such as measles, mumps, 
polio, rubella and diphtheria. 
</P>
<P>
 Also obliged to curtail services would be county-run hospitals and public 
clinics that provide basic medical services to poor, uninsured residents. 
Disorders that are treated range from minor wounds to care of serious 
infectious ailments such as tuberculosis, a grave problem among many immigrant 
populations. California leads the nation in reported cases of TB. Some experts 
predict a rise of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection, 
syphilis and gonorrhea if the measure passes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, this provision would probably terminate publicly funded long-term 
nursing home care for undocumented elderly and disabled people, along with 
kidney dialysis treatment. SOCIAL SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants are already ineligible for most major social service 
payouts, such as food stamps, unemployment insurance and federal child welfare 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal also would exclude illegal immigrants from publicly funded 
family planning initiatives and a smattering of specialized government efforts 
targeting at-risk populations, including abused and parentless youth, the 
elderly, blind, mentally impaired, homeless, and drug and alcohol abusers. 
Nonprofit social service groups that use state grants to assist illegal 
immigrants would probably have to stop. LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION 
</P>
<P>
 This section requires that law enforcement agencies "fully cooperate" with the 
INS, and it expressly prohibits legislative, administrative or other actions 
banning such collaboration. The result would be the likely nullification of all 
municipal sanctuary ordinances protecting refugees and the end of 
limited-cooperation agreements with the INS that some law enforcement agencies 
(including the Los Angeles Police Department) have imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision would require that police, deputies, Highway Patrol officers and 
all other California law enforcement officers notify the INS and state attorney 
general's office of any arrestees "suspected" of being illegal immigrants. 
Those identified would have to be advised that "apart from any criminal justice 
proceedings, he or she must either obtain legal status or leave the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics -- including Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, whose name 
appears on the anti-Proposition 187 ballot statement -- say the provision turns 
police officers into INS agents, heightening community distrust. Fearing 
deportation, detractors say, crime victims and witnesses may hesitate to 
contact police. FALSE DOCUMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would amend state law to include stiffer penalties for anyone 
who uses, manufactures or sells false documents designed to "conceal" 
citizenship or immigration status. Much of the proposal largely duplicates U.S. 
and state statutes, which already criminalize the surging false documentation 
trade. Ironically, authorities say Proposition 187, with its greatly widened 
mandate for identification, would probably boost the black market in documents 
to new heights. Proposition 187: What It Does 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187, which will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot, seeks to discourage 
illegal immigration by denying publicly funded benefits. Critics say immigrants 
come to the United States for jobs, not benefits. Here are the major 
provisions: 
</P>
<P>
 EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
 * Current law: Court rulings have held that undocumented children are entitled 
to elementary and secondary public school education. Illegal immigrants may 
also attend state colleges and universities, but most are charged non-resident 
tuition rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Bars enrollment in all public schools, colleges and 
universities. Parents or guardians of all schoolchildren, including U.S. 
citizens, would likewise have to demonstrate legal residence. The law would 
oblige school administrators to report students and parents suspected of being 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 HEALTH SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
 * Current law: Illegal immigrants may receive a wide variety of care at 
publicly funded hospitals and clinics. Federal law bars health facilities from 
denying emergency aid to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Denies non-emergency public care to those who cannot prove 
legal status, including prenatal and postnatal services. 
</P>
<P>
 SOCIAL SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
 * Current law: Federal and state laws bar illegal immigrants from most major 
benefits, such as welfare and unemployment insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187: Cuts off a host of other state and locally funded programs 
that are directed toward troubled youths, the elderly, the blind and others 
with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 LAW ENFORCEMENT COOPERATION

SENATE OPENS HISTORIC DEBATE ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate began an epic debate on national health care reform Tuesday night, 
setting in motion a monumental undertaking that, whatever the outcome, is 
certain to affect the lives and well-being of every citizen and business in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to go forward," declared Sen. Harris Wofford (D-Pa.). "The 
decisions we are about to make are going to be in the history books." 
</P>
<P>
 With time running short before November's midterm elections, in which 
lawmakers will be accountable for their votes on the issue, Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) formally opened the debate with a floor 
speech that described the health care crisis with a combination of statistics 
and personal anecdotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will undertake no more important task in Congress," Mitchell said. "There 
is a crisis in American health care. It is a crisis of affordability and price. 
It has to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's bill, whose prospects are uncertain, seeks to achieve 95% coverage 
by relying on voluntary, market-based measures and government subsidies for the 
needy. But if that target is not reached by the year 2000, large employers 
would be required to provide at least 50% of a worker's insurance premiums 
after the year 2002. Such a so-called employer mandate -- easily the most 
controversial element in the health reform debate -- would be phased in on a 
state-by-state basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell called his approach "a fair, reasonable, rather modest effort." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority leader said that he intends to keep the Senate in session six 
days a week until a health bill is passed, a schedule that will require 
canceling a good chunk of the Senate summer vacation that had been scheduled to 
run from Saturday until mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 The first vote in the debate is expected today on an amendment by Sen. Jesse 
Helms (R-N.C.) to delay consideration of health care reform until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delay equals a victory for special interests," Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) 
said on the Senate floor. "Delay is cowardly. Fifty years is a long time to 
study health care. Let's get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The House is to take up its version of health reform next week. The bill 
crafted by House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) would require 
employers to pay 80% of an employee's premiums. It too faces an uncertain fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, as Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate haggled 
over procedural matters governing the floor debate, the White House stepped up 
pressure on Congress to take bold action. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this debate is conveyed in understandable terms to people and they really 
know what's at stake, there will be increasing support for doing something 
sooner instead of later and for doing the hard decisions now and not postponing 
them," said First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, architect of President Clinton's 
reform plan -- of which only some elements remain under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with reporters, Mrs. Clinton also tried out what will likely 
be the Administration's public strategy for the critical days ahead: to portray 
opponents of health reform as people with vested interests who would have 
resisted enactment of other social programs that now are a part of the American 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton chastised opponents of comprehensive reform for resorting to the 
"same old bromides" that were uttered by those who, she said, had opposed 
Social Security, Medicare, civil rights legislation and the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some of these signs that look like they have been around since 
(Congress debated and enacted) Social Security -- you know, about socialism," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go back and read in your own newspapers what they said about Social Security 
and Medicare," the First Lady told a roomful of newspaper and wire service 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell later picked up the point in his floor speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the same arguments used against health care reform are the same as 
those used against Social Security and Medicare," Mitchell said. "Some of the 
same words used today were used then." 
</P>
<P>
 The Maine senator ended his remarks with a plea to overcome partisan politics. 
"The future quality of life of millions of Americans depends on how firmly we 
put aside partisanship now. . . . It is time to act. My bill is a good starting 
point for action." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady also strongly defended Mitchell's bill, saying that it would 
"establish for the first time the right of Americans to be guaranteed health 
insurance and it does it by permitting voluntary efforts to work and insurance 
reforms to work for a number of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's proposal also got a boost when the Congressional Budget Office, in 
a preliminary estimate released Tuesday evening, said that his approach could 
reach 95% coverage by the year 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was followed on the Senate floor by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.), who said he fears that the Democratic proposal would ruin what is now 
"the best health care system in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans understand there are Americans in need," he said. "Republicans 
want to help." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dole added, health reform "is too important to complete in a rushed 
and haphazard manner." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Mitchell's proposal is "chock full" of 17 new taxes "totaling 
billions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said that he and his fellow Republicans in the Senate favor a more 
incremental approach, one that would not impose "job-killing mandates." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not take the areas where there is universal, overwhelming bipartisan 
agreement, put them all together in a bill, pass it into law and thereby make 
insurance more affordable and more accessible for millions of Americans?" Dole 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), in his floor speech, noted that Dole and 
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) had opposed Medicare in 1965 
and added: "I am sure that neither Sen. Dole nor Congressman Michel would 
propose to repeal Medicare now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, reflecting the sentiments shared by many liberal senators, also 
criticized Mitchell's plan for not providing universal coverage more quickly 
and for not providing more generous terms in coverage for prescription drugs 
and long-term care. He said that he intends to offer amendments to strengthen 
such provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Tuesday, Consumers Union sent a letter to 18 senators that it regarded 
as swing votes urging them to back Mitchell's bill, especially its delayed 
employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The group prefers Gephardt's proposal, but said that Mitchell's bill deserves 
its support because "failure to enact meaningful reform will mean continued 
suffering for those whom the health care system in the country serves 
inadequately." 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks, the First Lady suggested that the President is prepared to 
pursue a strategy of passing health reform legislation with virtually no 
Republican support. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling that the President got his budget adopted last year with only 
Democratic support, with Vice President Al Gore casting the 51st and 
tie-breaking vote in the Senate, Mrs. Clinton said: 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's 51 votes, fine. . . . These are the kinds of trade-offs you make in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning reflective, the First Lady rued the "vicious hatred" aimed at the 
President and herself, calling such personal attacks "very damaging to our 
political process." 
</P>
<P>
 She also spoke wistfully about the efforts of past presidents to enact major 
social legislation, noting that Franklin D. Roosevelt "didn't have to carry 
around actuarial tables and have arguments with people on television."

WILDFIRE ARSON PROBE PROGRESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youths have been questioned and a man was being sought in an arson fire that 
has blackened 6,500 acres and singed two homes in a subdivision, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen spot fires in the Lake Tahoe Basin have also been labeled as 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're focused in on two different areas of the investigation, one involving a 
juvenile, the other involving an adult male," Warren Gay, deputy chief of the 
East Fork Fire Protection and Paramedic District, said of the Holbrook blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities interviewed the youths Monday, Gay said, but the man being sought 
for questioning had not been located. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay said authorities were also investigating a possible link between the 
Holbrook fire and a smaller blaze that broke out earlier Monday near the Clear 
Creek Youth Camp southwest of Carson City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holbrook fire south of Gardnerville broke out at 10:12 a.m. Monday behind 
Holbrook Junction along U.S. 395. Two homes were scorched by the flames and one 
outbuilding and a travel trailer reportedly burned, said Stacey Giomi of the 
Sierra Front Wildfire Cooperators. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was 15% contained Tuesday and was showing little movement because of 
higher humidity and a steady bombardment by air tankers and helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the state line, firefighters aided by cooler weather gained on a series 
of Northern California wildfires that burned 25 homes and a historic 
schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 An arson fire near the town of Kelsey in the Sierra Nevada foothills was 
expected to be fully contained by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A fire near Rough and Ready and a larger blaze along the California-Nevada 
border were encircled by fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Friday, at least half a dozen small fires have erupted in the 
Kelsey-Placerville area. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, authorities evacuated some homes near the town of Columbia in 
Tuolumne County as firefighters battled a 160-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 And an 18,000-acre wildfire in an uninhabited part of the Klamath National 
Forest near the Oregon border was not expected to be contained until Sunday, 
officials said.

HUFFINGTON DROPS HIS SUPPORT OF STALLED CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Huffington, California's Republican Senate nominee, rejected heavy 
pressure from police supporters of a long-stalled crime bill in the House and 
said Tuesday that he will cast a procedural vote that threatens to kill the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) voted in favor of the sweeping $33-billion crime 
bill when it was before the House in April. But his statement Tuesday said he 
is now unhappy that the bill includes more than $1 billion for "social 
programs," even though they were included in the version he supported last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see an end to the days when absurd and costly non-germane programs 
get slipped into big legislative packages," said Huffington, who is challenging 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. "House members should be allowed to 
streamline this bill and make it tougher on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is the dominant issue in California's political campaigns so far this 
year and, in the Senate race, the Clinton Administration-backed crime bill is 
the most significant vote the candidates will cast on the issue before the Nov. 
8 election. The crime bill includes funding for 100,000 additional police 
officers, a "three strikes" sentencing law, an assault weapons ban and a 
package of crime prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials were quick to criticize Huffington's vote. 
Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata charged that Huffington is threatening to 
scuttle the measure because he does not want the senator to win a political 
victory if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was the author of the measure's assault weapons ban and, if it 
becomes law, it would be among her major legislative accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an opportunity to vote for probably the most comprehensive crime 
package in decades," Kuwata said. "It's rather obvious that Congressman 
Huffington has no fingerprints on this bill. . . . Now he comes in in the 
eleventh hour to make his views known only because he doesn't want his 
political opponent to have a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's chief of staff, Fleming Saunders, said the congressman was 
unavailable to comment Tuesday evening. He also said he was uncertain why 
Huffington was speaking out against programs in the bill that he had already 
supported in a previous version. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's statement said he was concerned about funding for a jobs program 
and an after-schools curriculum that was part of the bill's attempt at crime 
prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd like to improve the bill," Saunders said. "You take what opportunities 
you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Saunders also said he was uncertain whether Huffington would support the crime 
bill -- as it is now fashioned -- if it reaches the House floor. But supporters 
of the bill say that could be a moot point if they don't get the votes to pass 
a key procedural vote first. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "rule vote," which Huffington has said he will oppose, is 
required to set procedures for House debate and votes before the bill can be 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and congressional leaders have conducted an intensive lobbying 
effort over the last few days to win approval of the rules resolution and the 
crime bill. On Tuesday, White House officials said the rules vote was still too 
close to call. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a vote on the rules resolution could come today and, if 
successful, the crime bill could reach the House floor this week. 
</P>
<P>
 House vote counters said that as many as 40 Democrats may oppose the rules 
resolution because they are unhappy with the assault weapons ban. Another group 
of Democratic legislators were expected to oppose the rule because the crime 
bill expands use of the death penalty without a provision to allow 
consideration of racial discrimination in capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, supporters of the bill were under pressure to find Republican 
votes. Huffington was considered a prime target because he favored the bill 
previously and he supports the assault weapons ban.

BILL FOR WIDER DEATH PENALTY FAILS AGAIN; ASSEMBLY: PUBLIC SAFETY PANEL BLOCKS 
WILSON-BACKED MEASURE CALLING FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN DRIVE-BY AND CARJACKING 
MURDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time this year, the Assembly Public Safety Committee rejected a 
bill backed by Gov. Pete Wilson to extend the death penalty to people convicted 
of murders committed during drive-by shootings and carjackings. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) needed four votes to 
clear committee but received only three on Tuesday, with four votes against. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union testified that it is 
opposed to the extension of capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Three committee members who voted against the measure are foes of the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee earlier this year killed the same bill by the same 4-3 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said after the committee action that those who voted no "care more 
about protecting criminals than they do about victims" and said they "needed to 
be held accountable" for rejecting the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor had urged the Democrat-dominated committee to approve Presley's 
bill at a rally Monday on the state Capitol steps that was attended by about 
1,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who is running for reelection in November, said he wanted dozens of 
get-tough-on-crime bills approved before the Legislature adjourns at the end of 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee postponed a vote on another bill backed by Wilson to impose 
25-year-to-life sentences for first-time child molesters and violent rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "one strike" measure is sponsored by Sen. Marian Bergeson 
(R-Newport Beach), who agreed to negotiate on amendments, making it possible 
that some version of the legislation would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill calls for a 25-year-to-life sentence for convicted child molesters 
and rapists when the forcible sex offense is associated with such crimes as 
burglary and kidnaping. Current state law provides for prison sentences ranging 
from three, six or eight years to life imprisonment for child molesters and 
rapists.

ON CALIFORNIA: READY OR NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a timeless choreography to California wildfires. A fire always is 
said to have moved faster than anyone ever had seen before. "Weary 
firefighters" slog through every newspaper dispatch, battling "wind-whipped" 
flames and "tinder-dry" conditions. Fire bureaucrats fatefully tabulate 
blackened acres, as though the count somehow matters. And always cameras come 
to rest on a representative victim poking through the ashes of a lost dream. 
The shot tightens and, peering red-eyed into the camera, the dazed unfortunate 
is asked to express how it "feels, when it happens to you." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, one day after a big fire had kicked up behind town, everyone here 
seemed to know the script. In front of Bill's Rough & Ready Market, 
firefighters, no doubt weary, lounged on cots and exclaimed they'd never seen a 
fire move so fast. Residents rounded up lost dogs, and spoke of blessings. 
State information officers posted "fire updates," listing acres burned, 
structures lost, houses "saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the market, proprietor Bill Baumgart provided out-of-town reporters 
with obligatory color. He told how the town, situated in the Sierra foothills 
north of Sacramento, had been named by a Gold Rush 49er who fought under Gen. 
Zachary (Old Rough and Ready) Taylor. And how the miners, angry over taxes and 
drunk, had seceded from the union in 1850, only to abandon the rebellion in 
order to partake of traditional Fourth of July debaucheries. 
</P>
<P>
 When the storyteller was finished, the news crews fanned out to find a 
suitable victim. This led them to Gaylene Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A short, husky woman, Collins leaned on a crutch as she stood among the ashes. 
Her faded blue T-shirt and cotton shorts were covered with smoke. Her face was 
red, and her soot-filled hair tied in a bun. She'd been up all night. Her 
parents pushed a paper plate of Red Cross spaghetti her way, but the 
42-year-old Collins wouldn't eat. Instead, as the satellite trucks rumbled in, 
she performed her part. She told her story. 
</P>
<P>
 She'd torn her knee apart not long ago, cleaning out her Caltrans dump truck. 
Sunday afternoon, she fell asleep exercising the knee in her mobile home. She 
awoke to the smell of smoke. She hobbled out, spotted the flames coming toward 
her lot, called 911 and cleared out. "I knew that was it," she said. "It was 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 From a nearby hill, she looked back and watched. The fire roared through the 
historic Rough and Ready schoolhouse she'd bought eight years ago. She was 
going to live in it. Renovation of the structure, built in 1868, was to have 
begun in a week. Next, the fire took out the trailer house. It burned down a 
shed where her husband, a logger away at work, kept his tools. In the shed was 
a 1965 Kenworth. She showed the reporters a snapshot of the well-polished 
logging truck, "Old Blue" painted across its door. "It was," she said, 
lovingly, "the prettiest truck on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she began to sob. The camera operators leaned in closer. "What does your 
loss mean?" a television man asked. She didn't seem to know how to answer. 
"Once history is on the ground," she said finally, "it doesn't come back up 
very well." This seemed to satisfy. The cameras pulled back. It was time to 
shoot some b-roll of the smoldering ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, beyond the colorful dateline and rustic setting, there was nothing 
much special about the Rough and Ready fire. It was not a big one, as 
California wildfires go. After taking out the Collins property, the fire -- 
started by a tree branch striking a power line -- burned across 500 acres, 
destroying about 10 structures. By late Monday, bigger fires already were 
burning elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 What was noteworthy about the fire, though, was when it happened. According to 
the script, wildfire season doesn't open in California until early September. 
This fire jumped the gun by a month. It spread fast, not because of strong 
winds, but because drought has left the brush and trees exceptionally brittle 
and dry. Like firewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real early season this year," said Don Gannon, chief of the Rough and 
Ready Volunteer Fire Department. "Real early. In terms of how dry things are, 
and in terms of the weather, it's like we are in September already. It's scary. 
Real scary." 
</P>
<P>
 And it is this way all over California. And if there is a message to be taken 
from the Rough and Ready fire, it is simply this: Get used to the script, get 
ready for more fires. Because, ready or not -- and far too early -- the burning 
season has begun.

MEDICINE / BREAST CANCER; STUDY DISPUTES SILICONE IMPLANT RISK

 Challenging the conventional wisdom about silicone breast implants, 
researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said Tuesday that preliminary 
laboratory tests in a handful of women suggest that implants may actually help 
combat breast cancer when the silicone seeps into the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting their results at a meeting in San Francisco, a team of radiology 
scientists found that plasma samples from three women with silicone implants -- 
long suspected of causing rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases -- apparently 
killed breast cancer cells in the test tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The radiologists cautioned that the results are very tentative and that more 
research will be necessary to confirm their findings. They added that they 
would not recommend the controversial implants as a way to fight disease. But, 
they said, their work does point scientists toward a new area of investigation: 
how silicone, or silicone compounds, might be used to treat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always surprised when you find something like this," Leoncio Garrido, 
the research radiologist who led the research effort, said at a news 
conference. If these findings are true, there is the potential for new types of 
drugs that can kill breast cancer and other types of cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one prominent cancer expert was highly skeptical of the findings. Dr. 
John Glaspy, director of the Boyer Oncology Center at UCLA, said that other 
properties in the plasma -- and not silicone -- may have been responsible for 
killing the cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting preliminary observation, but I don't think there's 
anything you can conclude from it," Glaspy said. "The numbers (of women in the 
study) are so small that you can't tell that there's any correlation with 
breast implants." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of women have filed lawsuits contending that they were injured by 
silicone gel breast implants, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
banned two years ago for nearly all cosmetic purposes. Earlier this year, the 
manufacturers of the implants joined in a record-breaking $4.2-billion 
settlement to put an end to the suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido and his colleagues reported their findings at this week's annual 
meeting of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in San Francisco. They conducted 
two separate studies, one tracking the migration of silicone inside the body 
and a second analyzing how the blood of women with implants reacted with cancer 
cells in the test tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies were funded by the National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts 
General, respectively. The first study involved 32 women -- 26 with breast 
implants and eight who served as controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy -- a technique for analyzing the 
chemical composition of tissue -- the researchers found that silicone from 
breast implants travels to the liver. There, it is apparently broken down into 
smaller molecules containing silicon, the element upon which silicone is based. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentrations of silicone and silicon varied from woman to woman. 
Although higher levels of each were found in women whose implants had ruptured, 
Garrido said that implants do not need to rupture in order for silicone to seep 
into the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The second study analyzed how the blood of five women with breast implants 
reacted with cancer cells in the test tube. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that plasma drawn from three women whose implants had been in place 
more than a decade -- from 11 to 17 years -- killed cancer cells; two of those 
women had leaky implants. Plasma drawn from two women whose implants had been 
in place for less time -- about 6 1/2 years -- failed to kill the cancer cells, 
as did plasma drawn from three women who lacked implants.

MUSLIM'S DRIVE FOR FIEFDOM ENDS IN CHAOS; BOSNIA: FOLLOWERS OF WARLORD FIKRET 
ABDIC FLEE AN OFFENSIVE BY THE SARAJEVO GOVERNMENT. THEY SEEK REFUGE AMONG 
CROATIAN SERB SUPPORTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Muslim businessman's yearlong campaign to carve a fiefdom out of 
northwestern Bosnia-Herzegovina collapsed in chaos Tuesday when thousands of 
soldiers and civilians from the Bihac pocket fled into this Serbian-held arc of 
central Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 5,000 civilians and 1,600 armed followers of warlord Fikret Abdic 
have flooded across the wooded hills just west of the town of Pecigrad this 
week since it fell to Bosnian government forces, U.N. officials reported. An 
additional 800 rebel fighters surrendered last week when government forces 
captured Pecigrad after a fierce battle that cost hundreds of casualties on 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would appear to represent the end of Abdic's forces as an effective 
fighting unit," U.N. Protection Force spokesman Paul Risely said from mission 
headquarters in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees were 
alerted by Knin authorities to prepare for the influx of defeated Abdic backers 
and had managed to find food and shelter for most of the first wave out of 
Bihac, said Mieke Bos, head of the U.N. refugee agency office here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless they come by the tens of thousands, they could probably be 
accommodated by the local population," Bos said of the Croatian Serbs who gave 
Abdic crucial support. "But it could become a lot bigger. God forbid they all 
feel they have to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of Abdic's forces, analysts said, marked the end of Bosnia's only 
civil conflict involving members of the same ethnic group -- Muslims -- warring 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It could serve as a moral victory of sorts for the Muslim-led Sarajevo 
government, allowing it to refocus its attention beyond the Bihac pocket, 
population about 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Abdic, his whereabouts were unclear after the core of his fighting 
force was vanquished in Pecigrad and the rest of his followers fled with their 
families into the occupied territory of Croatia, which its occupiers have 
dubbed the Serbian Republic of Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian officials in this self-styled capital of Krajina had supplied Abdic 
and his men with the weapons and other aid they used in the 
Muslim-versus-Muslim battle. They were reported to be prepared to grant him 
asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic has a felony conviction for embezzlement during the Yugoslav era and 
remains under investigation in Austria for allegedly siphoning off money from 
Bosnian emigres; that ploy at one point even involved U.N. Protection Force 
troops in its questionable activities involving food aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic also has offices in the Croatian port city of Rijeka. But his recent 
collusion with Croatian Serbs in the campaign to control Bihac has probably 
foreclosed any option of his taking refuge there. "I think the people in Zagreb 
think he is a little too close to the people down here," the U.N. source said 
amid rumors that Abdic was already under protective Serbian escort and en route 
to Knin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bihac exodus of Abdic supporters is particularly complicated for 
humanitarian aid workers trying to provide safety and shelter for civilians. 
The U.N. refugee agency, for example, has a policy of providing assistance only 
to unarmed civilians; a sizable portion of the Abdic exiles have fled in 
uniform with arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a huge influx of Muslims into this "ethnically cleansed," 
Serbian-occupied territory also can be expected to provoke problems, a concern 
that is spurring aid agencies to explore a means of negotiating an amnesty that 
would allow the refugees to return to Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdic, a wily trader who explored black-market links with Serbian renegades in 
Knin, as well as with Croatian forces, had proclaimed the U.N. safe area of 
Bihac in September to be the Autonomous Republic of Western Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate Muslim civilians who had been cut off from trade and protection by 
the Sarajevo government shifted their allegiance to Abdic when he managed to 
gain control over the distribution of food delivered to the isolated pocket by 
the U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 But as he sought to expand his territory to encompass the whole Bihac pocket, 
Abdic triggered fierce fighting between his backers and soldiers loyal to the 
Sarajevo-commanded Bosnian army.

U.S. MAY EASE SANCTIONS IF SERBIA KEEPS VOW TO CUT OFF BOSNIA ALLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States will consider easing economic sanctions against Serbia if 
President Slobodan Milosevic keeps his vow to cut off all assistance to the 
Bosnian Serbs, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be watching the situation very carefully because of the 
disappointment we had the last time that a similar intention was expressed," he 
told reporters on his return flight from a Middle East trip. "But there have 
been favorable indications on the ground that they will try to stop the flow of 
assistance from Serbia to the Bosnian Serbs." 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic announced last week that Serbia was breaking off relations with the 
Bosnian Serbs over their rejection of a peace plan for war-torn 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information that we have at the present time is that there has been at 
least a partially effective attempt to close the border between Serbia and 
Bosnia," Christopher said. "Up to this point, it appears that Milosevic is 
carrying out the intention that he publicly expressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Christopher said he will be in no hurry to advocate lifting the embargo 
against Serbia and Montenegro, its partner in the rump Yugoslavia. He said the 
international community should not ease sanctions until Milosevic demonstrates 
for an extended time that he has severed all ties with the Bosnian Serbs. But 
he added, "I don't rule out easing of the sanctions if there are verifiable 
deeds to follow the words from Milosevic." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher returned to Washington after a Middle East trip that focused on 
his effort to mediate a peace agreement between Israel and Syria, the region's 
most intractable foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he conceded he was unable to point to progress on any specific issue, 
he said the atmosphere was far more businesslike and less ideological than it 
has been. Senior officials said Christopher will probably return to the region 
next month to continue the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 He is indispensable to the process now because Syria refuses to negotiate face 
to face with Israel, so all of their messages are passed through the U.S. 
go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher said Syrian President Hafez Assad and Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin have begun to talk about the conditions -- and costs -- of making 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior State Department official said the process requires almost constant 
tending by Christopher. If it is too long between trips to the region, Assad 
and Rabin may go back to the sterile ideological debate that marked earlier 
talks.

NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE; HEALTH CARE: PAYING FOR COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They have the same goal: health coverage for all Americans. But the Democratic 
leaders in the House and Senate have proposed very different ways of paying for 
it. House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri would immediately 
require employers to provide coverage to their employees. Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell of Maine would provide incentives for employers to 
cover their workers voluntarily. His plan would only require employers to 
provide it if, by the beginning of the next decade, 95% coverage had not been 
achieved, and then only in states that had not reached that goal. BUSINESS 
OBLIGATIONS 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic Plan: All employers pay 80% of the premium for a standard 
package of benefits, with the worker paying the rest. Employers with 100 or 
more workers must provide coverage starting in 1997. Smaller companies must 
offer the insurance in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 A new Part C of Medicare will provide health insurance coverage for the poor 
and the unemployed. Companies with fewer than 100 workers would have the option 
of buying insurance in the private market or through Medicare Part C. Or the 
small firms could enroll their workers in the health benefits program available 
to federal workers. Employers would be required to make prorated contributions 
for seasonal, part-time and temporary workers. A self-employed person, such as 
an independent contractor or a consultant, would pay for his or her own 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democratic Plan: This aims to achieve coverage of 95% of all Americans 
by the year 2000 through voluntary measures. If the goal is not met, a National 
Health Care Cost and Coverage Commission will send to Congress by May 15, 2000, 
proposals to cover the remaining uninsured Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 If the legislation is not approved by Dec. 31, 2000, an employer mandate will 
be imposed. It would start Jan. 1, 2002, in the states where the 95% target has 
not been reached. All firms with 25 or more workers would be required to 
provide insurance coverage, splitting the cost with their workers on a 50-50 
basis. If a state already had achieved 95% coverage for its residents, 
companies in the state would be exempt from the mandate. Businesses with fewer 
than 25 workers would be exempt in all states. Under the mandate, all 
individuals would be required to have health insurance. INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDIES 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic Plan: Some low- and moderate-income workers would receive 
subsidies to help with their 20% of the cost of insurance. Coverage would be 
free for those at the poverty level, which is $7,400-a-year income for an 
individual, $11,500 for a single parent with one child, and $16,000 for a 
family of four. Partial subsidies would be available on a sliding scale up to 
incomes of 240% of poverty, or $17,760 for an individual and $38,400 for a 
family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democratic Plan: Starting in 1997, individuals and families with 
incomes at the poverty level will receive a full subsidy for the cost of buying 
an average health insurance premium in their regions. Partial subsidies will be 
available on a sliding scale for those with incomes up to 200% of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Pregnant women, and children up to age 19, with incomes up to 185% of poverty 
will receive a subsidy covering the full cost of the local insurance premium. 
Partial subsidies will be available for those with incomes up to 300% of 
poverty. Anyone receiving cash under Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
would receive a full subsidy for insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mandate is triggered in 2002, these subsidies would be implemented: 
workers with incomes up to 200% of poverty will get help in paying for their 
50% share of insurance. Those with incomes at the poverty level will pay no 
more than 4% of their incomes for insurance, with a maximum of 8% for those 
with incomes at 200% of the poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Subsidies would be available to income-eligible workers, whether full-time, 
part-time or seasonal. BUSINESS SUBSIDIES 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic Plan: Firms with 50 or fewer workers would be eligible for a 
sliding-scale credit to reduce their costs of buying insurance. Maximum credit 
would be available when the average payroll is $12,000 or less per worker per 
year, and the subsidy would be phased out when the average annual salary hits 
$26,000. The smallest annual average contribution for a firm would be $1,275, 
or 61 cents an hour. For the biggest firms, the average would be $2,625, or 
$1.26 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democratic Plan: Employers are given financial encouragement to expand 
coverage voluntarily. Subsidies are available starting in 1997 for employers 
that expand insurance to cover all workers. Employers will pay a maximum of 8% 
of the newly covered worker's wages or 50% of the cost of the insurance 
premium, whichever is less. The federal government will pay for the rest of the 
cost of coverage. Subsidies will be available for five years. FINANCES 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic Plan: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduces the rate of growth in spending for Medicare (health program for 
people over 65 and the disabled) and Medicaid (health program for the poor). 
</P>
<P>
 * Raises the cigarette tax, now 24 cents a pack, to 69 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Imposes a 2% surcharge on all health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requires all state and local employees to pay the 1.45% Medicare payroll 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminates the tax advantages workers now get by using "cafeteria" plans in 
which they set aside pre-tax funds at the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democratic Plan: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduces growth rate in spending for Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raises the cigarette tax to 69 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Imposes a 1.75% tax on all health care premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 * Imposes a 25% assessment on high-cost health plans, when increases in annual 
premiums exceed a target level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminates the "cafeteria" plan tax exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requires all state and local employees to pay the 1.45% Medicare payroll 
tax. COST CONTROLS 
</P>
<P>
 House Democratic Plan: Has a standby cost containment system. A new National 
Health Cost Commission will issue annual reports on the growth in health 
spending. Target rates of growth will be established for national health 
spending and for Medicare, with the goal of slowing spending to the general 
growth in economic output. The commission will decide in 2000 whether to 
recommend imposition of limits on spending. If Congress does not object, limits 
would be imposed in states where spending is growing faster than targets. Costs 
would be controlled by using the payment scale for Medicare patients and 
applying it to all doctor and hospital bills in the private sector. This would 
mean a sharp reduction in payments, because Medicare is significantly below 
private payment levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democratic Plan: The National Health Care Cost and Coverage Commission 
will study health care spending and recommend ways to increase coverage and 
restrain costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE TO WATCH: CNN plans extensive live coverage of the U.S. Senate health 
care debate. Coverage begins with start of the debate, tentatively scheduled 
for 8:30 a.m. PDT. C-SPAN also will cover the session. 
</P>
<P>
 TOMORROW: A look at the pros and cons of the plans GLOSSARY 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the more important terms used in the debate on the reform of 
the health care system: 
</P>
<P>
 * Community rating. The practice in which health insurance premiums are based 
on the geographic area and family size, not on pre-existing health conditions, 
health risks or age. Modified community rating allows some differentials for 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cost shifting. When costs are raised for insured people to cover the cost of 
caring for other groups, such as the uninsured or people whose costs are paid 
only in part. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employer mandate. The requirement that all employers must contribute to the 
cost of health insurance premiums for workers. Under the House bill, employers 
would pay 80% and individuals would pick up the remaining 20%. The Senate has 
no mandate for the first several years, although a 50-50 requirement could 
become effective in the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP). A menu of plans that covers 
members of Congress and other federal employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preventive services. Services aimed at preventing disease or detecting 
disease early. Immunizations, mammograms, cholesterol tests and Pap smears are 
typical services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Primary care. Care by non-specialists, such as family doctors, 
pediatricians, some internists and nurses. Usually the first place people go 
for care for a health problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchasing pool or cooperative. Theses are pools of consumers who grouped 
together, should have greater bargaining power to get lower rates for insurance 
than individuals or small businesses usually get on their own. Under President 
Clinton's original proposal, they were known as alliances and were mandatory, 
government-authorized groups that monitored health plans in a region. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single payer. Canadian-style health system in which a health tax is paid to 
the federal government, and individuals see any health care provider. Providers 
paid by government.

U.S. TO BOOST BUDGET FOR AIDS RESEARCH; HEALTH: MOVE WILL SHIFT $70 MILLION 
FROM OTHER HIV PROGRAMS. EFFORTS ALSO PLANNED TO GATHER DATA ON SEXUAL 
PRACTICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. government will boost its budget for basic laboratory research on the 
AIDS virus by 20% next year by shifting $70 million away from clinical studies 
now designed to test drugs and vaccines to curb the epidemic, Dr. William E. 
Paul, the new director of the Office of AIDS Research, said here Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In another move that won the immediate approval of activists, Paul also said 
his office will sponsor new research on sexual behavior -- an area of research 
that had been forbidden by the Reagan and Bush administrations and by 
conservative members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Paul said he will minimize the role of government officials in 
directing research, relying instead on new funds to attract young researchers 
with fresh ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must always recall that the path-breaking work, which has the capacity to 
transform our approach to this disease, will come from insights that cannot be 
planned in any administrative office," he said in an address to the 10th 
International Congress on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Although clinical researchers here did not comment on Paul's proposal to shift 
funds from their programs to basic research, activists were uniform in their 
appreciation of the new plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the six international AIDS conferences that I have attended, I have never 
seen anyone from our government articulate a strategy that is as comprehensive 
and coordinated," said Mark Harrington of the Treatment Action Group. "He is 
using money in a way that is going to save lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes in research direction, added Kevin Frost of ACT UP/New York, "are 
so long overdue that it almost verges on the criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds for the changes were planted almost a year ago when Congress, in 
response to intense criticism by activists and some scientists, drastically 
reorganized the oversight of AIDS research within the National Institutes of 
Health. It wrested budgetary control for such research from the 14 separate 
institutes and vested it in the Office of AIDS Research, which previously had a 
part-time director, Dr. Anthony Fauci. 
</P>
<P>
 To run the AIDS office, NIH director Harold Varmus brought in Paul, an 
immunologist by training with no experience in researching AIDS -- and, thus, 
presumably with no vested interests in any one facet of research on acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome. Paul, in turn, recruited an all-star panel of 
researcher-advisers, who recommended the new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus of this panel -- as well as of many AIDS researchers and 
activists -- is that more basic laboratory studies are necessary if science is 
to come up with a way to combat the complex human immunodeficiency virus, which 
causes AIDS. Although much has been learned about the way HIV works, much 
remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers do not fully understand, for instance, how HIV spreads inside the 
body, or the precise mechanisms by which it wages its attack on the immune 
system. Unraveling these mysteries could lay the groundwork for developing 
better AIDS treatments and a vaccine to prevent infection with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul's ideas have to be taken very seriously, said Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, 
chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, "because he has power 
that the previous 'AIDS czar' never had -- the power of the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul himself emphasized that "OAR now has the authority to shift resources to 
meet these scientific priorities, and I can assure you we have already begun to 
do so." 
</P>
<P>
 OAR has control over a budget of about $1.3 billion, a full 12% of the entire 
NIH budget. About 42% of it is spent developing and testing new drugs and 9% on 
vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, only about 25% is devoted to basic scientific research, with the 
remainder going to prevention, education and other activities. The new proposal 
would shift about $70 million from other areas to basic research but would not 
increase overall funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists and researchers have charged that there is redundancy and wasted 
effort in the clinical trials portion of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul seemed to agree. "A more complete, coherent and cost-effective clinical 
research effort is necessary and possible," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major change from recent policy, Paul said his office will begin efforts 
to obtain information about the nature and extent of various sexual practices 
and substance abuse -- proposals that in the past have been castigated by the 
religious right and others. 
</P>
<P>
 This information, said ACT UP's Frost, is "fundamental to our understanding of 
the pathogenesis of AIDS. Without it, we are wandering around in the dark." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to understand the nature of both substance abuse and sexual 
behaviors before we can begin to change them," Paul said.

SUFFERING IN CENTRAL AFRICA; RWANDA MAKES PLEDGE ON HUMAN RIGHTS; AFRICA: U.S. 
HAILS NEW LEADERS' PROMISE TO TURN OVER SUSPECTS TO U.N. WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
AND PUNISH ACTS OF REVENGE.

 Assistant Secretary of State John H. Shattuck, finding signals of improved 
stability in ravaged Rwanda, hailed the new Rwandan leaders Tuesday for 
promising to turn over suspected killers to a future U.N. war crimes tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shattuck, who heads the State Department's human rights division, also 
welcomed a promise by Paul Kagame, the Tutsi vice president and defense 
minister, that his forces would punish any vigilante acts of revenge against 
members of the Hutu tribe accused of taking part in the frenzy of killing 
during the last four months. Foreign humanitarian workers have estimated that 
half a million Rwandans, mostly Tutsis, died in the slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 These pledges, made after meetings with Shattuck in Kigali and then repeated 
in an official letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, were 
clearly designed to convince Hutus that it is safe to return to Rwanda and to 
reassure the outside world that the new government of Rwanda intends to rule 
within the bounds of international law. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a telephone interview from Nairobi, Shattuck declined to say whether he 
would advise Hutu refugees to leave their camps in Zaire and return to Rwanda. 
He said it is up to officials of humanitarian agencies to make that decision. 
But he called the pledges "very important signals to the improved stability of 
the situation in Rwanda." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Kagame and Prime Minister Faustin Twagirimungu had acknowledged that 
news accounts of murderous reprisals against Hutus are true, Shattuck said that 
the Rwandans had said only that they would punish those responsible if such 
acts occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to Boutros-Ghali, Justice Minister Alphonse-Marie Mkubito urged 
the United Nations to create a tribunal swiftly so suspects would not be 
detained "for an unreasonable time period before trial." 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council, which has not yet established a tribunal, recently 
created a commission to gather evidence of genocide and other violations of 
international law in Rwanda. The commission has four months to finish its work. 
But Mkubito said it is imperative that the commission conclude its work 
expeditiously, well before the four-month deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Mkubito said the Security Council should follow the pattern set when it 
created the Balkans War Crimes Tribunal. Set up more than a year ago, the 
Balkans tribunal has moved slowly and its prosecutor does not expect to issue 
any indictments until almost the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter to Boutros-Ghali also promised that the new Rwandan leaders, who 
routed the Hutu-dominated army last month, "intend to make every effort to 
prevent summary executions and other acts of vigilante justice and to arrest 
those who commit acts of revenge."

CUBAN EMIGRES REPORTEDLY KILL NAVY OFFICER, HIJACK BOAT; CARIBBEAN: THE U.S. 
COAST GUARD SAYS IT INTERCEPTED A VESSEL MATCHING THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SEIZED 
SHIP. 
</P>

<P>
 In a sign that political unrest in Cuba is continuing, Cuban hijackers 
commandeered a naval vessel, killed a Cuban naval officer and set sail for the 
United States, U.S. and Cuban officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said it had intercepted a 50-foot green-hulled vessel that 
matched the description of the hijacked ship but was not certain it was the 
same vessel. About 27 would-be emigres were taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking, reported to U.S. authorities late Monday by Cuban border 
police, was the fourth such incident since July 26 and came just three days 
after an unprecedented riot in Havana that was quelled by police firing into 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration reacted cautiously to the hijacking. Although the 
Pentagon insisted that Washington had not yet taken action to prepare for a 
mass exodus of Cubans, the State Department condemned what it called a 
"disturbing trend" toward violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that people fleeing (President Fidel) Castro's tyranny need our 
help and compassion, but the reported use of sometimes lethal violence by those 
taking over vessels to flee the island is a disturbing trend," spokesman David 
Johnson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, Johnson said the Administration is not considering any 
change in its policy toward Cuba as a result of the incidents. "We will not 
allow Castro to dictate our policy on immigration or any other issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro has said the United States invites Cubans to flee the island by taking 
them in and that he wants America to "guard its coast" against Cuban 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials renewed their appeals to Cuban Americans in Miami -- many of 
whom own small boats and are reportedly ready to pick up refugees who make it 
into international waters -- not to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said the Cuban vessel apparently was hijacked at Mariel, 
the port from which Castro launched a flood of emigres in 1980. The ship was 
intercepted 35 miles north of Cuba en route to Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. authorities had no immediate explanation for why Navy and Coast Guard 
ships and search aircraft had not been able to locate the hijacked vessel until 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hijacking took place late Monday afternoon as the Cuban vessel was docked. 
"People that came from land boarded it and attacked and killed this 
lieutenant," said Rafael Dausa, a political officer in the Cuban Interests 
Section in Washington. "A group of persons took the boat, attacked the boat, 
assaulted the boat and hijacked the vessel." 
</P>
<P>
 He blamed the hijacking on "delinquents and vandals" and asked the U.S. 
government to return them to Cuba. In dozens of cases over the years, in which 
Cubans have hijacked boats and planes -- including MIG fighter jets -- and come 
to the United States, no defector has ever been returned. 
</P>
<P>
 But never before has a military vessel been hijacked. And, coming after the 
unrest in Cuba, the incident was enough to spark another round of jubilation 
among Cuban Americans who want nothing more than the end of Castro's 35-year 
Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the immediate crisis passes, there is so much discontent that riots 
are going to happen again at any moment," said Arturo Cobo, director of the 
Transit Home for Cuban Rafters in Key West, which helps resettle refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The last week in Cuba has been tumultuous, posing what many believe to be the 
most serious threat yet to Castro. Without Russian sponsorship, the Cuban 
economy has steadily deteriorated and the scarcity of food is growing worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The current unrest appeared to begin with the July 13 sinking of a tugboat on 
which dozens were trying to flee to the United States. More than 30 people died 
when Cuban patrol boats rammed the vessel, survivors said. Thirteen days later 
the first of three ferry boat hijackings took place in Havana, incidents that 
brought 130 Cubans to Key West. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday afternoon, thousands gathered on the docks in Havana, apparently in 
response to rumors that boats were available to take them to Miami. As police 
moved in to break up the crowd -- estimated anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000 -- 
plainclothes police fired shots into the air. As people began to scatter, rocks 
were thrown, anti-Castro chants were heard and clashes between police and 
crowds grew intense, according to wire service reports and an amateur videotape 
shown widely in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report issued by the Coordinating Board for Human Rights 
Organizations in Cuba, more than 500 people were arrested and nearly 100 were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Friday, Castro visited the area and accused the United States of 
fomenting trouble by encouraging Cubans to flee to Florida. He then threatened 
to touch off another Mariel boat lift by inviting Cubans in the United States 
to come and pick up relatives on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Cernuda, a Miami resident who represents a coalition of human rights 
groups on the island, said Friday's events were "the first time a demonstration 
has openly taken place against the government and also the first time that 
large groups of young Cubans have dared to defy the police, acting out in civil 
disobedience." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a classified plan in place that details the federal and state 
response if another Mariel-type exodus were to begin, government sources said. 
Called "Operation Distant Shore," the plan calls for a naval blockade of the 
Florida Straits to stop boats arriving from Cuba and the seizure of U.S. 
vessels used to bring in immigrants. Those who do get through would be detained 
outside Florida; those who ferry them in would be prosecuted, sources familiar 
with the document said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cubans continue to leave Cuba the way they have for years: by raft. 
Over the weekend, more than 440 refugees showed up for processing in Key West, 
Cobo said. The Coast Guard reports assisting 5,163 Cubans into the United 
States this year, more than any year since 1980.

<P>
 A breakthrough agreement between longtime enemies on mainland China and Taiwan 
includes important steps meant to stop a spate of hijackings from China. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first significant agreement since formal contact between the two 
rival governments began in the spring of 1993. The latest talks ended Sunday, 
and the highest-ranking Chinese envoy to visit Taiwan since 1949, Tang Shubei, 
flew back to Beijing on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides reached consensus on how to deal with hijackers, as well as 
illegal mainland workers in Taiwan and fishing disputes in the Taiwan Straits, 
a joint news release said. A formal agreement will be signed after minor 
differences are resolved, it said.

 An inmate who escaped from jail by braiding minty-waxed dental floss into a 
rope as thick as a phone cord and scaling a fence was captured Tuesday, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after his escape, Robert Shepard was arrested by state troopers and 
Wood County Sheriff's deputies. Authorities allege he had robbed a drugstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9, 155-pound Shepard escaped June 29 from the South Central 
Regional Jail, where he was awaiting trial on charges he robbed a post office.

BAN ON ADDING IMMIGRANT KIN TO WELFARE ROLLS IS RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Families who bring relatives into the country should be prohibited from adding 
them to welfare rolls, a federal advisory commission recommended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commission on Immigration Reform, headed by former Rep. Barbara Jordan 
(D-Tex.), said the government must get tough with the growing number of 
immigrants who wind up on welfare despite their relatives' promises to support 
them financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Most legal immigrants are the spouses, children, parents or siblings of U.S. 
citizens or long-term permanent residents. These relatives, known as sponsors, 
must agree to support the new arrival and are required to sign an affidavit of 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Court decisions, however, have made the affidavit unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also recommended making it easier for the government to deport 
legal immigrants who get on welfare within five years of their arrival in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan told the House Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources that 
welfare benefits should remain available to legal immigrants whose families' 
financial circumstances change significantly after their arrival.

COELHO GETS POST TO BOOST DEMOCRATIC PROSPECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to boost his party's sagging political prospects in the November 
elections and strengthen ties on Capitol Hill, Democratic National Chairman 
David Wilhelm Tuesday named former California Rep. Tony Coelho as a senior 
adviser to the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm, who was President Clinton's choice to head the party, also disclosed 
that he plans to resign after the fall election to return to his home in 
Chicago. "I'm doing this to put an end to the constant speculation about my 
role at the national committee," said Wilhelm, who has been the target of 
continuing criticism as Democratic fortunes have waned over the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To Democratic problems growing out of the Whitewater controversy and the Paula 
Corbin Jones sexual harassment case, the 52-year-old Coelho -- now an 
investment banker in New York -- brings his own personal baggage, allegations 
of financial impropriety in his personal investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Those charges, and a report that the Justice Department had started a 
preliminary inquiry into the matter, led him to resign his House seat in 1989 
after representing California's 15th congressional district for more than 10 
years. The Justice Department, however, sent him a letter last year saying that 
it would take no action against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his resignation, Coelho had become an influential figure in the 
Democratic congressional leadership. He denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the allegations against Coelho, the announcement is expected to be a 
plus for the Clinton White House on Capitol Hill, where Coelho is remembered 
for his success as a fund-raiser when he headed the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of Congress will react very positively," predicted Democratic 
pollster Mark Mellman. "This will signal to them that the Democratic Party is 
back in the business of helping them get elected instead of pressuring them to 
cast unpopular votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm said that Coelho's past problems would be minimized by the informal 
nature of his new position. "He is a volunteer," Wilhelm said. Committee aides 
said that Coelho would not be paid. He is expected to continue to serve as a 
senior vice president at the Wall Street firm of Wertheim, Schroeder & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm noted that Coelho has "been informally advising folks at the White 
House for several months." A number of White House aides served on Coelho's 
staff on Capitol Hill. And a former congressional colleague from California, 
White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, was said by a well-placed source to 
have urged that Coelho be given this new role at the national committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Party professionals said that Democratic National Committee relations with 
Democratic lawmakers had suffered under Wilhelm. In part, this friction had 
less to do with Wilhelm personally than with the fact that Democratic members 
of Congress had to try to cooperate with a Democratic White House for the first 
time in 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm was pictured by those who knew him as caught between his loyalty to 
the President whose campaign for the White House he managed and his concern for 
his party's lawmakers. "Wilhelm had a hard time figuring out whether his job 
was to help Democrats win elections or help Clinton get his program passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have been notably unsuccessful at the polls since Clinton captured 
the White House. They have been embarrassed by losing the mayoralties of the 
nation's two largest cities, Los Angeles and New York, the governorships of 
Virginia and New Jersey, a Senate seat in Texas and several House seats.

CIGARETTE SMOKE CONTRIBUTES TO VISIBLE SMOG, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although car exhausts, fireplaces and smoky restaurant grills emit much of the 
visible smog that envelops Los Angeles, researchers have found that cigarette 
smokers also leave a mark in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco smoke makes up about 1% of the area's visible pollution, a group of 
environmental scientists found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smog in L.A. is a complicated mixture of chemical substances," Glen R. 
Cass of Caltech said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you hear about mostly are the daily ozone concentrations -- a 
transparent gas that's a respiratory irritant. What we're working on is a 
different part of the problem: the airborne particle complex -- solid particles 
and liquid droplets in the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Cass said fine particles in the air create most of the visibility problem and 
are the "most likely to get in the bottom of your lungs, as opposed to large 
dirt particles that probably won't make it past your nose." 
</P>
<P>
 To look for traces of cigarettes, Cass and a group of fellow scientists 
tracked two hydrocarbon compounds -- isoalkanes and anteisoalkanes -- found in 
the surface waxes of tobacco leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the best tracers because they were chemically stable in the 
atmosphere and, at the same time, they could be distinguished in the 
atmospheric samples from other contributing sources," said Cass. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his team have been analyzing Los Angeles pollution for a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 The team calculated that cigarette smoke particles constituted 1% to 1.3% of 
the fine particles in Los Angeles' atmosphere, as recorded by air monitoring 
stations in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Other comparable particle polluters included automobile brake linings and 
tires as they wear down and emissions from roofing tar pots.

reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Airbus A-300 skidded into a safety barricade on a rain-slick runway on the 
southern resort island of Cheju, KBS television said.

<P>
 Nine people sustained minor injures and were being treated at the police 
infirmary, KBS said. At least nine Japanese were aboard the domestic flight 
from Seoul, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was caught by wind gusts after touching down, witnesses said. The 
pilot tried to abort the landing and take off again, but the airliner skidded 
and crashed, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds were gusting because Typhoon Doug was approaching the Korean peninsula 
when the accident happened, the network said.

HELICOPTER FAILS TO LIFT DANTE OUT OF VOLCANO AS CABLE SNAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An effort to lift NASA's crippled Dante II robot from a volcano by helicopter 
failed Tuesday when the cable snapped, dropping the machine farther down the 
crater. A scientist on the ground fell and broke his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists debated whether to go to their backup plan -- sending a person into 
the crater to put a helicopter sling around Dante -- or abandon the 
$1.7-million spider-like robot altogether, as was suggested when Dante first 
got stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-legged Dante was damaged Friday when it slipped on rocks while 
trying to climb out of the crater. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante's half-inch-thick, Kevlar-reinforced power cable snapped when a National 
Guard Blackhawk helicopter tried to lift the robot by the cord. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable had served as a tether holding the robot to the crater's rim and as 
a way for scientists to power and communicate with the robot. It had undergone 
tests designed to ensure that it was strong enough to carry the 1,700-pound 
robot. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cable broke, the helicopter was assigned to take Tim Hegadorn, a 
Carnegie Mellon University graduate student, to the hospital. Hegadorn, 32, 
slipped on the crater's rim during the retrieval attempt and broke his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he lost his footing in mud and rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante was developed at Carnegie Mellon for NASA, which hopes someday to 
explore planets with robots. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante was brought to Mt. Spurr, 80 miles west of Anchorage, to test its 
ability to explore terrain deemed unsafe for humans and to collect scientific 
information from the volcano, which erupted three times in 1992.

WHITE HOUSE KEPT IN DARK ON $310-MILLION SPY OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Department concealed the cost 
and size of a massive headquarters for their clandestine spy satellite 
operations not only from Congress but also from the White House, officials 
acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies were so successful in hiding even the identity of the 
$310-million structure, being built in plain view on a 68-acre site near Dulles 
International Airport outside Washington, that Leon E. Panetta, former director 
of the White House Office of Management and Budget and now President Clinton's 
chief of staff, had no idea that the four office towers belonged to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-million-square-foot project, originally authorized in 1990, has been 
under construction for more than three years under cover of an office complex 
for the Los Angeles-based defense contractor, Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), chairman of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence, said the price tag of the complex is nearly double what his 
committee had been led to believe. He said committee members knew it was being 
constructed but that budget estimates and details were given to the committee 
piecemeal and buried in larger intelligence accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Tuesday ordered an immediate inquiry into how and why 
details were kept from Congress and the White House. He also ordered the 
building project declassified, which means that construction and cost details 
will be released. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget, personnel and operations of the National Reconnaissance Office 
itself, however, will remain almost entirely secret. 
</P>
<P>
 The office, jointly operated by the Air Force and the CIA, for decades was 
officially classified and its name could not be uttered in public without 
violating government secrecy regulations. The existence of the satellite 
operation was not acknowledged publicly until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility was discovered by auditors for DeConcini's committee during a 
review of construction projects for the intelligence community. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini told Clinton, Panetta and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake 
about the project during a meeting last week. He said all three were "caught by 
surprise" and that Panetta, who is known for his mastery of the federal budget, 
was amazed that so large a facility could be funded in such secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini urged Clinton to name independent auditors to conduct an inquiry 
into the project but the President instead put the review in the hands of the 
CIA and the Pentagon, who were responsible for hiding the project's spending in 
their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers defended the decision to put the two 
agencies in charge of investigating themselves, saying the President has 
confidence in the integrity of CIA chief R. James Woolsey and Deputy Defense 
Secretary John M. Deutch, who will supervise the internal inquiry. Both men are 
Clinton appointees. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini, still fuming at the concealment by the intelligence agencies, said 
he has no idea whether the investigation will uncover other multimillion-dollar 
clandestine operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all we know, they might have a battleship floating around out in the 
Pacific with a bunch of communications on it that we don't know about," the 
senator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini raised the question of whether Woolsey himself may have been kept in 
the dark about the project by his own agency. If the CIA director had known 
about it, DeConcini said, "I can't imagine Woolsey being so foolish as to not 
report it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 A CIA spokesman declined to comment, referring all questions to the National 
Reconnaissance Office, which said in a brief statement that the building was 
begun in 1990, two years before the office's existence was declassified. The 
agency said the facility, when completed in 1996, will house approximately 
3,000 employees who now work in offices scattered around the Washington area. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex will include office space, a cafeteria, conference facilities, a 
generator building and "other support functions," the statement said. "The 
building is intended to support the NRO mission of meeting U.S. government 
space-borne intelligence reconnaissance needs. . . . No other information about 
the NRO or this project has been declassified," the statement added. 
</P>
<P>
 The towers, three of which already have been enclosed in glass skins, are in 
clear sight of Virginia Route 28, a major highway in the suburban area. The 
only identification is a sign that says "Rockwell" and gives the site's 
address. Fairfax County officials and local residents were told that it was a 
private office project for the defense contractor, a fiction created by the spy 
agencies to conceal the buildings' true purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 A Rockwell spokesman in Los Angeles said only that: "Rockwell is constructing 
a facility in Northern Virginia to support certain government contract 
activities of our defense electronics business. Construction work on the 
project is being performed by CISCO, a Rocwkwell subsidiary." The spokesman, 
William Blanning, said that all further details are classified. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, Rockwell has paid more than $1.5 million in property 
taxes on the office complex to preserve the impression that the buildings were 
not a federal installation, according to the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles firm has paid Fairfax County, Va., $1.57 million in property 
taxes on the 68-acre tract. It could not be determined whether government funds 
were used to pay the taxes or whether Rockwell used its own money, the 
newspaper said. The county values the site at $80.2 million. The 1994 tax bill 
on the property is $931,841, half of which Rockwell paid last month. As a 
federal government facility, the project would have been exempt from local 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the House and Senate intelligence committees plan to examine the project 
in hearings today.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL SOUGHT IN ESPY CASE; PROBE: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL MAKES THE 
REQUEST. HER DEPARTMENT ALLEGES THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY RECEIVED GIFTS FROM 
GROUPS HIS OFFICE REGULATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on Tuesday sought appointment of an independent counsel 
to investigate whether Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy broke the law by 
accepting gifts worth "at least several hundred dollars" from a major poultry 
producer regulated by his department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a broadly worded mandate to the special three-judge court that would name 
the counsel, Reno said the Justice Department's preliminary investigation 
uncovered a number of instances in which Espy is alleged to have received gifts 
from organizations and individuals with business pending before his department. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission of the independent counsel proposed by Reno was broad enough to 
include allegations that Ronald Blackley, Espy's chief of staff in March, 1993, 
ordered Agriculture Department officials to halt work on developing tougher 
poultry inspection standards and to erase a draft of the proposal from their 
computers' memories. Blackley has denied giving the orders on the inspection 
standards, which were strongly opposed by poultry producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Espy has proclaimed his innocence and White House spokeswoman Dee Dee 
Myers Tuesday reiterated President Clinton's confidence in his Cabinet member, 
the investigation is sensitive for the Clintons because it involves Tyson Foods 
Inc. of Arkansas. Tyson President Don Tyson is a longtime Clinton backer and 
the firm's outside counsel, James B. Blair, helped First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton make nearly $100,000 in commodity trading profits in 1978, 1979 and 
1980 on an initial investment of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's preliminary inquiry found no evidence that Espy 
accepted gifts as a reward for past or future acts, Reno said in her 
application to the court. But the law bars the department from declining to ask 
for an independent counsel because of lack of evidence of the required intent 
"unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the person lacked such 
state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she noted that the Independent Counsel Act significantly restricts 
the department from exercising "its customary prosecutorial discretion when 
investigating a person under the act" and removes such traditional 
investigative tools as a grand jury. The discretion and the tools are left to 
an independent counsel to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The special court took no immediate action in naming an outside prosecutor. 
The same panel last Friday named Kenneth W. Starr, solicitor general during the 
George Bush Administration, to take over the Whitewater probe from Robert B. 
Fiske Jr., whom Reno had appointed after a previous independent counsel law had 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Espy case, the department's investigation developed evidence that he 
had accepted gifts from Tyson Foods on two separate trips, one to Arkansas in 
May, 1993, and one to Texas last January, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 trip involved a speech by Espy to the Arkansas Poultry Federation in 
Russellville, Ark., and a stay with a companion, Patricia Dempsey, at a group 
of Tyson cottages on a lake there. Espy and Dempsey returned to Washington on a 
Tyson plane, which Espy has explained by saying that he had to return quickly 
for an unexpected White House meeting. Tyson said Espy reimbursed the company 
for the cost of a first-class ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 The January trip reportedly involved Espy and Dempsey sitting in Tyson's sky 
box during the National Football League's National Conference championship game 
between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys. At the time, Espy has said, 
he was in Texas for a meeting with an Agriculture Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 The other instances in which Espy is alleged to have received gifts from 
organizations with business before his department are understood to include a 
request that he had made of Chicago-based Quaker Oats for a ticket to a Chicago 
Bulls playoff game. He is alleged to have used the personal season ticket of 
Quaker Oats' chief executive, William Smithburg. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Evan T. Barr, one of Espy's lawyers, said all of his client's 
"official and personal travel and entertainment expenses have been properly 
accounted for and reimbursed. Secretary Espy has never misused his office in 
any way at all." 
</P>
<P>
 In her application to the court, Reno noted that the anti-gratuity statute, 
one of the laws under which Espy's actions will be examined, is a strict 
statute that bars department employees with responsibilities under the Meat 
Inspection Act from accepting any gift from anybody engaged in commerce, 
without regard to intent.

APPEALS COURT PUTS DAY CARE CUSTODY CASE ON HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Michigan Court of Appeals on Monday delayed the transfer of a 3-year-old 
girl from her mother to her father, who had won custody because her mother puts 
the child in day care. 
</P>
<P>
 A lower court had ruled that Steve Smith could provide a more stable home for 
his daughter because Smith's mother, a full-time homemaker, would look after 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's 19-year-old mother, Jennifer Ireland, would send the girl to day 
care while attending the University of Michigan. Smith, 20, also plans to go to 
college but lives with his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The custody battle over Maranda Ireland-Smith has set off debate about day 
care and working parents, with the split often falling along gender lines. The 
National Organization for Women has backed Ireland; the National Congress for 
Men and Children has set up a legal defense fund for Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland was supposed to turn Maranda over to Smith by Thursday, but the 
appellate court action means that the girl will stay with her mother until 
Ireland's appeal of the lower court ruling is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys on both sides said a decision is not expected until late this year. 
No hearing has been scheduled yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has accused Ireland of neglecting their daughter, said he was 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland said she takes good care of the girl. The pair never married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a neglectful mother," she told WDIV-TV outside her Harrison Township 
home. "Granted I probably wasn't the best mother when I brought her home when I 
was 16. I have grown up tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip J. Holman of the National Congress for Men and Children said the case 
is "a good illustration of how we misconstrue the importance of fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Howard Simon of the American Civil Liberties Union, which supports 
Ireland, said a ruling in favor of Smith could hurt both working men and 
working women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not pro-male. It's anti-parents who are dependent on day care," Simon 
said.

FIGHTING THE GIANT; AS SCION OF THE WEALTHY TOBACCO CLAN, PATRICK REYNOLDS 
COULD HAVE HAD A LIFE OF EASE. BUT WHEN HIS FAMILY OF SMOKERS BEGAN TO DIE, HE 
HAD TO TAKE A STAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTIJANE LEVINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Reynolds, tobacco heir, easily explains himself: "I fight the tobacco 
industry. That is who I am, and what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 At a Town Hall lecture last Thursday night, Reynolds, 45, proves he has few 
peers in his chosen role of biting the hand that used to feed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Casually, as if among friends, Reynolds straightens the jacket of his pearl 
gray suit, stands before 100 members of the prestigious current affairs group, 
and quietly starts to reminisce: 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents divorced when I was 3. I didn't see my father again. At 9, I was 
so desperate for his hugs and love that I wrote him a letter: 'Dear Dad, Where 
are you? I want to meet you. Your loving son, Patrick.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The letter reached R.J. Reynolds Jr. on a yacht in the South Seas. The father 
eventually sent for his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick flew in one of his father's private planes to an island estate off the 
coast of Georgia, where he was ushered into a darkened room. There, his father 
lay flat in bed, gasping for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Joshua Reynolds Jr., son and namesake of the founder of the great 
tobacco firm, was suffering from emphysema -- the result of a life spent 
smoking the Camels and Winstons on which the family fortune was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds died slowly and painfully six years later, when Patrick was 15. In 
the interim, there were a few more visits, of increasingly shorter duration. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Patrick has lost four more close relatives from smoking-related 
causes. His half-brother R.J. Reynolds III -- Joshua -- whom Patrick called a 
"good buddy," died June 28 in North Carolina of emphysema and heart failure. He 
was a heavy smoker of Winstons, Patrick told friends at a small memorial 
service he conducted in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds has told his story repeatedly at universities, health groups, youth 
groups and corporate meetings around the country -- lectures for which his 
average fee is $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after last Thursday's talk, for example, he flew to address 10,000 
teen-agers in Denver at an annual Seventh-Day Adventist gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a compelling speaker, partly because each time he talks the anguish is so 
apparent and sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 And partly because he is, after all, a Reynolds -- scion of one of America's 
great fortune-building clans. His patrician profile, blond good looks -- the 
elegant, soft-voiced, delivery of a tale that could be straight out of "Dallas" 
or "Dynasty" -- are the stuff to make audiences gaze in wonder at what this 
man's gilded, turbulent life must be like. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Reynolds zaps them with reality. One out of every five deaths in 
the United States is due to smoking. It causes more deaths annually than 
cocaine, alcohol, heroin, fire, suicide, homicide, AIDS and auto accidents 
combined. It is the single most preventable cause of death, disease and 
addiction in our era, and tobacco is the only product sold legally in the world 
that has a harmful effect when used as intended. The direct medical cost for 
each pack of cigarettes smoked is about $2, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His information is from the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Assn. 
and studies by various government and prestigious private institutions. The 
statistics he quotes are not even controversial, says Joseph Cherner of 
Smoke-Free Educational Services, a New York-based volunteer group. Yet our 
elected officials refuse to do much about stopping the plague, he says. 
Reynolds wants action. For starters, he'd like higher cigarette taxes, a ban on 
cigarette ads, and prohibition of the sale of cigarettes to people under 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty percent of all smokers start by age 14. Ninety percent are addicted by 
age 19," he tells the group, citing figures from the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services. Why the apathy, he asks? It's easy to blame only the 
tobacco industry, he says. But he believes that there are even more dastardly 
culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the elected officials who accept hefty campaign contributions from 
the tobacco lobby -- funds that give them a tremendous financial advantage over 
challengers at election time. Reynolds believes these officials won't ever vote 
willingly against tobacco interests because they would lose the contributions 
the industry provides. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as ugly and simple as that, Reynolds says. And he's trying to gather 
citizens on his side to help stop it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry is not amused. DeeDee Whitt, representative for R.J. 
Reynolds, says: "Adults don't want to be told what to do, but Patrick wants to 
tell them anyway." Thomas Lauria, spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, says the 
lobbying group "declines comment on Mr. Reynolds' activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Scotty Baesler (D-Ky.), who debated Reynolds on "Night-line" last week, 
says, "I represent the farmers out in the fields. Tobacco provides 60% of their 
income in our state. That can't be changed or eliminated without great hardship 
-- something Reynolds mightn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Reynolds divested himself of $2.5 million worth of tobacco stock 
inherited from his grandmother. His mother, a lifetime smoker, had recently 
died of emphysema and heart disease; his favorite aunt, Nancy, of lung cancer 
and emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fighting his own pack-a-day habit of 10 years, which he finally 
conquered in 1986. One year later, he notified his brothers that he was about 
to testify on Capitol Hill in favor of a ban on cigarette ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're gonna do what, boy?" asked his half-brother Will, worried that the 
publicity would make Reynolds stock drop in value. Half-brother John, when told 
the news, worried that their father and grandfather would "spin in their 
graves." 
</P>
<P>
 And brother Michael told the press that although he didn't agree with his 
brother, "Patrick is sincere." Patrick says that until his half-brother Joshua 
died in June, they maintained a good relationship by "agreeing to disagree" 
about tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' first anti-smoking testimony in Washington catapulted him to a kind 
of national fame that has been more enduring than his sporadic attempts at an 
acting career, which he never pursued with as much vigor. 
</P>
<P>
 He has appeared on virtually all the major network and cable TV news and talk 
shows, from "Good Morning America" to "Oprah," "Larry King Live" and 
"Nightline." His dossier includes raves from media hosts, who frequently invite 
him back for more. And his numerous humanitarian awards come from the World 
Health Organization, hospitals, schools and civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, he started a nonprofit, charitable organization, "Citizens for a 
Smoke-Free America," which he runs from his combined home and office on the 
eastern fringe of Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to educate," he tells the Town Hall gathering, and to 
eventually "create a society that is totally smoke-free." 
</P>
<P>
 But the shocker of the evening comes after Reynolds' talk, during a lively 
period of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you tell us how your organization works," asks a woman who wants to 
know how many employees he has, what they do, how they go about trying to rid 
the world of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds pauses. Smiles. Rubs his forehead. Then divulges that he "has no 
money" for employees, that he can afford a secretary only on Friday afternoons, 
that he works alone out of his small house -- and that he is in need of funds 
to continue his crusade. "I earn my living from giving these lectures," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds is not exactly poor by most people's standards, but he might have 
been much richer if he'd kept his stock. He says he has spent about half his 
inheritance on the anti-smoking crusade, and he lives off the interest on the 
remainder along with earnings from his lectures and various other projects. 
</P>
<P>
 He never inherited a cent from his father, who left an estate valued "anywhere 
from the tens of millions to the hundreds of millions," Reynolds says. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, a pioneer in the airline and shipping industries and a onetime 
treasurer of the National Democratic Party, married four times. 
</P>
<P>
 The first marriage produced four sons and lasted until he set eyes on 
Patrick's mother, Marianne O'Brien -- a Warner Bros. starlet described by 
Patrick as "an extraordinary beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds Jr. left his first wife and sons for O'Brien, after a divorce 
settlement that was the largest in U.S. history at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick was one of two sons born during their seven-year marriage, after which 
his father married a third time -- a union that produced no offspring. R.J. 
Reynolds Jr.'s fourth wife bore him a daughter 36 hours after he died in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of that union, Irene Reynolds, lives "somewhere in Europe," 
Patrick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick's father did pay for his young son's summers at sailing camp in North 
Carolina. And for elite boarding schools from the age of 9, and for Hotchkiss 
preparatory school in Connecticut, after which Patrick entered the University 
of California, Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 He was raised like a prince but had no realm. A few, uncommunicative visits 
with his dad, from the ages of 9 to 15. And one weekend a month with his 
mother, when he came home from boarding school. "There was no mirror for me to 
look into, to ever know who I really was," Reynolds says. 
</P>
<P>
 He has undergone psychotherapy, attended Adult Children of Alcoholics for two 
years and participates in a men's group where he can unload the accumulated 
grief. "Once you grieve, you can heal," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He readily admits to scads of broken romances and a two-year marriage that 
ended in divorce. He wants nothing more than to marry someone "from a nice 
family" with whom he can have children, he says. He would like to be the father 
he never had. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he says, he'll continue to battle against the industry that gave 
him so much -- and then took it away.

CAN THESE TWO REALLY MAKE A LOVE CONNECTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 She's 26, a just-divorced mother of two young children and the only child of 
celebrities who separated when she was 4. Her mother is an actress. Her father, 
who by most reports died more than 15 years ago, was addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 After a turbulent adolescence marked by bodyguards, tony private schools and 
reported drug skirmishes, she married a little-known musician and flirted with 
an acting career. Reclusive and mysterious, the pouty heiress has helped manage 
her father's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth date: Feb. 1, 1968. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 He's 35, a lifelong entertainer and bachelor who harks from a large and once 
working-class family. This child prodigy's mother was a homemaker, and his 
strict father, whom one sister claims molested her, used to manage his career. 
With a propensity for excess, perfectionism, fantasy, odd dressing and plastic 
surgeries, off-stage he is notoriously shy and reclusive, although he's been 
seen escorting starlets and has been in trouble for alleged child molestation 
and was recently treated for prescription drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth date: Aug. 28, 1958.

<P>
 He, of course, is the Gloved One, the King of Pop Michael Jackson of 
Neverland. She is Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of crowned King of Rock Elvis 
Presley of Graceland. 
</P>
<P>
 Married in secret on May 26, they plan to raise a family, according to a 
written statement by Mrs. Lisa Marie Presley-Jackson, a missile that raises 
more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Is she after him for his money? Is he after her for her money? Was Elvis at 
the wedding? 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, can this peculiar merger, this family therapist's challenge, 
survive? Naming no names at first, we provided the above profiles to five 
analysts for their expert opinions. Syndicated columnist Dr. Joyce Brothers: 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll succeed beyond belief because they have so much in common. Their 
problems were a sense of not having been given love and not having learned to 
give love in return. Both are reclusive but (that's) very lonely, so how nice 
to be a recluse with a buddy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Their problems mesh with each other. You have one with the problem of always 
having everything without ever having to work and the other always having had 
to work. So what you have here are people on opposite end of extremes and 
they're balancing each other by coming together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their difficulties . . . can make them stronger and their similarities can 
allow for them to be best friends and keep them away from drugs. She can work 
out issues with her father and . . . he can break the (family) cycle of abuse 
by being protective and caring toward her, which is what she needs. The bumps 
in his head fit the holes in hers. I can't think of a better union for both." 
Pasadena clinical psychologist Gary Brainerd, a certified Imago Relationship 
Therapist who heads "Getting the Love You Want" workshops across Southern 
California: 
</P>
<P>
 "Without seeing the people, I could only say that the relationship is fraught 
with difficulties. If they are willing to do the necessary work there is 
potential for healing and success, but it will require a great deal of courage, 
persistence and knowledge. We tend to pick people with significant problems 
which are similar to those our parents had so it makes sense that they are 
significantly attracted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've both experienced significant wounding complicated by significant life 
benefits, such as wealth and the freedom that comes from that. But clearly the 
wounds outweigh the benefits so it makes sense that two people like that find 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a power struggle phase where the wounds will get activated and 
that will be the critical period. How they deal with the resulting anxiety, 
pain and disillusionment will determine the success of the relationship. I 
would encourage them to get into marital therapy very early with someone who 
really understand these kinds of complications." Beverly Hills matchmaker Debra 
Winkler: 
</P>
<P>
 "Although on the surface they appear as volatile personalities destined to 
(marital) failure, on close examination there are a lot of deep similarities. 
Both have had very unusual and extremely difficult childhoods, been surrounded 
and deeply involved in the music industry since infancy, been constantly 
subjected to media attention and grew up in fishbowl existences, therefore 
becoming reclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since lasting relationships are based on similarities, not differences, I 
think this could be a very powerful and deeply connected relationship. Neither 
will feel exploited for monetary reasons or to gain notoriety (because) both 
are wealthy and famous in their own right. If they haven't been too scarred to 
have a relationship, they could be extremely supportive of each other's past 
experiences in a way few others in the world could. I don't know about the sex 
part, but not every marriage is based on that." Joan Quigley, onetime 
astrologer to Nancy Reagan: 
</P>
<P>
 "Their charts are quite intriguing. They have a lot in common. To both, life 
is a fantasy, kind of unreal. Both are emotionally complex and both have 
commercial good sense. Both had complexes about their mothers. His own mother 
lacked what he wanted. In (Lisa's) case, he supplies emotional security and 
mothering she felt her mother failed to give her, as well as a place to live 
that'll make her feel good. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two kinds of attraction -- those that lead to one-night stands and 
those that lead to the altar. In both charts, the altar is extremely strong, so 
I can see why they married in a fever. He would go to her across a crowded 
room. He no doubt told her it was love at first sight. She may feel he could 
help her singing career as she has a great urge to express herself that way. 
She doesn't have a fantastic voice but she could develop one through sheer 
willpower. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may announce they're going to have a baby very shortly." New York-based 
marriage counselor Evelyn Moschetta, contributing editor for Ladies' Home 
Journal "Can-This-Marriage-Be-Saved?" column: 
</P>
<P>
 "The female was very pampered and not really permitted to develop a sense of 
her own self and strengths. Having not much self-identity would not give her a 
good sense of self-esteem, strength and power on her own. He has similar 
problems in that he's not sure of his identity as a male. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a marriage between two adult female and male persons with a good sense of 
self and a sense of going beyond the self for the other, the egos weren't 
well-defined enough so there would be a lot of trouble here. (But) if they want 
a marriage of friendship to help each other grow, it could work if there were 
reasonable expectations; however, there may not be with such fragile egos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would absolutely recommend very good marital therapy. They can begin to 
learn about themselves because marriage can become a mirror for who we really 
are. I think every marriage has possibilities if the people are not too badly 
damaged. With therapy, they have a shot. Without it, I don't think the 
prognosis is very good at all."

'90S FAMILY; COMMENTARY; KIDDIE POLITICS; WHAT TO DO WHEN JUNIOR LACKS A SOCIAL 
CIRCLE? MAKE 'PLAY DATES.' BUT MOMS HAVE TO FOLLOW PROTOCOL -- OR FACE BEING 
STOOD UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOYCE SUNILA / SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marriage and motherhood used to signal the end of dating. Today, a woman has 
kids and embarks on the most intense dating of her life: "play dating." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a time painstakingly arranged by mothers days ahead for children to 
frolic together in the safety of one another's houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Our mothers didn't need to operate this way. They opened the front door and we 
shot out into the street to play with whoever was around. Hours later, around 
twilight, Mom opened the front door again and yelled at us to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim she could have played gin rummy with the neighbors and knocked 
back a couple of scotches. No one would have been the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 On the street we made friends, made enemies, ganged up on kids and were ganged 
up on. Called "the socialization process," this experience laid the groundwork 
for our futures as social animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's mom stands by while children rampage through her home, unraveling 
her attempts to keep order. She is charged with umpiring fights. All day she 
dispenses politically correct advice about fairness and sharing. This prevents 
children from discovering their roles in life's inevitable pecking order. 
</P>
<P>
 But that isn't the really horrendous part of the play date. 
</P>
<P>
 The really horrendous part is the politics that some mothers play. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins when a mother who lives in a child-impoverished neighborhood with a 
bored, lonely kid picks up the phone to solicit companionship for him or her. 
This is the signal for the solicitee mother -- whose child, of course, has no 
shortage of playmates and who loves power trips -- to play hard to get. So she 
gives the impression that her offspring has the cachet and social currency of 
Princess Di's children, if not Princess Di herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, uh, Patsy. Do you think Jack might want to come over and play with Stevie 
on Wednesday?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack's going on an audition for a commercial on Wednesday. So sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 A commercial? Next. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Bonnie. What if Kenny and Stevie get together on Wednesday?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Kenny's got Cub Scouts then." 
</P>
<P>
 Cub Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Lauren. Is Oliver doing anything on Wednesday . . ? " 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour in this boiler room and many mothers give up. Their kids watch a 
lot of television. But moms made of sterner stuff persist until they make a 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 On the much-anticipated play day, drop-off moms have been known to offer dire 
warnings -- "Now, remember, Floyd can't eat any sugar ," or "If Mikey's 
allergies act up be sure to call my beeper" -- just to keep the host mom from 
getting overconfident. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three hours later (during which the guest has asked for food 40 times, 
demanded better toys and insisted that he can't use a left-handed flusher), Mom 
arrives looking tanned and rested to pick up her kid. 
</P>
<P>
 Arranging play dates ranks about third on the list of stress-inducing life 
events, right after "death of spouse" and "oral surgery." It has proven so 
stressful that a panel of top psychologists has declared mothers whose children 
require frequent play dates an at-risk group. 
</P>
<P>
 Their symptoms cut across class lines. In therapy they turn up long-forgotten 
memories of being passed over for team sports; they change their mouthwash 
often; they harbor irrational fears of having attended the wrong college. 
</P>
<P>
 The syndrome is so widespread it has spawned a new book, "Mothers Who Try Too 
Hard to Get Play Dates and the Mothers Who Laugh Up Their Sleeves at Them." 
</P>
<P>
 The book argues that sufferers of play-date phobia must hit bottom before they 
are treatable. To achieve this, the authors suggest mothers subject themselves 
to the two most humiliating features of play dating: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Observing how many children leave school or another pick-up location in 
pairs, particularly those whose mothers never reciprocated one's own play 
dates. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The dreaded cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 If either of these result in an out-of-body experience, the condition has 
reached the critical stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors offer a play-date hot line. Operators are standing by.

ABSORBING THE SOARING COST OF RAW COTTON; RETAILERS PAD BLOW OF 38% PRICE JUMP 
-- AT LEAST FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumers who have watched cotton prices shoot up with each new report of a 
poor Asian harvest can breathe a sigh of relief that they won't be paying the 
price at cash registers -- at least not right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers and analysts say that by and large, prices of denim jeans, T-shirts, 
bath towels and other cotton goods will not rise anywhere close to the 38% jump 
in world prices of raw cotton since the first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cotton prices in the last six months have gone through the roof, but retail 
prices in this country have not been affected by that," said Haque, a 
wholesaler of cotton clothing in the California Mart who goes by one name. 
"Prices of turtlenecks and T-shirts have actually gone down." 
</P>
<P>
 During the crop year that ended July 31, a whopping 20.4 million tons of 
cotton were made into sweat shirts, bedspreads, wrinkle-free dress shirts and 
other products worldwide. Americans lead the world in per-capita cotton 
consumption, and U.S. demand for cotton has doubled in the last decade, 
according to Terry Townsend, a statistician for the International Cotton 
Advisory Committee in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The appetite for cotton has been a boon to cotton growers worldwide, including 
those in California, which is No. 2 behind Texas among cotton-producing states. 
The United States is second to China in world production, followed by India and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 But insects and poor weather have plagued cotton crops in those Asian nations. 
That is the main reason worldwide cotton production in the 1993-94 crop year 
was a measly 18.3 million tons, down almost 20% from two years ago, Townsend 
said. And the outlook for the coming crop year is at least as bad. On Monday, 
China reported that its 1994 cotton harvest will be 10% below its already 
somber projections. 
</P>
<P>
 This shortfall sent the price of cotton up 38%, from 60 cents a pound at the 
end of last year to 82.5 cents in June, before a seasonal decline to 75 cents 
in July, said Kevin Brinkley, an economist for the Memphis-based National 
Cotton Council. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, manufacturers of cotton products are feeling squeezed by higher 
costs and lower profit margins. Now that their inventories have been drawn 
down, they are looking to raise prices, said Jeff Beck, an analyst with 
Anderson & Strudwick in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that use lots of cotton -- such as Levi Strauss & Co., Russell Mills 
and Fieldcrest Cannon -- would not discuss changes in their costs or plans to 
raise prices. But analysts and industry experts agree that most companies will 
try to pass the higher raw cotton prices on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, there's going to be an aggressive attempt to pass those price 
increases along," said Nicholas Hahn, president and chief executive of New 
York-based Cotton Inc., an industry-funded research and marketing group. "Until 
now, many companies have been swallowing those higher costs, but I think we 
will see it this fall." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when that happens, prices won't rise dramatically, because "very 
little of the retail value of a shirt is tied up in the raw material," Brinkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there is enough cotton in one 500-pound bale to make 765 dress 
shirts. Assuming cotton is priced at 85 cents a bale -- a relatively high price 
-- one dress shirt will contain about 56 cents' worth of cotton. Even if the 
price of cotton were to double, that extra 56 cents is still small compared to 
the $30 to $40 price tag on a typical dress shirt, Brinkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some segments of the fabric and apparel industries -- especially in 
high-demand areas such as wrinkle-free fabrics -- are expected to raise prices 
as much as 7% or 8%, analysts said. Home furnishings companies, led by Springs 
Industries, has raised prices between 4% and 5% on its fall products, said 
analyst Kay Norwood of Interstate/Johnson Lane in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers in other sectors, such as cotton jersey, are less able to raise 
prices because inventories are still high, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But retailers in Southern California said the region's weak economy will keep 
the price of cotton products low, at least for now.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our suppliers say their costs have gone up, but we have tried to convince 
them that it's not in their best interests to raise prices," said Donald 
Abrams, president of Costa Mesa-based 3-D Bed & Bath, which sells sheets, 
towels and bedspreads. 
</P>
<P>
 At Strouds in Encino, towel prices recently climbed a dollar to $10.95, said 
Allison Mortimer, manager of the home furnishings store where towels account 
for roughly a third of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrinkle-free cotton products have gotten more expensive, said Bernadette 
Caprarella, owner of Cotton Corner, an Atwater Village store specializing in 
cotton clothing. But prices for the cotton tank tops, pants and sweat suits she 
also sells have held steady so far, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Lee, owner of Cotton Wear, a clothing manufacturing company in Los 
Angeles, said higher cotton prices have cut into his profit margin. "We absorb 
the cost. It hasn't been reflected in retail" prices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts say prices could begin to rise in the weeks before Christmas, 
when the more expensive cotton starts making its way into stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you walk into a store today and see a pair of blue jeans, they were 
probably made with cotton that was bought six or eight months ago," said Jarral 
Neeper, a spokesman for Calcot Limited of Bakersfield, California's biggest 
cotton marketing cooperative. ...And the Cotton Is High 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton prices have jumped more than 30% in the last year, but analysts don't 
expect retail prices of cotton products to rise nearly as much. Mill-delivered 
prices for cotton, in cents per pound: 
</P>
<P>
 June 1994: 82.48 
</P>
<P>
 HOW MUCH IT TAKES 
</P>
<P>
 Denim requires more cotton than any other fabric. For example, one bale of 
cotton (480-500 pounds) will make 215 pairs of jeans, but that same bale will 
produce 6,460 bras. Number of items that can be made from a bale: 
</P>
<P>
 Men's jeans: 215 
</P>
<P>
 Dresses: 274 
</P>
<P>
 Women's sweaters: 379 
</P>
<P>
 Terry bath towels: 690 
</P>
<P>
 Men's dress shirts: 765 
</P>
<P>
 Nightgowns: 780 
</P>
<P>
 Work gloves: 1,918 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer shorts: 2,104

 Diapers: 3,085

WHITTLE TO SELL CHANNEL ONE; MEDIA: K-III COMMUNICATIONS PLANS TO BUY FIRM'S 
EDUCATIONAL NETWORK FOR NEARLY $300 MILLION, EXECUTIVES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whittle Communications, in a move that all but ends entrepreneur Christopher 
Whittle's dream of building a new kind of media empire, is close to selling the 
Whittle Educational Network to publishing giant K-III Communications Corp. for 
nearly $300 million, executives close to the negotiations confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale is the latest and most dramatic downshift yet for Knoxville, 
Tenn.-based Whittle, which had embarked on an ambitious series of ventures in 
the 1980s aimed at pioneering new strategies for advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle Educational Network's principal asset is Channel One, a highly 
controversial 12-minute newscast that is delivered by satellite to 12,000 high 
schools around the country -- and that carries two minutes of commercials from 
fast-food companies and personal-hygiene marketers. 
</P>
<P>
 K-III, which is controlled by the leveraged-buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts & Co., hopes to use the electronic "pipeline" Whittle has built to 
deliver other programming it already owns or is in the process of developing. 
The impending sale was first reported Monday in the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel One, which has revenue of about $100 million and is believed to be 
profitable, is Whittle's biggest asset. Its sale represents a major setback for 
Whittle, who has seen his empire virtually disintegrate over the past year as 
advertisers rejected some of his grand visions. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the late 1980s and early '90s, Whittle tried to create a media 
empire by launching a series of so-called place-based advertising ventures 
targeted to consumers outside the home. The concept was promising enough -- and 
super-salesman Whittle persuasive enough -- that Time Warner Inc., Philips and 
Associated Newspapers took equity interests in his company. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Whittle is left with only a professional women's baseball team, a 
handful of professional publications and a company that distributes sample 
products to college students -- one of his original businesses. He also remains 
head of a separate venture, the Edison Project, which aims to build a chain of 
for-profit schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Whittle's famed Colonial-style headquarters in Knoxville, built at a 
reported cost of $50 million and featuring offices that boast of wood paneling 
and roll-top desks, may be sold to the federal government, which wants to 
convert it into a courthouse. About 250 of Whittle's 600 employees work there. 
Last year, the company had more than 1,100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the first and probably will be the last" to embark simultaneously 
on so many new advertising projects, said Erica Gruen, senior vice president at 
Saatchi & Saatchi in New York. "I doubt anybody will want to try all these new 
ventures again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The premise behind Whittle's projects was that traditional broadcast 
television was losing its grip on the mass audience and that new avenues had to 
be opened to reach the increasingly kinetic consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Whittle's first ventures was Special Reports, a series of videos and 
magazines delivered into physicians' waiting rooms, and a division that 
published advertiser-sponsored books. Both ventures were shut down earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Whittle last week announced that it was scrubbing Medical News 
Network, a costly news service that was tested in 5,000 doctors' offices and 
had been set for a national rollout this fall. Whittle had planned to spend as 
much as $200 million on MNN but was unable to attract long-term drug company 
sponsorship in the face of the uncertainty created by the health care debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although ventures such as Special Reports made a quick splash, the 
follow-through frequently hit snags. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Whittle's razzle-dazzle presentations were often made to the 
chief executives of prospective sponsors, bypassing the normal chain of command 
in the media-buying business. The result was that he frequently alienated 
junior executives assigned to the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, media buyers were frustrated by what they saw as a lack of 
independently verifiable information regarding the numbers of viewers and 
readers for Whittle's videos and publications. On top of that, although Whittle 
promised advertisers exclusive exposure, he ultimately could not guarantee that 
other magazines and publications were not making their way into doctors' 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of Whittle's projects did not pan out as envisioned, Channel One 
nonetheless has built a valuable satellite conduit into many of the nation's 
schools at a time when cable operators and local phone companies want to wire 
them for the so-called information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel One has been fiercely opposed by many educators, who despise the idea 
of advertising in the classroom and resent the requirement that all schools 
receiving the Channel One equipment force all students to watch the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But merging Whittle's technical infrastructure -- it installed 12,000 
satellite dishes at secondary schools and gave them 350,000 TV sets -- with 
K-III's role as "content supplier" appears to make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 K-III already publishes several magazines aimed at teen-agers, including 
Seventeen and Weekly Reader, as well as general-interest titles such as New 
York magazine and Premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 But the New York-based publisher is expanding into related businesses. K-III 
acquired the Katherine Gibbs Schools and also owns a company that distributes 
CD-ROMs to the educational market and publishes the Funk & Wagnalls 
encyclopedia. A source close to K-III says it could use Whittle's system to 
deliver this and other content to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittle had been negotiating to sell a stake in Channel One to the merchant 
banking arm of Goldman, Sachs & Co. when it received a substantially better 
offer for the entire business from K-III. Whittle is expected to use the 
proceeds from the sale to pay back investors and costs incurred in the failed 
start-up of MNN. 
</P>
<P>
 The push to sell Channel One, however, was said to come from Whittle Chief 
Executive Donald Johnstone, a former Philips executive who joined Whittle after 
Philips increased its stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Whittle would continue to run Channel One for K-III, several experts 
who follow his activities expect that he will devote more time to the Edison 
Project. Whittle Communications 
</P>
<P>
 The privately held company, which was established in 1986, was once a phenom 
of the media world, but it has now been virtually liquidated. Here's what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 * Special Report Network: The network, launched in 1988, consisted of glossy 
magazines -- and later videodiscs -- for display in doctors' offices. Though it 
grew to include more than 32,000 waiting rooms, high costs forced its shutdown 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 * Medical News Network: An interactive TV service for doctors that was 
launched on a test basis 18 months ago. The project was canceled last week 
after major advertisers -- mostly drug companies -- refused to make long-term 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Channel One: Controversial service offers advertiser-supported newscasts to 
about 12,000 schools. Sold to K-III Communications Corp. on Tuesday for a 
reported $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Edison Project: Ambitious plan to create a for-profit private-school network 
has floundered for lack of funds. Christopher Whittle remains chairman of the 
project, which is not part of Whittle Communications.

TOM SNYDER GETS HIS OLD TIME SLOT BACK -- BUT ON CBS; TELEVISION: HE ONCE 
FOLLOWED CARSON'S SHOW ON NBC; NOW HE'LL FOLLOW THE NEW KING OF LATE NIGHT, 
DAVID LETTERMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Snyder, whose talk show followed Johnny Carson's on NBC for nine years, 
was tapped Tuesday to play the same role for the new king of late-night 
television, CBS' David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is truly incredible," Snyder told a news conference here with Letterman 
by his side. "A year ago, this was no more in my mind than to jump off the 
Empire State Building." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, 58, who currently hosts a talk show on the CNBC cable channel, will 
begin hosting "The Late Late Show With Tom Snyder" for CBS on weeknights at 
12:35 a.m. in mid-December. The hourlong show will originate in Los Angeles and 
will be simulcast on the CBS radio network. 
</P>
<P>
 The time slot will be very familiar to Snyder. He hosted the "Tomorrow" series 
there on NBC from 1973 until 1982, when he was replaced by a young comedian by 
the name of David Letterman. Letterman remained in that slot until last year, 
when, miffed at losing out to Jay Leno in the competition to replace Carson as 
host of "The Tonight Show," he departed for CBS and launched what is now the 
top-rated show in the late-night market. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the deal that brought Letterman to CBS, his company will 
produce the new show, and he was instrumental in the selection of Snyder, who 
signed a four-year contract for undisclosed terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Letterman said Tuesday that he used to watch the "Tomorrow" show regularly 
while working in Indianapolis and has been a fan of Snyder's ever since. "I've 
always found the man, first and foremost, to be entertaining," Letterman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Snyder's age made him the right candidate to hold on to the 
young Letterman viewers who are prized by advertisers, Letterman said: "He's 
just a guy who's smart and very good at what he does. To me, I don't care if 
he's 100 -- and believe me, he's close." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder, however, was not the first choice: The post-Letterman spot was turned 
down by Garry Shandling and Bob Costas. 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder's primary competition will be Letterman's replacement at NBC, Conan 
O'Brien -- although the number of cities in which they go head-to-head at 12:35 
will depend on how successful CBS is at persuading its affiliated stations to 
clear the Snyder show at that hour. Many stations balked at pushing back 
lucrative syndicated programming to accommodate the Letterman show last year 
and may be unwilling to do it again for Snyder -- in which case his show would 
be scheduled in the wee hours of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS officials said they expected 70% of their affiliates to carry "The Late 
Late Show" initially, but they declined to specify how many plan to schedule it 
at 12:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise premiere date has not yet been set, but Snyder said CNBC has 
agreed to let him out of his contract early. He said the format will closely 
resemble what he has always done -- one-on-one interviews -- with an 800 phone 
line on which viewers can call in with questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brash and breezy, with a distinctive laugh that has often been parodied, 
Snyder has had a relatively low profile in recent years. But he was once a 
major figure in U.S. broadcasting. He began his career in 1955 at a radio 
station in his hometown of Milwaukee and worked in local news for 18 years, 
including a stint as an anchor for the top-rated news department at KNBC-TV 
Channel 4 in Los Angeles from 1970 to 1973. He then took over "Tomorrow," 
doubled for a time as an anchor at WNBC in New York and also hosted a 
prime-time newsmagazine for NBC in 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Tomorrow," Snyder returned to Los Angeles, working for a time at 
KABC-TV Channel 7 in 1986, then hosting a call-in radio show on ABC for five 
years and finally landing the CNBC job in early 1993.

U.S. PRODUCTIVITY DIPS; EXPERTS SAY FIGURE IS VOLATILE; ECONOMY: ECONOMISTS 
ATTRIBUTE DROP MAINLY TO RECENT SURGE IN HIRING. DECLINE ALSO RAISES SPECTER OF 
INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The productivity of American workers fell for the first time in more than a 
year during the spring, the federal government reported Tuesday, and economists 
attributed the decline mainly to a recent surge in hiring by U.S. employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary figures showed that productivity dropped at an annual rate of 1.2% 
from April through June. At the same time, a measure of employment -- hours 
worked by everyone in the labor force -- climbed 5.4% during the second 
quarter, the biggest gain since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Productivity is a measure of business efficiency, reflecting the output per 
hour of work of all employees. It is an important economic gauge over the long 
term because, among other things, it helps determine a nation's standard of 
living and the competitiveness of its products in foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining productivity also raises the specter of renewed inflation. But those 
concerns were largely offset by additional second-quarter figures showing a 
skimpy 0.8% rise in hourly compensation, the smallest advance in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking all of the figures into account, many analysts said the decline in 
productivity was not alarming and that it was characteristic of an economy 
moving into a later phase of recovery. Earlier in the recovery, these analysts 
explained, companies found ways to boost productivity by squeezing more out of 
their existing staff and equipment while waiting to see if the recovery would 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in many cases, employers "have pushed their resources to the limit, so 
they have to hire more," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist with First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the productivity per worker at these firms is likely to slump at 
least until the recent hires are fully trained and their performance is brought 
up to par with veteran employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible explanation for lower productivity is that workers at "lean 
and mean" companies who for months or even years have put in long hours may be 
starting to burn out. Likewise, employers that have delayed investing in new 
equipment are now suffering some of the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts cautioned that the productivity figures are volatile and are likely 
to be revised when updated statistics are released next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, economist Robert A. Brusca of Nikko Securities in New York speculated 
that productivity is actually much better than Tuesday's numbers suggest. He 
pointed to the heavy capital investments and continued staff cutbacks by major 
companies, actions believed by many executives to be boosting their firms' 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to ask yourself whether all these people are wrong," Brusca said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, productivity is still up 2.6% over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brusca warned that if productivity goes into a genuine slump, it is likely 
to fuel inflation. Rising productivity ordinarily keeps inflation in check by 
providing savings to offset the higher wages that typically come during an 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's last previous decline in productivity was a 1.8% drop in the 
first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate economic report, the government reported that wholesale sales 
rose in June for a second straight month and inventories of unsold goods fell. 
Sales by wholesalers were up 0.5% to a seasonally adjusted $168.7 billion, 
following a 0.3% increase in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Inventories dropped in June by 0.4% to a seasonally adjusted $222.3 billion 
after rising 1.6% in May and 1% in April. That decline, Reaser said, eases 
concerns of a possible inventory surplus that could lead to sales and 
production cutbacks.

ACCOUNTING FIRM TO PAY $186.5 MILLION TO SETTLE CLAIMS; BANKING: AGREEMENT BY 
KPMG PEAT MARWICK IS LATEST IN GOVERNMENT'S EFFORT TO RECOUP LOSSES FROM THE 
S&L DEBACLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 KPMG Peat Marwick, which once audited the books of nearly half the nation's 
banks and thrifts, said Tuesday that it will pay the federal government $186.5 
million to settle allegations that its work played a role in the failure of 
several savings institutions dating back to the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement is the latest in a series of deals the government has reached 
with America's biggest accounting firms for their part in the savings and loan 
debacle and the failure of dozens of banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord covers 22 financial institutions that KPMG or its predecessor, Main 
Hurdman, audited since the mid-1980s. Two of those institutions were in 
California: Costa Mesa-based Pacific Savings Bank, seized by regulators in 
1989, and Orange-based Ramona Savings & Loan, taken over in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges against KPMG included improper accounting for profits on sales of real 
estate and exchanges of assets, which made some institutions look stronger than 
they really were. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact raises the amount that regulators have recovered from major 
accounting firms to $1.4 billion, according to a report by the National Assn. 
of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys. Deloitte & Touche paid $312 million 
to settle similar charges in March, Arthur Andersen paid $79 million last year 
and Ernst & Young paid $400 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 New York-based KPMG, however, was the country's biggest auditor of thrifts 
when the S&L crisis first surfaced in the 1980s. At its peak, the accounting 
firm said it worked for about 45% of all U.S. banks and thrifts. It still calls 
itself the market leader, but it does not disclose its current share. 
</P>
<P>
 KPMG spokeswoman Gina Greer said the number of claims the government had filed 
against the firm and the amount it will pay were "relatively small," 
considering its once-dominant market share and potential financial exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "By comparison to those other firms, we're happy with the way things have 
worked out," Greer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blanket agreement settles all of the claims and charges made against KPMG 
by the Resolution Trust Corp., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the 
Office of Thrift Supervision, OTS spokeswoman Laurie Lavaroni said. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC, which is in charge of cleaning up the S&L debacle, and the FDIC had 
charged KPMG with accounting malpractice. The OTS had filed a variety of 
charges, most of which concerned the firm's alleged failure to use generally 
accepted accounting practices when auditing the various institutions' books.  
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, KPMG neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing but agreed to 
change its accounting policies when auditing federally insured institutions in 
the future, the OTS said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Settlement at this time represents, overall, an intelligent business 
decision," KPMG Chief Executive Jon C. Madonna said.

 K&B Employee Settled on Kickback Charges: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission charged that Thomas Piteo, a senior vice president at home builder 
Kaufman & Broad in the 1980s, took nearly $435,000 in kickbacks from a 
stockbroker to whom he steered corporate securities trades from 1986 to 1989. 
Piteo settled the charges without admitting or denying guilt, but he agreed to 
repay $159,155 -- the most he could afford, the SEC said -- to K&B's corporate 
successor, SunAmerica.The SEC said Piteo got the payoffs from Aurelio Martinez, 
a broker at Prudential Securities and PaineWebber Inc., who received more than 
$1 million in commissions on transactions valued at $714 million. Martinez also 
settled the civil charges and pleaded guilty to a felony count of filing a 
false statement with the IRS.

 Accounting Firm Loses Bid to Overturn Award: Motions brought by lawyers for 
Arthur Andersen & Co.-- for a new trial and to vacate a $1.9-million judgment 
against it -- were denied by a Los Angeles County Superior Court. The firm was 
also ordered to pay nearly $670,000 in interest on the award, which a jury 
granted last month to Pacific Coast Packaging of Montebello. Pacific Packaging 
sued Andersen for negligence during a four-year period when the company's 
controller embezzled nearly $2.5 million.

 Baby Bells Hesitant on Legislative Compromise: The regional telephone 
companies, noting that 80 pages of last-minute changes have been added to a 
telecommunications reform bill since they shook hands on a compromise Monday, 
said they will try to amend the proposal now making its way through the Senate. 
"We have agreed to support the process to move forward to mark-up on this bill 
. . . but we are going to press for an amendment on Thursday," said Bill 
McCloskey, spokesman for the Bells Task Force lobby.The Bells said they are 
concerned about added regulatory burdens and what they called new provisions 
that would delay their entering the cable business. The Senate Commerce 
Committee is expected to approve the bill Thursday, but the stage is set for a 
fierce floor battle over amendments.

AIRBUS ACCUSES MARTIN MARIETTA OF FAULTY WORK; AEROSPACE: SETBACK IS LATEST TO 
HIT THE A-330 JET, WHICH THE CONSORTIUM IS PINNING ITS SALES HOPES ON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Airbus Industrie accused Martin Marietta Corp. of performing "incredibly 
shoddy" work on the construction of its A-330 passenger jets, causing delays in 
the delivery of planes to two big Asian airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback is the latest in a series of problems besetting the brand-new 
twin-engine A-330, which together with the four-engine A-340 is expected to 
drive the European consortium's jetliner sales well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Airbus said the Martin Marietta problem had nothing to do with the June 30 
crash of an A-330 on a test flight near Toulouse, France, and involves a 
non-mechanical part. 
</P>
<P>
 The work centers on a piece of a thrust reverser that Martin Marietta was 
subcontracted to make for Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. 
Pratt is providing the engines on the planes scheduled to go to Thai Airways 
and Malaysia Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quality was incredibly shoddy -- and you can quote me on that," Bob 
Alizart, vice president of communications at Airbus, said of the work by Martin 
Marietta, an aerospace and defense contractor based in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The A-330's short history has been checkered. In January, an Air Inter A-330 
had to be returned to Toulouse for several weeks after problems with the 
landing gear were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The European plane maker had been scheduled to begin deliveries to Malaysia 
Airlines in August and to Thai Airways in September. 
</P>
<P>
 However, problems with work performed by Martin Marietta as a subcontractor to 
Pratt & Whitney are expected to cause delays of about a month on several planes 
scheduled for delivery, Airbus said. This is the first time Martin Marietta has 
subcontracted for Pratt & Whitney on its engines. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is an engine core cowl covering the Martin Marietta-made thrust 
reversers, Pratt & Whitney said. The bonding between several layers on the 
cowl, a tripartite covering of composite materials that protects the engine, 
was faulty and needed to be redone. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the company stressed that the cowl is not a mechanical part and its 
faulty manufacture was never judged to be a safety problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the simplest terms, we are working with Martin Marietta right now to try 
and recover delivery schedules," said Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for Pratt. "It 
seems we are getting the process under control, but there may be a delay in 
delivering the first few planes." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Martin Marietta said the company had no immediate comment and 
expects to issue a response to Airbus' charges later. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's Sullivan said the companies had not yet decided what sort of penalties 
Martin Marietta may face, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concentrating now on getting the problem solved," he said. "Afterward 
we'll talk about financial considerations." 
</P>
<P>
 The wide-body A-330 is Airbus' newest plane in service. The company has 
delivered five A-330s since January, but all five of those planes use a 
Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine.

INVEST IN S. AFRICA, OFFICIAL URGES; DIPLOMACY: U.S. FIRMS COULD LOSE OUT TO 
EUROPEAN, JAPANESE FIRMS, AMBASSADOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 U.S. companies will lose out on investment opportunities in the new South 
Africa -- deals that their Japanese and European counterparts will seize -- 
unless American business becomes more aggressive, South Africa's U.S. 
ambassador said Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. consumer products firms have recently increased their presence 
in South Africa, those in aerospace, engineering and telecommunications need to 
make greater financial commitments, said Harry Schwarz, who spoke at a forum 
arranged by a Long Beach-based investment partnership. Schwarz said European 
and particularly Japanese companies are beginning to show a willingness to bet 
on South Africa's economy. He said Japan is providing more foreign aid than the 
United States and that Japanese firms are investing faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to wait and go in at the top of an investment market," Schwarz 
said in an interview. "There is growing (American) interest, but we need more 
of a commitment at this time -- particularly from small and medium-sized 
businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarz said profit opportunities have been enhanced by the elimination of 
apartheid -- South Africa's system of racial discrimination -- and by a mandate 
on the part of the new government headed by Nelson Mandela to create an 
economic climate that will lead to higher wages for the country's black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result, there will be an increase in the demand for products (such as) 
prepared foods, clothing, household items and computers," Schwarz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major U.S. firms -- PepsiCo, Honeywell, IBM, Sara Lee and Procter & 
Gamble among them -- returned to South Africa this year after having pulled out 
in the 1980s. The American corporate exodus was prompted by protests, U.S. 
economic sanctions and other forms of pressure to abandon the apartheid system. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, more than 300 U.S. firms were maintaining South African assets of 
about $2.6 billion. In 1989, they reached a low of about $714 million. But five 
years later -- and three years after the U.S. sanctions had been lifted -- just 
164 U.S. firms with assets of $1 billion have operations there. Twenty-nine of 
those companies have gone in since Mandela called for an end to all economic 
sanctions against the country last September. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. investors have not taken adequate advantage of the opportunities for 
direct investment, said Regional Cook, sponsor of the Schwarz visit and 
managing director of South African Partners, a Long Beach group that is raising 
money to create and acquire companies in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors who hesitate in the face of this opportunity will be crying in 
their soup 10 years from now," said Cook, whose partner is former Coca-Cola 
executive Ian Wilson. Wilson separately leads a venture to return Pepsi to 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan O'Flaherty, executive director of the U.S.-South Africa Business 
Council in Washington, says it is not surprising that U.S. firms are moving 
cautiously.

 The new South African government "has operated for just more than 2 1/2 
months, and its policy directions have only been sketched," said O'Flaherty, 
whose organization provides economic data to companies in the two countries. 
"New rules governing investment, labor and taxes are being developed, and 
investors are waiting to see the fine print." 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa is also competing with fast-growing markets in countries such as 
China, Argentina and Mexico, noted Bill Moses, a senior analyst at the Investor 
Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based organization that conducts 
research for pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic "world that South Africa is re-entering is very different," Moses 
said. "Communism has collapsed, and there is an economic revival in much of 
Asia and Latin America."

AMERICAN HOME MAKES TENDER OFFER FOR FIRM 
</P>

 American Home Products Corp. is bypassing the management of American Cyanamid 
Corp. and taking its buyout offer for the chemical and drug company directly to 
Cyanamid's shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 American Home Products, purveyor of such familiar names as Advil, Gulden's 
mustard and Chef Boyardee foods, said Tuesday that its board had authorized a 
tender offer of $95 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyanamid shareholders will decide on their own whether to accept the 
$8.5-billion buyout, no matter the position of Cyanamid's managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came one week after American Home Products Chairman John 
Stafford made the same $95 offer in a letter to Cyanamid. The Cyanamid board 
acknowledged having received the offer but would not comment further. It 
remained silent Tuesday on the news of the tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of the two New Jersey-based companies -- American Home Products is in 
Madison and American Cyanamid is in Wayne -- would follow several recent 
multibillion-dollar mergers in the drug-manufacturing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford said in a written statement Tuesday that despite the tender offer, 
the company remains confident that the American Cyanamid board will agree to 
merge. The offer is about 50% higher than Cyanamid's stock price was before the 
release of Stafford's letter last week. The stock jumped $30 to $93 on Aug. 2, 
the day of the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford said he is hopeful that Cyanamid board members "will recognize the 
inherent value of our offer to their stockholders, and we hope they will 
quickly accept our invitation to begin meaningful discussions for a negotiated 
transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case they don't, American Home Products also filed a lawsuit Tuesday 
in U.S. District Court in Maine challenging whether certain American Cyanamid 
anti-takeover and other defensive provisions ought to apply in this tender 
offer. Such defenses could make a hostile bid for Cyanamid excessively 
expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyanamid shares climbed $2.625 to $93.625 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Tuesday. American Home Products gained 25 cents to $56.25.

latest attempt to contain the damage from its $268-million bailout of the 
short-term government bond fund, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. 
Fensterstock was the latest casualty from the costly and embarrassing rescue of 
the fund, which dabbled in risky securities.

 Nordstrom Earnings Up Sharply: The apparel retailer said its earnings soared 
48% in the second quarter, though sales rose only 6%. Analysts say Nordstrom 
Inc. has been able to boost earnings largely by improving its inventory 
control, which had limited the volume of merchandise the stores could sell at 
discount prices.The Seattle-based chain posted earnings of $62 million, or 77 
cents a share, for the quarter, up from $42.7 million, or 52 cents a share, a 
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.08 billion from $1.02 billion. A spokeswoman 
for Nordstrom said the retailer has seen improvement in every area, including 
the crucial California market. Nordstrom's stock closed 31 cents higher at 
$43.875 a share on Nasdaq before the earnings report was released.

 Book-to-Bill Ratio Drops: For the tenth time in the last 11 years, the July 
book-to-bill ratio declined, according to World Semiconductor Trade Statistics 
data released by the Semiconductor Industry Assn.The preliminary figure for 
companies competing in the North American market is 1.04. June's revised ratio 
is 1.07. A book-to-bill ratio of 1.04 means that for every $100 worth of 
products shipped (billed), manufacturers received $104 worth of new orders 
(bookings).

 U.S. Bank Failures at 13-Year Low, Regulators Say: The Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. said five banks failed in the first half of this year, the 
lowest midyear figure since 1981.During the first six months of 1993, 23 banks 
were closed. The FDIC said the low failure rate has boosted the reserves of its 
bank insurance fund, which at the end of June had $17.5 billion to protect 
commercial bank deposits. The all-time high mark for the insurance fund was 
$18.3 billion, set at the end of 1987.

 Chrysler May Abandon Sport Utility Vehicle: The auto maker said concern about 
future fuel-economy laws covering light-duty trucks has prompted it to 
reconsider the $100-million project. The vehicle, tentatively named the Dodge 
Adventurer, was intended to compete with Toyota Motor Corp.'s Land Cruiser and 
Land Rover's Range Rover in the fast-growing luxury sport utility market.Rules 
now call for each manufacturer's truck line to achieve an average of 20.5 miles 
per gallon. The government is considering raising that by as much as 25% over 
the next 10 years, a standard that auto makers would find harder to meet. The 
Adventurer, based on Chrysler Corp.'s Dodge Ram pickup, had been expected to 
make its debut in the 1997 model year.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: 'TAX-FREE' MUNI NOTES MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California municipal money market funds and other investors have a potential 
multibillion-dollar problem on their hands, and the only thing most of the 
parties involved can do is point fingers at one another. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extraordinarily embarrassing episode for everyone concerned, an 
as-yet-unknown number of California tax-free money funds since spring have 
invested in short-term notes that may not be entirely tax-free. Individual 
investors who bought the notes may be in the same predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 The securities -- typically known as tax and revenue anticipation notes, or 
TRANs -- are issued each year by counties, school districts and other 
municipalities as a way to borrow in advance on revenue that will accrue during 
the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest paid on these notes, as on almost all municipal securities, is 
free of federal income tax. But the Internal Revenue Service has in recent 
years changed the rules regarding the issuance of these securities, to make 
sure that the issuers and investors don't derive more tax-free benefit than a 
"fair" muni yield should offer. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the big IRS-ordered changes took effect last year, aiming at a favorite 
practice of California municipalities: issuing $1,000 notes for, say, $1,020, 
with relatively high coupons and 13-month terms. Such deals gave the issuers 
more money up front and provided lucrative returns for the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A full explanation of the IRS rule change would bore most people to tears, but 
in a nutshell the feds said that depending on the type of muni note you buy, 
and the price you pay relative to its original issue price, you may owe 
ordinary income tax on the difference. In bond market shorthand, if you pay 
$101 for a note issued at $102 and worth $100 at maturity, you could owe tax on 
the $1 difference between $101 and $102 -- however unfair that might seem. 
</P>
<P>
 For a tax-free money market fund, the thought of owing any taxes is naturally 
abhorrent. Which means the funds should have been very careful in buying TRANs 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But they weren't, and apparently neither were a lot of other buyers of these 
securities. Why not? Astonishing as this sounds, no one among the highly paid 
crowd of investment bankers, lawyers, mutual fund managers and others involved 
was aware of the IRS rules until late July. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was asleep," says one California state finance official. "Everyone 
assumed someone else was doing 'due diligence' on these deals." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems affect TRAN investors nationwide, but California localities in 
particular have been fond of this type of financing vehicle. And we aren't 
talking about a few dollars: More than $3.4 billion in California TRANs was 
issued through June this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not all of them are subject to the tax rules (notes issued for one year 
or less aren't affected), the issuers whose 1994 notes are potentially 
"tax-disadvantaged" include Contra Costa County, Ventura County, San Francisco 
County and the L.A. Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California tax-free money funds, whose assets now total about $14.5 billion, 
hold much but certainly not all of this paper. The fund managers, 
understandably, are livid because they say nobody told them about the tax 
issue. They blame the underwriters of the notes (major brokerages) and the 
underwriters' lawyers, who are paid to issue legal opinions on the securities' 
tax ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would guess there's some negligence there," says Pam Wisehaupt, whose 
Vanguard California Tax Free fund has 2.5% of its assets in TRANs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lawyers note that the IRS rules apply only to investors who purchase 
TRANs after they begin trading. In other words, investors who bought directly 
from the issuers at the initial sale don't have a tax liability -- only 
"secondary" buyers do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our response is that disclosure (required) with regard to tax issues is for 
the original investors," says Jan Brockman, partner at the bond counsel law 
firm of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San Francisco. Counsel, she says, has 
no legal requirement to advise secondary buyers on taxes, at least not in the 
offering documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the IRS rules do affect original buyers, because the notes in 
question have dropped sharply in value precisely because of the tax threat. 
Many TRANs were issued at annualized yields of about 3.6% in spring; today the 
market is demanding 4.5% to 4.6%, so the principal value of the TRANs has 
fallen accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 For muni money funds that own TRANs, the decline in the notes' prices has 
raised the question of whether principal losses must be reflected in the 
portfolios -- and whether those losses could be large enough to then require a 
reduction in any fund's normally stable share price of $1. Obviously, any money 
fund that "breaks" the $1 share price would see shareholders stampede out. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: For most funds it appears that the notes don't make up enough 
of their assets to threaten the share price. Wisehaupt says her 2.5% stake is 
"nothing we're concerned about." At Wells Fargo, which runs the Stagecoach and 
Overland muni money funds, TRANs are "significantly under 5%" of assets and 
aren't a problem, says manager David Wines in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But whether the entire California money fund universe will escape share price 
turmoil remains to be seen. Federal regulators say privately that they don't 
know of any funds whose $1 price is in jeopardy from TRAN losses, but they 
concede it may be too early to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The chart below lists the biggest California muni money funds. The only clue 
for shareholders that a fund may have a large stake in TRANs is the "average 
maturity": The longer that maturity, the greater the chance that 13-month TRAN 
paper is in the portfolio, because TRANs of that term would tend to skew the 
maturity to the long end. 
</P>
<P>
 But note: A long average maturity isn't a sure sign of TRAN investments. 
What's more, it's a good bet that any of the major mutual fund companies or 
brokerages wouldn't permit their money funds to break $1 anyway. As with some 
well-publicized bond fund debacles last spring, big fund sponsors would most 
likely inject capital into their money funds to protect the $1 share price and 
avoid a public relations nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 However this sad episode plays out, at the very least it is another reminder 
to investors that "risk" can exist even where you least expect it. And it's 
also another wake-up call for the fund industry, which seems to be forgetting 
what "due diligence" in investing is all about. California Tax-Free Money Funds

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES; 
APPEALS COURT RULING OPENS DOOR TO FURTHER SOFTWARE PATENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that patent applications for 
software should be given the same treatment as other inventions, rekindling a 
longstanding debate over whether patents will encourage or hinder innovation in 
the rapidly growing industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 29 decision in Washington overturned the Office of Patent and 
Trademark's rejection of a 1989 patent application for scanning software by 
developer Kuriappan Alappat. The patent office had ruled that as software, it 
represented an abstract idea that was not patentable under the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Court of Appeals decision "will make it easier to make computer programs 
patentable," said Carl Moy, professor at William Mitchell College of Law in St. 
Paul, Minn., and a former patent examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will force the patent office to have a more upfront discussion about why 
it is or isn't willing to grant patents for software." 
</P>
<P>
 Larger, established software companies such as Microsoft and Sun Microsystems 
have been strong backers of the use of patents to protect software ideas, but 
many smaller firms worry that the granting of further patents will amount to a 
tax on the industry in the form of litigation expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The July 29 ruling helped clarify patent policy muddled by previous court 
decisions and Patent and Trademark Office policies that tended to discriminate 
against software products. The opinion holds particular force because it was 
made en banc , by all 11 judges rather than the usual panel of three. 
</P>
<P>
 Software companies have used copyright laws to protect intellectual property. 
Although software has been patentable since a 1980 Supreme Court ruling, patent 
office policy in effect has excluded many software applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say patent examiners seeking easy ways to reject patents have tended 
to conclude that a particular piece of software does not fit statutory 
requirements of being a process, manufacture, machine or composition of matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The court decided that software becomes a manufactured product when it is used 
in a computer because "a general-purpose computer in effect becomes a 
special-purpose computer once it is programmed to perform particular functions 
pursuant to instructions from program software." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts say the clarified policy will help reward innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Hollaar, a computer sciences professor at the University of Utah and a 
patent agent, said the decision will make it more difficult for patent 
examiners to dismiss whole classes of applications and force them to examine 
each particular innovation offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision helps people who are doing truly innovative things," Hollaar 
said. Since the patent office has been ordered to examine the structure of the 
innovation being offered rather than simply the new function offered, Hollaar 
said, examiners would also be less likely to award overly broad patents. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent office set off a firestorm earlier this year when it granted 
Compton's New Media of Carlsbad, Calif., a broad-based patent that seemed to 
cover virtually every product offered in the booming multimedia business. 
</P>
<P>
 Others worry that software companies will have to spend more money and time on 
legal battles at the expense of innovative projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The software industry progressed more rapidly than other industries in an era 
when software wasn't patentable," said Douglas Brotz, principal scientist at 
Adobe Systems Inc., a Silicon Valley software company. "I think increased use 
of patents will be a drag, not a spur. Patents are a tremendous burden on 
software companies." 
</P>
<P>
 Many lawyers share Brotz's concerns. William Rooklidge, a Newport Beach 
attorney, said he expects to have plenty of work litigating on both sides of 
the issue as a result of the new ruling. "You are going to have more 
software-related patents, more challenges to those patents and more people 
defending themselves from others' patents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent office said after the ruling that it was studying the decision and 
was not yet in a position to comment on it. Under new Commissioner Bruce 
Lehman, it has already begun to respond to past criticisms of its treatment of 
software patent applications. 
</P>
<P>
 The office held hearings earlier this year to collect views on the application 
of patents in the software industry. Lehman also recently hired nine computer 
scientists to help examiners make decisions with respect to software patents.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; SOFTWARE SALES LEAP 67% 
ON RISING HOME USE

<P>
 Surging demand for entertainment and educational computer software for the 
home contributed to a 67% growth in unit sales of software in North America 
during the first quarter, a trade group reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, data collected by the Washington-based Software Publishers Assn. 
shows that dollar sales of software at the retail level rose by only 11.1% to 
$1.48 billion, as merchants cut their markups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a new gold rush in the consumer software industry," said David 
Tremblay, research director for the trade group, referring to software used in 
the home. "The rapid growth in the use of personal computers in American homes 
is creating millions of new customers for software." 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly survey of sales performance reflects several key trends among 
software buyers. Software sales for Macintosh computers made by Apple Computer 
Inc. rose 18.9% to $259 million, the biggest jump since the third quarter of 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Software for the dominant Windows operating system from Microsoft Corp. 
increased 43.4% to $899 million. Sales of software for the older DOS operating 
system slid 36.4% to $303 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of products for Windows-based computers was visible in all of 
the consumer software categories.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; LIBRARIES CAUGHT IN 
TRANSITION OF COMPUTER AGE; TECHNOLOGY: PATRONS INTIMIDATED BY ON-LINE 
DATABASES GIVE UP ACCESS TO A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 40 years, Vincent Ronco was an avid patron of the San Francisco Public 
Library, checking out one or two books every week. But now he has turned away 
from the library in frustration, victim of a routine technological advance that 
would appear to be both inevitable and wholly rational: the replacement of the 
ancient card catalogue indexing system with a modern computer database. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since they got rid of the card catalogue, I don't check out books anymore," 
says the 65-year-old retiree. "I just turned in my library card. I don't know 
how to use a computer, and I don't want to be forced to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The computerization of libraries, in fact, has turned out to be something of a 
case study of how technological advances can bring about unforeseen -- and 
often negative -- consequences. While on-line library indexes have many 
advantages, they also create many new problems -- not the least of which is 
cutting off access to those who remain intimidated by computers. 
</P>
<P>
 These difficulties pose a challenge not only for libraries, but for all public 
institutions that serve a diverse population. And they also provide a 
cautionary lesson for many corporations that are engaged in a headlong drive to 
automate their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Electronic access is, and always will be, limited to the technologically 
adept," warns Steven Black, head of acquisitions at the Bancroft Library of UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Access is far from the only problem with on-line library catalogues. Software 
bugs and data entry errors have caused some books to virtually disappear, even 
as they remain somewhere on the shelves. And on-line systems have in some cases 
made it more difficult and less enjoyable to do research: They sometimes 
provide an unwanted avalanche of information, eliminate the handwritten 
notations of generations of librarians and render impossible the simple 
pleasure of browsing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to have all those cards right under my chin. It feels so good to pull 
out the wooden drawer and feel the papers between my fingers, to smell the 
scent of the cards and be reminded of how old books are," says Eddie Oliva, a 
computer instructor at Ulster Community College in Upstate New York. He uses 
the on-line catalogue for professional purposes. "But when it comes to personal 
research, I always choose the traditional card catalogue." 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't how it was supposed to turn out when the nation's libraries began 
computerizing about a decade ago. Computers and libraries seemed an obvious 
match: A card catalogue, after all, is nothing more than a simple database, the 
kind computers handle best. Today, an estimated 55% of American public 
libraries have switched to on-line catalogues, with more converting every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, on-line cataloguing systems offer many advantages. They allow a 
library patron at one terminal to access collections all over the city -- or in 
some cases, all over the world. They offer information on the book's status -- 
whether it has been checked out, when it is due back. And they have relieved 
librarians of the overwhelming task of keeping the card catalogue up to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Advanced "multimedia" computers, such as the $4-million on-line system that 
the San Francisco Public Library finished installing last year, can offer much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "For quick and cheap retrieval of multimedia services -- both still and moving 
video images, audio services, magazines, newspapers and books -- ours is the 
system of tomorrow," says George McBride, coordinator of the automation 
services of the San Francisco library. 
</P>
<P>
 Most librarians, while acknowledging some of the problems that go along with 
computerized catalogues, praise the on-line systems as essential to helping 
libraries maintain their place as centers of learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the proponents of computerized catalogues, however, say the technology 
has a long way to go. R. Bruce Miller, president-elect of the Library and 
Information Technology Assn. of the American Library Assn. and assistant 
university librarian at UC San Diego, points to some key limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not where we should be," he says. The UCSD system "requires too much 
of the user. You can't ask a general question and be guided to an answer. You 
need to know which database you should be looking in. That demands an expertise 
of the typical library user that's just not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a big complaint of on-line catalogue users is that a simple query such 
as a subject search yields an unmanageably large amount of data. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm in a library with both a card catalogue and the on-line system, I 
always use the card catalogue," says San Francisco library patron Robbin Frey, 
40, who is the director of a local dance company. "That way, I don't have to 
deal with all the garbage that comes on-screen that has nothing to do with what 
I'm looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speed is also a problem: On many systems, response time is very poor. And 
that, of course, undermines one of the original reasons for having an on-line 
catalogue in the first place. So do system crashes, which can bring an entire 
library to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious answer to many of these problems, of course, would be to keep the 
old card catalogue alongside the computerized system. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say many types of organizations could benefit from an approach in 
which computerized systems were viewed as an enhancement to the old way of 
doing things, rather than a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Things rarely work that way in the Information Age. But in a gesture to the 
affection many feel for the old card catalogue, the San Francisco Arts 
Commission, in collaboration with the library, has commissioned two artists to 
design a plaster wall for the main library branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastered into the wall will be old cards from the card catalogue that 
librarians have been invited to notate in the way librarians have done for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people, and I'm among them, had an emotional attachment to the card 
catalogue," says Laura Lent, a reference librarian at San Francisco Public 
Library's Excelsior branch. "It represented history."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; NUCLEAR LAB 
TECHNOLOGY IS IN THE AIR AT DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. is hoping to use a little nuclear-weapons magic to keep its 
theme parks clean, safe and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings last summer between Disney executives and scientists at Los Alamos 
National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico included 
discussions of resonant ultrasound techniques to test the structural integrity 
of rides, as well as alternative fuels for the energy-hungry rides, advanced 
pyrotechnics for better fireworks displays and battle-simulation software for 
managing traffic flow. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ideas being explored by Disney and Los Alamos involves a technique 
used to measure the fallout from a nuclear explosion. Disney is interested in 
using the technology, known as light detection and ranging, or "lidar," to 
monitor the air quality at its giant theme parks. Walt Disney World in Orlando, 
Fla., will be the first test site. 
</P>
<P>
 A cousin of radar (which stands for radio detection and ranging), lidar has 
existed for more than half a century, but scientists at Los Alamos were the 
first to apply the technology to track and control air pollution. Researchers 
have recently made a great leap forward in the field by reducing the size of a 
lidar system and improving the usefulness of the lidar data. 
</P>
<P>
 Lidar uses pulses of light in much the same way radar collects information 
from radio waves. A laser mounted on a telescope shines a beam into the 
atmosphere, and the glimmers of light reflected off particles in the air are 
collected in the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 By scanning the same area repeatedly, scientists can build a set of 
computerized data, stored on a hard disk attached to the telescope, which is 
then used to form a three-dimensional map of the air. Scientists can use the 
map to make detailed analyses of pollution patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Berger, a former nuclear weapons designer now working on the lidar 
project, says Los Alamos has been developing various uses of the technology 
since the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab hurriedly scraped together a device for the Army during the 1990 Iraqi 
invasion of Kuwait. But the war ended before employment of the system, which 
was built to detect the use of biological and chemical weapons by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamos has already provided the technology for several air quality 
tracking projects, including a mini-lidar system used in Barcelona at the 1992 
Summer Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Technologies, a small New Mexico firm that holds the exclusive 
license to lidar air pollution monitoring technology, is also developing a 
commercial version of the mini-lidar that it hopes to market to cities for air 
pollution control. 
</P>
<P>
 For Disney, whose theme parks attract tens of millions of visitors a year, 
traffic-related air pollution is a serious issue. Pollutants left in the 
aftermath of its immense fireworks shows are also a potential target of lidar 
study. CATHERINE JORDAN

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: PINNACLE MICRO'S REVISED REPORT GETS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spokesman for Ernst & Young, the accounting firm that audited Pinnacle 
Micro's flawed annual report last year, said Tuesday that the accounting firm 
is satisfied with the accuracy of revised earnings and revenue reports from the 
Irvine-based manufacturer of optical disk drives for storing computer data. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle Micro's stock closed at $11.75 on Tuesday, unchanged after a $1.50 
fall on Monday, when the company announced revisions in its 1993 
reports.Because some products recorded as 1993 sales were not actually shipped 
until the first days of 1994, about $2 million of the company's 1993 revenues 
of $39.2 million should have been counted as sales in the first quarter of 
1994, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle Micro had also announced preliminary second-quarter earnings of $13.2 
million.

DISC MANUFACTURING TO STAY IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Disc Manufacturing Inc. said Tuesday that it will remain in Anaheim during a 
planned expansion, taking advantage of economic incentives provided by the city 
in order to purchase a building from Rockwell International Corp. along the 
Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, a manufacturer of compact discs and CD-ROMs, employs about 170 
workers.It plans to add 190 jobs by 1998, according to company officials, and 
expects to spend about $30 million on the new site. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim voted Tuesday to provide the company with lower-priced 
utilities and has agreed to buy a portion of the Rockwell site that Disc 
Manufacturing may need in the future. The company has agreed to purchase the 
additional parcel within 14 years, city officials said.

TALKS BREAK DOWN BETWEEN UNITED AND FLIGHT ATTENDANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiations to bring the flight attendants union aboard the employee buyout 
at United Airlines have broken down, and no new talks are scheduled, both sides 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 UAL Corp. and the Assn. of Flight Attendants broke off talks over 
disagreements about the value of concessions the union would make to 
participate in the employee ownership program, according to the union and the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Friday's recorded telephone message for union members, United 
Airlines' parent company is either "unwilling or unable to place reasonable 
value on our contract changes." 
</P>
<P>
 UAL spokesman Tony Molinaro called the end of the talks a "recess." He said 
the company hopes to reopen negotiations "at a later date." 
</P>
<P>
 Molinaro said the delay in reaching an agreement was a result of the 
complexity of the talks. He declined to characterize the extent of the 
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In early July, employees represented by the Air Line Pilots Assn., the 
International Assn. of Machinists and a non-union group exchanged $4.9 billion 
in wage and work-rule concessions taken during almost a six-year period for a 
55% stake in United, creating one of the nation's largest employee-owned 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is seeking AFA concessions valued at $416 million for a 12% stake, 
according to Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed before the 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees participating in the buyout agreed to make concessions for five 
years and nine months. Flight attendant participation would have shortened that 
to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has opposed company plans to open foreign bases for flight 
attendants, a move it says would drain off U.S. jobs. The union also objected 
to company weight and height limits for flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides have moved closer to agreement on most issues other than the 
value of concessions, the union message said. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFA, United's largest employee group, represents about 24%, or 18,000, of 
United's 75,500 workers.

CROWDED PAINKILLER MARKET BECOMES A REAL HEADACHE; HEALTH: WITH NEWCOMER ALEVE, 
COMPETITION AMONG SUCH MEDICATIONS IS FIERCER THAN EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Bayer works wonders. More doctors use Tylenol. Advil stops the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The claims, counterclaims and dizzying displays of tablets, capsules, caplets 
and gel caps are enough to bring on a slam-bang head-thumper that would make 
even Robert Urich groan. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans' preoccupation with their throbbing heads has encouraged a vigorous 
advertising battle in which the purveyors of painkillers fight almost hourly 
over which works fast! faster! fastest! 
</P>
<P>
 You choose: Regular strength, extra strength? Doctor-recommended, 
hospital-used? Regular containers or easy-open bottles? Easy-to-swallow or the 
old choke-'em-down-with-water? (That's a choice?) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, this barrage helped Tylenol bump Bayer as the top-selling 
painkiller. Now Advil is en route to toppling Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
 New on the scene is Aleve, which says its pain relief lasts two to three times 
longer than the competition, a claim that threatens to consign the other guys 
to a list of headache has-beens. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason the makers of Advil sued Aleve this week, claiming Aleve 
deceives customers with false advertising. At stake is the preeminent position 
in a $2.5-billion business with more than 140 brands. 
</P>
<P>
 "All day strong -- all day long," boast Aleve's TV commercials, part of a 
$100-million campaign undertaken by Procter & Gamble Co., which sells the drug 
in partnership with drug maker Syntex Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 One or two Aleve pills last eight to 12 hours, the ads say, while 
official-looking bar graphs show the competition pooping out at four to eight 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not only wrong, it's dangerous, asserts Karen Brown, spokeswoman for 
American Home Products Corp., maker of Advil. 
</P>
<P>
 The painkilling power of Aleve and Advil is "virtually the same," but Procter 
& Gamble has distorted test results to claim otherwise, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, P&G never planned to tout the longer-lasting dosage. The factor it 
seems to be boasting about -- the recommendation to take Aleve only every eight 
hours -- was actually required by the Food and Drug Administration because 
doctors were worried about side effects of indigestion, constipation and 
sleeplessness that could result if the pills were taken more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have a disadvantage in terms of safety and it's being twisted to look 
like an advantage," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Newark, N.J., demands that 
Procter & Gamble halt the advertising campaign, run correction ads and pay 
unspecified dollar penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, Procter & Gamble issued a statement saying that all its claims 
for Aleve are true and were cleared by the FDA before the product was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly didn't expect our competitors to sit idly by, though we're 
disappointed by the misleading statements American Home Products is making 
today about Aleve," said P&G Chairman and Chief Executive Edwin Artzt. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is real enough but is highly unlikely to produce tense courtroom 
scenes with batteries of medical experts debating headache remedies or actor 
Urich on the stand to punch out pain with Bayer aspirin. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, marketers see it as a strategic weapon fired by Advil to alleviate 
Aleve's ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is using the legal system in its pure form, which is to harass and 
intimidate your competitors," said Al Ries, chairman of Trout & Ries, a market 
consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn. "There is absolutely no intent on the part 
of American Home Products to win a lawsuit. What they're trying to win is the 
minds of the analgesic customer."

SHERWIN-WILLIAMS BUYS OLD QUAKER PAINT OF ONTARIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sherwin-Williams Co. said Tuesday that it has acquired the assets of 
Ontario-based Old Quaker Paint Co., a closely held company that has seven paint 
stores in Southern California and sells products to the new-home construction 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwin-Williams, a Cleveland-based maker and retailer of paint, did not 
disclose the price it paid for Old Quaker, which had annual revenue of less 
than $20 million and less than 100 employees, a company spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>

ONE STUDIO'S TRASH IS ANOTHER'S TREASURE; MOVIES: WARNERS PASSING ON 'GUMP' AND 
COLUMBIA LOSING 'E.T.' ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES IN A LONG LINE OF HOLLYWOOD 
IRONIES. ASK WHO'S RESPONSIBLE AND EVERYONE'S FORGOTTEN, IN DENIAL OR OFF THE 
RECORD.

<P>
 In 1985, producer Wendy Finerman went to Warner Bros. to pitch a movie based 
on the novel "Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 A quirky story about a man with a low IQ whose remarkable life intersected key 
moments in modern American history, author Winston Groom's book was a difficult 
concept to sell to a major studio, but Warner Bros. took a gamble, acquired the 
property and Finerman went off to develop a script. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, "Forrest Gump," starring Tom Hanks and directed by Robert Zemeckis, has 
become one of the year's biggest blockbusters -- for Paramount Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Warner Bros., unable to come up with the kind of screenplay it 
wanted, put the script in "turnaround." That's Hollywood jargon for when a 
studio decides not to go forward with a project and offers it to other buyers 
in order to recoup its development costs. 
</P>
<P>
 While Paramount today is basking in the enormous success of "Gump" -- it has 
grossed more than $165 million this summer and could be an Oscar contender next 
year -- studio executives are also kicking themselves because a previous regime 
at Paramount let "Speed" slip away. The bomb-on-a-bus thriller starring Keanu 
Reeves has grossed more than $100 million this summer for 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 That one studio can create a blockbuster from the same source material 
rejected by others is one of the great ironies of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Every studio has a story about the big one that got away. Columbia Pictures 
once had Steven Spielberg's "E.T.: The Extraterrestrial," but let it go to 
Universal Pictures, which then turned it into a $400-million blockbuster. 
Warner Bros. gave up on "Home Alone" because of an escalating budget, and it 
went on to gross nearly $286 million for Fox. "A League of Their Own" was at 
Fox before it became a big hit for Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the studio executives who let the big ones get away, the embarrassment 
can be stinging. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask the question today, "Who at Warner Bros., and later, at Columbia, 
made the decision to pass on 'Forrest Gump'?" or "Who at Paramount made the 
decision to pass on 'Speed'?" memories begin to fade, fingers are pointed, and 
conversations quickly go Off the Record.  
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, it is a truism that just as people try to attach themselves to 
success, they also try to distance themselves from failure. And if it was you 
who made a decision to pass on that $200-million mega-hit, you hope nobody 
notices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "Gump," the question is especially intriguing because at the 
time the project was placed in turnaround by Warner Bros., Finerman's husband, 
Mark Canton, was in charge of worldwide production at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Canton, who today heads Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures, reject his 
own wife's project? Or, was the decision made down the line by production 
executive Bruce Berman, who in 1990 worked directly under Canton? 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, all that sources at Warner Bros. will say is that it was a "studio 
decision."  
</P>
<P>
 Finerman said that Canton was removed from making any decisions on her 
projects. "Mark did not get involved in the development of any of my projects 
at Warners, including 'Forrest Gump,' " Finerman said, declining further 
comment. Canton declined to be interviewed for this story. 
</P>
<P>
 However, others contend Canton cannot distance himself completely from the 
decision that ultimately was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark Canton was aware of everything that went on," said a source familiar 
with the project. "There's something called pillow-talk. Are you telling me 
that his wife never told him that Warner Bros. was putting her movie in 
turnaround? . . . These things (did) not happen without his knowledge. He (was) 
in charge." 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to Canton, however, pointed out that Canton had been elevated 
in 1989 to executive vice president of Warner Bros. Inc. and, though he was 
still responsible for overseeing production, he was out of the day-to-day 
decision-making loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Allyn Stewart, who brought "Gump" to Warner Bros. when she was a vice 
president of production there, recalled that it was a "group decision" to put 
the script in turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said the decision was made at a meeting chaired by Berman and attended 
by as many as 10 of his staff. She said neither Canton nor the studio's two top 
executives, Bob Daly or Terry Semel, were present. 
</P>
<P>
 Some point the finger at Berman, while others say he is the convenient 
scapegoat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Bruce Berman," one source recalled. "Canton was not responsible 
day-to-day for putting things into development." Berman was on vacation this 
week and could not be reached for comment, but one of his defenders said, "You 
would be making a serious error if you laid this off on Berman." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the Eric Roth screenplay that Paramount used for "Gump" did not 
exist when Warner Bros. put the project in turnaround. Similarly, the 
computer-generated special effects that Zemeckis inserted in the movie did not 
exist when Warner Bros. bought the rights to the novel in October, 1985. 
Indeed, neither Hanks nor Zemeckis was attached to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Finerman got permission from Warner Bros. to shop the script to 
Columbia, where she had an overall deal. Here, again, memories differ on what 
happened next. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources told The Times that Frank Price, then chairman of Columbia Pictures, 
rejected "Gump" after two of his top lieutenants, Michael Nathanson and Amy 
Pascal, had wholeheartedly supported it. Nathanson and Pascal declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Price today is adamant that he never read or passed on the "Forrest Gump" 
script. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," he said. "I am quite sure I didn't. Did anyone (at Columbia) see 
it? One can never be sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia sources said although "Gump" was Nathanson's project, Price had to 
have been aware of it since he was known to have been very meticulous about 
reading scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody (a production executive) apparently decided not to bring it to me," 
Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too there is the question of professional jealousy. Canton replaced Price 
as head of Columbia Pictures in 1991. Price has taken heat over the years for 
letting "E.T" go to Universal. Canton has taken heat for Arnold 
Schwarzenegger's 1993 fiasco, "Last Action Hero." Could both men have rejected 
"Gump"? 
</P>
<P>
 Scripts in turnaround, it should be noted, do not always become hits. Warner 
Bros., for example, placed "Fat Man and Little Boy," "The Temp" and "Whispers 
in the Dark" in turnaround only to see Paramount make all three and then watch 
all three become duds. 
</P>
<P>
 But even some Paramount executives were surprised in 1992 when the studio put 
"Speed" in turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former Paramount employees put the blame squarely on the shoulders of 
Stanley Jaffe, the irascible former president of Paramount Communications, the 
studio's parent company. They said he tossed out numerous scripts in late 1992 
that had been acquired during the short-lived Brandon Tartikoff era. 
</P>
<P>
 One Hollywood source said people on the lot were astounded that Jaffe would 
get rid of "Speed," since it's "Die-Hard-on-a-bus" theme seemed a natural as an 
action picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how anybody could miss seeing a hit in 'Speed,' " said the 
source. "It was so different -- building adventure around a runaway bus that 
can't slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed" producer Mark Gordon said he doesn't blame Paramount at all for 
passing on his script. 
</P>
<P>
 "People read scripts and pass on them all the time," Gordon said. "It's just 
the nature of the business. Paramount has had a fabulous summer. They have the 
second biggest picture of the year in 'Forrest Gump.' We can't say they made a 
mistake turning down 'Speed.' Everyone in town missed it."

A FUTURE MADE UP OF 'PUZZLEWORKS'; TELEVISION: KCET HOPES TO ENTER THE 
CHILDREN'S MARKET WITH ITS NEW $11-MILLION SERIES, FEATURING MULTIETHNIC 
PUPPETS LIVING IN A MAGICAL PLAYHOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 From planets to puppets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, the largest production at Los Angeles public-television station 
KCET Channel 28 was a subject as huge as the universe -- the $8.2-million, 
13-hour PBS series "Cosmos." 
</P>
<P>
 Now in the 1990s, it's "The Puzzleworks," an $11-million (and still counting) 
children's series featuring puppets, designed to convey down-to-earth messages 
of racial harmony, gender differences and individuality, and to help young 
viewers learn about making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-produced by KCET and Lancit Media Productions Ltd. (the company that makes 
PBS' "Reading Rainbow"), the weekday series will premiere in January. It's 
aimed at children between the ages of 2 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cosmos," said Stephen Kulczycki, KCET senior vice president for programming 
and one of the executive producers of "The Puzzleworks," "put KCET on the map 
in a way it hadn't been before, and this ("Puzzleworks") is a very big part of 
the way we see our future. We were wanna-bes; we wanted to get into children's 
television. There's a desperate need to provide children's television that 
helps kids figure out the world they're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Taping has just been completed at KCET's studios in Hollywood on the first 40 
episodes. Another batch of 25 is scheduled to begin production in January, but 
that timetable could be delayed if KCET and Lancit are unable to secure more 
corporate and foundation money. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers estimate that another $5.5 million to $6.5 million needs to be 
raised. Their contract with the federally funded Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting, which commissioned the series in 1991, calls for 65 episodes. CPB 
kicked in $4.5 million; another $3.5 million came from Southern California 
Edison after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 To a degree, KCET and Lancit have an ace in the hole. Beginning next June, 
they intend to take the "Sesame Street" and "Barney" route of selling tag-along 
toys, games and other "Puzzleworks" merchandise -- including puzzles, of 
course. Seven licensees have already been signed -- giving the producers 
guarantees of $8 million over three years -- and more are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But to complete the first 40 episodes, the producers had to use $3 million of 
the advance licensing guarantees. KCET insists there was no production overage. 
"It was just a matter of not getting funding to the amount we needed," said 
Barbara Goen, vice president of public information for the station.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked how KCET could guarantee it would get the money for the next 25 if it 
couldn't secure it for the first 40, Kulczycki said: " Guarantee is a state of 
mind. . . . We've got a number of (corporate and foundation) leads that are 
extremely interested in it. We aren't going to say now who they are, but we 
have leads that make us think that one of these is very likely to come through 
to help us. It's a calculated gamble, like anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if there's a worst-case scenario and the producers get nothing more beyond 
the remaining $5 million in licensing guarantees, wouldn't they be short at 
least $500,000 for the next 25 episodes? "We're going to get there," the KCET 
station executive insisted. "It is not a debatable issue in our minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the private funders come forward and the "Puzzleworks" products sell, 
KCET and Lancit hope to do more than the 65 episodes they are committed to. 
Proceeds from the merchandise will be funneled back into production. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecily Truett, co-executive producer of the series with her husband, Larry 
Lancit, president of Lancit Media, professes no doubt that "Puzzleworks" will 
make it. She likens it to "a soap opera for preschoolers," even though there is 
no ongoing story line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we don't have is continuity," she explained. "(It's) the 
emotional dynamic of what's going on, the emotional connection between the 
audience and the material, that irresistible magnetism to feel vicariously or 
to identify emotionally with what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 So who are these puppets whom the producers hope to make as familiar -- and 
commercial -- as Big Bird, Kermit, Miss Piggy and that adorable purple 
dinosaur? They are three boys and three girls, as diverse as a dream political 
ticket: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leon MacNeal, a feisty, smart, inquisitive African American boy from 
Manhattan's Upper West Side, who lives with his mother and grandmother (his 
father has died), loves science and cracks the best jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jody Silver, a Lithuanian American Jewish girl from Cincinnati. Offbeat, 
sensitive, artistic, she sees beauty everywhere, as evidenced by her wide, 
wonderful and offbeat collection of hats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ben Olafsen, a trusting, independent, loyal Norwegian German American farm 
boy from South Dakota. He loves animals, especially his prize pig Hammy, and 
plays a mean trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kiki Flores, a first-generation Mexican American from San Antonio, Tex., who 
speaks two languages fluently. Determined, efficient, inventive, she is a 
natural leader. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skye Nakalye, an Apache from the reservation in White Mountain, Ariz. 
Because of a particularly close relationship with his grandfather, he has a 
deep understanding and respect for the traditions of his culture. His favorite 
place at "Puzzleworks" is the greenhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Julie Woo, a stylish, charming, assertive and socially skilled Chinese 
American from San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are nothing if not politically correct here," Truett said, laughing, 
bounding onto the set with the energy of a kid let out for recess. Toward the 
end of the first 40 episodes, a seventh puppet will be introduced. He's Kyle 
and, Truett notes, "physically challenged" -- although that phrase will not be 
used on the show. "And we don't say ever he's in a wheelchair," she added. "He 
uses a wheelchair. He plays basketball, he dances."  
</P>
<P>
 The puppet kids come together in a sort of magical playhouse with giant 
colorful puzzle pieces, puzzle-inspired furniture, a goofy kitchen with a 
refrigerator in the shape of a milk carton, and a Laundromat dryer that doubles 
as either a popcorn machine or a gingerbread house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has nothing to do with being a real place," Truett said when questioned 
how the characters get together. "The metaphor of the puzzle is that each piece 
is different, yet it fits together in a whole. And that if one piece is 
missing, the puzzle is not complete." 
</P>
<P>
 In the episode "Ben's Bad Hair Day," Ben, with a thatch of ruler-straight 
yellow hair, decides he wants hair like Leon's, a thicket of black sausage-like 
curls. His wish becomes his dream. Not only does he get Leon's hair but so do 
all the other kids -- until Ben realizes he liked Kiki's brown hair and Skye's 
long black hair and Jody's strawberry-blond curls. He liked variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Puzzleworks" is chock-full of music, animation, visits from real-life 
celebrities and documentary-like inserts. In "Bad Hair Day," for example, 
Truett said there are segments "that take us to a Native American home where a 
kid is getting a haircut; we go to an African American barbershop; we go to 
your basic white-bread suburban beauty parlor." 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot do a show about diversity with just puppets," Truett said. 
"They're darling, they're wonderful, but unless you bring the real world in, 
you're not doing the full job."

'THREE GRACES' SAGA: GETTY PURCHASE DELAYED AGAIN; ART: THE LATEST ACTION BY 
BRITAIN TO DEFER AN EXPORT LICENSE IS JUST ONE OF MANY SETBACKS IN THE MUSEUM'S 
FIVE-YEAR EFFORT TO BUY THE ANTONIO CANOVA STATUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The J. Paul Getty Museum's five-year attempt to buy Antonio Canova's 
neo-classical sculpture "The Three Graces" for $12.3 million and export it from 
England has been stalled once again. In February, the British Department of 
National Heritage deferred the Getty's export license until Aug. 5, but now the 
deferral has been extended for three more months. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing saga pits cultural aspirations of British authorities, who fear 
losing their artistic heritage, against the ambitions of a wealthy American 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay, announced Tuesday by British National Heritage Secretary Stephen 
Dorrell, allows London's Victoria and Albert Museum additional time to match 
the Getty's price and keep the marble statue in England. To date, the V&A has 
raised 4.7 million ($7.6 million) toward the purchase. The museum is exploring 
a partnership with the National Galleries of Scotland that would contribute an 
additional 1.1 million ($1.8 million) leaving a balance of 1.8 million ($2.9 
million) to be raised by Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty museum, which first tried to purchase the artwork in 1989, expressed 
disappointment at the decision to delay shipping it. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to the press Tuesday morning, Getty director John Walsh said: 
"Evidently the faith we have had in the fairness of the British export license 
system has been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The British government refused to acquire the statue for 1.2 million in 1983. 
No British or Scottish museum has made an offer for the statue over the 
intervening 11 years, for most of which the statue has been in storage. 
</P>
<P>
 "On two occasions that we have endeavored to purchase the statue, our efforts 
have been blatantly frustrated by manipulations of the export license system, 
this time with the launch of a public appeal for funds announced after the 
deferral period had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that our disappointment will be shared by many museum colleagues 
internationally. We also happen to believe that the decision to defer, yet 
again, the grant of an export license will have a significant effect on 
London's position in the international art market," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, where the Canova affair has been something of a media event, the 
extension was greeted with relief. V&A Director Elizabeth Esteve-Coll issued a 
statement, saying: "We welcome the decision by Stephen Dorrell as a recognition 
of our commitment to our cultural heritage. As the home of the National 
Collection of Sculpture, the V&A recognizes the immense significance of this 
statue and has made every possible attempt to raise the funds needed to save it 
for the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The marble statue depicts the nude daughters of Jove -- Aglaia (Grace), 
Athalia (Beauty) and Euphronsyne (Joy). For the Getty, it is a union of the 
classical and the 19th-Century periods, two important areas in the museum's 
collection. "In a single statue, it sums up a lot of ideals of the 
neo-classical period. Not the heroic ideals, but ideals of feminine beauty and 
harmony," Walsh said by phone Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture was commissioned in 1814 by John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, 
and installed in 1819 in the newly built Temple of the Graces at Woburn Abbey 
in Bedfordshire. The Marquess of Tavistock, owner of Woburn Abbey, sold the 
work in 1984 to Fine Art Investment and Display Ltd., a Cayman Islands company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty agreed to buy the Canova in 1989, but the British Reviewing 
Committee on the Export of Works of Art recommended that an export license be 
deferred for six months so that a British museum could match the Getty's price. 
The V&A in 1990 launched a public appeal for funds to buy the statue and put it 
on display for six months. The museum raised a mere 70,000 ($113,400) during 
that period, but a series of delays has thwarted the Getty's attempts to follow 
through on its offer while the V&A has slowly built up its war chest.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Secretary Dorrell said the sculpture "has a place at the heart of our 
national heritage," he said he would not extend the deadline past three months.

MUSIC; PIANIST FINDS HER OWN RHYTHM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anne-Marie McDermott started taking lessons when she was 5, which is pretty 
common for would-be pianists. She stopped them when she was 18, which isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had wonderful teachers and intense training, but I made the decision that I 
needed to figure out on my own what everyone had taught me," the 31-year-old 
pianist said from her apartment in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, I was partially being rebellious at all that authority around me and 
needed to assert myself. I have not regretted it. Both with piano and with my 
life, the learning I've continued to do is a lot more genuine." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the decision to wing it hasn't impaired her career. McDermott found 
professional representation the same year she stopped lessons for good. She 
soon began winning a number of important prizes and eventually came to greater 
prominence, as do so many other young artists, by substituting for ailing 
colleagues on short notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly big breaks occurred when she substituted for Murray Perahia in 
the Mozart D-minor Concerto with the Atlanta Symphony in 1992 and when she 
stepped in for Maria Joao Pires with the Dallas Symphony in Beethoven's Second 
Concerto in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 She will be soloist with the Pacific Symphony led by Klaus Donath on Saturday 
at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in another Mozart Concerto -- No. 21, popularly 
called the "Elvira Madigan" Concerto, after its use in the 1967 Swedish film. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a nickname, however, McDermott detests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose it's inevitable, but it generally irritates me so much. It's really 
a great piece of music all on its own. It's incredibly uplifting, without 
having to relate it to any movie or any scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, McDermott finds its popularity -- she has been called upon to play 
that work more often than any other Mozart concerto -- frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many Mozart concertos that are so great, I hate to see any of 
them overlooked because of a movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she'll do her duty.  
</P>
<P>
 "I adore playing all Mozart. I fall in love with whichever (concerto) I'm 
working on at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Flushing, N.Y., McDermott grew up with two older sisters who are also 
musicians ("probably we were a little bit competitive as to who would practice 
longer") and a younger brother, who is an artist. Maureen, the eldest, is a 
free-lance cellist; Kerry, the next in line, plays in the first violin section 
of the New York Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Irish parents wanted them to have everything.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had Irish step-dancing lessons, swimming lessons, diving lessons. I 
studied the guitar as well as the piano. Diving was my second favorite thing 
after the piano. But I got an infection in my inner ear when I was about 9, so 
I stopped doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 The same year McDermott stopped taking lessons, she met her future husband, 
Jeffrey Caswell, now a free-lance trombonist. They have divided their apartment 
in two so each can practice without "driving the other crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I met him, I've been traveling a lot. Essentially, we don't see each 
other for months. It is difficult. (But) I think the core of our friendship is 
so great, nothing could draw us apart. We talk on the phone constantly. It is 
difficult. But this is my priority in my life, and we both know it. I just am 
lucky to have somebody in my life who understands that." 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott approaches all music -- and Mozart especially -- by not trying to 
impose herself on it too much.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's sort of in our nature as musicians," she says, "to want to shape lines 
and do a lot with them. The challenge with Mozart is doing very little. Of 
course, when you practice, you try out every option. But when you perform it, 
you separate yourself out." 
</P>
<P>
 What she likes to emphasize in Mozart is the music's "great strength of rhythm 
and humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Some pianists take a more lyrical, introverted approach. McDermott feels 
stronger about the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm a little more extroverted. Still, I view all the concertos as 
chamber music, where the music-making is highly interactive. I like that to be 
as evident as it can it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as tempos are concerned, I'm not a purist," she continued. "I don't 
try to do exactly the tempos marked by a composer (even) when they are marked. 
I have to find my own rhythm, my own contribution to tempo and dynamics. 
Certainly I try to abide by what the composer wrote, but not to an extreme. 
Everybody is different, psychologically. You have to find it for yourself 
first. That's the only way to do it with conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott also makes no apologies for playing Mozart on a concert grand, as 
she will Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always felt very strongly that we shouldn't have any preconceptions 
about Mozart and Bach being performed on modern-day instruments," she says. 
"The music speaks for itself and should be accessible to as large a group as 
possible. A modern grand makes it more accessible. If I played on a fortepiano, 
it would have to be in a smaller setting to be effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Donath doesn't object to the modern instrument either.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter," he said from Bristol, England, after conducting the 
second of three performances of Mozart's "Don Giovanni." "The orchestra will be 
large enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he will keep the orchestra to about 40 players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mozart has to be interpreted light and friendly and not heavy and not with 
too big an orchestra, because Mozart did not know anything about Brahms, 
Strauss, Wagner and Bruckner. You have to hear that Mozart comes from Haydn; 
Beethoven comes later. The orchestra shouldn't sound like a Romantic orchestra. 
If it sounds like Brahms, it's completely wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 * Anne-Marie McDermott will be the soloist in Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 21 
with the Pacific Symphony led by Klaus Donath on Saturday at 8 p.m. at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Meadows Drive, Irvine. Donath also will 
conduct the Divertimento, K. 138, and the Symphonies No. 32 and 38 ("Prague"). 
$12 to $48. (714) 740-2000 (TicketMaster).

NO 'PUZZLEWORKS' ON KOCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't look for "The Puzzleworks" on KOCE Channel 50, Orange County's public 
television station.KOCE is a so-called Limited Use Discount station, explains 
spokeswoman Judith Schaefer. That means it receives discounts on programs 
obtained from the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) as long as it doesn't take 
more than 40% of its programming from the service. At the moment, Schaefer 
said, KOCE has reached the limit and therefore cannot pick up "Puzzleworks" 
without jeopardizing its fiscal base. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the Limited Use Discount regulation is scheduled for national 
re-evaluation this fall. "Many public stations would like to have children's 
programs, like 'Puzzleworks,' exempt" from the regulation, she said.ZAN DUBIN

THE PERILOUS QUEST FOR A VOICE TO SAY VOLUMES; AUDIO BOOKS: FINDING THE RIGHT 
PERSON TO READ A WORK ALOUD IS A FINE ART. BAD NARRATORS CAN MAKE LISTENERS 
TUNE OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American heiress is in love with a mysterious, imposing man but she's 
engaged to a boorish Scottish duke. She shows contempt for her fiance 
throughout Jude Deveraux's romance novel "The Duchess," and finally lets her 
internal struggle out after he kills a deer for sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you do anything useful?" she shouts. "Don't you do anything other than 
kill things?" 
</P>
<P>
 In print, the passage shows her strong-willed side. On the audio cassette 
version of the book, voiced by a male actor who takes a stab at a falsetto 
voice, she sounds like Sammy Davis Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any problem with men reading female parts, but this sounds 
really silly," says Leslie Oelerich, editor of Audio Garden newsletter, which 
reviews voice performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the pitfalls of audio voice casting, where producers walk a fine line 
to get just the right actor for the right book. The task is loaded with risks: 
The slightest detail can make a listener turn off the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter how good the book is, there's nothing worse than the wrong 
narrator," says Claudia Howard, producer for Recorded Books Inc. in Prince 
Frederick, Md. "What it takes is imagination, the ability to live every single 
sentence you say. It's not just mouthing the words, but being there." 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, when the audio book business barely existed, not every publisher 
paid close attention to speech patterns or voice inflections. But audio books 
have boomed in popularity to about $1.2 billion in sales this year, according 
to the Audio Publishers Assn. That's about 80 million books sold. At the same 
time, the recordings have become more sophisticated, demanding lively vocal 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that you would just plunk a reader down in a chair, put music 
at the top and the end and they would start reading," says Maya Thomas, 
producer for Time Warner AudioBooks. "It worked, but it was not much of an 
interpretation." 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, the obvious choices -- the authors themselves -- are not 
the ones reading their works. John Grisham doesn't read "The Chamber"; Michael 
Beck does. Stacy Keach voices Scott Turow's "Pleading Guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Many authors "are no good at it," says Ray Bradbury, who has read about a 
dozen of his works on tape and spoken-word albums. "They're not actors. I got 
started as an actor, when I was 12." 
</P>
<P>
 So many producers at New York publishing houses scout for the best voices on 
Broadway. They rely on about 50 performers who routinely do audio voices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stage actors are experienced in staying up there and saying a lot of words 
over a long period of time," says HarperAudio producer Rick Harris. "By and 
large, my experience is that any really good stage actor can do this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the upcoming audio book "The Secret Life of Laszlo: Count Dracula," by 
Roderick Anscombe, Harris picked David Dukes, who recently appeared on Broadway 
in Arthur Miller's "Broken Glass." Dukes was "the best male actor we know who 
can project a sensuous menace," Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dukes' Count doesn't have a Transylvanian accent, even though the novel is 
told from the vampire's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I chose not to use an accent," Dukes says. "It's for an American audience. 
(As the narrator), you're trying to lure the audience into the story. You try 
not to remove him from the listener." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Dukes uses more flair in voicing supporting characters, who have to 
be memorable to listeners even though they may be in only a short part of the 
story. When he voiced Mario Puzo's "The Fourth K," he used Kennedy-esque Boston 
accents for some of the smaller parts. In Isaac Asimov's "Foundation" series, 
he voiced a galactic general like George C. Scott in "Patton." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to doing a woman's part, most actors make it as subtle as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't try to do a woman's voice," says Frank Muller, who has done almost 
100 audio books since he started in 1979. "I just try to lighten the tone to 
establish the character." 
</P>
<P>
 Muller, in preparing for his vocal performances, reads the work at least once 
before going into a studio. Other voice actors wing it. "Laugh-In" star Arte 
Johnson never read Dave Barry and Russell Baker before he recorded their books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times I will be absolutely hysterical laughing at what I am reading," 
Johnson says. "But I love to read raw. I'm reading it as fresh as I possibly 
can, without any preconceived notions." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, producers are depending on recognizable names to do audio 
books. A-list performers, such as Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Whoopi 
Goldberg, already have done them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can identify with them," says Cindy Jo Hinkleman, production 
coordinator for Dove Audio in Beverly Hills. "Especially if they see a big name 
does a current book, it gives that book all the more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Voice actors are paid a standard rate of $114.50 per hour, and the performers 
usually spend about six to eight hours recording books, according to the 
American Federation of Radio and Television Artists. Celebrities are paid much 
more to read, although it is far from what they would get for a TV show or 
movie, Hinkleman said. She and other producers declined to say how much they 
paid their top-name talent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, Dove got Meryl Streep to read a collection of works 
called "Women on Women, Men on Men." Ben Kingsley read some H.G. Wells 
classics, and Glenda Jackson, now a member of the British Parliament, recorded 
some of Jane Austen's works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get to do radio, whereas our predecessors did," says Blair Brown, 
who just finished reading "Now You See Her," by Whitney Otto, for Time Warner 
AudioBooks. "And every older actor I've talked to who did radio said it was the 
most fun because you're not bound by the limitations of your physical self." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean a big name is the right choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, it's not really suited," said Amy Lewis of Dercum Audio in 
West Chester, Pa. "It's waving a flag. Meryl Streep read 'Out of Africa.' Half 
the time you were thinking 'This is really intriguing.' The other half, you 
were thinking, 'This is Meryl Streep.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Few producers fret about casting famous names for autobiographies. The author 
almost always reads their work. It's their life story. Dan Quayle read 
"Standing Firm" for Harper Audio and Barbara Bush is due to record her upcoming 
memoirs for Simon & Schuster Audio. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers scramble, however, when world events put an author out of reach. 
Nelson Mandela's memoirs are coming up at Time Warner, but his election as 
South Africa's president makes it impossible for him to sit in a recording 
booth for several days. The publisher is now looking for a well-known African 
American actor to take the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Simon & Schuster had to find someone to read the memoirs of 
Virginia Kelley, President Clinton's mother, who died in January. The 
publishers sent President Clinton a list of possible readers -- mainly 
actresses with Southern voices. His choice: Rue McClanahan, one of his mother's 
favorite actresses, whom she had met at the 1992 Democratic National Convention 
and at Clinton's inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kelley had a "deep, rich throaty voice," McClanahan didn't try to 
replicate it in the book, "Leading With My Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get the flavor of Virginia as much as possible, but without being 
her," McClanahan says. "Imitating her wouldn't have been appropriate. So it's 
the spin you give to it. It's kind of the humorous approach to expression. Some 
of the colloquialisms." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, McClanahan got a letter from Clinton: "Mother's story could not have 
been in better hands or voice."

THEATRE CORP. PULLS OUT OF MANAGEMENT OF THE ALEX; STAGE: THE FIRM SAYS IT 
CAN'T AFFORD THE LAST TWO OF THREE MUSICALS OF THE SERIES, AFFECTING 10,000 
SUBSCRIBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Theatre Corp. of America has withdrawn from managing the Alex Theatre in 
Glendale, leaving 10,000 subscribers to its current three-musical series 
uncertain about how their remaining tickets will be honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. president David Houk said his company could not afford to 
produce the last two shows in the current series, but he said he would help the 
Alex Regional Theatre Board -- the city-appointed panel that oversees the 
recently restored theater -- find replacements for them. In the meantime, Alex 
tickets will also be honored at productions of the Pasadena Playhouse, the 
Theatre Corp.'s home base, Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alex board had helped finance the first Theatre Corp. production in the 
current Alex series, "Fashion," which closed Sunday. But the board was 
unwilling to help Theatre Corp. finance the other two shows, Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked when he realized that he would have to pull out of the Alex, Houk 
replied, "when I saw 'Fashion.' " Although he said he "enjoyed" the show, "I 
had hoped the audience would enjoy it more." 
</P>
<P>
 But "Fashion" is hardly the only reason the Theatre Corp., is exiting. The 
company spent more than it earned in its first Alex season, which began in 
January, and it also was afflicted by problems at the Pasadena Playhouse, where 
the Jan. 17 earthquake cut into ticket sales, Houk said. Theatre Corp. has been 
retrenching since May, when it canceled its tours of the Alex shows to San 
Diego and Fresno and Pasadena Playhouse productions to the Lobero Theatre in 
Santa Barbara and laid off 44 members of its 130 permanent staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan is to shrink back to the Pasadena Playhouse and concentrate all our 
efforts there," Houk said. The city of Pasadena recently loaned Theatre Corp. 
$200,000 to tide over the Playhouse cash flow while awaiting subscription 
receipts for its winter/spring season. Houk said Tuesday that the Pasadena 
subscription drive is meeting expectations and that "I'm doing everything I can 
to prevent" the collapse of the Theatre Corp. programming in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the Theatre Corp. musicals, scheduled events at the Alex will 
continue, Houk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex board member Jim DeMonaco said while Theatre Corp. is "on the hook" to 
the Alex subscribers, "ethically the board feels obligated to provide 
subscribers with the quality they bought into, and we are really committed to 
fulfilling that obligation." He said that he had talked to at least six 
organizations that might be able to present substitute shows at the Alex and 
that a decision should be ready "in a week or two."

LOW COUNT OF MINORITIES NOT JUSTIFIED, COURT SAYS; CENSUS: IF RULING STANDS, 
BIG CITIES WOULD BENEFIT. SOUTHLAND COULD GAIN MORE POLITICAL CLOUT AND U.S. 
MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a ruling that could mean more federal money for large cities -- and more 
political muscle for Southern California, a federal appeals court has found 
that the Bush Administration failed to justify undercounting millions of 
minority citizens in the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion, handed down Monday by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 
New York, breathed new life into a politically charged, six-year battle by a 
group of cities, including Los Angeles, to adjust population counts to correct 
for the chronic difficulty that the Census Bureau has had in reaching and 
counting minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents said Tuesday that, if allowed to stand, the ruling could 
dramatically restructure the equation of political power both nationally and 
within the state. Census figures are used for drawing district lines for the 
U.S. House of Representatives, seats in state legislatures and even city 
councils, as well as distributing federal funds for everything from feeding the 
poor to running mass transit systems. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is unclear what will actually happen if President Clinton chooses not 
to take up the Bush Administration position in the reinstated case. 
Theoretically, the new federal allocations could start flowing within a matter 
of months, but lawyers familiar with the case said it is also likely that any 
congressional redistricting will be challenged for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the court ruling could mean more federal funds for several 
cities as well as the possibility of more congressional representation. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest beneficiaries would be Santa Ana and Anaheim, which would see 
their official population counts rise by 5.5% and 4.4% respectively -- and reap 
additional funds because of it. The county overall count would rise 2.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Census experts were far less sure how the changes would affect the county's 
congressional representation, or if the courts would even order a new round of 
redistricting in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Many speculated that an extra congressional seat would be dropped into Los 
Angeles County, but that there was an outside chance that Orange County could 
get an additional seat because of its large immigrant population in the cities 
of Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the seat was added to Los Angeles County, it would have a pronounced 
effect on district boundaries throughout Southern California, experts said. In 
Orange County, for instance, congressional districts that currently only 
include a piece of the county's northern reaches might be shifted nearly all 
the way into the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess right now is if you would redraw the congressional district lines 
you would start in Los Angeles County," said Timothy Hodson, the former Senate 
Elections and Reapportionment Committee consultant who shepherded the 1990 
redistricting process. "That's where there's the greatest concentration of 
undercounted population. But there would be this incredible ripple effect in 
all the surrounding areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that Southern California and Arizona would gain one new 
congressional seat apiece under the new numbers, at the expense of Pennsylvania 
and Wisconsin, and that Los Angeles would be entitled to $150 million more a 
year in state and federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The census figures are a cornerstone of representative government," said 
Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz, who helped argue the case for Los Angeles. "We 
are really excited by this decision . . . it throws open a lot of issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Robert S. Rifkind, a Manhattan lawyer who represented the city of 
New York, called the ruling "a milestone in the battle against racial 
discrimination in voting." 
</P>
<P>
 "What the court found is that blacks, Hispanics and other minorities have had 
their votes diluted by this statistical problem back to 1940 at least -- and 
there's no reason why we should put up with it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Census Bureau has acknowledged that minorities have been undercounted 
for decades; members of minority and low-income families have traditionally 
been harder to reach because of misinformation and fears of government 
intrusion into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, in the 1980s, the bureau devised a formula to more accurately 
reflect the nation's diversity, but the increased minority numbers carried a 
potent political charge -- they are believed to be more favorable to Democrats 
than to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in that decade, as the 1990 census was being planned, mayors in Los 
Angeles, New York, Chicago and other big cities with large minority populations 
-- and heavily Democratic constituencies -- sued the Republican Bush 
Administration to compel an adjustment for what they expected would be an 
undercount. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the bureau conducted the Post Enumeration Survey, canvassing 
171,390 households nationwide. The sampling indicated that the nation's 
population had been undercounted by about 2.1%, or 5.4 million people. But the 
undercount, as suspected, was particularly glaring among minorities. The Census 
Bureau estimated that Hispanics had been undercounted by 5.2%, Native Americans 
by 5%, blacks by 4.8% and Asian and Pacific Islanders by 3.1%. Less than 2% of 
the white population was estimated to have been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Los Angeles and California have such large minority populations, state 
and local estimates also got short shrift. The city of Los Angeles, the bureau 
estimated, was undercounted by nearly 200,000 people, or about 5%, while 
California as a whole was undercounted by 3.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the legal settlement that culminated the mayors' suit, the 
Bush Administration's Department of Commerce -- which oversees the census -- 
was required to consider using the adjusted figures. But in 1991, then-Commerce 
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher declared the 1990 count "one of the two best 
censuses ever taken in this country," and refused to adjust the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosbacher said politics did not influence his decision; rather, he said, he 
simply did not want to "abandon a 200-year tradition of how we actually count 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision prompted a new legal challenge, this time not only from the 
cities but also from national minority organizations. But last year, a lower 
court threw out the case, ruling that although the adjustments would have made 
the census more accurate, Mosbacher was not technically required to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower court said the only legal requirement was that the commerce 
secretary not be arbitrary and capricious in his decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, the appeals court overturned that ruling on a 2-1 vote, saying 
that because the constitutional right of minorities to equal representation was 
at stake, the commerce secretary had to be held to a higher legal standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "While precise equality is a goal that at the national level may be illusory, 
there must be a good-faith effort to approach that goal as nearly as is 
practicable," the court ruled. If the official answer "is that it is preferable 
to undercount minorities," the opinion added, the Department of Commerce will 
have to prove that that decision serves a legitimate governmental objective 
that cannot be met any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkind, Heinz and other lawyers who argued the case said Monday that it is 
unclear what the ramifications will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a new secretary of commerce, a new attorney general and a new 
President now," Heinz said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said Monday that the Justice Department 
is reviewing the court's decision, and will eventually decide among three 
options -- to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court, to let the matter be 
sent back to the lower court for reconsideration under the new appeals court 
standards, or to admit to the undercount and let California and Arizona gain 
their congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Justice Department takes the third option, lawyers said, federal 
funding could be reallocated almost immediately; however, they added, the 
implications of that decision would be so prone to litigation that the next 
census could pass without a resolution of this case. 
</P>
<P>
 As lawyers grappled with the dramatic possibilities posed by the ruling, 
lobbying had already begun. On Tuesday, almost before the White House had 
received a copy of the opinion, Sen. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) had written a letter 
to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno urging an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 California's elected officials predictably lauded the opinion. "All of 
California wins on this particular ruling," said Assemblyman Richard Polanco 
(D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson was not immediately available for comment, but his office 
noted that he had been in favor of an adjustment for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Walsh, Wilson's press spokesman, said the governor's office would contact 
the administration "to see what steps they plan to take from here."

MAYOR ASKS DELAY ON SMOG RULES; POLLUTION: RIORDAN PLAN WOULD PUT OFF SOME 
TOUGH MEASURES FOR SEVERAL YEARS TO REDUCE IMPACT ON AIRLINES AND SHIPPING. IT 
TRIGGERS FIERCE DEBATE. 
</P>

<P>
 Jumping at the eleventh hour into the fray over cleaning up the Southland's 
smoggy skies, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan is pressuring air quality 
officials to delay for several years stringent measures aimed at eliminating 
one of the region's most dangerous air pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 Released in detail this week, the mayor's proposal immediately triggered a 
fierce debate, pitted the city against its neighbors in the Inland Empire and 
prompted an outcry by environmentalists and top staff members at the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District, who called the plan flawed and 
potentially illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the opposition, the plan from the mayor's office -- which until 
now has been mute on most clean-air issues -- has spurred enough political 
friction that the AQMD board is expected to delay its vote, slated for Friday, 
on an updated 20-year smog plan. Under federal law, both the AQMD and the state 
Air Resources Board must approve a new plan by November or face a freeze on 
federal highway funds and other economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to soften the economic impact of a clean-air plan on the city, 
Riordan's alternative plan addresses most of the smog problem but delays many 
measures proposed by the AQMD to reduce particulates -- the fine pieces of 
diesel soot and dust that can lodge in lungs and trigger respiratory disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's goal is to ease the burden on airlines, ships, trains and diesel 
trucks in the four-county basin, which under the AQMD plan would have to cut 
the nitrogen oxides that contribute to both smog and particulate pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business and labor groups worry that the proposed rules by the AQMD -- 
which also are contained in a plan by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
-- would devastate the Southland's economy by putting its interstate commerce 
at a competitive disadvantage with other markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, under Riordan's plan, the AQMD and EPA would have to come up with 
other solutions for particulates, including some that could shift the burden 
largely to the Inland Empire. Among the mayor's suggestions are tougher 
controls on dairy farms, where manure piles emit ammonia, and on "fugitive 
dust," particles that blow off rural lots during windstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Deputy Executive Officer Barry Wallerstein called the Riordan plan 
"seriously flawed" because it fails to illustrate how particulates would be 
cleaned up enough to meet federal law and state requirements, could harm public 
health and kill the region's dairy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time we don't believe it is a viable option," Wallerstein 
said, adding that Riordan is ignoring a state law requiring the air pollution 
agency to clean up particulates as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Kun, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
said the mayor is trying to skirt responsibility in cleaning up pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the mayor's plan is irresponsible," Kun said. "It is kind of the 
manana strategy -- do it later and do it somewhere else. They want to shift the 
problem out to the cows and avoid doing anything in the city to control the 
emissions." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling it the "most important single issue for the economy of California," 
Riordan said his office became involved because some proposals, if unchanged, 
would force airlines to reduce flights at Los Angeles International Airport by 
25% and shippers to turn away from the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports and 
head for others with no pollution controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and his aides say their strategy still will meet federal clean air 
deadlines but has a better chance of being implemented because it would delay 
the cost of achieving clean air. The city estimates that initially it could 
reduce the $5.4-billion annual price tag on the agency's plan to $2.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the city wants a plan that reduces pollution just enough to meet 
1994 federal mandates for ozone, the main ingredient of smog -- but no other 
air pollutants. In contrast, the AQMD wants to satisfy all pollution 
requirements with its new plan, including proposals on particulates that are 
not due until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's staff is arguing that the AQMD wants to reduce nitrogen oxides by 
79% when only a 45% reduction is now required to meet health standards for 
ozone. His office says planning for further reductions can come later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no agenda here to 'just say no' to clean air," Deputy Mayor Michael 
Keeley said. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD board Chairman Henry Wedaa and board member Marvin Braude said they will 
urge their colleagues on Friday to postpone a vote on the AQMD plan so that the 
mayor's proposal can be studied. The board's public hearing, set for 9:30 a.m., 
will continue as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Wedaa told Riordan's aides that he would not seek a delay in the 
vote but reconsidered after pressure from city officials. "We are in the 
process of giving it a fair and honest look," Wedaa, a Yorba Linda councilman, 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned, however, that the vote should not be delayed past September 
because the AQMD has little time to produce a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal Clean Air Act deadlines, the AQMD and state Air Resources Board 
have until November to submit an updated plan to the EPA that outlines how the 
region will achieve an ozone health standard by 2010. At the same time, the EPA 
is under a federal court order to come up with its own plan by Feb. 15 that 
would go into effect if local efforts fail. 
</P>
<P>
 David Howekamp, head of EPA's regional air and toxics division, said the 
federal agency is reviewing the mayor's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan acknowledged that the city's idea comes late, but said his staff 
didn't fully understand the economic impact of the proposals until May. His 
office then hired a consultant to come up with an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate, but so much of what government does is when you're right on 
the brink of falling over a cliff," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan conceded that the AQMD and EPA could miss their November and February 
deadlines by a few months. But he said that violating the deadlines is a better 
option than approving a plan that would severely harm Los Angeles' economy. He 
also said the Clinton Administration would be reluctant to penalize California 
with economic sanctions if the deadlines are not met. 
</P>
<P>
 But AQMD board member Norton Younglove, a Riverside County supervisor, called 
that a "spit-in-your-eye-and-stand-back approach. I don't think that's a sound 
tactic for government. Frankly, we have to remember what our objective is. To 
clean up the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Younglove said the mayor's plan could unfairly place the burden of controlling 
particulates on the region's inland valleys, when most pollution comes from Los 
Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles in effect says, 'Let us pollute all we want upwind and make the 
reductions down there in the inland valleys.' Frankly, the opposite thing 
should be done because we in the inland valleys face the most health problems," 
Younglove said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the mayor should go move in the part of the city that is an inland 
valley and then he would understand why many of us are concerned about the 
quality of the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Younglove said a strategy similar to Riordan's piecemeal approach of reducing 
individual pollutants was proposed by the oil and utility industries almost a 
decade ago. The argument was rejected by the AQMD and state ARB in the late 
1980s because it failed to address particulate pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Ed Laird, chairman of the county Chamber of Commerce's 
Environmental and Energy Committee, was supportive of Riordan's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They mayor has come out with quite a few positive proposals, and we would 
approach this in a positive manner," he said.

ST. LOUIS GETS RICH WISH LIST FROM THE RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams, stepping up efforts to find a more profitable home, have sent St. 
Louis officials an ambitious wish list that includes not only all revenue from 
games to be played in a new domed stadium there but also payment of $30 million 
the team still owes for Anaheim Stadium improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But St. Louis, which is trying to outbid Baltimore, Hartford, Conn. -- and 
Orange County -- for the Rams, likely could not satisfy all of the National 
Football League team's desires. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was a list of demands and not wishes, we'd never be able to do all 
this," said Mac Scott, director of communications for the office of St. Louis 
County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall. "However, this is a list of wishes, 
things they'd want if they could have everything. It's a place to begin 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, sent a week and a half ago, is one of the first concrete glimpses 
into what the Rams are looking for if they are to be lured from Southern 
California, where they have played since 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $30 million -- which would pay off a debt incurred when 
Anaheim Stadium was expanded to accommodate the Rams' move from Los Angeles in 
1980 -- Scott said the team has also asked St. Louis to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Compensate the team for lost revenue if it was forced, because of an 
unresolved lease situation, to play the 1995 and '96 seasons in Busch Stadium, 
which has 54,000 seats and no luxury suites, instead of the new 70,000-seat 
domed stadium under construction. Premium seating in the new stadium is 
expected to generate up to $12 million a year for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay an estimated $10 million in relocation fees to the NFL. When the 
Cardinals moved from St. Louis to Phoenix in 1988, they paid $6 million to $7 
million as a penalty for removing Phoenix from the list of potential NFL 
expansion sites. 
</P>
<P>
 * Build a separate practice facility, at an estimated cost of $10 million to 
$15 million. The existing stadium lease calls for the city to build such a 
facility for a new NFL tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give all new stadium revenue to the team. Under the current lease, a team 
would receive all concession, in-house advertising, luxury suite and club seat 
revenues, but it has not been determined who would receive single-game ticket 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Ram Executive Vice President) John Shaw that we're prepared for them 
to ask for the moon, and we're prepared to give them the moon, but it depends 
on the size of the moon," Westfall told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, reached at the Rams' UC Irvine training camp, deferred comment to Heidi 
Sinclair of the Los Angeles-based Burson-Marsteller public relations firm, 
which has been hired to handle questions regarding a possible move. But 
Sinclair could not be reached Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, unhappy with an outdated lease and a stadium that Shaw has called 
"economically obsolete," in May invoked an escape clause that allows them to 
leave in early August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The current lease calls for the Rams to pay rent of 60 cents per admission, 
not to exceed $400,000 a year, and give the city 7.5% of ticket revenue, 20% of 
luxury box revenue and about half of parking and concession revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurt by declining attendance in its fourth consecutive losing season, the team 
made a profit of about $3.5 million in 1993, but Shaw said a substantial loss 
is projected this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of baseball's Baltimore Orioles, Peter Angelos, who is trying to 
purchase a minority interest in the Rams and move them to Baltimore, has made 
three trips to Los Angeles to meet with Shaw and Rams owner Georgia Frontiere. 
</P>
<P>
 A St. Louis delegation that included House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.) met with Shaw in June, and A. Searle Field, chief of staff for 
Connecticut Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., visited Shaw in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore and St. Louis are considered the front-runners in the Rams derby. 
Though the Rams' wish list is imposing, St. Louis officials are at least 
encouraged by the team's apparent willingness to play in 29-year-old Busch 
Stadium for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis' NFL expansion effort last year and its current efforts to lure an 
existing team to relocate have been hampered by a lease dispute that could 
prevent a football team from playing in the new, $258-million stadium in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis beer distributor Jerry Clinton, who has had several meetings with 
Shaw, controls 30% of the lease and does not appear willing to turn over his 
share to FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), a nonprofit group formed by 
Westfall and St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. FANS Inc. controls 65%. The 
remaining 5% is owned by two smaller investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton at one point demanded $8 million for his share of the lease and has 
been quoted recently as saying it might be worth much more. But the lease 
dissolves in 1997, at which point it would revert to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be cheaper to compensate the Rams to play in Busch Stadium for two 
years, until Clinton's hold on the lease expires, than it would be to pay off 
Clinton," Scott said. "We're not all on the same page on this deal, 
unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orange County continued Tuesday to expand its efforts to keep the 
Rams. Leigh Steinberg, co-chairman of the Save the Rams Task Force, said his 
group will put up 12 billboards, seven in Los Angeles County and five in Orange 
County, that say: "Keep Our Rams in Orange County." Some 3,000 T-shirts with 
that slogan are also being produced. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly told the Save the Rams group that the Orange County 
region could lose about $36 million a year in annual sales and income if the 
team leaves. City officials culled their information from the economic impact 
reports of three other cities that have pro sports franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said Daly's findings "go to show the real risk to Orange County of 
losing this team. There's tangible economic consequences to the loss of the 
Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which is also considering plans to renovate Anaheim Stadium, 
purchase a share of the team and renegotiate the stadium lease, said it will 
unveil its formal proposal to the team at the annual Rams booster luncheon on 
Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Orange County can match the financial offers of St. Louis and 
Baltimore," said Jack Lindquist, former Disneyland president and co-chairman of 
the task force. "But we can come close enough so that a move wouldn't look 
quite as good to the Rams."

VALLEY MOTHER CHARGED OVER CAR ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL and ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney filed child endangerment charges Tuesday against 
a North Hollywood woman whose 2-year-old son knocked her idling car into gear 
on July 30, causing it to run over five children playing in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Disputing the account given by Estela Lopez, 33, who said that the boy climbed 
into the car on his own, city attorneys reported that they have two witnesses 
who will testify that Lopez left 2-year-old Osvaldo alone in the idling car. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a mother of three, was charged with two counts of child endangerment in 
a complaint the city attorney's office filed in Van Nuys Municipal Court. She 
was advised by letter to appear for arraignment on Aug. 30, Deputy City Atty. 
Richard Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined up to 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although four of the children, between 5 and 10 years old, were hospitalized 
in serious or critical condition immediately after the accident, none suffered 
permanent injuries. All have since been released. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the incident in the 6800 block of Agnes Avenue in North 
Hollywood, police and the district attorney's office declined to seek charges, 
saying the incident was a terrible tragedy that did not merit criminal action. 
Officers said they accepted Lopez's explanation for the incident, that she had 
left the car running while she ran into the house to retrieve her purse and 
that the boy climbed into the car on his own and accidentally moved the shift 
lever into drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said attorneys later decided to file charges because the children's 
injuries were serious and because several witnesses said Lopez had left the 
child unattended inside the car with the engine running. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 2-year-old was left alone in the car," Schmidt said. "There is no 
evidence the emergency brake was engaged. The child, based on what our 
witnesses say, was not strapped into a car seat or seat belt. Nothing was done 
to keep him from running around in the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Schmidt said two witnesses, including a 9-year-old girl who was struck and 
received broken ribs, stated they saw Lopez put her son in the idling car, 
close the door, then go inside her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, Schmidt said, told police that the toddler's head "seemed to 
disappear very quickly and the next thing she knew, the car was lurching 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who said she was unaware of the charges filed against her, reiterated 
Tuesday in a telephone interview with The Times that she did not leave the boy 
in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a matter of 10 seconds," Lopez said. "I started the car for my 
husband, remembered that I forgot my purse, ran inside, and returned to see the 
car moving toward the children. The car door was closed. I never knew he could 
open it by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the car, Lopez said, the boy tripped the automatic locks on the 
1984 Thunderbird. Unable to get inside the moving vehicle, Lopez said she 
pulled on the rear bumper in a futile attempt to slow it down, yelling a 
warning to the five unsuspecting children as it bore down on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The children -- four girls ages 5 through 10, and a boy, 7 -- were playing on 
a sofa in the apartment complex driveway, police said. The car pushed the sofa 
about 20 feet up the driveway and pinned it against the wall, trapping some of 
the children beneath the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and two of the girls, ages 6 and 10, are Lopez's nephew and nieces, 
Schmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who does not have a driver's license, said she was warming up the car 
engine for her husband, while the family prepared for a trip to McDonald's for 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the district attorney's office declined to file felony charges 
against Lopez, saying she left the boy alone very briefly, was remorseful and 
had no prior criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "She could have been looking at six years in state prison, and we felt her 
actions were more appropriately prosecuted as misdemeanors," Deputy Dist. Atty. 
David Mintz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Misdemeanor cases are prosecuted by the city attorney, and felonies by the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The more serious of the two child-endangerment charges filed Tuesday against 
Lopez involves placing a child in a situation "likely to cause great bodily 
injury or death," Schmidt said.

SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT THIS THEFT; UTILITIES: WATER DISTRICT OFFICIALS SAY 
HYDRANT WAS BEING TAPPED TO FILL A NEIGHBORHOOD POND KEPT STOCKED FOR ANGLERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For six weeks, Trabuco Canyon Water District officials fumed as the big one 
kept getting away -- namely, the mysterious water thief who informants said was 
tapping district lines to fill a local fishing hole. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, district officials think they have found the culprit -- or culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days ago, a district worker patrolling late at night discovered a fire 
hose connected to a hydrant in the tony Trabuco Highlands development pumping 
1,000 gallons of water per minute into the pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, officials said Tuesday, the worker found himself surrounded by 
area residents eager to write a check, install a meter, negotiate a deal, 
anything to quietly settle the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing doing. District officials called the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were just filling a pool, that would be one thing," district general 
manager Fred Sims said Tuesday. "But this is as much a crime as stealing 
something off a store shelf." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators are trying to determine who tapped into the hydrant, 
although district officials said they won't press charges if somebody just pays 
a $5,000 bill for the 1.5 million gallons allegedly taken from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Carved into the bottom of a ravine by cattle ranchers long ago, the fishing 
hole has been the private reserve for homeowners living on Brookseed Drive, who 
have stocked the pond with bass and catfish, according to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny, makeshift wooden dock rests on the edge of the pond with a couple of 
lawn chairs sitting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our kids fish there," said resident Rex Moody. "It keeps the 
surrounding vegetation green, it provides water for animals and keeps 
mosquitoes away" from homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody, who said he had nothing to do with connecting the fire hose to the 
hydrant, believes the district is overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district guy who came out (Friday) night was ranting," he said. "He said 
we were committing a bleeping felony and should be put in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Sims declined to say who is suspected of taking the water but added that the 
Sheriff's Department is investigating. Department officials could not be 
reached Tuesday to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire hose ran from a street hydrant through the back yard of a vacant 
house to a concrete culvert. From there, water flowed into the pond, which is 
about 50 feet across and a maximum of five to six feet deep, water officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The water leeches from the pond into two other bodies of water farther down 
the ravine, one covering an area of about two acres. District officials 
estimate that 1.5 million gallons have been siphoned off, a year's supply of 
water for five families. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Trabuco Highlands Homeowners Assn., the ponds are on land 
belonging to the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Chadd, president of the association's board of directors, acknowledged 
that the water was taken improperly but said Brookseed residents were being 
unfairly singled out because the association had sued the district on an 
unrelated matter this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dumb for these people to do what they did," Chadd said, "but I think 
the district is trying to make examples out of some of our residents. This was 
very bad timing on (the residents') part." 
</P>
<P>
 Sims countered, "This is no vendetta. If this was Portola Hills or any place 
else, we'd be reacting exactly the same because when you steal water, everyone 
in the district pays." 
</P>
<P>
 The general manager, whose district serves about 4,000 customers, said the 
first reports that residents were tapping into the lines came about six weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "These ponds dry up in the summer, and I guess these folks had stocked the 
pond with bass and wanted the water to keep the pond full," Sims said. "We had 
to catch them in the act, so we sent our people out regularly" to patrol the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took this real seriously because our only revenue is water," he said. "God 
makes the water flow down the hills for free, but it costs a lot to pump it 
back up to these homes."

 Aug. 27 was to be Patrick Stebbins' big day. As a proud new member of the 
Junior Angels Club, the 7-year-old was set to attend his first major league 
baseball game, to watch the California Angels take on the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 But the imminent baseball strike -- a dispute Patrick acknowledges he really 
doesn't understand -- may cancel the long-anticipated outing for Patrick and 
thousands of other Junior Angels, who may have to wait another year before they 
can watch Chili Davis try to blast one over the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "That strike really blew me up," said a sullen Patrick, whose mother, Katy, is 
trying to teach him as much about labor negotiations as she expects a 
7-year-old to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 If major league baseball players walk out as scheduled Friday and no agreement 
is reached before the Aug. 27 game, the strike could wipe out the big event of 
the Junior Angels' year: the night they are to turn over money they have been 
collecting for the National Childhood Cancer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick, who has raised $25 by clipping coupons (his mother pays him for the 
effort) and cajoling spare change from his relatives, is so disappointed at 
that prospect that he sat down at his mother's computer and laboriously typed 
out an angry letter to the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't you remember that you have a game for the kids with cancer?" Patrick 
wrote. "I get in trouble when I don't keep my promises and they hurt other 
people. We have wars and problems because of not keeping your word." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick has yet to send the one-page complaint to the ballclub but has fired 
it off to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Angels pay $5 to join the club, which entitles them to four free 
tickets to each of two Angels games, a fan magazine, a chance to be an honorary 
batboy or batgirl and some baseball cards. Some said they joined just to be 
part of the fund-raiser for cancer research. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels and Indians don't meet Aug. 27, the ballclub hopes to reschedule 
the Junior Angels' day at the ballpark later in the season. "I get calls all 
day long from kids wondering if there's going to be a game," said Corky 
Lippert, coordinator of the Junior Angels. "I tell them just to look 
optimistic, like I am." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first year the Junior Angels have raised money for the 
Arcadia-based cancer foundation, which last year collected about $11,000 
through the Colorado Rockies, San Francisco Giants and Houston Astros youth fan 
clubs, said Bob Pannoni, the research organization's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pannoni's 9-year-old son, Gregory, a Junior Angel member who plays Little 
League in Arcadia, said he, too, is angry that he might miss a chance to see 
his hero, Bo Jackson. But the strike, he said, may have one positive side 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good thing is I might have extra time to raise more money," Gregory said.

BUS DRIVERS OUTSPOKEN OVER DEMERITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two dozen Orange County bus drivers are fighting to save their jobs after they 
received demerits for failing to announce the names of major bus stops during 
random inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers and their union have filed grievances against the Orange County 
Transportation Authority in an effort to remove the demerits from their 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 The disciplinary action is part of the agency's aggressive effort to comply 
with the Americans With Disabilities Act, a federal law that requires, among 
other things, that major bus transfer points be called out so that blind 
passengers know when to get off the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Several blind people have complained that they missed their stops because of 
silent bus drivers, OCTA officials acknowledged Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have now made this a priority for us," said John Standiford, an OCTA 
spokesman. "It is no different than any safety rules." 
</P>
<P>
 But some drivers complained that the agency's punishment is Draconian. Drivers 
received 75 demerits for failing to announce major stops. Those who receive a 
total of 100 points are usually fired, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it takes is this . . . and one more infraction and you're out," said 
driver Don Shagam, who knows several colleagues who have received the demerits 
but is not facing disciplinary action himself. "I understand how important (ADA 
compliance) is to (OCTA). But a first-time offense should not be 
job-threatening. They should give the drivers a warning first." 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 bus drivers have received demerits for violating the announcement 
rules during the past month, according to Arlene Mordasini, secretary-treasurer 
for the Teamsters Local 911, which represents the drivers. Of that group, 24 
would have a total of 100 demerits or more each if the ADA violations are 
allowed to stand, Mordasini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union hopes to strike an agreement with OCTA that would protect the 
drivers from being dismissed. Mordasini said that no driver has been fired so 
far, but that a formal agreement has yet to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have an issue with complying with ADA," Mordasini said. "Our issue 
is that we feel the authority has instituted unreasonable and unfair rules." 
</P>
<P>
 John Catoe, OCTA's director of operations, said the disciplinary action was 
taken only after management repeatedly informed drivers about ADA requirements 
over a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, officials distributed a memo warning that failure to announce stops 
could result in disciplinary proceedings, Catoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to fire anyone if they are doing the job," he said. "But 
conversely, if someone is failing to make the (stop) announcements, that person 
can cause (himself or herself) to be fired. That could occur." 
</P>
<P>
 Catoe said he expected that only bus drivers who have been previously warned 
about the issue would face termination proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Blind people often complain about missing their destinations because bus 
drivers fail to announce their stops, said Melinda Johnson, a blind woman who 
works at the Blind-Braille Institute in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pass your stop and you have no idea where you are," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has received several calls about the problem, and some blind people 
recently brought their case before the agency's board of directors, Standiford 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a shortcoming of the service," Standiford said. "This is an 
example of the board responding to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But drivers and union officials contend that the agency should not expect all 
drivers to immediately announce each major stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't institute rules and regulations and expect everyone to be in 
compliance within a few short weeks," Mordasini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shagam, a 14-year OCTA veteran, said that drivers sometimes simply forget to 
announce stops as they attempt to keep track of traffic and deal with 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things to concentrate on," Shagam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Catoe stressed that the vast majority of drivers follow the announcement rules 
and attempt to assist blind people any way they can. The Braille Institute's 
Johnson agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, they are pretty terrific," she said, noting that an OCTA driver 
once got off his bus and walked her to her destination after he forgot to 
announce her stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that the Braille Institute trains blind people to ask a driver 
when they first enter the bus to announce their destination. She also suggested 
that blind people ask the driver about the progress of the trip every few 
minutes.

HEART DISEASE RISK NOT LOWER HERE, HOAG STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite being stereotyped as diet-conscious and fitness-crazed, Orange County 
residents might not be any better off than the average American when it comes 
to high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, two key risk factors for heart 
disease, according to preliminary findings of an ongoing study. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial findings, based on 5,000 screenings throughout the county, 
surprised researchers at Hoag Heart Institute in Newport Beach, one of 52 
centers in a nationwide study on how to reduce the risks of heart disease. Hoag 
is the only center in Orange County involved in the research. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assumed that being in Southern California, we were going to look very good 
compared to people with indoor, less active lifestyles," said Dr. Joel 
Manchester, the institute's medical director of cardiology. 
</P>
<P>
 Manchester stressed that the findings released this week were not the basic 
point of the research. The National Heart Attack Risk Study was designed to 
determine whether people who are made aware of their risks of heart disease and 
how their numbers compare to others will, as a result, make healthful changes 
in their lifestyles. So far, that question remains unanswered, Manchester said, 
as Hoag is only about a year into the five-year study. 
</P>
<P>
 But measurements of the five key risk indicators -- cholesterol, blood 
pressure and blood sugar levels, weight and smoking -- have not all turned out 
as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-four percent of Orange County participants had high total blood 
cholesterol levels, compared to 51% nationally, and 29% had high blood 
pressure, compared to 21% nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The slightly higher numbers in Orange County are not considered statistically 
significant; the surprise is that "the numbers weren't lower," Manchester said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers were also taken aback that almost 20% of people screened who had 
cardiovascular disease were not under the care of a physician, and 20% of those 
who had had a cardiovascular procedure in the past were not currently under a 
doctor's care. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large percentage of screened individuals in whom we detected an abnormality 
were unaware" that they had a problem, "but there was a large percentage who 
knew they had an abnormality but weren't following up on it," Manchester said. 
The cardiologist said he cannot explain the findings at this stage. 
</P>
<P>
 More in keeping with expectations were findings that Orange County residents 
smoked less and weighed less compared to the national average, Manchester said. 
Fifty-seven percent of county participants were above ideal body weight, 
compared to 64% nationally. Six percent of county participants smoked, half the 
national percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen percent of Orange County participants showed elevated blood sugar 
levels, perhaps indicative of a diabetic tendency, compared to 20% nationwide, 
not a statistically significant difference, Manchester said. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is mostly based on screenings of corporate employees throughout the 
county, but also includes some community screening data, Manchester said. 
Participants include men between the ages of 21 and 88, and women age 21 to 86. 
More than 370,000 people are participating in the study nationally.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; COUNCIL PLANNING TO AMEND SIGN CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just how dangerous is it to drive down Harbor Boulevard while trying to read 
some of the business signs? 
</P>
<P>
 John Feeney, a Costa Mesa resident, thinks it can get pretty hectic, 
especially when the letters aren't big enough and there are seven different 
pieces of information to absorb on a single sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if there are three different businesses listed on a multi-tenant sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to be a public safety hazard," Feeney on Monday told the City 
Council, which is in the midst of amending its sign ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the minimum height for signs needs to be higher and whether more or 
fewer businesses should be listed on signs were just a few proposed changes 
that were batted about by council members during the study session. 
</P>
<P>
 All council members agreed that the sign ordinance needs to be amended to make 
such accommodations -- but not necessarily with fewer regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your typical (sign) applicants want to eliminate ambiguity," Mayor Sandra L. 
Genis said. "They don't want more rules, they just want them to be clear."  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Peter F. Buffa said he would like to shrink the current 39-page 
ordinance to one page, while Perry Valentine, the city's planning manager, 
submitted two alternative ordinances for consideration: a 23-page version and a 
14-page version. 
</P>
<P>
 The shorter of the two was based on a model ordinance by the National Electric 
Sign Assn. and would impose no limits on the height of letters and the number 
of businesses allowed on a multi-tenant sign, which is three. That version 
would increase the allowable height for ground signs on 60-foot-wide lots to 25 
feet from seven feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 23-page proposal, which Valentine and the planning staff recommend, 
there would be more flexibility in the height of letters and the number of 
businesses allowed on a multi-tenant sign would increase from three to four. 
</P>
<P>
 During a slide presentation, Valentine showed photographs of Harbor Boulevard 
20 years ago, before the sign ordinance was adopted in 1973. He compared it to 
the way the boulevard looks today, when the signs are much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentine said he wants a strict sign code and fears a simpler ordinance could 
lead to larger signs in the city. The City Council and the Planning Commission 
plan to vote on the new ordinance sometime in the beginning of October, 
Valentine said.TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; PLANNING BOARD TO RECONSIDER PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will reconsider Wednesday a controversial plan to 
redevelop a downtown site that includes the building that once housed the 
Fahrenheit 451 bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is owned by Wyland, the artist who painted the "Whaling Wall" 
alongside the property 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has gotten attention partly because the bluff-top property holds 
three historic structures, the popular old bookstore building and two 
dilapidated cottages built in 1902. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the first development proposal up for city approval under the 
Central Bluffs Specific Plan, which governs construction on about two blocks of 
choice coastal property south of Main Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the central bluffs, a very visually prominent and important stretch 
of property in Laguna Beach," Community Development Director Kyle Butterwick 
said Monday. "A lot of people are looking at this plan as an example of the 
type of development the specific plan would allow for." 
</P>
<P>
 While an earlier plan called for all three buildings to be razed, planning 
commissioners recommended that any redevelopment plan make use of the existing 
buildings. As a result, the property owner will present a modified proposal 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The new project calls for the old bookstore building to be remodeled, expanded 
and transformed into an art gallery. Wyland, who uses no first name, is 
offering to pay to relocate one of the old cottages if a suitable site can be 
found. The other cottage would be razed and rebuilt to look essentially the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Conrad, Wyland's architect, said Monday he has been lobbying community 
groups and is "cautiously optimistic" about winning commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done our best to follow the recommendations from the Planning 
Commission, and we think we're going to have some support from some of the 
local community groups," Conrad said. "It's a sensitive site; we're not going 
to make everybody happy." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff is recommending that the project be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Butterwick questioned whether the one cottage would withstand 
relocation. He also balked at the prospect of re-creating the other cottage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That to me is a very significant issue," he said. "We speak about historic 
preservation. Are we speaking about preservation in the literal sense or does 
preservation mean you can . . . demolish the structure and re-create it? The 
(city) staff has taken the position that historic preservation means precisely 
what the term (implies), and that is preservation of historic structures."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; ELDERLY DRIVER HELD AFTER 4-COUNTY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An elderly man led California Highway Patrol officers on a chase across four 
Southern California counties Tuesday, finally being arrested only because 
southbound Interstate 5 near Oceanside was closed because a would-be suicide 
was threatening to jump from an overpass, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the chase began shortly after 1 p.m. in Ventura County, where 
CHP officers attempted to stop a white Ford Taurus said to be traveling in 
excess of 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning eastbound on U.S. 101 in Oxnard, the chase proceeded south on the 
the San Diego Freeway through Los Angeles County, then into Orange County and 
finally into San Diego County along Interstate 5, said CHP Officer Tito Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Were it not for the other emergency, which closed Interstate 5 from Mission 
Avenue in Oceanside to a rest area near Camp Pendleton, the chase would have 
continued, said CHP Officer Phil Konstantin. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified driver of the Taurus, believed to be in his 70s, could go no 
farther, "only because there was nowhere else to go -- he, like everyone else, 
was at a standstill," Konstantin said. Officers apprehended him at 3:37 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the chase. MICHAEL GRANBERRY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WILSON GETS SUPPORT FOR STANCE ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing his "tough on crime" message that has become the centerpiece of his 
reelection campaign, Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday received support from local 
law enforcement officers and crime survivors who also suggested that his 
anti-crime package could stand to get a little tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the governor was whipping up public support for his anti-crime 
agenda, the Assembly Public Safety Committee was voting down a part of the 
package that would make murder in a carjacking or drive-by shooting a capital 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, already rejected earlier this year by the committee, can come up 
again for reconsideration. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke to about two dozen law enforcement and crime victim advocates in 
Westminster, Wilson had not yet learned of the latest defeat of the bill and 
urged the local group to pressure the Assembly for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 He said some Assembly members have stated opposition to the bill because they 
are philosophically opposed to the death penalty, but he argued that the 
committee members "should at least allow their colleagues the opportunity to 
cast a vote on the floor. . . . In effect, what you have now are 32 million 
Californians being held hostage by four (committee) votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also heard several suggestions from the police chiefs of Buena Park, 
Huntington Beach, Placentia and Westminster and Orange County Dist. Atty. 
Michael R. Capizzi on how to strengthen laws against violent criminals. They 
also requested $750,000 for the countywide expansion of a program founded in 
Westminster, which teams up prosecutors, probation officers and local police to 
go after gang leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Wagel, 29, of Fountain Valley, who was left paralyzed after a carjacking 
three years ago, told the governor that the statute of limitations on attempted 
murder cases should be expanded. Even if his attacker were to be caught, the 
legal time limit on prosecution has already run out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of appalled that, based on my survival, the statute of limitations 
is three years," Wagel told the governor. "There's no reason for (a violent 
criminal) to think about the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Lott, 46, of Lake Forest, who began a campaign against gang violence 
after a 1992 shooting injured her then-16-year-old son, also argued that those 
convicted of attempted murder should receive the same punishment doled out to 
convicted murderers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to her son and Wagel, Lott said: "Just because they survived a 
violent, violent shooting doesn't lessen the crime committed against them. . . 
. No one knows the way that it affects a family, no one knows the pain and 
suffering we go through, no one understands it unless they walk in our shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Wilson's proposal to lower the legal age that a juvenile can be 
tried as an adult from 16 to 14, Lott said the law should apply to anyone over 
the age of 12 who commits a violent crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Later, in response to reporters' questions, Wilson said the federal crime bill 
awaiting final approval in Congress "is all right." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than nothing, now that it is freed of the absurd racial justice 
amendment," he said, referring to a provision that was deleted that would have 
allowed Death Row inmates to challenge their sentences by using statistical 
evidence to show racial bias in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerning a bill by state Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), which calls 
for up to 10 strikes of a wooden paddle for convicted juvenile graffiti 
vandals, Wilson downplayed the proposed punishment in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more important than the corporal punishment aspect of the thing is 
public humiliation of some kind," Wilson said. "I also think . . . (parents) 
should be made to pay restitution for whatever is required to cure the 
defacement of the property, whether it's public or private property." GEBE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; WATER DISTRICT BOARD MEMBER APPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Witold Muller, a 58-year-old commercial real estate broker and general 
contractor, has been appointed to fill a seat on the board of the Capistrano 
Beach County Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller won unanimous board approval last week to fill the seat vacated in June 
by Addison H. DeBoi, who quit after an unsuccessful bid to become a Dana Point 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Meadows, the water district's general manager, said that although Muller 
was appointed to a board term that expires in 1996, he must run for election in 
November for the seat's remaining two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller could also choose to seek one of two other seats with full two-year 
terms being contested in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller said Monday that he intends to run in November but hasn't decided which 
seat to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd be getting involved for the short term," he said. He said 
he planned to speak with the registrar of voters office about his options. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Muller, five other board hopefuls applied for the seat, according to 
the water district. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; EDWARDS THEATER ALLOWED TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The big Edwards Newport Cinemas is going to get bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved plans Monday night to allow Edwards Theater Circuit 
Inc. to demolish the former Good Earth restaurant at 300 Newport Center Drive 
and build in its place a three-screen annex to the existing three-screen 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for a three-story complex, using the existing ground-floor 
entrances and ticket booths. Patrons will ride elevators or escalators to a 
lobby level below, which will house three new auditoriums, each with 299 seats, 
a full-size screen and digital sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Only employees will use an enclosed bridge connecting new administrative 
offices in the annex to the current theater site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put a lot of study into making this work, and we think it will work 
beautifully," Jim Edwards, president of the chain, told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said the company expects to start construction this fall and have the 
new screens running by next summer, bringing its total to 2,947 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's only objection to the project came from Councilwoman Jean H. 
Watt, who wanted the new marquee sign to keep to the 32-foot height limit. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members pointed out that there are no homes nearby, and the 
adjacent Hard Rock Cafe has a 40-foot guitar adorning its frontage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the Planning Commission when that sign came up, and I voted against 
it," Councilwoman Janice A. Debay said. Now that it's there, she said, "it 
really looks good." HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; BUSINESSES THAT SELL ALCOHOL NEED PERMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by a rumor that a store offering alcohol might open across the street 
from La Habra High School, the City Council has adopted a temporary ordinance 
requiring all businesses that sell alcohol to obtain city permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, which took effect immediately upon passage July 28, 
anyone seeking to open a new establishment that would sell beer, wine or liquor 
must obtain a city permit and pay a $500 fee.The temporary ordinance expires 45 
days from passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came after the city received a petition last month signed by 250 high 
school employees and officials of the local Boys & Girls Club opposing the 
rumored opening of a convenience store or liquor store near the high school, 
City Clerk Sharie Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were concerned about the store's (proximity) to the school and said it 
could become a hangout" for teen-agers, Apodaca said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 28, a week after receiving the petition, the council unanimously 
passed the temporary ordinance. A week later, the council considered passing a 
permanent ordinance banning alcohol sales anywhere within 500 feet of a school 
but postponed action after legal questions arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Bars and restaurants that sell alcohol consumed on the premises already must 
obtain city permits. City officials now are working to craft a law aimed at 
keeping stores that sell alcohol away from schools and churches.  
</P>
<P>
 That ordinance will be considered by the Planning Commission and the City 
Council within the next two months. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY TO AWARD EFFORTS AT WASTE REDUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are launching an environmental awards program that encourages 
commercial and industrial establishments to improve their waste management. The 
program is part of the city's effort to reduce landfill usage in compliance 
with a recent state law. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which was approved by the state Legislature in 1989, requires 
California cities and counties to cut their landfill use 25% by next summer. A 
50% reduction in landfill use must be achieved by the year 2000. If these goals 
are not met, cities and counties will face fines of up to $10,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Business Environmental Awards will be presented each quarter and focus 
alternately on the themes of reduce, reuse and recycle. A fourth award will be 
presented around the time of Earth Day for the best comprehensive approach to 
waste management. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsoring the awards are the city of Tustin and its contracted waste hauler, 
Great Western Reclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Pitcher, an administrative assistant with the city Public Works 
Department, said the program is designed to increase public awareness about the 
pressing need to reduce waste, and to get as many local companies involved as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious way for companies to manage waste is through recycling, 
Pitcher said, but there are other approaches as well. 
</P>
<P>
 One of these is to reduce the amount of raw material used such as through 
innovative packaging or more efficient production methods. This type of 
conservation will be the focus of the first Business Environmental Award. 
Another way to reduce waste, Pitcher said, is through operational changes that 
conserve water or energy, or improve air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 All participants in the program will receive a window decal, "so their 
customers can see they're an environmentally responsible company," Pitcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Award winners will be presented with a glass trophy that Pitcher describes as 
"very artistic, very pretty." The first award will be presented by Mayor Thomas 
R. Saltarelli and a representative of Great Western Reclamation at the Sept. 19 
City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully it will be successful and we will continue to do it every quarter," 
Pitcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Application forms for the awards program are available at Tustin City Hall, 
300 Centennial Way; Great Western Reclamation, 1800 S. Grand Ave. in Santa Ana, 
and the Tustin Chamber of Commerce, 399 El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 The application deadline for the first award is Sept. 2. Additional 
information is available by calling (714) 573-3173 or (714) 558-7761. ALAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COAST PANEL TO HEAR PIER, BEACH PLANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to build a Ruby's Diner at the end of the municipal pier and transform 
the beachfront into a plaza area will be considered Thursday by the California 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue concerning the diner is the proposed 45-foot height of the 
6,510-square-foot restaurant. Another is whether the development meets parking 
requirements, said Ron Hagan, community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the diner's two-story design is needed to accommodate the plumbing 
system, vents and air-conditioning unit on the top of the building, which will 
be screened from public view. He said that placing equipment and utilities 
under the pier would mean exposure to wave action and the possibility of losing 
them in a storm. 
</P>
<P>
 John Auyong, coastal program analyst for the Coastal Commission, said 
officials are recommending approval of the 45-foot-high restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "From staff's point of view, the concerns have been addressed," Auyong said. 
"We are comfortable recommending to the commission that the (height) would not 
have an adverse impact on views." 
</P>
<P>
 Auyong also said the parking issue has been resolved, as Ruby's will validate 
tickets for patrons who park in the city's downtown parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Cavanaugh, president of the Ruby Restaurant Group, said the restaurant 
will be named "Ruby's Surf City Diner" and feature a surfing theme. 
</P>
<P>
 A snack shop and bait and tackle shop on the pier will also be considered for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 A new lifeguard tower and restrooms have already been approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the cost to build all five buildings on the pier is estimated at 
nearly $2 million. But the city has $1.3 million to construct the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to build the diner is estimated at $1.2 million, he said. Ruby's will 
be built first since it guarantees $150,000 yearly to the city from lease and 
tax revenue, Hagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal commissioners will also consider approval of the city project known as 
Pier Plaza. Plans include a plaza area next to the pier with a new boardwalk, 
public amphitheater, lawn area, restrooms and showers, concession building, 
bicycle parking and redesigned public parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the Coastal Commission staff is concerned about the proposed width 
of the nearly one-mile boardwalk for bicycle and pedestrian use.  
</P>
<P>
 The city wants to build a 24-foot-wide path, but Coastal Commission officials 
are recommending a maximum of 17 feet for a boardwalk in an effort to limit 
encroachment onto the beach, said Meg Vaughn, Coastal Commission staff analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the wider boardwalk is needed to meet public safety codes and 
accommodate emergency vehicles and beach crowds.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; ADVERTISING SIGNS FOR 'AUTO ROW' DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city may work with dealers along "Auto Row" on Manchester Boulevard to 
develop one or more advertising signs on nearby freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Development director Thomas E. Lynch presented two preliminary designs at 
Monday's City Council meeting but said the dealers have yet to reach a 
consensus. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions about the project primarily would be up to the car dealers, who are 
the largest cumulative tax-generators in the city, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the signs could range from $50,000 to $400,000. Who would pay that 
bill is still undetermined, Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first design showed a traditional stacking of dealership logos that would 
measure approximately 50 to 70 feet tall and 27 feet across. One section 
directs drivers from Beach to Manchester boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option was a much larger sign with various blocks for electronic signs 
and a space for the city's logo, "Center of the Southland," at the top. The 
city could bear the capital costs and rent out space to car dealers and 
businesses on the entertainment corridor, Lynch said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; ROSE ESPINOZA TO RUN FOR SEAT ON COUNCIL

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rose Espinoza, the woman hailed by leaders nationwide for her successful 
after-school tutoring program in her garage, has decided to run for City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Her decision came after months of resisting continued pleas from the 
community.Espinoza said she decided to run for election after being urged to do 
so by numerous neighbors, friends, community volunteers and local school 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old volunteer, who grew up here, began her free tutoring program, 
MAS (Motivating Adolescents to Succeed), three years ago to encourage area 
children to excel in school and steer away from gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza's work recently was recognized by President Clinton, who presented 
her with the prestigious Presidential Volunteer Action Award. The City Council 
also recognized her with a proclamation for her dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I go in town, where work needs to be done, there's Rosie helping 
out," said Dan Casey, executive director of the local Boys and Girls Club. "She 
tutors kids in the afternoons and their parents in the evenings. They don't 
make ladies any nicer. We need more people like her because she understands the 
problems of this city and really lends support." 
</P>
<P>
 Espinoza, who promotes grass-roots efforts to better the city, said she will 
file candidacy papers this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, Espinoza faces competition from Mayor David M. Cheverton and 
Dorothy Rush, a longtime resident who wants to fight blight in the city. City 
Clerk Sharie Apodaca said Rush and Cheverton have already filed candidacy 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates have until Friday to file for the council race, in which two seats 
will be filled in the November election. The deadline will be extended to Aug. 
17 if incumbent William D. Mahoney decides not to run for reelection. MIMI KO

SUMMER'S STAR SHOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The annual Perseid meteor shower may be unusually intense this year. A meteor 
storm could occur Thursday night and Friday morning, climaxing about 3 a.m. 
Friday, Pacific time. Astronomers are predicting that viewers in dark locations 
with a good view of the sky could see at least one meteor per minute -- or up 
to several hundred per hour. The Makings of Meteors 
</P>
<P>
 * Often called "shooting stars," meteors are particles of dust shed by comets. 
Streaks of light are produced as the particles fall through the atmosphere and 
are burned up by friction when they collide with air molecules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meteors fall every night, but when the Earth passes through the orbit of an 
active comet, meteors fall in a shower of up to a few dozen meteors per hour. 
The Comet Swift-Tuttle 
</P>
<P>
 * Every August the Earth passes near the orbit of the comet Swift-Tuttle and 
we see the so-called Perseid meteors, which radiate from the direction of the 
constellation Perseus. 
</P>
<P>
 * This comet reached its closest point to Earth in 1992, as it does once every 
130 years. For several years before and after its return, showers can be 
intense because the Earth is passing through the part of the comet's orbit 
where a lot of dust was recently shed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The August shower was especially brilliant in 1991 and 1992, and less so in 
1993 because it peaked before dark on the West Coast. For the next two years 
there are still chances for bright August fireworks. Tips for Sky-Watchers 
</P>
<P>
 * The best time for viewing will be late Thursday night until 3 a.m. Friday. 
Meteors will also fall tonight and Friday, but with less intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 * If possible, get away from city lights. Griffith Observatory is too close to 
Downtown Los Angeles' bright lights for good visibility and will not be open 
late for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 * For more information on celestial events, call the observatory's Sky Report 
at (213) 663-8171. For program information, call (213) 664-1191.

SANTA ANA MAN FATALLY SHOT AT EX-GIRLFRIEND'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Ana man was shot dead Monday night by a guest of his ex-girlfriend, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Steven Robinson, 40, died of several gunshot wounds in the living room 
of the Santa Ana mobile home he once shared with Pamela Corry, 45, authorities 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitor, Lonnie Ray Sylvey, 47, of Santa Ana, was arrested in the 
shooting, which occurred about 9:30 p.m. in a mobile home park in the 4000 
block of 1st Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be a lover's triangle," Sgt. Dennis Rios said. "She's visiting 
with this guy. Robinson arrives, sees him there, a dispute erupts, and one 
thing leads to another." 
</P>
<P>
 But Corry's sister, Karen Whitworth, who shares the mobile home with her, said 
Sylvey was simply a friend who was there to offer protection in case Robinson 
came around. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitworth said Robinson threatened Corry and her because he could not accept 
the breakup. Corry ended the relationship after about three years of living 
together with Robinson.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of difficult to make the break. She finally made the decision, 
but he was having trouble accepting it," said Whitworth, who was in another 
room at the time of the shooting. She said Sylvey and Robinson were friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Sylvey, who waited with Corry for police to arrive, was booked on suspicion of 
murder and held at the Santa Ana Detention Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios said police recovered a .25-caliber handgun believed to be the weapon 
used in the killing. No other weapons were found at the scene, he said.

UCI PROFESSOR TO JOIN CLINTON'S COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE; RESEARCH: FRANCISCO J. 
AYALA WILL BE AMONG THOSE ADVISING THE PRESIDENT ON THE NEWEST ADVANCEMENTS AND 
GUIDING FEDERAL SPENDING ON TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An acclaimed UC Irvine professor has been named to a committee that advises 
President Clinton on scientific advancement, UCI officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco J. Ayala, 60, one of UCI's best-known researchers, will join 18 
other top academics and industry leaders on the President's Committee of 
Advisers on Science and Technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton created the committee by executive order in November to guide how the 
federal government should spend money in technology, a White House spokesman 
said. It includes representatives from corporations such as Hewlett-Packard Co. 
and Monsanto Co., as well as university researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news briefing last week, Clinton Administration officials announced the 
committee members and disclosed plans to increase the nation's spending on 
science and technology research to a level similar to that of Germany and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably not since the time of (Presidents) Kennedy or Johnson have we seen a 
similar direction," Ayala said in an interview Tuesday. "It's clear that 
there's a connection . . . between the economic welfare of a nation and 
science." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala has experience in overseeing scientific research on a national basis. He 
currently serves as president of the American Assn. for the Advancement of 
Science, the world's largest general scientific organization.  
</P>
<P>
 A professor of ecology, evolutionary biology and philosophy, Ayala was the 
first academic to be named a Bren Fellow at UCI in 1989, university spokesman 
Scott Nelson said. He is also director of the Bren Fellows program, a perpetual 
endowment created to attract the world's foremost scholars to UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala, a former Roman Catholic priest who left the church to study genetics, 
was lured from UC Davis in 1987. He has written more than 400 articles and 
eight books. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of our stars," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala has often battled creationists in his 29-year academic career. He served 
as a prime witness in a 1981 trial that resulted in the overturning of an 
Arkansas law forcing public school teachers to give equal time to the 
discussion of creationism and evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 A deep-voiced native of Madrid, Spain, Ayala said he is "reassured" by 
Clinton's goals to increase resources for science research and promote 
partnerships between private industry and the public sector. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the direction of scientific research in the next few years, 
Ayala said he believes American scientists will pay renewed attention to 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The breakthroughs of the last two to three years make it clear there will be 
great payoffs in investing money into cancer," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Priorities will also include nanotechnology -- creating very tiny scientific 
components -- and cutting-edge communications networks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI students will still find Ayala's name listed in course schedules this 
fall, despite restraints on his time.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see my research and teaching (being) affected," Ayala said. "I will 
be teaching introductory biology -- it has nearly 1,500 students in it every 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Ayala, the President's committee includes Mario J. Molina, a 
professor of environmental sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. Molina, along with UCI researcher F. Sherwood Rowland, discovered 
that chlorofluorocarbons promote ozone depletion, Nelson said.  
</P>

ANAHEIM, DISNEY TO BUILD JOINT-USE ICE RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously gave final approval Tuesday night for a 
90,000-square-foot community ice rink in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink will serve both as a practice site for the Mighty Ducks and a 
community youth center.Expected to open as soon as September, 1995, the rink is 
a joint project by the city and the Walt Disney Co. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope that the new Community Ice Center will help revitalize 
downtown Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this as the beginning of redevelopment in the downtown area," 
Councilman Irv Pickler said. "I think it's going to take off from this 
project."  
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Los Angeles architect Frank O. Gehry, the rink will be on a 
3.2-acre site at the southwest corner of Lincoln Avenue and Clementine Street. 
The facility will house two ice rinks, one Olympic-size and the other National 
Hockey League-size. The Olympic rink will seat about 300 spectators, while the 
NHL rink would hold up to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, who now practice at the Glacial Garden Ice Arena in Anaheim, will 
use the facility about 200 hours per year. Disney officials said there will be 
about 12,800 hours of ice time available to the public each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The rink will be used by Disney's new nonprofit program called GOALS -- Growth 
Opportunities Through Athletics, Learning and Service. Modeled after a highly 
touted New York ice hockey program in Harlem, the charitable organization's aim 
is to offer organized athletics, education and community service to 
underprivileged youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has initially targeted three neighborhoods around the center for 
participation -- Jeffrey-Lynne, Ponderosa Park and Guinida Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will also include a retail pro shop, meeting rooms, an amusement 
arcade and a restaurant.

ANAHEIM MAKES MOVES TOWARD STADIUM IMPROVEMENTS; PLANNING: ACCOUNTING FIRM WILL 
STUDY COST OF RENOVATING OR BUILDING NEW FACILITY. LAND-USE CONSULTANT WILL BE 
HIRED.

<P>
 Faced with the probability of losing the Los Angeles Rams as a tenant, the 
City Council on Tuesday took its first step toward revitalizing Anaheim Stadium 
and its surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which hopes to lure a new professional football team to town if 
the Rams leave, voted unanimously to hire an accounting firm to analyze the 
cost of renovating the stadium or building a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to begin a search for a consultant to develop an 
updated land-use strategy for the entire stadium area, which officials said 
needs to be done regardless of whether the Rams stay in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By hiring a consultant, the city plans to explore land uses that would 
complement both The Pond and the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to explore transit possibilities, such as the widening of the 
Santa Ana Freeway, that would make the area more accessible and are looking for 
ways to link the stadium and arena with areas such as Disneyland, according to 
a city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 High-rise offices have been scheduled for development around the stadium, but 
because of the glut of office space in Orange County, city officials are 
examining other land uses such as retail. 
</P>
<P>
 These vacant and underutilized properties, which are publicly or privately 
owned, offer significant development possibilities, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche was hired for $120,000 to study the 
feasibility of renovating the stadium or building a new one to meet the needs 
of the Rams and the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 A new or renovated stadium is believed to be a key element in any effort to 
keep the Rams in Orange County, some city officials contend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are being courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's plans have met with positive reaction from members of the Save the 
Rams committee, a group of 45 local politicians and business people working to 
keep the team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have no timeline for making public their plans, but will not announce 
anything before football season begins in September, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related action Tuesday, the council unanimously approved an earthquake 
recovery plan that is also aimed at refurbishing the stadium or possibly 
building a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The recovery plan is necessary to help finance stadium repairs caused by the 
Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake, the stadium's 17-ton scoreboard fell and caused an 
estimated $10 million in damage. Because of that damage, the city is allowed to 
create a redevelopment project without finding that the site is blighted, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action makes the 150 acres of stadium land a redevelopment area. 
With this designation, the city will be able to use any increase in tax revenue 
for development on stadium land.

BODY OF SHOOTING VICTIM DISCOVERED; DEPUTIES SEEK HELP IN IDENTIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies are investigating the apparent murder of an unidentified 
man whose body was found Monday in a construction area near the junction of 
Diamante and Calle Fino Clarete, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy revealed that the man, whose age was estimated at 20 to 30, died as 
a result of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the body was apparently set ablaze after the killing. The body, 
more than 80% of it burned, was in a decomposed condition when discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Two San Clemente residents looking for a lost pet discovered the partially 
clothed body about 7 p.m. Monday and called police. A helicopter from the 
Orange County Fire Department was called in to shine high-powered lights on the 
area to aid in a search of the crime scene, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, either white or Latino, was 5 feet, 8 inches tall, according to 
the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information regarding the identity of the victim or who may have 
witnessed any suspicious activity in the area is asked to contact the Sheriff's 
Department's homicide unit at (714) 647-7055 or, after normal business hours, 
at (714) 647-7000.

WOMAN ON METROLINK TRACKS KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rush-hour commuter trains were backed up for hours Tuesday after an 
unidentified woman stood on a narrow railroad bridge and let an oncoming 
Metrolink commuter train strike her, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, going 35 to 40 m.p.h., was unable to stop as it rounded a bend on 
Santiago Creek Bridge just south of the Garden Grove Freeway near Fairhaven 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew saw a trespassing pedestrian on the tracks and continued to blow the 
horn," said Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Sgt. Raul Luna said, "It looks like a suicide. She apparently looked 
at the train and covered her face and just stood in place. She had plenty of 
time to get off the tracks and avoid the train."  
</P>
<P>
 Passengers said they were not thrown when the train tried to stop at 5:28 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big pop," said Evelyn Silk, on her way to Oceanside. "It sounded 
like an air hose. It was like we hit something, not someone." 
</P>
<P>
 The train, the first of three rush-hour trains from Los Angeles to Oceanside, 
was delayed more than two hours by investigators at the scene. The second train 
was delayed about an hour, Metrolink officials said, and the third about 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our trains have never been held this long," Hidalgo said. "But we always try 
to cooperate with the authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County buses began transporting commuters to their destinations in 
South County and San Diego County, but heavy traffic on the Santa Ana Freeway 
prompted about 150 passengers to ask the drivers to return them to the train, 
which then left at 7:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 12, a man was struck and killed by a Metrolink train when he backed his 
car onto the tracks in Laguna Niguel, Hidalgo said. There have also been a 
number of fatalities, both suicides and accidents, involving Metrolink trains 
in the San Fernando Valley.

MAN ELECTROCUTED AT CONSTRUCTION SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old construction worker was electrocuted Tuesday night when he came 
in contact with a 480-volt power line while restoring the interior of an office 
building, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who has not been identified, was working with three other employees 
of Laguna Hills-based Tri-Star Restorations at a building in the 18600 block of 
Jamboree Road, near Dupont Drive, Irvine Police Sgt. Jim Lowder said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four workers were removing drywall from the building, which has been 
vacant for more than five years, when the victim came in contact with the power 
line.

POLICE IDENTIFY COOK AS SLAYING SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have identified a Tustin restaurant cook as a suspect in the beating of 
a woman whose body was dumped near the city's water tower three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old man, known as Carlos Garcia Berdeja or Carlos B. Garcia, may 
have fled to Mexico, police Detective Terry Selinske said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 17, the body of 33-year-old Jeanne Ruth Molina of Anaheim was found 
near the city's water pumping station on 23rd Street. Witnesses told police 
they saw a man dump a body from a cream-colored, four-door sedan about 6:30 
a.m., then drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina died as a result of blunt force trauma, according to police. Garcia was 
a co-worker of Molina, a mother of three, at a Red Robin restaurant in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is described as 5 feet 7 and 180 pounds. He has a mustache, which he 
may have shaved off, Selinske said.

FORMER IRVINE STOCKBROKER SIGNS CONSENT AGREEMENT; SECURITIES: AN SEC SUIT 
ALLEGED THAT AURELIO MARTINEZ PARTICIPATED IN AN ILLEGAL KICKBACK SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine man who worked as a stockbroker in Orange County until late 1989 
signed a consent agreement Tuesday in a civil fraud case brought by the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleged in a civil suit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles that Aurelio Martinez, who worked at a Prudential Securities brokerage 
in Anaheim and later at a PaineWebber office in Newport Beach, participated in 
an illegal kickback scheme from March, 1986, through July, 1989, with Thomas 
Anthony Piteo, then the senior vice president of a Los Angeles investment firm, 
Sun-America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 A SunAmerica spokeswoman said Piteo is no longer listed on the company's 
personnel roster. Martinez is unemployed, an SEC official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC suit alleged that Piteo arranged to steer more than $700 million in 
SunAmerica securities transactions to Martinez, who received nearly $1 million 
in commissions from the transactions and kicked back half of the money to 
Piteo, a Palos Verdes resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneous with the filing of the case, both men signed consent agreements 
-- a civil version of "no contest" plea in which they neither admitted nor 
denied guilt but agreed to avoid future violations of securities trading 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Piteo also agreed to give the SEC $159,155 as partial repayment of the money 
he allegedly received in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Martinez was not fined, an SEC official said that in such cases an 
administrative hearing generally is held to consider revoking the broker's 
license.

BRIEFCASE: AUTO INDUSTRY; HYUNDAI'S REDESIGNED CARS, INCLUDING 1995 SONATA, WIN 
PRAISE FROM CRITICS 
</P>

<P>
 Hyundai, whose dismal reviews by auto writers in past years had threatened to 
make it the Rodney Dangerfield of the auto world, has been winning some respect 
of late with its redesigned cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Car and Driver magazine ranked the Korean auto maker's 1995 
Sonata third in its September edition comparison of six family sedans with 
price tags under $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonata outscored the Chevrolet Lumina, which placed sixth, Subaru's Legacy 
and the fourth-place Toyota Camry, which placed first in the magazine's 
four-door comparison last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's Accord placed first on this year's list, with the Dodge Intrepid in 
second place. Hyundai, with 86 points, wasn't far behind: the Dodge scored 89 
points, and the Honda got 90 on a scale of 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Car and Driver ranked the Sonata at the top of the pack with a perfect 10 for 
convenience features and amenities -- including driver's seat height adjusters, 
seat comfort that "is well above average" and a Mitsubishi-designed V-6 engine 
"that throws dust at all the others" from 0 to 60 m.p.h. and also posted the 
highest top speed of the pack at 118. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased. This will make our American employees and Korean partners 
at the factory work even harder," said H. Doug Mazza, chief operating officer 
at Hyundai Motor America Inc., the car maker's Fountain Valley-based importer 
and distributor.

 US Facilities Corp.: The Costa Mesa insurance company posted a profit of 
$761,000, or 13 cents a share, for the second quarter. That was down from 
earnings of $1.8 million, or 31 cents a share, for the comparable 1993 
quarter.The company attributed the decline to $1.5 million in expenses related 
to an unsolicited takeover attempt by Fidelity National Financial Inc. and a 
subsequent proxy fight, as well as a one-time restructuring charge of $654,000. 
Revenue showed a gain of 18% to $32.2 million from $27.2 million. Profit for 
the first six months of 1994 dropped to $1.4 million, or 23 cents a share, from 
$3.7 million, or 62 cents a share, for the first half of 1993. Six-month 
revenue rose 18% to $62.7 million from $53.2 million.

<P>
 Rockwell's transportation systems unit, based in Anaheim, will manage the 
project through its Troy, Mich., regional office.A number of other companies 
are part of the Rockwell-led partnership developing the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell will provide a transportation information management system that will 
enable officials to link and control traffic routing for civilian, police and 
commercial vehicles and other modes of transportation, including buses and 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell's involvement in the Oakland County pilot project began in 1992, when

 Creative, which does sound recording and audio cassette production for a

company recently completed the soundtrack for a Nissan dealer sales incentive 
program -- a job that involved casting Hawaiian actors and then recording them 
by telephone from a studio in Oahu. (The budget didn't stretch to flying Keenan 
and his crew to Hawaii.)

 Keenan said he has also produced a series of audio cassettes for Mazda 
dealers. The tapes compare the new Protege to the competition's models with an 
emphasis on where cars such as the Chrysler Neon, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic

 Creative not only tapes the dialogue for the presentation, it also records 
music and sound effects, then puts the whole package together.

 About 10% of the company's business comes from the auto industry, Keenan said.

FORMER KODAK EXECUTIVE IS A MAN ON A MISSION; RELIGION: KAY R. WHITMORE'S NEW 
ROLE WITH THE MORMON CHURCH IN ENGLAND HAS FEW MEASURES OF SUCCESS AND NO 
BOTTOM LINE. HE'S NOW IN THE PEOPLE BUSINESS, AND HE LIKES IT.

 Across from a weed-infested train station, next to a store selling "part-worn 
tyres," the ousted chief executive of Eastman Kodak has found a new calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay R. Whitmore, who left Kodak under pressure in December, is once again a 
leader, but this time, as the supreme Mormon missionary of southern England. A 
few weeks into the non-paying job, Whitmore pondered life after the boardroom 
and said he's not sure how to size up everything. He said he sees more 
differences than similarities between this post and his job at Kodak, which 
paid a salary of around $1 million a year, plus stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 One big change is not having to worry about the bottom line -- missionaries 
don't have one. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the benefits of being in the (business) sector is you have very clear, 
specific targets that are easy to understand, and you either make them or you 
don't make them. Here, doing good is not a measurable target; it's all 
relative," Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't -- like you can in business -- open up the cash box and see if I 
got more money today than I had yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore, 64, is now called "President Whitmore" in this tight religious 
circle where a male missionary would take on the title "Elder Smith" and a 
woman would be "Sister Jones." He still looks the part of a CEO, neatly groomed 
in a dark suit, and notes apologetically that a big photograph of Ezra Taft 
Benson has not yet been replaced, nearly two months after the Mormon 
president's death. 
</P>
<P>
 His office is simple, a far cry from the executive suite at Kodak's Rochester, 
N.Y., headquarters. A bust of Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith rests on the 
portable air conditioner. The wall is covered with pictures of all the 
missionaries who work from the bustling streets of London to the shadow of 
Dover Castle. 
</P>
<P>
 His new life is "much more people-intensive than I've been accustomed to," 
Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world I came from was very much thing- and financial-intensive. How do 
you sell photographic products? How do you make a profit from that? There was a 
people element to it, but this -- there isn't anything in this but people 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues at Kodak brought the normal array of human problems to work, but 
once it was quitting time, the problems went home with the people. It is 
different at the mission, where Whitmore is in charge of about 180 young adults 
who sacrifice two years of their lives to preach the Mormon message to that 
rare person who doesn't shut the door in their face. 
</P>
<P>
 Sickness or accidents require Whitmore's immediate attention. He has to be on 
call in case anybody breaks the strict rules, for example by trying to go out 
on a date, taking in the movies or ordering a pint of beer in one of Britain's 
countless pubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they've got a problem today, then you've got to solve it today," Whitmore 
said. "You can't say, 'I'm busy today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore retired from Kodak after disagreeing with board members about how 
fast the stumbling photographic company should cut costs and jobs to combat 
intense competition from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore was replaced by George M.C. Fisher, formerly the boss at Motorola 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could say that I was invited to make room for an outsider," Whitmore 
said. "I guess I really don't care to talk about the specifics of that. I don't 
think there was as much disagreement as the press has reported." 
</P>
<P>
 When his 37-year tenure at Kodak ended, Whitmore and his wife, Yvonne, didn't 
immediately know what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitmore figured he'd spent enough of life working for somebody else. He 
thought of opening his own business, maybe entering politics, or doing 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 2,000 miles away from Rochester, within the Mormon Church 
hierarchy in Salt Lake City, Whitmore was "a well-enough-known Mormon that they 
knew what was happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 3, the Whitmores got a phone call asking them to run one of the 
church's 300 missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Whitmore is a lifelong Mormon born in Salt Lake City, he never spent 
two years of his youth as a missionary, as many Mormons do. He came of age in 
the Korean War era and was drafted, then finished school, got married and 
joined Kodak. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the time was right. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with tradition, the Whitmores had to decide whether to become 
missionaries without knowing where they would serve, although both thought 
London would be ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gone anywhere, from Provo, Utah -- there is one of these things 
even in the western part of Mormon country -- all the way down to Durban, South 
Africa," Whitmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's here, learning how to drive on the left side and interpret 
strange road signs that say "give way," instead of "yield," Whitmore said his 
main goal is to improve the lives of the young missionaries as they try to 
convert others to Mormonism in a nation whose religious life is dominated by 
the Church of England. 
</P>
<P>
 But, again in contrast to being a corporate honcho, Whitmore sets no numerical 
targets. Quotas might lead to cutting corners -- and converts who aren't 
totally convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We occasionally find people of very limited capability, and they like the 
missionaries because they're nice and friendly and they're warm," Whitmore 
said. "They're not fully there, mentally. We wouldn't want to go out and 
attract people like that because they're not really capable" of making a real 
commitment to Mormonism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could go out and pick up all the derelicts on the street and get them 
baptized next week and they'd probably think it's nice for a day as long as we 
gave them a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not what we're trying to do. We're here trying to improve people's 
lives."

 AIDS research -- A story in Sunday's editions of The Times said that Dr. 
Harold Varmus, the new director of the National Institutes of Health, had 
recently ousted Dr. Anthony Fauci as head of the Office of AIDS Research. A 
spokeswoman for Varmus says Fauci withdrew from the job because keeping it 
would have required him to give up his other duties.

aftershocks, including 49 between magnitude 4.0 and 4.9 and eight magnitude 5.0 
or stronger.

 For the record: A quote attributed to a reporter in Tuesday's report on 
Monday's game was reported incorrectly in some editions of The Times. In 
response to Todd Worrell's telling reporters, "You guys don't know . . . about 
the game and how it's played," the reporter replied, "Obviously, you don't know 
anything about journalism." MARYANN HUDSON
